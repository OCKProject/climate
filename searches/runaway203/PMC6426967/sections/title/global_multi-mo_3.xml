 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculate the drought characteristics: frequency of short-term drought (longer than or equal to 2 months and less than 6 months) and frequency of long-term drought (longer than or equal to 6 months) for the 30-year period of 1976–2005 (historical forcing) and 2071–2100 (RCP forcing) for each region (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(a)</a>). The multi-model median (shown in the boxplots) frequency of short-term drought is projected to increase by the end of the 21st century for most regions and for most RCP scenarios (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(a)</a>). In most cases, the increase in the frequency of short-term drought is higher for RCP2.6 than RCP8.5. There are several cases where the frequency of short-term drought is projected to decrease for the highest radiative forcing RCP8.5 compared to the historical period, such as Eastern North America (ENA), Europe and Mediterranean (EUM), South Africa (SAF), Tropical South America (TSA), and the global. This is because, in the RCP8.5 scenario, sequences of consecutive dry months are more likely, thus increasing the frequency of long-term drought and decreasing the frequency of short-term drought. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(a)</a> shows that the median frequency of long-term drought is projected to increase in most regions, with the greatest increase in EUM, TSA, Central America (CAM), ENA, and SAF, and the smallest increase in North Asia (NAS), South Asia (SAS), Central Africa (CAF), and North Africa (NAF). The highest radiative forcing shows the greatest increase in the long-term drought in most regions. However, as the boxplot show, the MMEs have a range that is much larger than the change (Fig.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global multi-model ensemble mean in the spatial extent of severe drought is projected to increase from approximately 11% for the period of 1976–2005 to 27% under RCP2.6, 29% under RCP4.5, 32% under RCP6.0, and 33% under RCP 8.5 for the period of 2071–2100 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows the regional seasonal patterns of future drought projections in the RCP forcing compared with the historical forcing. The multi-model mean spatial extents of severe drought are projected to increase for all regions and all future RCP scenarios, with progressively larger spatial extent of severe drought as the strength of radiative forcing increases (RCP8.5 &gt; RCP6.0 &gt; RCP4.5 &gt; RCP2.6) in most cases. The increase in the spatial extent of drought tends to be larger in warmer seasons than cooler seasons in most regions. In southern hemisphere (TSA, SSA, AUS, and SAF), the largest increase in spatial extent occurs predominantly in the Austral Spring. The increase in the spatial extent of soil moisture deficit in high latitude regions (e.g. NAS) tends to be concentrated in the warmer season and diminished in the cooler season. The seasonal disproportionate change of soil moisture deficit is mainly because of changes in snow and ice. During the cooler season, the temperature increase tends to reduce the snow cover, increase the ratio of rainfall to snowfall, and drive earlier spring melting which limits soil moisture deficit, while during the warmer season, earlier spring melting coupled with higher evapotranspiration strengthen the soil moisture deficit

  </span>. This mechanism leads to the seasonal disproportionate change in the spatial extent of drought in warmer months compared with the cooler months in high latitude regions.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CAM and EUM show the largest spread across emission scenarios, i.e., these regions respond very differently to different radiative forcing compared with other regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). For those regions, the highest radiative forcing (RCP8.5) creates a much greater spatial extent of drought than the lowest radiative forcing (RCP2.6). By contrast, NAF, SAS, SEA, and CAF show the smallest spread resulting from different emission scenarios (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), i.e., the spatial extent of drought in these regions is relatively insensitive to the differences in radiative forcing compared with other regions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We fit empirical CDFs of the global monthly spatial extent of drought for each individual model for the 360-month in the period of 1976–2005 (historical forcing) and the 360-month in the period of 2071–2100 (RCP forcing) to investigate both the mean change and temporal variability (inter-month variability) change (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Most of the GCMs project increases in the spatial extent of severe drought, in which the RCP8.5 shows the largest increase. The MMEs under RCP forcing show very large inter-model uncertainty, in which RCP8.5 shows the widest range of projections, while RCP2.6 shows the narrowest range of projections, indicating that the projection uncertainty increases as the radiative forcing increases. This is true when the four RCP scenarios contain the same set of GCMs (not shown here). Furthermore, for each individual GCM projection under RCP forcing, in most cases, the CDFs, especially under RCP8.5, are flatter when compared with the CDFs using historical forcing, indicating greater temporal (inter-month) variability in the spatial extent of severe drought, i.e., more widespread drought and more extreme drought events.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculate 30-year mean of the spatial extent of severe drought for the globe and for 15 regions for the period of 1976–2005 (historical forcing) and the period of 2071–2100 (RCP forcing) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). The model results from the same institution are similar and highly correlated (e.g. GISS-E2-R and GISS-E2-H, IPSL-CM5A-MR and IPSL-CM5A-LR, GFDL-ESM2M and GFDL-ESM2G) and those climate models developed by the same institution and sharing model components might have shared biases. The multi-model and multi-scenario mean spatial extent of CAM, EUM, TSA, and SAF are projected to increase the most, while the mean spatial extent of SAS, SEA, NAS, and CAF are projected to increase the least. We find that the variations of the spatial extent of drought across the 17 models (standard deviation: 10.4, unit: %) are much larger than the variations across the 4 RCP scenarios (standard deviation: 4.2, unit: %), i.e., the model spread is much larger than the scenario spread. Also, we find that the variations across the 17 models (standard deviation: 10.4, unit: %) are also larger than the variations across those 15 regions (standard deviation: 6.4, unit: %). Thus, the model difference is a significant contribution to the uncertainty of the future drought projections.
