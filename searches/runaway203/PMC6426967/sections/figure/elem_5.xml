  <p>Global (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) decadal mean standardized soil moisture anomalies; (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) decadal sum of 1-month drought occurrence; (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) decadal sum of drought severity; (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) decadal mean spatial extent of drought from CMIP5 MMEs under four RCP scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 from 1900 to 2100 (the thin line represents individual GCM and the thick line represents multi-model mean for each scenario). The fluctuations (“wiggles”) superimposed on the long-term trends in each projection approximate the internal variability in climate; the spread of the thin lines in the same color represents the model uncertainty for a particular scenario (e.g. red color for RCP8.5); the spread of the four thick colored lines represents the scenario uncertainty.
