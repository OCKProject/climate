 <div class="caption">
  <p>The annual and seasonal signal to noise ratio of surface soil moisture anomalies for the 3rd decade, 6th decade, and 9th decade relative to mean of 1976â€“2005 based on CMIP5 MMEs (summer: JJA in North hemisphere and DJF in South hemisphere; winter: DJF in North hemisphere and JJA in South hemisphere). The negative values indicate drying and the positive values indicate wetting. The grids with stippling indicate an absolute value of S/N greater than 1, which means that the magnitude of soil moisture anomaly change signal exceeds uncertainty.</p>
