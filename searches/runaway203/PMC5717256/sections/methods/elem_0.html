            <span><a>72</a></span> coupled to a mixed-layer (slab) ocean. The atmosphere and land models are run on
            a 1.9° × 2.5° (latitude × longitude) finite volume grid with 26 atmospheric levels
            in the vertical dimension. The ice and ocean models use a 1° displaced pole grid.
            The greenhouse gas concentrations, solar insolation, and orbital parameters are representative
            of the year 2000 values for all simulations. The prescribed ocean heat flux (“q-flux”),
            salinity, temperature, and velocity fields required for the mixed-layer ocean model
            simulations are derived from a fully coupled CCSM simulation using the full-depth
            ocean.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to isolate the atmospheric impacts of sea-ice loss, we compare two sets of
            experiments that differ only in the amount of sea-ice cover. For this purpose, we
            have developed a novel experimental configuration in which we alter the sea-ice cover
            without imposing artificial energy fluxes in the high latitudes as done in the previous
            studies. When sea-ice loss is achieved by imposing non-physical heat flux perturbations,
            energy is not conserved. This makes it difficult to determine if the observed atmospheric
            response originates solely from the sea-ice changes or if it is also impacted by the
            imposed energy flux perturbations. Analyzed response represents cumulative effect
            of sea-ice extent and thickness changes.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea-ice loss in our model simulations is achieved through sea-ice physics parameter
            perturbations. We use an ensemble of 70 Latin hypercube simulations to select the
            sea-ice physics parameters that have the strongest impact on the resulting sea-ice
            extent
            <span><a>20</a></span>. The selected sea-ice physics parameters are shown in Supplementary Table 
            <a>1</a>. Parameter values were not varied outside of their respective expert-defined ranges.
            Two sets of sea-ice physics parameter values are chosen, both resulting in similar
            amounts of sea-ice loss (see Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>1</a> and “Methods” section). Parameter perturbations are separately applied in each hemisphere:
            “low Arctic ice” (“low Antarctic ice”) simulation sets are obtained by applying the
            parameter changes in the Northern (Southern) hemisphere alone. For each set of ice
            parameter values used (control, set 1 and set 2) we performed five additional simulations
            with altered initial atmospheric conditions. The length of each model simulation was
            40 years. Our focus is on the last 20 years of these simulations. “Low Arctic ice”
            and “low Antarctic ice” ensemble means are an average of all simulations with the
            perturbed sea-ice parameter values applied in the Northern and Southern hemispheres,
            respectively. The anomalies represent the ensemble mean differences between “low Arctic
            ice” (or “low Antarctic ice”) and control simulations.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical significance is estimated using Welch’s 
            <span>t</span>-test in order to account for different sample size and variances between the control
            and “low Arctic ice” simulations. Prior to 
            <span>t</span>-test calculations, the equivalent sample size is determined at each grid point (accounting
            for temporal autocorrelation).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perturbed sea-ice physics parameter simulations require changes to the following parameters:
            snow grain radius tuning parameter, thermal conductivity of snow, and snow melt maximum
            radius. Their respective values are given in Supplementary Table 
            <a>1</a>. Implementation of the perturbed sea-ice parameter values requires namelist and CICE4
            source code changes (available per request).
