      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to isolate the atmospheric impacts of sea-ice loss, we compare two sets of
         experiments that differ only in the amount of sea-ice cover. For this purpose, we
         have developed a novel experimental configuration in which we alter the sea-ice cover
         without imposing artificial energy fluxes in the high latitudes as done in the previous
         studies. When sea-ice loss is achieved by imposing non-physical heat flux perturbations,
         energy is not conserved. This makes it difficult to determine if the observed atmospheric
         response originates solely from the sea-ice changes or if it is also impacted by the
         imposed energy flux perturbations. Analyzed response represents cumulative effect
         of sea-ice extent and thickness changes.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea-ice loss in our model simulations is achieved through sea-ice physics parameter
         perturbations. We use an ensemble of 70 Latin hypercube simulations to select the
         sea-ice physics parameters that have the strongest impact on the resulting sea-ice
         extent
         <span><a>20</a></span>. The selected sea-ice physics parameters are shown in Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a>. Parameter values were not varied outside of their respective expert-defined ranges.
         Two sets of sea-ice physics parameter values are chosen, both resulting in similar
         amounts of sea-ice loss (see Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a> and “Methods” section). Parameter perturbations are separately applied in each hemisphere:
         “low Arctic ice” (“low Antarctic ice”) simulation sets are obtained by applying the
         parameter changes in the Northern (Southern) hemisphere alone. For each set of ice
         parameter values used (control, set 1 and set 2) we performed five additional simulations
         with altered initial atmospheric conditions. The length of each model simulation was
         40 years. Our focus is on the last 20 years of these simulations. “Low Arctic ice”
         and “low Antarctic ice” ensemble means are an average of all simulations with the
         perturbed sea-ice parameter values applied in the Northern and Southern hemispheres,
         respectively. The anomalies represent the ensemble mean differences between “low Arctic
         ice” (or “low Antarctic ice”) and control simulations.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical significance is estimated using Welch’s 
         <span>t</span>-test in order to account for different sample size and variances between the control
         and “low Arctic ice” simulations. Prior to 
         <span>t</span>-test calculations, the equivalent sample size is determined at each grid point (accounting
         for temporal autocorrelation).
