         <a>1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a> illustrate some of the differences in Arctic sea-ice cover between control and “low
         Arctic ice” simulations. During August and September, monthly mean Arctic sea-ice
         area for the “low Arctic ice” ensemble mean falls below the 1 million km
         <span>2</span> threshold used to define a nearly ice-free Arctic
         <span><a>19</a></span>. By comparison, CMIP-5 simulations of twenty-first century climate and extrapolations
         of observed changes in ice volume place the time horizon for a nearly ice-free Arctic
         roughly between 2020 and 2040
         <span><a>19</a></span>. The smallest and largest differences between the “low Arctic ice” and control Arctic
         sea-ice area (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a>) occur in March and September, respectively, in accord with the seasonality of the
         observed Arctic sea-ice loss since the beginning of the satellite era.

                  Areas contained within contour lines have sea-ice fractions larger than 15%. Thick

                  in

                  <span>b</span>. Thin purple lines indicate individual “low Arctic ice” (“low Antarctic ice”) simulations.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the temperature impacts of sea-ice loss are most pronounced in the northern
         high- to mid-latitudes (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>), precipitation anomalies show a more global response (Fig. 
         <a>2b, c</a>). We focus our analysis on the December–February season, because these months yield
         the largest impact of sea-ice changes on Californian precipitation in our model simulations.
         The most striking feature of the precipitation response to Arctic sea-ice loss is
         the reorganization of tropical rainfall and an apparent northward precipitation shift.
         The Arctic sea-ice decline also results in significantly less precipitation over California—a
         consequence of a geopotential ridge in the North Pacific that steers the wet winter
         air masses northward into Alaska and Canada, away from California (Fig. 
         <a>2e</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These findings are consistent with previous claims of a sea-ice driven component of
         Californian precipitation changes
         <span><a>15</a>, 
            <a>29</a>, 
            <a>30</a></span>. We suggest, however, that the persistent geopotential height anomaly in the North
         Pacific shown in Fig. 
         <a>2e</a> is not just a direct consequence of sea-ice-induced surface warming and associated
         high-latitude planetary wave perturbations (as hypothesized previously), but rather
         is forced by sea-ice-induced convection changes over the tropical Pacific. We find
         that the key components of this two-step teleconnection are changes in the location
         and intensity of tropical Pacific convection and the northward-propagating Rossby
         wavetrain they initiate.
