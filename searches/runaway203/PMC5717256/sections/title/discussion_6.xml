 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many aspects of the observed mean state of the atmosphere during the recent 2012–2016 California drought are qualitatively consistent with our simulated response to Arctic sea-ice changes. ERA-Interim estimates of the precipitation, geopotential, and OLR anomalies between 2012 and 2015 (relative to the period 1979–2010) are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">7</a>. Similar to our simulations, ERA-Interim exhibits a geopotential ridge in the North Pacific and a precipitation decrease over California (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">7a, b</a>). In the tropics, precipitation decreases across the central and eastern tropical Pacific and increases northward of this region and in the west tropical Pacific (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">7a</a>). Another commonality is the behavior of OLR changes across the central tropical Pacific and over California (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">7c</a>). The magnitudes of the observed 3-year mean anomalies during the recent California drought (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">7a</a>) are much larger than the magnitudes of the 20-year mean response to sea-ice changes shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>. This is expected given that the longer 20-year period contains both dry and wet years. As seen from Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">8a</a>, low Arctic sea-ice increases the likelihood of drier California, but does not result in drier conditions over California every single year. On average, when considering the 20-year mean, there is a 10–15% decrease in California’s rainfall (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). Comparison with the driest 3-year interval within this 20-year period (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">8b</a>) indicates that the magnitude of the simulated precipitation response is comparable to the magnitude of changes in ERA-Interim during the most recent drought.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This consistency does not, however, constitute compelling evidence that the 2012–2016 California drought is attributable to Arctic sea-ice changes. Rather, it illustrates that some of the atmospheric features of the droughts driven by Arctic sea-ice loss may resemble those of the most recent California drought. The intensification of dry conditions over California since late 2012 may have also been affected by several other factors not discussed in this study, such as the appearance of a large warm SST anomaly off the west coast of North America—though this appears to be a consequence rather than a cause of the altered atmospheric circulations causing the drought
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Another important factor may be the 2014 phase shift of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation from negative to positive. However, this shift would be expected to alleviate drought conditions over California—not intensify them
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. Finally, we note that other hemispherically asymmetric forcings may also trigger—via the same physical pathways described here—tropical convection changes and teleconnections affecting California’s precipitation. Possible examples include asymmetric forcing by anthropogenic aerosols, volcanic eruptions, and solar irradiance variations. All of these forcings can alter the inter-hemispheric temperature gradient
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>, thereby causing shifts in the location of tropical convection and initiating “far-field” precipitation changes over California.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is of interest to consider whether paleoclimatic evidence provides support for our model-inferred two-step teleconnection (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). We focus on past periods with pronounced excursions in Arctic temperatures and sea-ice cover. The first part of the two-step teleconnection is well documented in both paleoclimate simulations and paleoclimate records of the last glacial period
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Abrupt high-latitude temperature increase during the last interglacial (the Dansgaard–Oeschger and Bølling–Allerød warmings) are manifest in the tropics through a northward shift in the position of the ITCZ
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. Conversely, the signature of cold stadials and Younger Dryas cooling in the Arctic is matched by a southward shift of tropical precipitation across all ocean basins
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. These ITCZ shifts are consistent with precipitation changes inferred from high-resolution, precisely dated speleothem records: speleothems across the southwestern United States indicate shifts to drier conditions during the Dansgaard–Oeschger warmings

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. Similarly, during the Heinrich 1 and Younger Dryas cold periods, wetter conditions are indicated by lake-level high stands in the Great Basin and glaciation in central and southern California
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>, while at least one modeling study has implicated North Atlantic cooling and a corresponding southward ITCZ shift as a possible cause of increased precipitation over the western United States
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timing, magnitude, and drivers of sea-ice changes during the last millennium are less well understood
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. In addition, volcanic activity may have also had an impact on tropical precipitation during this time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. However, proxy data for the last millennium does yield information regarding the second teleconnection step—the link between the ITCZ location and southwestern rainfall. The southward shift of the ITCZ in the transition from the medieval climate anomaly (MCA) to the little ice age (LIA) is well documented
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. The effect of this shift is apparent in the contrast between the dry MCA and the wet LIA in the western US lake levels
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>, from trees growing on lake beds exposed by low lake levels
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>, and in pollen records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>. Interestingly, a brief southward shift in the ITCZ position between ~AD 1050 and 1250
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span> is clearly recorded in the American southwest as a wet interval in the midst of the dry MCA. Great Basin lakes expanded briefly during this period
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span> and increased soil moisture in southern California (as inferred from pollen records)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>. Such periods during the MCA and LIA provide some support for the second teleconnection step. In the absence of more reliable sea-ice data sets, however, we cannot confirm if such covariance relationships between the ITCZ location and southwestern rainfall are directly attributable to sea-ice changes, or could instead be due to other factors (e.g., volcanic forcing or solar irradiance changes).
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we address the suitability of our experimental configuration (an AGCM coupled to a slab ocean) for studying the fast atmosphere–surface ocean-mediated response to sea-ice changes. In our simulations, key response features are manifest within the first two decades (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">9</a>). While our current study does not examine how this initial atmosphere–surface ocean response may be altered on longer timescales by the deep ocean, we note that the fast response identified here is in agreement with previous AOGCM-based studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Additional analysis of the short-term (first 50 years) response of an AOGCM response to sea-ice changes in a complementary, energy-conserving setup confirms our AGCM/slab ocean findings (see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="Sec12" href="#Sec12">Supplementary Discussions</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">10</a>). The decadal-scale AOGCM response indicates tropical convection changes and drying over California in response to the loss of Arctic sea-ice cover, a qualitatively similar result to that seen in the present study. Recent studies have investigated the impacts of Arctic sea-ice loss in a fully coupled AOGCM setup by imposing artificial high-latitude energy fluxes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. These studies have demonstrated the importance of ocean dynamics one century after imposing high-latitude longwave forcing. However, such investigations provide no evidence that ocean dynamics dominates the response to high-latitude longwave forcing on timescales considerably shorter than a century, nor do they indicate when the transition to an ocean-dominated response would occur. Understanding the differences between energy-conserving and non-energy-conserving setups, in particular how the presumed impacts of sea-ice changes in non-energy-conserving experimental setups
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> may be affected by artificially imposed energy flux perturbations remains an important future step. A key result from our study is the identification of a link between high-latitude and tropical energy budget and convection changes that can further drive precipitation changes over California. This link highlights the importance of differentiating between: (i) the different timescales of the response; and (ii) studies that attempt to isolate the impacts of sea-ice changes by imposing large artificial energy perturbations in order to achieve the sea-ice loss
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>, and investigations that achieve sea-ice changes in an energy-conserving manner (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span> and the current study).
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selection, implementation, and testing of sea-ice physics parameter changes from the latin hypercube simulation ensemble
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> has provided a novel energy-conserving framework for testing the climate impacts of sea-ice changes. Our results implicate both Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice loss as potential drivers of future precipitation changes over the American southwest. We show that substantial loss of high-latitude sea-ice cover is likely to have significant far-field effects, and can impact California’s precipitation through atmospheric teleconnections involving tropical convection changes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present day precipitation decreases over California and the associated circulation anomalies are not evident in coupled model projections of twenty-first century climate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>. Most current simulations disagree regarding the sign of the future precipitation changes over California
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>. As a consequence, a multi-model mean features a large envelope of uncertainty, and suggests negligible precipitation decline in the first decade of the twenty-first century, followed by an increase in precipitation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span> over the next decade. One possible cause of these inter-model discrepancies is that some climate models underestimate the magnitude of observed Arctic sea-ice loss over the satellite era
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> and the sign of recent Antarctic sea-ice changes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>. Our analysis suggests that both of these factors—the reduced magnitude of Arctic sea-ice loss and the reversed sign of Antarctic sea-ice changes relative to the observations—contribute to the smaller than observed precipitation decline in model simulations of early twenty-first century climate change. Our results imply that as long as Arctic sea-ice cover continues to decrease, overall sea-ice forcing will favor drying over California. This assumes that Antarctic sea-ice continues to expand or remains stationary over the next several decades. As Antarctic sea-ice cover begins to decrease, the competing influences of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice loss will weaken or even reverse the sign of the sea-ice driven component of California’s precipitation changes. We emphasize, however, that sea-ice loss is one of multiple factors implicated in driving the described atmospheric circulation and precipitation changes. In simulations of historical and future climate, multiple hemispherically asymmetric forcings are changing simultaneously. Some of these forcings affect sea-ice cover, thus hampering the elucidation of links between Arctic sea-ice loss and California’s rainfall. This is one advantage of the experimental configuration used here. By design, the convection, atmospheric circulation, and precipitation responses described here are directly related to sea-ice changes in each hemisphere, and not to changes in anthropogenic and natural forcings, or deep-ocean feedbacks.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have confirmed that the short-term (decadal-scale) response to Arctic sea-ice loss described in our study is consistent with the response found in previous AOGCM studies that allow for ocean dynamics and deep-ocean changes. The long-term centennial climate response to sea-ice changes may, however, differ from the fast response described here. While investigations with other climate models are necessary to further confirm these findings, our results strongly suggest that what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic and provide a physically plausible pathway by which high-latitude sea-ice forcing may mediate tropical climate, and thereby influence California’s rainfall.</p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a final remark, we note that the pronounced Arctic sea-ice loss over the satellite era is likely human-induced, arising from anthropogenic warming caused by greenhouse gas increases
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span>. Our study thus identifies yet another pathway by which human activities could affect the occurrence of future droughts over California—through human-induced Arctic sea-ice decline.
