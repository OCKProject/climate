 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the temperature impacts of sea-ice loss are most pronounced in the northern high- to mid-latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), precipitation anomalies show a more global response (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b, c</a>). We focus our analysis on the December–February season, because these months yield the largest impact of sea-ice changes on Californian precipitation in our model simulations. The most striking feature of the precipitation response to Arctic sea-ice loss is the reorganization of tropical rainfall and an apparent northward precipitation shift. The Arctic sea-ice decline also results in significantly less precipitation over California—a consequence of a geopotential ridge in the North Pacific that steers the wet winter air masses northward into Alaska and Canada, away from California (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>).

  </span>. We suggest, however, that the persistent geopotential height anomaly in the North Pacific shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a> is not just a direct consequence of sea-ice-induced surface warming and associated high-latitude planetary wave perturbations (as hypothesized previously), but rather is forced by sea-ice-induced convection changes over the tropical Pacific. We find that the key components of this two-step teleconnection are changes in the location and intensity of tropical Pacific convection and the northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain they initiate.
