 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is considerable uncertainty in model projections of twenty-first century precipitation changes over California
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. These uncertainties are largely a consequence of the sensitivity of Californian rainfall to both tropical and mid-latitude atmospheric circulation changes, such as variability in the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and shifts in the Pacific jet stream
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. California’s winter precipitation has decreased over the past two decades, and between 2012 and 2016 California has entered into one of the most severe droughts on record
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. The impacts of reduced rainfall have been intensified by anomalously high temperatures that have enhanced potential evapotranspiration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Several studies posit that California’s drought has an anthropogenic component arising from increased temperatures, with the likelihood of such warming-enhanced droughts expected to increase in the future

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The exceptionally dry conditions during the winters of 2012–2015 were accompanied by a prominent dynamical feature: a persistent geopotential ridge located in the North Pacific. This ridge pushed storm tracks further north, resulting in wetter than normal conditions over the northwest and substantial drying over the southwest of the United States
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. A La Niña event in 2011/12 and anomalously warm sea-surface temperatures (SST) over the west tropical Pacific in 2012/13 and 2013/14 may have helped sustain the North Pacific geopotential ridge
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Climate model simulations forced with observed SSTs alone were unable to capture all the important features of the recent precipitation decline, suggesting that California’s recent precipitation deficit may in part be attributable to other factors, such as internal atmospheric variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A positive geopotential anomaly in the North Pacific is not unique to the recent drought. Similar anomalies are known to be associated with precipitation decline across the American southwest
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Most of the existing literature points to anomalous tropical SSTs and convection as dynamical drivers of the geopotential changes in the North Pacific
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. However, at least one study has implicated Arctic sea-ice loss as a possible cause of the drier winters over the American southwest
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. One proposed physical mechanism involves surface warming and geopotential height increase over the newly open ocean areas in the Arctic, which in turn drives anomalous ridging over the North Pacific by perturbing high-latitude planetary wave patterns
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Although this mechanism is not considered to be a primary driver of California’s precipitation variability, scientific interest in the “sea-ice hypothesis” has been heightened by the pronounced Arctic sea-ice loss over the satellite era and the dramatic sea-ice retreat expected by the end of the twenty-first century
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Motivated by this, we focus on elucidating the possible mechanisms by which large-scale sea-ice cover changes could affect precipitation over California.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A novel feature of our approach is that we sample the uncertainties in selected sea-ice physics parameters (see “Methods” section and ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>), thereby obtaining an ensemble of simulations with a seasonally ice-free Arctic (“low Arctic ice” simulations). These are compared to control simulations representative of sea-ice conditions at the end of the twentieth century. A comparison between “low Arctic ice” and control simulations allows us to isolate the atmospheric response that is solely associated with changes in sea-ice cover. Neither the SSTs nor the sea-ice cover are prescribed in our model simulations. We are therefore able to account for atmosphere–surface ocean interactions and SST changes necessary for propagation of high-to-low latitude atmospheric teleconnections
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Unlike previous studies that impose artificial energy fluxes to achieve sea-ice loss
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>, our sea-ice parameter perturbations allow for energy budget conservation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our primary interest is in the fast atmospheric response to sea-ice changes in the first decades after the sea-ice loss has occurred. This fast response is mediated by the surface ocean, and typically dominates the overall response during the first years or decades after the initial high-latitude perturbation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. We examine this initial response using an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model. We do not investigate how this initial atmosphere–surface ocean response may become modulated by the slower deep-ocean response over longer (e.g., century scale) time periods as in refs. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. We verify that at the short timescales of interest here (&lt;50 years after the sea-ice loss), an AGCM coupled to a slab ocean yields a qualitatively similar short-term response to that produced by the same AGCM coupled to a full ocean model (AOGCM) (see Supplementary Discussion). Our results show that the consequences of Arctic sea-ice decline are not restricted to the Arctic region alone. Loss of Arctic sea-ice cover of the magnitude expected in the next few decades, could induce large-scale atmospheric circulation changes across the Northern hemisphere, resulting in significant drying over California.
