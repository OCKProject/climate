 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We suggest that the tropical Pacific convection changes described above play a key role in driving the North Pacific circulation changes. Linkages between the equatorial Pacific convection anomalies and extratropical (North Pacific) atmospheric circulation changes are found in both observational and modeling studies

  </span> and have been invoked to explain North Pacific circulation differences during different phases of the ENSO cycle. These studies find that enhanced winter convection (and corresponding enhanced upper-level divergence) in the equatorial Pacific initiates a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain. The characteristics of this wavetrain are positive stream function and geopotential anomalies immediately outside the region of increased convection (anticyclonic flow), and negative anomalies in the extratropical Pacific (cyclonic flow). We find that this mechanism also operates in our simulations.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the DJF season, the area of strongest decrease in high cloud cover is located over the central tropical Pacific (see contour lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). This region of decreased tropical deep convection coincides with the area of the largest outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) increase (see shading in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). In the second teleconnection step, decreased deep convection in the tropical Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>) and the associated decrease in upper-level divergence force a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain with negative (cyclonic) anomalies in the northern tropical Pacific and positive (anticyclonic) anomalies in the extratropical North Pacific sector. This is evident from the 250 mb stream function changes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2f</a>), which indicate anomalous cyclonic flow in the tropics and anomalous anticyclonic flow in the North Pacific. The 250 mb North Pacific anticyclonic flow is the upper-level manifestation of the geopotential ridge in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>—a factor responsible for steering the wet winter air masses away from California. The atmospheric anomalies in the North Pacific exhibit an equivalent barotropic response (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">5a</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The convection changes described above are consistent with the simulated upper-level vertical velocity anomalies and Hadley circulation changes. From a climatological perspective, the descending branch of the winter Hadley cell is positioned over (and to the west of) California (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">6</a>). Arctic sea-ice loss markedly amplifies this subsidence over California, while also affecting the uplift and subsidence regions across the tropical Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). The tropical Hadley circulation plays a key role in the atmospheric transport of heat between the tropics and extratropics

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The schematic in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> summarizes the hypothesized two-step teleconnection, involving sea-ice loss, tropical convection reorganization, a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain, and a decrease in precipitation over California. Several previous studies have suggested that tropical and subtropical Pacific convection changes affect precipitation over California by inducing geopotential anomalies in the North Pacific

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. While such tropical and subtropical convection changes could be a consequence of natural variability, our analysis indicates that they can also be forced from the high latitudes by substantial sea-ice loss. Our simulations imply that two hitherto separate hypotheses—that Californian rainfall is primarily influenced by tropical convection changes (“tropical hypothesis”)

    <p>Schematics of the two-step teleconnection. In step 1 (equatorward propagation), Arctic sea-ice loss induced high-latitude changes propagate into tropics, triggering tropical circulation and convection response. Decreased convection and decreased upper-level divergence in the tropical Pacific in turn drive a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain with anticyclonic flow forming in the North Pacific. This ridge is responsible for steering the wet tropical air masses away from California</p>
