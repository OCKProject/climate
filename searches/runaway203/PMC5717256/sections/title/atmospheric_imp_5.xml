 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further investigate the proposed two-step teleconnection, and additionally verify that sea-ice-induced tropical convection changes are forcing the circulation changes in the North Pacific, we explore the impacts of another source of remote forcing: Antarctic sea-ice loss. Antarctic sea-ice decline will result in a warming at mid- to high latitudes of the southern hemisphere. One consequence of this warming is a southward shift of tropical precipitation, with convection increase in the southern and central tropical Pacific
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. This is the opposite to the precipitation response accompanying Arctic sea-ice loss. In accord with previous studies

  </span> and the mechanism advanced here, increased convection should in turn drive a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain consisting of an anticyclonic anomaly in the tropical Pacific and a cyclonic anomaly in the North Pacific. This cyclonic flow is associated with negative geopotential height anomalies over the North Pacific (geopotential low) leading to wetter conditions over California. Simulations in which the sea-ice physics parameter perturbations are prescribed in the Southern hemisphere only (“low Antarctic ice” simulations, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">1b, d</a>) show a response that is consistent with these expectations. Tropical precipitation shifts southward (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>), anticyclonic flow is established over the northern tropical Pacific, and cyclonic flow is formed over the North Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>). The geopotential ridge in the North Pacific is replaced with a geopotential trough, favoring the propagation of tropical storms across California (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). As a result, precipitation over California increases (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>).

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “low Antarctic ice” simulations show that the proposed mechanism can be triggered by sea-ice changes in either hemisphere. Since Antarctic sea-ice loss involves northward propagation in both teleconnection steps (i.e., Antarctic sea-ice affecting the tropical Pacific, which in turn affects the North Pacific) and no high northern latitude changes, it provides additional support for our conjecture that the sea-ice changes can influence North Pacific geopotential height through tropical convection changes. More generally, any high-latitude perturbation (northern or southern hemispheric warming or cooling) that impacts the position of the tropical Pacific ITCZ, will have an impact on California’s rainfall.</p>
