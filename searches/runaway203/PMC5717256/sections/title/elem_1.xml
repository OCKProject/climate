   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b, c</a>). We focus our analysis on the December–February season, because these months yield the largest impact of sea-ice changes on Californian precipitation in our model simulations. The most striking feature of the precipitation response to Arctic sea-ice loss is the reorganization of tropical rainfall and an apparent northward precipitation shift. The Arctic sea-ice decline also results in significantly less precipitation over California—a consequence of a geopotential ridge in the North Pacific that steers the wet winter air masses northward into Alaska and Canada, away from California (Fig.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first step of this teleconnection, sea-ice loss alters the high-latitude energy budget (see annual mean flux changes shown in Supplementary Figs. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">3a</a>). These high-latitude energy flux changes are dominated by a decrease in the net top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation to space (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2a</a>). Sea-ice loss leads to an increase in the net downward TOA shortwave flux (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2b</a>) that is only partly compensated by an increase in net TOA upward longwave flux. This yields an increased net TOA heat flux into the atmosphere, and thus less radiation to space. Over the high northern latitudes, the TOA net flux changes are on average larger than the net surface flux changes (Supplementary Figs. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2a, c</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">3a</a>), leading to an increased heat flux into the atmospheric column (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2d</a>). With the exception of very high northern latitudes, sea-ice induced decrease in the net upward shortwave flux at the surface is largely compensated by an increase in the latent and sensible heat fluxes (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2e, f, g</a>). Several previous studies

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span> support our finding of larger high-latitude TOA flux anomalies (relative to surface flux anomalies) in response to sea-ice changes. Experimental configurations that impose artificial surface energy fluxes in order to remove sea-ice cover necessarily yield a substantially larger surface energy imbalance than the one described here.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a consequence of the increased high-latitude heat flux into the atmospheric column, the atmospheric heat transport from mid-latitudes into the high northern latitudes decreases (see the large white arrow in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">3a</a>). The high-latitude energy surplus is compensated for at lower latitudes, with most of the energy emitted to space through the TOA flux changes over the tropical Pacific between 20
   <span class="bold">°</span>S and 20
   <span class="bold">°</span>N (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">3a, b</a>). Increase in the tropical net TOA flux to space is associated with changes in high cloud cover. As seen from Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">3b</a>, regions of increased TOA flux to space coincide with the regions of decreased high cloud cover. An increase in the net TOA flux to space over the regions of decreased high cloud cover is a consequence of an increase in the outgoing longwave radiation (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">3c</a>) due to decreased radiation height, that is only partially compensated by an increase in the net downward shortwave flux.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>. Specifically, previous work suggests that reorganization of atmospheric convection over the tropical Pacific (and resulting adjustment of the amount of energy emitted to space) can provide a compensation for energy budget perturbations elsewhere
   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>

  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanism by which high-latitude changes propagate into the tropics and induce tropical convection responses involves two processes: (i) a southward advection of the initial high-latitude temperature perturbation over the mid-latitudes through transport and mixing; and (ii) a wind/evaporation/sea-surface temperature feedback in the region of the northeasterly trades. The tropical response to high-latitude sea-ice loss in our model simulations is consistent with these findings (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">4</a>). Once advected into the mid-latitudes, the sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies propagate into the tropics by giving rise to anomalous meridional surface pressure gradients that in turn affect the strengths of easterly winds. These wind strength changes then further drive the evaporative flux changes
   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span>. Specifically, over the northern tropics, in the region of the northeasterly trades, the progression of cold (warm) SST anomalies will lead to an increase (decrease) in the surface wind strengths. This results in increased (decreased) evaporative cooling, thus allowing for further propagation of cold (warm) anomalies toward the equator. Over the southern tropics, the response is the opposite, due to the background southeasterly flow. Negative (positive) wind strength and latent heat flux anomalies over the northern (southern) tropics in response to Arctic sea-ice loss are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">4b, c</a>.

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The progression of these relatively small SST changes into the tropics, in combination with tropospheric temperature changes aloft, can drive convection changes in the tropical Pacific

These studies find that enhanced winter convection (and corresponding enhanced upper-level divergence) in the equatorial Pacific initiates a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain. The characteristics of this wavetrain are positive stream function and geopotential anomalies immediately outside the region of increased convection (anticyclonic flow), and negative anomalies in the extratropical Pacific (cyclonic flow). We find that this mechanism also operates in our simulations.
  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the DJF season, the area of strongest decrease in high cloud cover is located over the central tropical Pacific (see contour lines in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). This region of decreased tropical deep convection coincides with the area of the largest outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) increase (see shading in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). In the second teleconnection step, decreased deep convection in the tropical Pacific (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>) and the associated decrease in upper-level divergence force a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain with negative (cyclonic) anomalies in the northern tropical Pacific and positive (anticyclonic) anomalies in the extratropical North Pacific sector. This is evident from the 250 mb stream function changes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2f</a>), which indicate anomalous cyclonic flow in the tropics and anomalous anticyclonic flow in the North Pacific. The 250 mb North Pacific anticyclonic flow is the upper-level manifestation of the geopotential ridge in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>—a factor responsible for steering the wet winter air masses away from California. The atmospheric anomalies in the North Pacific exhibit an equivalent barotropic response (Supplementary Fig.

More generally, any high-latitude perturbation (northern or southern hemispheric warming or cooling) that impacts the position of the tropical Pacific ITCZ, will have an impact on California’s rainfall.</p>
