         <p>Impact of sea-ice physics parameter perturbations on Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice
            cover. 
            <span>a</span> Arctic sea-ice concentrations, September. 
            <span>b</span> Antarctic sea-ice concentrations, March. Shown are monthly mean sea-ice concentrations.
            Areas contained within contour lines have sea-ice fractions larger than 15%. Thick
            black lines denote control ensemble means, thick purple lines show “low Arctic ice”
            in 
            <span>a</span> and “low Antarctic ice” ensemble means in 
            <span>b</span>. Thin purple lines indicate individual “low Arctic ice” (“low Antarctic ice”) simulations.
            The colored shading indicates the average observed September (
            <span>a</span>) and March (
            <span>b</span>) sea-ice concentrations over the period 1992–2001 (from the Center for Satellite
            Exploitation and Research; 
            <span>http://nsidc.org/data/sipn/data-sets.html#seaice-conc-ext</span>). A brief comparison of Arctic vs. Antarctic sea-ice changes is provided in Supplementary
