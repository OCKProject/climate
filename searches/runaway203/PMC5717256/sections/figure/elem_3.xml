  <p>Schematics of the two-step teleconnection. In step 1 (equatorward propagation), Arctic sea-ice loss induced high-latitude changes propagate into tropics, triggering tropical circulation and convection response. Decreased convection and decreased upper-level divergence in the tropical Pacific in turn drive a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain with anticyclonic flow forming in the North Pacific. This ridge is responsible for steering the wet tropical air masses away from California</p>
