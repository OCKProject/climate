         <p>Schematics of the two-step teleconnection. In step 1 (equatorward propagation), Arctic
            sea-ice loss induced high-latitude changes propagate into tropics, triggering tropical
            circulation and convection response. Decreased convection and decreased upper-level
            divergence in the tropical Pacific in turn drive a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain
            with anticyclonic flow forming in the North Pacific. This ridge is responsible for
            steering the wet tropical air masses away from California
