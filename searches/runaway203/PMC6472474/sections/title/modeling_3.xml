 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have developed an empirical crop model based on statistical relationships for the impacts of temperature, precipitation, CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations, and ozone rather than plant level simulations. Crop responses to changes in meteorological variables and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations are based on a meta‐analysis of more than 1,000 modeling studies (Challinor et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0002">2014</a>), incorporating relationships observed in field studies. The availability of these three response factors from meta‐analysis determines the scope of our analysis, which includes wheat, maize (corn), and rice and uses separate response coefficients for each of these according to temperate or tropical conditions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Processes included in the modeling are summarized in Figure 
  <a rid="eft2497-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eft2497-fig-0001">1</a>. We first use a model that calculates time‐dependent composition in response to emissions of each agent involved in climate change. Residence times for all species are those given in the IPCC AR5 (Myhre et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0018">2013</a>), with the exception of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, which is evaluated using a simple carbon cycle model incorporating four response times representing major terrestrial and oceanic carbon reservoirs (Joos et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0010">2001</a>; the version used in IPCC AR4). In the next step, radiative forcing values are calculated based on the radiative efficiency of each compound given in the IPCC AR5 (Myhre et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0018">2013</a>), supplemented by results from our prior modeling for the indirect effects of aerosols, as AR5 values are not available. For short‐lived species, global mean forcing values per unit emission are used, as we only explore the response to worldwide changes in short‐lived species. It is clear that radiative efficiency varies with the location of emissions (Myhre et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0018">2013</a>), and this could be addressed in future work. Global mean temperature responses are then calculated using an impulse‐response function based on the climate sensitivity and response times of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models (Geoffroy et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0007">2013</a>), which is consistent with estimates based on paleoclimate data and analysis of modern climate (Collins et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0004">2013</a>). This impulse‐response function includes two exponential decays, one with a time constant of 8.2 years representing the relatively rapid response of the land and upper ocean and a second with a time constant of 290 years representing the comparatively slow response of the deeper ocean, and has a climate sensitivity to doubled CO
  <sub>2</sub> of 3.2 °C. Through this stage, the entire modeling follows that described previously (Shindell, 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0024">2016</a>), except that the impulse‐response function has been updated.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To extend beyond our prior work, we now incorporate the spatial pattern of both temperature and precipitation responses based on an analysis of nine global climate models that have performed idealized simulations examining the individual responses to CO
  <sub>2</sub>, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, SO
  <sub>4</sub>, and BC (Myhre et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0017">2017</a>). Aerosols were increased globally by large factors (5× present day for sulfate and 10× for BC) to obtain statistically significant signals. Responses to localized aerosol perturbations might differ, and hence, here we present only responses to worldwide aerosol changes. All results are interpolated to 1° × 1° horizontal resolution, with the native resolution in the underlying climate models ranging from 2.8° × 2.8° to 1.4° × 1.4°. We assume that the temperature and precipitation responses per unit forcing to other well‐mixed greenhouse gasses (WMGHGs; N
  <sub>2</sub>O and F‐gasses) is similar to the responses to CO
  <sub>2</sub> (as is found to be the case for methane). Similarly, we assume the response to other scattering aerosols or aerosol precursors (OC, NH
  <sub>3</sub>, and the portion of NO
  <sub>x</sub> that leads to nitrate) is similar to the response to SO
  <sub>2</sub>. Multimodel mean results for the temperature and precipitation impacts of CO and NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions via tropospheric ozone and methane are excluded, as these are not available. Based on the IPCC AR5, the net forcing from these two gasses (excluding nitrate‐related impacts) is 0.1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, a small value compared with forcing due to, for example, CO
  <sub>2</sub> of 1.7 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>. Nevertheless, it would be useful to add the impacts of these gasses along with nonmethane volatile organic compounds for completeness. The multimodel mean temperature response patterns are uniformly scaled according to the amplitude of global mean temperature change calculated in the simple model as described in the previous paragraph. Precipitation patterns are also uniformly scaled following the relationship in the climate models between those patterns and global mean temperature for individual forcers.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crop responses to temperature are regionally varying with values in units of percent yield per degree warming of (temperate regions and tropical regions): maize (−2.4, −3.4), wheat (−2.4, −13.8), and rice (−3.2, −2.0) based on the meta‐analysis (Challinor et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0002">2014</a>). This compares with the uniform global mean value of −4.9% yield change per degree for all crops in Shindell (
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0024">2016</a>) based on this same meta‐analysis. For consistency with the underlying meta‐analysis, we define regions as follows: Tropical regions are those from 30°S to 30°N except for longitudes 20°W to 60°E (North Africa and the Middle East) where we use 20°S–20°N for all crops. Central and Eastern China, defined as 22–40°N, 100–122°E, is assigned to be temperate for wheat and maize, but tropical for rice (thus northeast China is temperate for all), as those were the classifications used in the meta‐analysis from which the response functions are derived.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Turning now to composition, in addition to the response of CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations to CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions, we include the very small “direct” oxidation of CH
  <sub>4</sub> and CO to CO
  <sub>2</sub>. We also include the “indirect” CO
  <sub>2</sub> response to all other climate drivers via their impact on the carbon cycle (Gasser et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0006">2017</a>; see dashed arrows in Figure 
  <a rid="eft2497-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eft2497-fig-0001">1</a>). Hence, all emissions affect the carbon cycle, though no others as greatly as direct emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impacts of methane emissions on ozone are based on simulations with the GISS and ECHAM global composition‐climate models (Shindell et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0021">2012</a>), whereas ozone responses to CO and NO
  <sub>x</sub> are based on prior modeling with the GISS model only (Shindell et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0022">2005</a>). There are multiple ozone metrics associated with crop yields. We use M7 and M12 (the mean 7‐ or 12‐hr exposure during the growing season, depending on the crop) rather than accumulated ozone over a threshold of 40 ppb (AOT40) since the latter is by definition highly nonlinear, as it uses a threshold, so not well suited to the linear framework used here. Metrics based on stomatal flux of ozone (e.g., Mills et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0015">2011</a>) are likely better than those based on surface concentrations, as they take into account variations in ozone uptake by plants under different meteorological conditions, but are not practical to implement in our framework with currently available model results. While direct human impacts on crops via land management (e.g., application of fertilizer and cultivar choice) obviously have large impacts on yields, these processes are not included in this study, which aims to isolate the indirect effects of worldwide pollutant emissions largely outside the control of local land managers.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Uncertainties are propagated through from all sources using a Monte Carlo evaluation with 20,000 samples randomly selected across the distributions of each components' uncertainty range. Relative uncertainties in RF are taken from the AR5, whereas uncertainties in crop yield responses are those reported in the meta‐analysis (Challinor et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0002">2014</a>). Uncertainty in climate response comes from the multimodel CMIP5 analysis (Geoffroy et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0007">2013</a>). All are 5–95% confidence intervals, and the sampling assumes that all have a normal Gaussian distribution except for climate sensitivity (which is asymmetric, with a long tail at the high end). GHG and pollutant emissions are taken from the CMIP5 data set (Lamarque et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0011">2011</a>). Effects are calculated as the time‐dependent response to historical emissions since 1850, and we show results for 2010 (which are hence based on all emissions through that year). Note that results for the impacts of short‐lived aerosol and nonmethane ozone precursors represent the effect of worldwide emissions and the impact of emissions at any given location might differ. Crop distributions for 2010 are taken from the Food and Agricultural Organization data sets (FAO, 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0005">2010</a>).
