 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is interesting to consider the potential impacts of pollution controls in China and India. The effects of removing aerosols along with CO and NO
  <sub>x</sub> would lead to production losses for wheat and rice (Figure 
  <a rid="eft2497-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#eft2497-fig-0005">5</a>). Such decreases in short‐lived pollutants appear to be already taking place (Zheng et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0026">2018</a>). Conversely, methane reductions could greatly improve production of all three crops in all areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The losses experienced by a particular country are driven both by its location and the amount of crops grown there. The influence of the latter factor makes comparisons of historical “responsibility” to actual present‐day losses complex. To simplify this comparison, we assume that maize losses are attributable to methane, whereas wheat losses are assumed to be due equally to CO
  <sub>2</sub> (owing to warming) and methane. Rice is substantially influenced by many pollutants, so is not included here as short‐lived aerosol, and nonmethane ozone precursors are not considered since impacts of regional emissions may differ from the global mean. Though only a rough guide, it is nevertheless interesting to find that production losses are in some cases far less than the national‐level attributable share of time‐weighted GHG emissions whereas in other cases they are much greater. For example, losses of maize in the United States are 6.2 times greater than the U.S. share of GHG emissions driving those losses, owing primarily to the very large share of worldwide maize produced in the United States, but losses of wheat are only 40% of the U.S. share of emissions driving wheat losses. In contrast, production losses for wheat in India are 8.8 times greater than the Indian share of GHG emissions driving those losses, due to India's position in the tropics (where wheat is very sensitive to warming and where methane increases lead to large ozone responses). India's losses of maize, however, are only 10% of their share of emissions, as India produced little maize. For China, production losses tend to be more similar to the Chinese share of historical GHG emissions (50% of share of wheat losses and 120% of share of maize losses).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modeling performed here provides insight into the role of individual pollutant emissions, but further work is needed in several areas. For instance, production changes describe only a portion of the crop response to emissions, as factors such as nutritional content may also change (Myers et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0016">2014</a>). A full picture would also require consideration of the possible effect of the activity leading to emissions on production. For example, a large portion of N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions result from fertilizer application, the net impact of which is clearly still to increase production despite the effects shown here. Impacts of F‐gasses are similarly complex when these are used as refrigerants to prevent food spoilage. In the case of livestock, these results suggest that shifting to diets with lower consumption of cattle products (meat and dairy) could indirectly lead to substantial crop production benefits form decreased methane emissions, potentially including benefits for substitute sources of protein such as soybeans.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also note that some limited‐area studies show highly nonlinear yield changes with, for example, very steep declines at high daily temperatures for U.S. maize, soy, and cotton (Schlenker &amp; Roberts, 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0020">2009</a>). Data are unavailable for other crops or regions, so this cannot be incorporated here but indicates that the linearity of the meta‐analysis (Challinor et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0002">2014</a>) may be oversimplified. It is possible, however, that a linear response to annual average temperatures may capture probabilistic increase in short‐term extremes, as these may follow longer‐term averages. Similarly, studies have suggested that responses to minimum and maximum daily temperatures are opposite for rice, and though the use of mean temperature in the meta‐analysis presumably captures the average of these changes if daily extremes were to be substantially different from prior studies (e.g., under a future climate scenario), the relationship with mean temperature may no longer hold. Another factor that may be oversimplified is our use of a globally uniform (though crop‐specific) CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect derived by the meta‐analysis (Challinor et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0002">2014</a>). Some research has suggested regional differences but indicates that more research is necessary to adequately account for these in models (McGrath &amp; Lobell, 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0013">2013</a>). Additionally, as discussed in section 
  <a rid="eft2497-sec-0001" ref-type="sec" href="#eft2497-sec-0001">1</a>, aerosols are likely to play an additional role through their effects on both direct and diffuse radiation and nutrient fertilization, so should be accounted for as these effects become better understood. Hence, there is ample room for improving our understanding of the crop response to individual pollutants. These results also highlight the prominent role of methane, suggesting that it would be useful to perform simulations with detailed, computationally expensive plant level and climate modeling driven by methane alone to compare with our statistical modeling approach.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current results suggest that worldwide, we currently experience yield losses of wheat and maize of about 4–6%. Present‐day (2010) losses due to historical emissions are greater than one million tons for maize in China and for wheat in Pakistan, the United States, China, and France, with losses exceeding 10 million tons for U.S. maize and Indian wheat. Relative yield losses are greater than 10% for several large producers, including wheat in India and Mexico and maize in Egypt. Yield losses are greater than 15% for wheat in several Latin American and South Asian countries, and Ethiopia owing to the large sensitivity of tropical wheat to warming. In contrast, South and East Asian countries have experienced yield increases in rice due to the combined influence of CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization and aerosol‐induced cooling. Given the role of aerosols and that maize yield losses are largely attributable to methane, these results suggest that greater attention should be paid to the role of non‐CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions in affecting agriculture. In particular, there may be large agricultural benefits to targeting methane emission reductions, and such impacts are not well captured by the use of traditional metrics for comparison of GHGs that only reflect their climate impacts (Huntingford et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0009">2011</a>; Shindell et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0023">2017</a>).
