 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many prior studies have investigated agricultural responses to climate change, as summarized, for example, in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; Porter et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0019">2014</a>). Though changes in the composition of the atmosphere in the case of CO
  <sub>2</sub> are typically included, changes in other aspects of atmospheric composition are generally omitted. Impacts of ozone, however, are relatively well understood, as acknowledged by the AR5 (Porter et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0019">2014</a>), and have been quantified in many studies (e.g., Avnery et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0001">2011</a>; Porter et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0019">2014</a>; Van Dingenen et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0025">2009</a>). Those studies, however, do not include climate change impacts. As such, extant research does not provide a clear indication of the impact of the individual emissions that drive, in many cases, both climate change and ozone concentrations. An initial study to quantify the effects of individual pollutants on agriculture was performed recently, examining global aggregate results only (Shindell, 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0024">2016</a>). Here we build on that work, now examining the spatial distribution of the crop yield impacts of all major pollutants that occur via the physiological (CO
  <sub>2</sub> and ozone exposure) and climate‐related (temperature and precipitation) impacts of emissions. We consider greenhouse gasses (GHGs), aerosols, and both aerosol and ozone precursors all as pollutants since all adversely affect the environment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in aerosol‐related emissions and atmospheric aerosol concentrations are likely to have multiple effects on crops, including leading to changes in nutrient deposition (e.g., Mahowald, 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0012">2011</a>), diffuse versus direct sunlight available for photosynthesis (Mercado et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0014">2009</a>), and total photosynthetically active radiation reaching plants due to atmospheric (Chameides et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0003">1994</a>) or deposited (Greenwald et al., 
  <a rid="eft2497-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#eft2497-bib-0008">2006</a>) aerosol. There are few field studies available to quantify the role of each of these effects, preventing us from applying the type of meta‐analysis used to characterize other crop impacts in this study, and hence, impacts of aerosol composition change are not included here (impacts of aerosols on climate are included). Additional work on aerosol‐related crop impacts would of course be useful.
