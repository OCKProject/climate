  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human influence has strongly modified the annual mean temperature in West Africa, with a regional warming depicted since the 1950s (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). We found a difference of approximately 1 °C when comparing the average temperature of the last decade 2000–2009 between the factual and counterfactual climate simulations (Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). Although this warming is simulated all over West Africa, it is more pronounced in the north and central Sahel and in the Sahara (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1a</a>). This is certainly the most robust change, with all statistical tests showing significant values (Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). In addition, the factual climate simulation, which includes human influence, is able to more accurately reproduce the mean and the variability of the observed annual temperatures derived from the CRU dataset
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span> than the counterfactual climate simulation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The correlation between the observed and simulated time series of annual temperature reaches 0.92 with the factual simulation, while it falls to 0.75 with the counterfactual simulation. Moreover, the bias between the simulated and observed annual temperatures is −0.9 °C with the counterfactual simulation, which is colder than CRU data, while the bias is only +0.1 °C with the factual simulation. This comparison provides clear evidence of the reality of anthropogenic climate change in West Africa. The factual and counterfactual climate simulations significantly differ from each other. For instance, an important increase in the number of very hot days in the factual climate simulation was found (the number of hot days increases eight-fold in the last decade; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a> and Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). This increase is more pronounced in the north of West Africa (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1c</a>). While the impacts of human activities are particularly evident on regional surface temperature, the impacts on rainfall are less clear. The model is able to accurately reproduce the decadal variations of annual rainfall with the wet years during the 1950s, the droughts of the late 1970s and 1980s and the recovery of rainfall, which starts in the 1990s compared to observations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). However, the simulated annual rainfall time series in the factual and in the counterfactual simulations are almost identical, showing a similar correlation with observation (R = 0.54 and R = 0.56 for factual and counterfactual simulation, respectively) and no significant change in the last decade (Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). The changes are hardly or not significant when we consider the number of rainy days or the onset of the rains, which neither of which seems to be modified with the human activities in the climate model. However, more significant changes are detected for rainfall intensity and in heavy rainfall in the Sahel over the last decade, which can be deemed the impacts of human activities (Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>; Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). This is particularly clear when we consider the number of rainy days exceeding 50 mm/day (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>), where we found a significant increase of 27.7% in the last decades between the factual and the counterfactual simulations.

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reported data for West Africa obtained from the M3-Crops dataset showed that the reported millet yields were almost the same as the sorghum yields (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The yield dataset is solely based on reported yield statistics and represents the average yield circa the year 2000 (that is, the average in 1997–2003). However, the different crop models reproduced the reported data differently. The average yields of millet in 1997–2003 simulated by the CYGMA model were comparable to the reported data in terms of the long-term yield average (the simulated yields are approximately 1 t ha
   <span class="sup">−1</span>), whereas the SARRA-H model overestimated the millet yields over that region (the simulated yields often exceed 2 t ha
   <span class="sup">−1</span>). Both crop models overestimated the sorghum yields, especially in northern Nigeria and southern Mali, while only the CYGMA model overestimated those in Burkina Faso.

Post-processing of the simulated yields, such as scaling so that the CYGMA-simulated regional average yield in 1996–2005 would equal one, led to a good agreement between the reported and simulated yields (“Scaled” in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). These results indicate that the simulated regional average yield in absolute terms is less reliable and that the simulated relative changes in yields should be utilized for further analysis.

     <p>Comparison of annual yield time series reported by the FAO and the average yields over West Africa simulated by SARRA-H and CYGMA for millet and sorghum for the period 1961–2012.

The grid-cell harvested area in 2000 was used as the weight when computing country average yields. Three different metrics were used: 1) the reported and simulated raw yield data were compared without any post-processing (raw); 2) the reported and simulated annual yield data were separately scaled so that each average yield in 1996–2005 was equal to one, and then the data were compared (scaled); and 3) the percentage yield anomalies, relative to the normal yield calculated as the 5-yr running average, were separately computed for the reported and simulated data and then compared (anomaly).

  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main advantage of the CYGMA model is that it is able to reproduce the historical yield increasing trends, as visually indicated (“Raw” in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). A sensitivity analysis using the CYGMA model revealed that the technological effect (increased use of N fertilizer and improved varieties along with an increase in the knowledge stock) contributed more strongly to the simulated yield trends than the CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). No such trend is simulated with the SARRA-H model, which does not include technological effects nor the CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect.
  </p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SARRA-H model outperforms the CYGMA model in reproducing the interannual variability of crop yields. Significant correlation values between the reported and simulated regional average yield anomalies were obtained for both millet and sorghum (R = 0.485 and R = 0.335, respectively; “Anomaly” in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The country-level comparisons reveal that the performance of the SARRA-H model in simulating the yield anomalies of the two crops was relatively good, with significant correlation coefficients in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, three major crop-producing countries in the studied region (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The ability of the SARRA-H model to capture interannual variability is detailed for the 12 countries in Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>. The highest correlation between simulated yield and reported yield is depicted for millet in Senegal (R = 0.77). However, the correlation coefficient was not significant for Nigeria, the top producer of sorghum and the 3
   <span class="sup">rd</span> largest producer of millet in the region (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Therefore, if we remove the data in Nigeria when calculating regional average yield anomalies, the correlation values between the reported and simulated yields increase to 0.686 for millet and 0.533 for sorghum (figure not shows). The best correlations are obtained when rainfall and/or temperature during the growing seasons are correlated with the reported FAO yields (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>), i.e., when the observed yield variability is explained by climate factors. However, the SARRA-H model generally outperforms the correlation between the reported FAO yield and rainfall and/or temperature, which shows the added value of having a process-based model compared to simple linear statistics. The performance of the CYGMA model in simulating the yield anomalies of millet and sorghum was lower than that of the SARRA-H model in most cases.

  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results suggested that the models evaluated here, although imperfect, had a certain usefulness and complementarity in assessing the climate impacts on yield variability and trends. The CYGMA model accurately reproduces the yield trends, while the SARRA-H model better reproduces year-to-year variability. However, the comparison between reported and simulated country yields in West Africa is difficult partly because – although FAO yield statistics are the best reliable source of information – many data values from the FAO database in the region are derived from data imputation or unofficial data sources (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>), and historical management information is not available.

Although some positive impacts are simulated by the CYGMA model in the south of West Africa, negative yield impacts appeared in many parts of West Africa for both millet and sorghum.

On average, across West Africa, the SARRA-H model simulates a yield loss of 17.7% for millet and 15.0% for sorghum. The CYGMA model simulates a slightly weaker impact, with a yield loss of 10.9% for millet and 5.9% for sorghum. When we consider the five major crop-producing countries (Fig.

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the grid-cell harvested area in 2000 and the country average producer prices in 2000–2009, we estimated that the average annual production losses over West Africa in 2000–2009 associated with historical climate change simulated by SARRA-H account for 2.99 billion USD for millet and 1.89 billion USD for sorghum (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). These losses are lower when the CYGMA model was used and account for 1.65 billion USD for millet and 0.69 billion USD for sorghum. Although all of the simulations lead to economic losses in West Africa, the uncertainty persists. Using the CYGMA model, the 90% probability interval of the estimated sorghum production losses calculated across the 100 ensemble members, which represents the uncertainty of the internal climate variability, ranged from 0.12 to 1.42 billion USD. For millet, the estimates ranged from the production loss of 4.05 billon USD to the production gain of 0.38 billion USD. Using the SARRA-H model, the production loss estimates for sorghum varied from 3.64 to 0.79 billion USD for sorghum and from 6.07 to 0.81 billion USD for millet. The most important economic losses are expected in Nigeria and Niger partly because of the relatively large extent of their harvested area for millet and sorghum.
  </p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This production loss is mainly driven by the temperature change between the factual and the counterfactual climate simulations, whose spatial pattern (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>) is similar to the pattern of yield change (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>); the highest production losses are located in the northern Sahel, where the warming is more intense. The relationship between temperature change and yield change is particularly clear when the SARRA-H model is used (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>). A negative linear relationship is found between simulated yield change and temperature change. A warming above 1 °C is associated with yield losses in almost all simulations of millet and sorghum, and the warmest simulations lead to the highest yield losses. Although no significant change on simulated rainfall is found, on average, in West Africa, variations of rainfall can also have an impact on SARRA-H-simulated yield change and have the potential to exacerbate or mitigate the yield impact depending on whether the rainfall decreases or increases. However, there are only a few simulations showing production gain even with rainfall increase. This confirms the results of Salack
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span>, who showed that rainfall increase did not completely compensate for the effect of temperature increase (+1.5 °C) but greatly mitigated the impacts of warming (−59% and −26% for decreasing and increasing rainfall, respectively). The relative effects of temperature and rainfall changes on crop yield impacts are also discussed by Roudier 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
   </span> and Schlenker and Lobell
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span>, who also noted the dominant role of temperature increase in the estimation of the impact of climate change on crop yield in Africa. However, there are uncertainties in the estimated climate-yield relationship across the two models SARRA-H and CYGMA. Indeed, although the CYGMA-simulated yields decrease with warming and increase with increasing precipitation, the slope is weaker (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>), which might explain why the simulated yield impacts are lower in CYGMA than in SARRA-H.

  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To better understand the production changes in the processes represented in the crop models, a sensitivity analysis was performed with the CYGMA model, which simulates more processes affecting crop yields (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>) and has more flexibility. The results (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>) suggest that CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization and technological improvement are insufficient to offset the increased heat stress and water stress under factual conditions. The water deficit stress most largely contributed to the yield impact, likely through increased evapotranspiration since no significant trend in growing season rainfall was detected (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). A direct effect of warming, such as heat stress, is also found, but its contribution to the yield impact is smaller than that of the indirect effect. Interestingly, although the SARRA-H model includes fewer processes and does not include heat stress, it leads to crop yield losses similarly to CYGMA. This consistency might imply that mechanisms commonly considered in the two models cause yield and production losses. Increased evapotranspiration-led water deficit was found to be the largest contributing factor in CYGMA (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>) and in SARRA-H in a previous study
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
   </span>, in addition to shortened crop duration with increased temperatures. However, CYGMA-based yield and production losses are almost always smaller than the SARRA-H-based yield and losses (an exception is millet in Senegal). One explanation is that the SARRA-H model overestimates the effect of climate on crop yield compared to the CYGMA model or the reported yields from the FAO (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>) and thus might exacerbate the effect of altered climate conditions. In addition, technological effects (use of varieties that are more tolerant to suboptimal conditions and have larger thermal requirements) and CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization effects are considered in CYGMA but not in SARRA-H and alter the yield response (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>).
