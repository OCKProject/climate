Observed changes in sea surface temperature, sea ice, greenhouse gas concentration, ozone, anthropogenic aerosol burdens (sulfate, black carbon and organic carbon), volcanic sulfate aerosol loading and natural aerosol loading (sea salt and dust) are considered in the factual climate simulation. Variations in solar irradiance are not considered in the simulation. The non-warming counterfactual climate simulation represents a pre-industrial climate that lacks appreciable human influences on global climate systems. The sea surface temperature and sea ice are both detrended, as are greenhouse gas concentration in 1850, anthropogenic aerosol and volcanic sulfate aerosol in 1850 and ozone concentration in 1961, which are used in the counterfactual climate simulation. Each type of climate simulation has 100 ensemble members associated with small perturbations in sea surface temperature that represent observational uncertainties.

   </span> were calculated on every land point of each factual and counterfactual ensemble climate simulation (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). These include seasonal characteristics of precipitation (annual amount, number of rainy days, rainfall intensity, onset of the rains), mean surface temperature and extreme indices with heavy precipitation indices and one hot day index. Each index is averaged across West Africa (20°W to 15°E; 4°N to 18°N). The robustness of the change of an index between the factual and counterfactual climate simulations, on the basis of the models’ ensemble, is assessed with statistical tests. First, we average each of the 100 members of the factual and counterfactual ensemble climate simulations and test the statistical significance of the change between the two ensemble means over the last decade of the simulation 2000–2009 by means of Student’s t-test. Second, we apply a similar Student’s t-test to compare the factual and counterfactual climate simulations over the reference period 2000–2009, but for each model run individually, paired with the same initial conditions, and we count the number of significant changes at the 5% confidence level. A value of 100 in a climatic index of interest indicates that the factual and counterfactual climate simulations are significantly different in the 100 simulations. Third, we apply a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the 100 factual and 100 counterfactual climate simulations over the reference period 2000–2009 with the null hypothesis that the discrepancies between the two distributions are only due to sampling error. A significance level of 5% indicates that the null hypothesis can be rejected statistically. For Student’s t-test, we count the number of significant changes at the 5% confidence level. Finally, we count the number of cases with consistent change over the reference period 2000–2009 in a climatic index of interest between an ensemble member and the ensemble mean in terms of the sign of change. A value of 100 indicates that all changes in individual runs have the same sign as the change computed with the ensemble mean.

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SARRA-H model was originally developed to simulate crops in dry tropics, such as millet and sorghum
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>. The inputs to the model are daily weather data, latitude, soil characteristics (depth, soil water capacity) and crop management (sowing density and depth, sowing date). The crop model estimates attainable yield under water-limited conditions by computing the soil water balance, evapotranspiration, phenology, assimilation, and biomass partitioning (see ref.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span> with assimilation rates depending on solar radiation and water stress and with maintenance respiration depending on temperature. Daily temperatures are also involved in the computation of thermal time, which serves, on an additive basis, to calculate the progress of developmental processes. The phenology of the model is based on a simplified concept of successive phenological stages that have constant (genotypic) thermal duration. The photoperiod sensitivity routine is not activated in this study. SARRA-H was calibrated against local agronomic-trial data and on-farm surveys conducted in eight contrasted sites in terms of climate and agricultural practices in West Africa
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span>. These data were used to define the varieties and the parameters representing management practice in the crop model. SARRA-H showed good performance in simulating crop yield variability in West Africa compared to FAO data, even if it tends to overestimate the mean yield

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the CYGMA model is a global gridded crop model and initially covers four major crops (maize, soybean, rice and spring wheat); it is modified in this study to include millet and sorghum. In the CYGMA model, the development of the crop growth stage is computed as a fraction of the accumulated growing degree days relative to the crop thermal requirements. Leaf area expansion and senescence are computed according to the fraction of the growing season using the prescribed shape of the leaf area index curve. The yields are computed from the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the crop canopy, the radiation-use efficiency, the CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization on the efficiency and the fraction of total biomass increments allocated to the harvestable component. The soil water balance submodel and the snow cover submodel are used to calculate the actual evapotranspiration (although no snow cover occurs in the studied area). Five different stress types – nitrogen (N) deficits, heat, cold, water deficits and water excesses – are considered. The most dominant stress type for a day decreases the daily potential increment of the leaf area and yield. All of the stress types except N deficits are functions of daily weather conditions. The stress associated with the N deficit is modelled as a function of the annual N application rate. The crop’s tolerance to these stresses increases as the knowledge stock increases. The knowledge stock is an economic indicator derived as the sum of the governmental annual research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures in the agricultural sector since 1961 with a certain obsolescence rate, and it represents the average agronomic technology and management level among farmers in the country. More details on modelling are available in the Supplementary Note described in the Supplementary Information of Iizumi

  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CYGMA model uses socioeconomic variables (such as per capita GDP, per capita agricultural area, agricultural research and development expenditure) as the model inputs in addition to physical variables (e.g., daily weather and plant-extractable water holding capacity of soil), enabling the model to simulate yield trends associated with technological improvements. This is a unique characteristic of the CYGMA model. The daily mean, maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, solar radiation, relative humidity and wind speed are used as the weather inputs. For this study, the CYGMA model was calibrated for millet and sorghum using the global dataset of actual and potential yields in 2000
   <span class="sup">

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span>. In short, the sensitivity of the daily increment of leaf area index and yield to each of five different stress factors (N deficit, heat, cold, water deficit and water excess) was determined using the relationship among the yield gap (the ratio between actual and potential yields) in 2000, knowledge stock in 2000 and simulated average growing season stress factor in 1996–2005. The crop coefficient values for millet and sorghum used in this study are available in Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>. The CYGMA model operates globally for millet and sorghum, similar to the four crops previously modelled; therefore, the simulated yields in West Africa were used for this study.

Second, factual and counterfactual climate simulations are used to force the crop models to reproduce the crop yields under climate with (factual) and without (counterfactual) human influences. The comparison between the factual and counterfactual crop yield simulations enables the quantification of the effect of human influence on historical crop yields as simulated by the two crop models.

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SARRA-H simulations include four sets of parameters to capture the diversity of crop management in West Africa. They aim to reproduce the behaviour of two representative varieties of millet and two varieties of sorghum that differ mainly by the length of the growth cycle– a short duration crop (approximately 90 days) and a long duration crop (approximately 120 days) that are both insensitive to the photoperiod – and two levels of fertilization rate by modifying the biomass conversion ratio to a sub-optimal level and a better level to simulate, respectively, a low and a moderate fertilization rate. Here, we run the model separately using each of these four sets of parameters and average the resulting yield with even weights year by year, as in an earlier study
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>

Simulations were performed without any irrigation since most crop systems are rainfed (93% of all agricultural land in Sub-Saharan Africa; FAOSTAT data), and to our knowledge, irrigation is never used for pearl millet and sorghum in West Africa.

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CYGMA model required a 60-yr long soil moisture spin-up (1958–1960 × 20 times) before crop simulation. Annual nitrogen application rates for the individual crops were parameterized as a function of per capita GDP and per capita agricultural area, with the assumption that an increase in average farm income and an increase in land scarcity lead to increased fertilizer use. The use of improved varieties and corresponding management was parameterized using the agricultural knowledge stock, which is an economic indicator to represent technological improvements. These socioeconomic data were obtained from the World Bank and FAOSTAT databases. The sowing dates of the individual crops in 2000 in the CYGMA model follow those reported in the Monthly Irrigated and Rainfed Crop Areas around the year 2000 (MIRCA2000) dataset
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
   </span> but change dynamically according to the long-term temperature and moisture conditions calculated in the model. The extent of harvested area and the fractions of irrigated and rainfed areas in 2000 were obtained from the M3-Crops dataset and MIRCA2000 dataset, respectively. We also used the Historical Irrigation Information (HID) dataset
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span> to take the annual growth rates of irrigation-equipped area (if any) into account. However, in West Africa, there are almost no irrigated areas. Therefore, the crop yields in West Africa simulated by the CYGMA model represent those in rainfed conditions.

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Factual and non-warming counterfactual crop simulations were performed using the two crop models with the 100 factual and counterfactual ensemble climate simulations as the inputs to the crop models to estimate the impacts of historical climate change on crop yields. The climatic variables used as the model inputs include daily mean, maximum and minimum 2-m air temperatures, precipitation, downward shortwave radiation flux, relative humidity and 10-m wind speed. The ET

Therefore, while time-constant, we used the grid-cell harvested area data obtained from the M3Crops dataset instead of FAO-reported data. Different price data (i.e., consumer price) were available in the FAO database, but consumer prices are strongly affected by variations in oil price and export bans in major food-exporting countries. Therefore, we used producer prices to minimize the impacts of these confounding factors on our estimates of crop production losses.
