 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we used a large ensemble of climate simulations and two crop models to estimate the effects of historical climate change on crop production in West Africa. Our study demonstrates that human activities have already had a significant impact on the regional climate in the Sahel, with negative consequences on agricultural production.</p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent increase in the mean temperature in the Sahel and the Sahara, as observed in the CRU observations and described by several authors (see, for instance, ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>), cannot be reproduced if the influences of human activities on climate are excluded. The decade 2000–2009 is approximately 1 °C warmer in West Africa, relative to a counterfactual climate condition, due to human activities, with a much higher frequency of very hot days. While the evolution of annual rainfall in West Africa during the 20th century, which is characterized by the succession of wet periods with droughts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>, does not seem to be driven by human activities, we found a significant increase in the intensity of rainy events. This increase in the frequency of heavy rains corroborates the results from Taylor 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, who depicted more intense Sahelian storms since the 1980s using 35 years of satellite observations and rain gauges in the region. The authors also attributed this intensification of the rains to global warming, which particularly affects the temperatures in the Sahara. A warmer Sahara intensifies convection within Sahelian storms through increased wind shear and changes to the Saharan air layer

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two crop models used here differently reproduced the reported yields in West Africa. Although no single best crop model was found, the CYGMA model showed its relative advantage in capturing the yield growth driven by technological improvements. In contrast, the SARRA-H model showed its relative advantage in capturing yield anomalies, which are mainly driven by seasonal climate variability. The modelled yield response to growing season mean temperature and precipitation are largely different across the models in quantitative terms but similar in qualitative terms (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>; 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>). The crop models reveal a common tendency for warmer conditions to lead to yield losses and wetter conditions to lead to yield gains in the studied region. For this reason, the negative impacts of historical climate change, relative to a counterfactual climate condition, are derived from the crop models. The yield impacts simulated by the SARRA-H model are often more severe than those simulated by the CYGMA model (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). The explicit consideration of technological improvements and agronomic adjustments (sowing date shift and cultivar switching) in the CYGMA model partially explains the difference.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crop production losses were assessed by two independent crop models for the two main staple food crops of West Africa, millet and sorghum. We found that the average crop yield across West Africa for the decade 2000–2009 would have been 11% to 18% higher for millet and 6% to 15% higher for sorghum if human influence on climate was excluded. This yield impact is quite substantial, especially for millet, when compared to the year-to-year variability of observed crop yield in FAO data. For instance, the dramatic drought of 1982–1984 led to a yield loss of approximately 18% in West Africa for millet compared to the more humid year 1985. This yield loss, which led to one of the most severe food crises in the Sahel, is within the range of our estimation of the average climate change impact in the decade 2000–2009 relative to a counterfactual climate condition. Although the uncertainty is large, crop production losses due to climate change have likely led to important financial losses in several Sahelian countries. We estimated that in Niger, which is one of the poorest countries on the planet, the climate change impact on millet production cost between 0.47 and 0.54 billion USD per year during the decade 2000–2009, while the average GDP of the country was 3.4 billion USD during the same decade, according to the World Bank. The GDP share of agriculture in Niger for the period is approximately 35%, and millet is the main cereal that is most extensively cultivated in that country. We assumed that among other agricultural commodities, the production share of millet in agricultural GDP accounts for 50%. The ensemble average yield impact for millet ranged from −19% (CYGMA) to −22% (SARRA-H) relative to what would have occurred under the counterfactual climate condition. A simple multiplication (3.4 billion USD × 0.35 × 0.50 × 0.22) leads to a production loss of 0.13 billion USD. Although this value is much smaller than the crop model-based production loss estimates, these estimates match in order. We found that estimated yield impacts sometimes take a very large value when the yield in the factual climate condition is low (&lt;0.1 t ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), and this could numerically lead to an unrealistically large production loss estimate. We therefore limit the simulated maximum yield impact to −100% of the yield in the factual climate condition to avoid this problem. There might be room to further refine the threshold value, but no information is currently available to determine a reasonable value. The production loss estimates derived from the CYGMA model are smaller than those derived from the SARRA-H model mainly because the yield response to temperature in the CYGMA model is more moderate than that in the SARRA-H model.

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both crop models simulated more important impacts in the north of the Sahel, where the warming is the highest; Niger, Senegal and Mali are most affected by climate change. This spatial pattern is consistent with the results of Roudier 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>, who found that cropped areas in the Soudano-Sahelian zone are likely to be more affected by climate change than those located in the Guinean zone. The authors explain this spatial variability by a greater warming in climate change projections over continental Africa (particularly in the Sahel and the Sahara), while the temperatures of the Guinean zone, which are influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, are expected to increase more slowly. Our results also confirm the importance of increasing temperatures, which leads to crop yield losses, irrespective of rainfall changes. This adverse role of higher temperatures in shortening the crop duration, increasing evapotranspiration demand and reducing crop yields has been noted in several crop modelling studies focused on West Africa

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our production loss estimates for millet and sorghum are consistent with the estimated crop yield losses under future climate change scenarios published in the literature

  </span>. Indeed, it is expected that global warming in the next decades will lead to adverse effects on agriculture, with a mean yield reduction of −8% identified in all Africa

  </span> and −11% in West Africa
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. The production losses are already significant at moderate levels of regional warming. Here, we found that even an increase of 1 °C can lead to yield losses compared with the yields in the non-warming counterfactual climate condition. Challinor

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>

  <span class="sup">

  </span> and especially in West Africa
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span> are expected with an elevation of 1.5 °C of the global surface temperature above preindustrial levels. Since the most optimistic climate change scenarios do not lead to a warming below 1.5 °C, crop production losses in West Africa appear to be unavoidable without adaptation, and knowledge of the most effective adaptation methods becomes critical. Several adaptation methods that may counteract the adverse effects of climate change were investigated for millet and sorghum in West Africa by Parkes

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Every modelling study has its limitations, and we recognize a few caveats to the design of our simulation experiments. Caution is necessary when interpreting the crop simulation results presented here because the quality of the reported data in the studied region is not as high as that in developed countries, although the FAO statistical database used here is the most reliable, accessible source of information on crop yields. The differences between the reported and simulated data described earlier are mainly due to imperfect modelling and errors in model inputs (this is especially the case for the socioeconomic variables used as the inputs to the CYGMA model) and the assumptions used in the model setup (e.g., the assumptions on management levels used in the SARRA-H model). However, errors in reporting, inadequate sampling in census surveys and data imputation could be other reasons for the differences. Indeed, a notable percentage of the data in the studied region is based on the data imputation at the FAO, with unofficial or unavailable sources (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). For this reason, we used the harvested area data from 2000 obtained from the M3-Crops dataset throughout the studied period. However, FAO data show that the harvested areas of these crops change over time (14.6 M ha to 13.7 M ha for millet and 12.0 M ha to 13.8 M ha for sorghum for the period 2000–2016), which may lead to different production loss estimates. However, crop-specific gridded historical harvested area data are not available.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, our study demonstrates that human activities have already had a significant impact on the regional climate in the Sahel, with negative consequences for the production of major cereals in the region. Our production loss estimates offer a sound basis to depict a more specific view of the costs of adaptation and investments in adaptation in crop production systems in West Africa. These estimates can provide scientific input for national governments and international organizations at international climate negotiations.</p>
