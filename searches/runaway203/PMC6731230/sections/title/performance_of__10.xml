 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reported data for West Africa obtained from the M3-Crops dataset showed that the reported millet yields were almost the same as the sorghum yields (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The yield dataset is solely based on reported yield statistics and represents the average yield circa the year 2000 (that is, the average in 1997–2003). However, the different crop models reproduced the reported data differently. The average yields of millet in 1997–2003 simulated by the CYGMA model were comparable to the reported data in terms of the long-term yield average (the simulated yields are approximately 1 t ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), whereas the SARRA-H model overestimated the millet yields over that region (the simulated yields often exceed 2 t ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). Both crop models overestimated the sorghum yields, especially in northern Nigeria and southern Mali, while only the CYGMA model overestimated those in Burkina Faso.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CYGMA model showed a good match in terms of the regional average yield for millet relative to the reported data (“Raw” in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), while the SARRA-H model led to a substantial overestimation. However, both crop models overestimated the regional average sorghum yields. Post-processing of the simulated yields, such as scaling so that the CYGMA-simulated regional average yield in 1996–2005 would equal one, led to a good agreement between the reported and simulated yields (“Scaled” in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). These results indicate that the simulated regional average yield in absolute terms is less reliable and that the simulated relative changes in yields should be utilized for further analysis.

    <p>Comparison of annual yield time series reported by the FAO and the average yields over West Africa simulated by SARRA-H and CYGMA for millet and sorghum for the period 1961–2012. The regional average data for West Africa were calculated by averaging the data over Benin, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo (country harvested areas were used as the weights). The grid-cell harvested area in 2000 was used as the weight when computing country average yields. Three different metrics were used: 1) the reported and simulated raw yield data were compared without any post-processing (raw); 2) the reported and simulated annual yield data were separately scaled so that each average yield in 1996–2005 was equal to one, and then the data were compared (scaled); and 3) the percentage yield anomalies, relative to the normal yield calculated as the 5-yr running average, were separately computed for the reported and simulated data and then compared (anomaly). The numbers presented in each panel show the correlation coefficient calculated between the reported and simulated data (***, ** and * indicate that the correlation is significant at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively).</p>

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main advantage of the CYGMA model is that it is able to reproduce the historical yield increasing trends, as visually indicated (“Raw” in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). A sensitivity analysis using the CYGMA model revealed that the technological effect (increased use of N fertilizer and improved varieties along with an increase in the knowledge stock) contributed more strongly to the simulated yield trends than the CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). No such trend is simulated with the SARRA-H model, which does not include technological effects nor the CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SARRA-H model outperforms the CYGMA model in reproducing the interannual variability of crop yields. Significant correlation values between the reported and simulated regional average yield anomalies were obtained for both millet and sorghum (R = 0.485 and R = 0.335, respectively; “Anomaly” in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The country-level comparisons reveal that the performance of the SARRA-H model in simulating the yield anomalies of the two crops was relatively good, with significant correlation coefficients in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, three major crop-producing countries in the studied region (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The ability of the SARRA-H model to capture interannual variability is detailed for the 12 countries in Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>. The highest correlation between simulated yield and reported yield is depicted for millet in Senegal (R = 0.77). However, the correlation coefficient was not significant for Nigeria, the top producer of sorghum and the 3
  <span class="sup">rd</span> largest producer of millet in the region (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Therefore, if we remove the data in Nigeria when calculating regional average yield anomalies, the correlation values between the reported and simulated yields increase to 0.686 for millet and 0.533 for sorghum (figure not shows). The best correlations are obtained when rainfall and/or temperature during the growing seasons are correlated with the reported FAO yields (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>), i.e., when the observed yield variability is explained by climate factors. However, the SARRA-H model generally outperforms the correlation between the reported FAO yield and rainfall and/or temperature, which shows the added value of having a process-based model compared to simple linear statistics. The performance of the CYGMA model in simulating the yield anomalies of millet and sorghum was lower than that of the SARRA-H model in most cases.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results suggested that the models evaluated here, although imperfect, had a certain usefulness and complementarity in assessing the climate impacts on yield variability and trends. The CYGMA model accurately reproduces the yield trends, while the SARRA-H model better reproduces year-to-year variability. However, the comparison between reported and simulated country yields in West Africa is difficult partly because – although FAO yield statistics are the best reliable source of information – many data values from the FAO database in the region are derived from data imputation or unofficial data sources (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>), and historical management information is not available.
