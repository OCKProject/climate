  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> were calculated on every land point of each factual and counterfactual ensemble climate simulation (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). These include seasonal characteristics of precipitation (annual amount, number of rainy days, rainfall intensity, onset of the rains), mean surface temperature and extreme indices with heavy precipitation indices and one hot day index. Each index is averaged across West Africa (20°W to 15°E; 4°N to 18°N). The robustness of the change of an index between the factual and counterfactual climate simulations, on the basis of the models’ ensemble, is assessed with statistical tests. First, we average each of the 100 members of the factual and counterfactual ensemble climate simulations and test the statistical significance of the change between the two ensemble means over the last decade of the simulation 2000–2009 by means of Student’s t-test. Second, we apply a similar Student’s t-test to compare the factual and counterfactual climate simulations over the reference period 2000–2009, but for each model run individually, paired with the same initial conditions, and we count the number of significant changes at the 5% confidence level. A value of 100 in a climatic index of interest indicates that the factual and counterfactual climate simulations are significantly different in the 100 simulations. Third, we apply a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the 100 factual and 100 counterfactual climate simulations over the reference period 2000–2009 with the null hypothesis that the discrepancies between the two distributions are only due to sampling error. A significance level of 5% indicates that the null hypothesis can be rejected statistically. For Student’s t-test, we count the number of significant changes at the 5% confidence level. Finally, we count the number of cases with consistent change over the reference period 2000–2009 in a climatic index of interest between an ensemble member and the ensemble mean in terms of the sign of change. A value of 100 indicates that all changes in individual runs have the same sign as the change computed with the ensemble mean.
