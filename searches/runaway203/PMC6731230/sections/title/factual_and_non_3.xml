The original climate model simulations of factual and counterfactual climate conditions for the period 1951–2010 are carried out using the Meteorological Research Institute Atmospheric General Circulation Model, version 3.2 (MRI-AGCM3.2) with a grid interval of 60 km

  </span>. The factual climate simulation represents actual climate conditions that are influenced by both human activities and natural forcing. Observed changes in sea surface temperature, sea ice, greenhouse gas concentration, ozone, anthropogenic aerosol burdens (sulfate, black carbon and organic carbon), volcanic sulfate aerosol loading and natural aerosol loading (sea salt and dust) are considered in the factual climate simulation. Variations in solar irradiance are not considered in the simulation. The non-warming counterfactual climate simulation represents a pre-industrial climate that lacks appreciable human influences on global climate systems. The sea surface temperature and sea ice are both detrended, as are greenhouse gas concentration in 1850, anthropogenic aerosol and volcanic sulfate aerosol in 1850 and ozone concentration in 1961, which are used in the counterfactual climate simulation. Each type of climate simulation has 100 ensemble members associated with small perturbations in sea surface temperature that represent observational uncertainties. Additional details on the setup of the climate model and simulations are available in Mizuta
