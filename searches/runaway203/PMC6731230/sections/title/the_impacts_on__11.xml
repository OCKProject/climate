 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simulated impacts on average yields in 2000–2009 due to historical climate change varied by location and between the two crop models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Although some positive impacts are simulated by the CYGMA model in the south of West Africa, negative yield impacts appeared in many parts of West Africa for both millet and sorghum. Both crop models simulate a strong crop yield loss in the northern part of the Sahel (north of 14°N), exceeding 50% in some locations. This tendency is common across millet and sorghum and consistent between CYGMA and SARRA-H.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated average yield impacts in the recent decade (2000–2009) due to historical climate change, relative to a counterfactual climate condition, appeared to be negative for all major crop-producing countries in West Africa (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). Millet appears to be more affected by climate change than sorghum in the two crop models. On average, across West Africa, the SARRA-H model simulates a yield loss of 17.7% for millet and 15.0% for sorghum. The CYGMA model simulates a slightly weaker impact, with a yield loss of 10.9% for millet and 5.9% for sorghum. When we consider the five major crop-producing countries (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>), the highest production losses are estimated in Niger (sorghum), Senegal (millet) and Mali (millet). Important production losses are also expected in other countries, such as Benin and the Gambia (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>).

    <p>Estimated impacts on the average annual yield and average production of millet and sorghum in 2000–2009 for selected major crop-producing countries in West Africa. The impacts were measured as the difference between the factual and counterfactual crop simulations. Harvested area weighting was considered when computing country and West Africa average yield impacts. Box plots indicate the mean (cross), with 25 to 75% (box) and 5 to 95% (vertical line) confidence intervals derived from ensemble members of the crop simulation. The horizontal lines indicate the median. The regional average data for West Africa were calculated by averaging the data over Benin, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. The range of simulated yield change was limited to the interval from −100% to +100% to avoid unrealistically large yield impacts in locations where the current yield is very low.</p>

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the grid-cell harvested area in 2000 and the country average producer prices in 2000–2009, we estimated that the average annual production losses over West Africa in 2000–2009 associated with historical climate change simulated by SARRA-H account for 2.99 billion USD for millet and 1.89 billion USD for sorghum (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). These losses are lower when the CYGMA model was used and account for 1.65 billion USD for millet and 0.69 billion USD for sorghum. Although all of the simulations lead to economic losses in West Africa, the uncertainty persists. Using the CYGMA model, the 90% probability interval of the estimated sorghum production losses calculated across the 100 ensemble members, which represents the uncertainty of the internal climate variability, ranged from 0.12 to 1.42 billion USD. For millet, the estimates ranged from the production loss of 4.05 billon USD to the production gain of 0.38 billion USD. Using the SARRA-H model, the production loss estimates for sorghum varied from 3.64 to 0.79 billion USD for sorghum and from 6.07 to 0.81 billion USD for millet. The most important economic losses are expected in Nigeria and Niger partly because of the relatively large extent of their harvested area for millet and sorghum.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This production loss is mainly driven by the temperature change between the factual and the counterfactual climate simulations, whose spatial pattern (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>) is similar to the pattern of yield change (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>); the highest production losses are located in the northern Sahel, where the warming is more intense. The relationship between temperature change and yield change is particularly clear when the SARRA-H model is used (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>). A negative linear relationship is found between simulated yield change and temperature change. A warming above 1 °C is associated with yield losses in almost all simulations of millet and sorghum, and the warmest simulations lead to the highest yield losses. Although no significant change on simulated rainfall is found, on average, in West Africa, variations of rainfall can also have an impact on SARRA-H-simulated yield change and have the potential to exacerbate or mitigate the yield impact depending on whether the rainfall decreases or increases. However, there are only a few simulations showing production gain even with rainfall increase. This confirms the results of Salack
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>, who showed that rainfall increase did not completely compensate for the effect of temperature increase (+1.5 °C) but greatly mitigated the impacts of warming (−59% and −26% for decreasing and increasing rainfall, respectively). The relative effects of temperature and rainfall changes on crop yield impacts are also discussed by Roudier 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span> and Schlenker and Lobell
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>, who also noted the dominant role of temperature increase in the estimation of the impact of climate change on crop yield in Africa. However, there are uncertainties in the estimated climate-yield relationship across the two models SARRA-H and CYGMA. Indeed, although the CYGMA-simulated yields decrease with warming and increase with increasing precipitation, the slope is weaker (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>), which might explain why the simulated yield impacts are lower in CYGMA than in SARRA-H.

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To better understand the production changes in the processes represented in the crop models, a sensitivity analysis was performed with the CYGMA model, which simulates more processes affecting crop yields (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>) and has more flexibility. The results (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>) suggest that CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization and technological improvement are insufficient to offset the increased heat stress and water stress under factual conditions. The water deficit stress most largely contributed to the yield impact, likely through increased evapotranspiration since no significant trend in growing season rainfall was detected (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). A direct effect of warming, such as heat stress, is also found, but its contribution to the yield impact is smaller than that of the indirect effect. Interestingly, although the SARRA-H model includes fewer processes and does not include heat stress, it leads to crop yield losses similarly to CYGMA. This consistency might imply that mechanisms commonly considered in the two models cause yield and production losses. Increased evapotranspiration-led water deficit was found to be the largest contributing factor in CYGMA (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>) and in SARRA-H in a previous study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, in addition to shortened crop duration with increased temperatures. However, CYGMA-based yield and production losses are almost always smaller than the SARRA-H-based yield and losses (an exception is millet in Senegal). One explanation is that the SARRA-H model overestimates the effect of climate on crop yield compared to the CYGMA model or the reported yields from the FAO (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>) and thus might exacerbate the effect of altered climate conditions. In addition, technological effects (use of varieties that are more tolerant to suboptimal conditions and have larger thermal requirements) and CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effects are considered in CYGMA but not in SARRA-H and alter the yield response (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>).
