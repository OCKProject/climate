  </span>. Climate change poses an additional burden, especially for developing countries, in achieving food security goals when the population is rapidly increasing; therefore, yield improvement is necessary to meet the increasing demand for food. Food security is a high-priority development goal for national governments in food insecure regions, such as West Africa, as well as for the United Nations (as declared in Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals). However, in the recent literature on the consequences of an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and associated climate change on crop yields in West Africa

  </span>, several studies estimate possible crop yield losses with adverse impacts on food security in the next decades, although the extent of these losses remains uncertain

  </span> have been found to be the most promising technical options amongst a large variety of realistic adaptation options for the production of sorghum and millet (late sowing, increased planting density, fertilizer use and water harvesting and use of cultivars with larger thermal time requirements and greater resilience to heat stress). However, we lack knowledge on the crop production losses induced by climate change, which is a basis for exploring how much adaptation of production systems to specific crop costs, although some estimates of aggregated adaptation costs for agriculture at the continental or global level are available

  </span>. More specific estimates of such losses are useful to lead to a better understanding of the relative importance of adaptation to other political issues and are crucial for the optimal prioritization of adaptation investments for supporting adaptation strategies in West Africa that may counteract the adverse effects of climate change.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study aims to estimate the average crop production losses of millet and sorghum, two major crops in West Africa, due to human-induced climate change during the last decade 2000–2009. Since the potentially adverse effects of climatic changes are superimposed on top of high natural climate variability and technical and crop management improvements, we design a modelling framework that is able to estimate the historical yield without accounting for human influence on climate, and we compare this estimate to a more realistic climate simulation including both natural forcing and human activities. We investigate the robustness of the changes in terms of regional climate and crop yields relative to these non-warming counterfactual climate conditions using a large ensemble of 100 climate simulations to sample the internal variability of climate and two process-based crop models to quantify the uncertainty in the response of crop yield to climate change. Crop price data are then used to quantify the financial production losses due to human-induced climate warming. It is expected that our estimates can offer a sound basis to depict a more specific view of the adaptation costs in crop production systems in that region.</p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the next section, we introduce the experimental setup, the bias-corrected ensemble simulation of a climate model (MRI-AGCM3.2) and the two crop models (SARRA-H and CYGMA) used in this study. In section 3, we analyse the simulations by separating (i) the impacts of historical human activities on the regional climate of West Africa and (ii) the impacts on crop yields due to historical climate change. Finally, in section 4, we summarize and discuss our results.</p>
