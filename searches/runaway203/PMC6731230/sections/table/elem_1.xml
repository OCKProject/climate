   <tr>
    <td>Temperature acts on plant development rates through the concept of thermal time</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Temperature has an effect on maintenance respiration</td>
    <td>Temperature affects potential and actual evapotranspiration rates. The daily increment of leaf area and yield are stressed when the actual evapotranspiration is lower than its potential value.</td>

    <td>No cold/heat stress</td>
    <td>Each of heat and cold stresses are modelled as a function of daily mean temperature and used to compute the daily actual increment of leaf area and yield.</td>

    <td>Water deficit defined as a ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration rate is used to compute the daily actual increment of leaf area and yield.</td>

    <td>Rainfall triggers sowing dates, and water stress can lead to sowing failures</td>
    <td>Sowing date is determined according to 10-yr average temperature and moisture conditions. Sowing date is updated every year in the model. A crop-specific look-up table is used to derive the sowing date under a given climate condition.</td>

    <td>Solar radiation impacts potential assimilation rates through the intercepted, photosynthetically active radiation</td>
    <td>Solar radiation affects daily potential increment of crop total biomass. After the modelled heading date, the CYGMA model starts calculating the daily increment of yield based on the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation, CO
     <sub>2</sub> fertilization and fraction of the increment of the total biomass allocated to the harvestable part of a crop.

    <td>Cultivar choice</td>
    <td>The total thermal requirement of a crop that represents the cultivar’s characteristics on crop duration changes depending on the 10-yr average temperature condition and is updated every year in the model.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>No technology improvements</td>
    <td>The nitrogen application rate increases with changes in per capita GDP and per capita agricultural area. The crop’s tolerance to suboptimal conditions (nitrogen deficit, heat, cold, water deficit, and water excess) increases with changes in per capita GDP, GDP share of agriculture value added and total R&amp;D expenditure (these are used to calculate agricultural knowledge stock), which represents the use of high-yielding technology and management.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Only rainfed condition is assumed</td>
    <td>Yields in rainfed and irrigated conditions are separately simulated, and their area-weighted average is then computed. Because there is almost no irrigated area in West Africa, the millet and sorghum yields in West Africa simulated by the CYGMA model represent those in the rainfed condition.</td>
