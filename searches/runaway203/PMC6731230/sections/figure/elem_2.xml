  <p>Comparison of annual yield time series reported by the FAO and the average yields over West Africa simulated by SARRA-H and CYGMA for millet and sorghum for the period 1961–2012. The regional average data for West Africa were calculated by averaging the data over Benin, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo (country harvested areas were used as the weights). The grid-cell harvested area in 2000 was used as the weight when computing country average yields. Three different metrics were used: 1) the reported and simulated raw yield data were compared without any post-processing (raw); 2) the reported and simulated annual yield data were separately scaled so that each average yield in 1996–2005 was equal to one, and then the data were compared (scaled); and 3) the percentage yield anomalies, relative to the normal yield calculated as the 5-yr running average, were separately computed for the reported and simulated data and then compared (anomaly). The numbers presented in each panel show the correlation coefficient calculated between the reported and simulated data (***, ** and * indicate that the correlation is significant at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively).</p>
