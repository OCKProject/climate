  <p>Estimated impacts on the average annual yield and average production of millet and sorghum in 2000–2009 for selected major crop-producing countries in West Africa. The impacts were measured as the difference between the factual and counterfactual crop simulations. Harvested area weighting was considered when computing country and West Africa average yield impacts. Box plots indicate the mean (cross), with 25 to 75% (box) and 5 to 95% (vertical line) confidence intervals derived from ensemble members of the crop simulation. The horizontal lines indicate the median. The regional average data for West Africa were calculated by averaging the data over Benin, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. The range of simulated yield change was limited to the interval from −100% to +100% to avoid unrealistically large yield impacts in locations where the current yield is very low.</p>
