  <p>Geographical patterns of the reported and simulated average yields of millet and sorghum circa in 2000 across West Africa. The reported data were obtained from the M3Crops dataset

   </span>. Both crop models SARRA-H and CYGMA used the same forcing dataset S14FD. For SARRA-H outputs, only locations where the individual crops were harvested were shown. For consistent comparison with the M3Crop-reported data, the simulated annual yields for the period 1997â€“2003 were averaged and then compared.
