 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food security, according to Benhin (
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>), is defined as a ‘state that prevails when people have secure access to sufficient nutritious food for normal growth, development, and an active and healthy life’. This explanation is in line with the understanding of other researchers and important institutions that promote food security (DAFF 
  <a rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0015">2014</a>). According to Cracknell (
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2011</a>), greenhouse gas emissions are causing the earth to get warmer.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Warmer temperatures are causing other major changes around the world. Impacts of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere include a rise in weather-related incidents such as floods, droughts, frosts, hailstones and destructive storms; the extinction of countless plant and animal species; the loss of agricultural harvests in vulnerable areas; the changing of agricultural seasons; the melting of glaciers; the disruption of water supplies; the expansion of infectious tropical diseases; the rising of sea levels and much more (Benhin 
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>). One of the sectors most affected by climate change is the agricultural sector as it is dependent on environmental stability in terms of water supply, atmospheric temperatures, soil fertility and the incidents of pests and disease (Benhin 
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The negative effects of climate change affect smallholder farmers which directly has an impact on food security. Furthermore, the people most vulnerable to climate change impacts are communities in developing countries, given their low or compromised resilience levels to climate change (Cohen et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2008</a>). Communities in developing countries have limited financial and technical resources to support climate adaptation and mitigation (Benhin 
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>). Smallholder farmers in rural areas, such as the tea farmers in Kenya, will be severely affected unless action is taken now to ensure that they are aware of the impacts of climate change and are supported to address these impacts using locally appropriate solutions (Cohen et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change has significant impact on agriculture, especially on those crops that are dependent on consistent climatic conditions; hence, it affects food security (Vink &amp; Tergurtha 
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">n.d.</a>); it also causes the growing season to be shortened, resulting in disastrous failure (Benhin 
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>). Thus, smallholder farmers who depend on agriculture may experience food shortages. It is important to note that leadership in the two departments of Local Government and the Department of Economic Opportunities responsible for Economic Development and Tourism have acknowledged and agreed that ‘extreme weather events are threatening food security and economic growth’ (Western Cape Department of Agriculture 
  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2016</a>:7). This paper argues that action needs to be taken to mitigate the impact of climate change in the Western Cape Province.
