 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is evident that climate change is one of the biggest challenges that humanity is facing both in the Western Cape Province and internationally. It was evident that extension advisors did not have sufficient knowledge of climate change, including its causes. The findings indicated that humans also cause climate change; hence, it is important that humans should be made aware of the concept of climate change and its impacts so that they can adopt climate smart farming techniques and practices. This research was conducted in the spirit of equipping extension advisors to take note of it in order to promote adaptation and mitigation measures.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper discussed the findings and specifically made reference to crops and livestock that indicate how the Western Cape has been affected by climate change, especially during the 2015 and 2016 drought. The article concluded by listing some of the mitigation steps that need to be considered in both crop and livestock production. Based on the findings, it is recommended that measures of mitigation should be adopted towards food security and these include the following:</p>
 <div list-type="bullet" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>breeding livestock that are adaptable to the environment</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>adopting precise farming strategies as pronounced in the climate change reports of the Western Cape like the policy of climate change of the Western Cape</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>minimising environmental degradation like burning of organic materials because gases affect the atmospheric layer that serves as a protection against ultraviolet rays; furthermore, human beings should refrain from injudicious use of irrigation water and fertilisers; avoid overgrazing; keep the correct size of the herd; and not burn organic matter but rather adapt other practices like composting</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>managing the manure of the animals and using adaptable seeds from crop breeding</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>low-income people, who depend on vulnerable subsistence agriculture, should be assisted with the correct measures</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>promoting climate research uptake among extension officers so that they can contribute to the body of knowledge that will mitigate or adapt to climate change</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>developing more drought-resistant dry land crops and pastures for dairy consumption and adopting more effective and environmentally friendly farming practices</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>conducting education and sensitisation workshops for extension advisors to enable them to fight the effects of climate change at local and regional levels.</p>
