  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conceptualisation and contextualisation of climate change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the concept of climate change is critical because many researchers forget to include climate variability and report on climate change as if it is something happening within a short timeframe. Scientists speak about climate change as changes that take place (where) over a long period, and one needs to have records to measure the changes that took place (IPCC 
   <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">2007</a>). In the absence of records, one has to include climate variability; for example, Afful (
   <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2016</a>) used the concept of climate variability in his conceptualisation and discussion of the extension competency in climate change. There is a need to differentiate between climate change and variability. According to WIRED UK (
   <a rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0037">2018</a>), climate change is a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by burning fossil fuels, which add heat-trapping gases to the earth’s atmosphere. These phenomena include the increased temperature trends described by global warming, which also encompass changes such as sea-level rise; ice mass loss in Greenland, Antarctica, the Arctic and mountain glaciers worldwide; shifts in flower/plant blooming; and extreme events. Other authors view the definition from a different perspective; for example, climate change in the IPCC (
   <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">2007</a>) refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period of time, typically decades or longer. It refers to any change in climate over time, whether caused by natural variability or as a result of human activity. This definition provides a comprehensive insight; for example, it was reported that the gradual yet dramatic disappearance of the glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro is a result of climate change (350Africa.org). The glaciers act as a water tower and several rivers are now drying up. It is estimated that 82% of the ice that capped the mountain, when it was first recorded in 1912, is now gone (350Africa.org).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate has always been changing naturally; the current impact of human activities is causing the climate to change in an unnatural way and at a faster pace than ever before (Shabangu 
   <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">2017</a>). This unnatural and human-induced climate change is problematic as it is causing shifts in the normal climatic conditions such as rainfall and temperature, which, in turn, are placing pressure on the planet’s natural environment and have negative impacts on people and their livelihoods (Benhin 
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>). The question that is asked is the following: what is drought and whether it is caused by climate change or not? According to the Western Cape Government (
   <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">2017</a>), there are four types of drought. The first one is meteorological drought: this is an extended period during which less than a certain amount of the normal (long-term average) rainfall is received over a large area.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second one is hydrological drought: the impact of a reduction in rainfall on natural and artificial surface water resources. Furthermore, this type of drought occurs when there is a deficit in surface runoff below normal conditions or when there is normal depletion of groundwater supplies. Hydrological drought reduces the supply of water for irrigation and other household and industrial uses. The third one is agricultural drought: a reduction in water availability below the optimal level required by a crop during each different growth stage, resulting in impaired growth and reduced yields. Agricultural drought relates to an imbalance in water content of the soil during the growing season. The fourth one is the socio-economic drought: the impact of drought on human activities, including both indirect and direct impacts. It relates to institutional economic decision-making. Socio-economic drought occurs when demand for freshwater exceeds supply (Western Cape Government 
   <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">2017</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These drought scenarios were explained in the government communication for farmers, alerting them of what to expect in the Western Cape. There was an argument as to which stage can be declared as a disaster. It is the writers’ view that all the municipalities are affected and as such the situation of drought and climate change affect all areas of the Western Cape, for example, the water rationing, especially in the city of Cape Town, is a case in point.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="s20006" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Causes of climate change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies show that there is no single factor that causes climate change. Indications from literature are that both humans and non-humans can cause climate change (Cracknell 
   <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2011</a>; Shabangu 
   <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">2017</a>). Humans could be engaged in activities that increase the amount of heat-trapping gases in the earth’s atmosphere, a phenomenon called ‘greenhouse gases’. According to Cracknell (
   <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2011</a>), greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere and are important as they make the earth’s temperature warm enough for life to exist. Without these heat-trapping gases, the planet would be far too cold, making it uninhabitable.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, as humans increase the amount of these gases in the atmosphere, more and more heat is trapped, which, in turn, is causing the climate to change. Human activities release a range of greenhouse gases; however, there are four major gases that cause climate change: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. Carbon dioxide, according to Cracknell (
   <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2011</a>), is the major global contributor to climate change and is released through the burning of fossil fuels (oil, coal and gas) and the removal of biomass, especially through deforestation in the tropical regions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second most important greenhouse gas is methane. The high emissions of methane arise from agricultural activities and practices, in particular, from the management of manure and the decomposition of organic waste. It is important to indicate that the mismanagement of manure may result in releasing more gases into the atmosphere. These gases are known to be promoting climate change.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third key greenhouse gas is nitrous oxide, which is also released during agricultural activities, mainly through the application of nitrogen fertilisers, depending on the type of fertilisers that are being used; some fertilisers can contribute to climate change, for example, nitrogen fertilisers can decompose under anaerobic conditions to produce a gas known as nitric oxide, which can escape into the atmosphere to cause havoc, thereby destroying the cover of the atmosphere. The final category of greenhouse gas is fluorinated gases; these are emitted during industrial processes but have a minimal impact compared to other gases (Aydinalp &amp; Cresser 
   <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">2008</a>; Cracknell 
   <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2011</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following livestock were reported: 493 380 herd of cattle in February 2004; the Western Cape accounted for just 3.6% of the national herd, although its 2 979 410 sheep make up a more substantial 10.6%. The region also has 239 757 pigs (15.3%) and 244 915 goats (3.7%). The industry is both extensive and field-based (cattle and sheep), or intensive and based on grain feeds (poultry and pigs) (Vink &amp; Tregurtha 
   <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">n.d.</a>). Furthermore, there are 1267 milk producers in the Western Cape (Vink &amp; Tregurtha 
   <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">n.d.</a>), and the management of manure becomes important. It should be understood that no matter how little these gasses are produced by livestock, the potential to contribute to damaging the atmospheric layer serving as a cause of climate change exists in the Western Cape based on the numbers of the livestock.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implications of greenhouse gases to food security</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food security, according to Benhin (
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>), is defined as a ‘state that prevails when people have secure access to sufficient nutritious food for normal growth, development, and an active and healthy life’. This explanation is in line with the understanding of other researchers and important institutions that promote food security (DAFF 
   <a rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0015">2014</a>). According to Cracknell (
   <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2011</a>), greenhouse gas emissions are causing the earth to get warmer.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Warmer temperatures are causing other major changes around the world. Impacts of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere include a rise in weather-related incidents such as floods, droughts, frosts, hailstones and destructive storms; the extinction of countless plant and animal species; the loss of agricultural harvests in vulnerable areas; the changing of agricultural seasons; the melting of glaciers; the disruption of water supplies; the expansion of infectious tropical diseases; the rising of sea levels and much more (Benhin 
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>). One of the sectors most affected by climate change is the agricultural sector as it is dependent on environmental stability in terms of water supply, atmospheric temperatures, soil fertility and the incidents of pests and disease (Benhin 
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The negative effects of climate change affect smallholder farmers which directly has an impact on food security. Furthermore, the people most vulnerable to climate change impacts are communities in developing countries, given their low or compromised resilience levels to climate change (Cohen et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2008</a>). Communities in developing countries have limited financial and technical resources to support climate adaptation and mitigation (Benhin 
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>). Smallholder farmers in rural areas, such as the tea farmers in Kenya, will be severely affected unless action is taken now to ensure that they are aware of the impacts of climate change and are supported to address these impacts using locally appropriate solutions (Cohen et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2008</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change has significant impact on agriculture, especially on those crops that are dependent on consistent climatic conditions; hence, it affects food security (Vink &amp; Tergurtha 
   <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">n.d.</a>); it also causes the growing season to be shortened, resulting in disastrous failure (Benhin 
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>). Thus, smallholder farmers who depend on agriculture may experience food shortages. It is important to note that leadership in the two departments of Local Government and the Department of Economic Opportunities responsible for Economic Development and Tourism have acknowledged and agreed that ‘extreme weather events are threatening food security and economic growth’ (Western Cape Department of Agriculture 
   <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2016</a>:7). This paper argues that action needs to be taken to mitigate the impact of climate change in the Western Cape Province.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impact of climate change on crop production</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change and climate variability present a negative influence on crop production (Afful 
   <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2016</a>). In areas, for example, where irrigation is insufficient, crops wither and die, thus reducing the yield. The reduced yield could further mean reduced profit and increased poverty. However, certain steps need to be taken to mitigate climate change and improve crop production. The following mitigation could be adopted. It has also been found that climate change affects crops by spreading new types of diseases that were not there in the past (Cohen et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2008</a>). Such diseases and pests might be difficult to control because of a lack of registered pest control remedies.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The outbreak of the fall armyworm in South Africa, for example, presented new challenges and caused havoc to the farmers in the beginning of 2017 (M. Motupa [Limpopo Department of Agriculture, Gravelot Service Centre] pers. comm., 18 April 2017). As far as the Western Cape is concerned, the drought and heat affected fruit quality (e.g. size, sunburn, colour and storage ability) in the 2016 and 2017 season, and the demand has decreased in key markets; therefore, the export share is expected to decrease by 4.2%. A similar trend was observed in terms of vegetable production, and one tomato firm was closed down because of climate change (Western Cape Government 
   <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">2017</a>). In the Ceres region, 50% fewer onions and 80% fewer potatoes were planted because of a lack of water. The reduced production could be translated to a R40-million loss in wages to seasonal workers (Agri Western Cape, 20 September 2017) cited by the Western Cape Government (
   <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">2017</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mitigation measures for crop production</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is very important that crops should be adapted to the agricultural environment in the wake of climate change. Research can make a contribution in the breeding of new climate-tolerant crop varieties to suit the changing climate patterns (source). Historical and current breeding practices and experience indicate that natural biodiversity within crops has allowed for plant adaptation to different conditions, providing clear evidence that plant breeding has great potential to support adaptation of crops to climate change (IPCC 
   <a rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0017">1996</a>). The development of a cropping system that can also be seen as another measure can help agriculture in the Western Cape to adapt to a changing climate (Vink 
   <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">2003</a>). It has been found that where crop mixtures were used, there has been positive results in terms of output because if several crops are growing at one time, this can help systems exhibit greater durability during periods of high water or heat stress (IPCC 
   <a rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0017">1996</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Davies (
   <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">2014</a>), the Government of the Western Cape adopted a climate change response strategy that, among others, focussed on food security. Some of the strategies included exploring alternative crops and testing them under drought conditions, conservation farming practices, crop rotation, more efficient use of water, renewable energy farm planning, and monitoring of plant and soil changes. It is true that climate-related disasters pose significant challenges to the agricultural sector of the Western Cape. There is doubt that if this is not addressed adequately, the intensification of disaster risks associated with climate change have the potential to undermine the productivity and resilience of this sector.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impacts also extend significantly into the wider provincial economy. It is for this reason that the Government of the Western Cape has developed a drought response strategy in which mitigation issues have been implemented. The Government of the Western Cape has rolled out a wide range of support actions in partnership with industry organisations and Agri Western Cape; for example, it provided drought support (mainly feed provision) to stock farmers, and the Avian Influenza epidemic had been well managed (Government of Western Cape 2017).</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impact of drought on livestock production</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought knows no size of farming; it affects both smallholder and large-scale farming. This was confirmed by Swart in 2016 who presented in the AGRA (Agricultural forum consisting of role players called to discuss drought situation) dialogue on drought, who reported that all categories of farmers were affected by climate change. There was not sufficient fodder for their livestock within the commercial farming sector, and livestock were given potato seedlings to graze on because they were not being sold because of the drought (Swart 
   <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">2016</a>). While it is argued that climate change is causing havoc in livestock, Rust and Rust (
   <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2013</a>) observed that some of the problems in livestock cooperatives were caused by conflicts resulting from poor leadership or the development of opportunistic ideas by individual members of the cooperatives. It is important that leadership should take advantage when policies are pronounced to help the farmers. Experience showed that selfishness does not help. Farmers need to be organised to fight the scourge of drought as a team rather than by competing with each other.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change will affect animal production in different ways. Rust and Rust (
   <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2013</a>) identified four ways: changes in livestock feed, grain availability and price challenges, the impact on livestock pastures and forage crop production and quality of feed changes in livestock diseases and pests, and the direct effects of extreme weather events on animal health, growth and reproduction. Furthermore, the indirect effects of climate-driven change in animal production may result mainly from alterations in the nutritional environment. Research indicates that changes in climate, to a large extent, will affect the quality and quantity of forage (Topp &amp; Doyle 
   <a rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0026">1996</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of climate change may result in the deterioration of pasture, towards lesser quality, which, in turn, will affect the quality of animals; hence, the meat quality will also be affected. Sometimes the quality of meat may be affected by infected feed that the animals eat (Rust &amp; Rust 
   <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2013</a>). Changes in temperature and rainfall may result in the spread of disease and parasites creeping into new regions, or an increase in the incidence of pests and diseases. Pests and diseases reduce animal productivity and increase animal mortality (Baker &amp; Viglizzo 
   <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">1998</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other changes include heat stress which, according to Fuquay (
   <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">1981</a>), has various detrimental effects on livestock. In the dairy herd, climate change will result in a decrease in fodder production from dry land and irrigated pastures, resulting in the rise in feed costs (Rust &amp; Rust 
   <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As far as monogastric animals are concerned, they emit gases that if not managed will go into the atmosphere and destroy the layer that protects the intense heat from destroying the environment and human beings. Poultry meat and egg production are the most efficient animal protein production systems (Rust &amp; Rust 
   <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2013</a>). Poultry meat production is the most environmentally efficient (smallest carbon footprint per unit product produced), followed by pork and mutton (primarily lamb) with beef the least efficient (Williams, Audsley &amp; Sandars 
   <a rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0036">2006</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of the emissions can be reduced by using various housing techniques that have been developed to reduce emissions. A combination of housing and feeding measures seems most promising to achieve a substantial reduction in emissions at a relatively low cost (Van der Peet-Schwering et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0027">1999</a>). As far as the Western Cape is concerned, livestock farmers are among the hardest hit by the drought. An estimated 30 000 cattle have been sold as farmers were unable to feed their herds. The impacts of the drought in the summer rainfall region on beef cattle herds, with high numbers of animals slaughtered, have been reported (Government of Western Cape 2017).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impact of climate change on water sources for irrigation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change affects water for irrigation (Benhin 
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>). It was also proved in the farmer’s perception that climate change is a reality in the Western Cape. For example, 50% of the sample interviewed by Benhin (
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>) observed that the climate is becoming drier and hotter, the winter season has shortened and the rain is coming later than expected. 
   <span class="italic">The Farmers Weekly</span> (2017) reported that in the Western Cape there was a decline in the volume of wine grapes harvested because of a lack of irrigation water (Du Preez 
   <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dam levels have gone down to 30% (Du Preez 
   <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017</a>). It has been found that in other places, like some irrigation schemes such as Krokodilheuvel in the Limpopo province, irrigation has not been effective because it was a furrow system prior to the introduction of the drip and floppy systems of irrigation. It is the writers’ experience that where flood irrigation is used, it has proved to waste more water; hence, it was officially not recommended in the Limpopo province. Drip and sprinkler irrigations were recommended by the Limpopo Head Office (De Witt 
   <a rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0011">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was further reported that farmers in the Western Cape have sold 30 000 cattle because of a lack of feed as a result of drought. The water availability was reported based on the rainfall received in the areas; for example, in 2016 rainfall in September was lower than 50% of the long-term mean in the northern and western parts of the Western Cape. Only the Southern Cape east of the Breede River mouth experienced normal to above-normal rainfall. In October of the same year, most areas had below-normal rainfall, with a few exceptions (Government of Western Cape 2017); this situation provides evidence that climate change is affecting the availability of water.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mitigation for livestock production</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is understood that mitigation is associated with reducing risk of loss from the occurrence of any undesirable event. In general, mitigation means to minimise the degree of any loss or harm (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mitigation" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mitigation</span>). According to the response policy on climate change, mitigation factors imply that steps have to be taken to lessen the impact of climate change (Davies 
   <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">2014</a>; Western Cape Department of Agriculture 
   <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">2014</a>). The Western Cape’s response strategy is a two-pronged process consisting of mitigation and adaptation. In terms of mitigation, it aims at making some contribution to national and global efforts to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build a sustainable low carbon economy in the Western Cape, while simultaneously addressing the need for economic growth, job creation and improving socio-economic conditions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second strategy, namely adaptation, aims to reduce climate vulnerability and develop the adaptive capacity of the Western Cape’s economy, its people, its ecosystems and its critical infrastructure in a manner that simultaneously addresses the province’s socioeconomic and environmental goals. Beef and dairy cattle can contribute to climate change through the greenhouse gasses they emit. On the contrary, beef and dairy cattle are tolerant to heat stress (Rust &amp; Rust 
   <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, in the case of dairy and monogastric animals, the following need to be considered: lowering the concentrations of urea and ammonia in the slurry; lowering the temperature of the slurry; reducing the emitting surface area; and reducing the pH of the slurry (Rust &amp; Rust 
   <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">2013</a>). It is important that we need to be seen taking steps to deal with climate change and not to promote it but to adopt mitigation steps. The Western Cape will need to work and ensure that natural resources are well managed to reduce climate vulnerability. The other area to work on would be to improve resilience and coping capacity within the various communities that are also vulnerable. The other step would be to actively adapt some of the practices to climate change.
