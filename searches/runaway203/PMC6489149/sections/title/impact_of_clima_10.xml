 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change affects water for irrigation (Benhin 
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>). It was also proved in the farmer’s perception that climate change is a reality in the Western Cape. For example, 50% of the sample interviewed by Benhin (
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2006</a>) observed that the climate is becoming drier and hotter, the winter season has shortened and the rain is coming later than expected. 
  <span class="italic">The Farmers Weekly</span> (2017) reported that in the Western Cape there was a decline in the volume of wine grapes harvested because of a lack of irrigation water (Du Preez 
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dam levels have gone down to 30% (Du Preez 
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2017</a>). It has been found that in other places, like some irrigation schemes such as Krokodilheuvel in the Limpopo province, irrigation has not been effective because it was a furrow system prior to the introduction of the drip and floppy systems of irrigation. It is the writers’ experience that where flood irrigation is used, it has proved to waste more water; hence, it was officially not recommended in the Limpopo province. Drip and sprinkler irrigations were recommended by the Limpopo Head Office (De Witt 
  <a rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0011">2010</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was further reported that farmers in the Western Cape have sold 30 000 cattle because of a lack of feed as a result of drought. The water availability was reported based on the rainfall received in the areas; for example, in 2016 rainfall in September was lower than 50% of the long-term mean in the northern and western parts of the Western Cape. Only the Southern Cape east of the Breede River mouth experienced normal to above-normal rainfall. In October of the same year, most areas had below-normal rainfall, with a few exceptions (Government of Western Cape 2017); this situation provides evidence that climate change is affecting the availability of water.</p>
