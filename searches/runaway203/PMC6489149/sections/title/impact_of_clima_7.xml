 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change and climate variability present a negative influence on crop production (Afful 
  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2016</a>). In areas, for example, where irrigation is insufficient, crops wither and die, thus reducing the yield. The reduced yield could further mean reduced profit and increased poverty. However, certain steps need to be taken to mitigate climate change and improve crop production. The following mitigation could be adopted. It has also been found that climate change affects crops by spreading new types of diseases that were not there in the past (Cohen et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2008</a>). Such diseases and pests might be difficult to control because of a lack of registered pest control remedies.

Motupa [Limpopo Department of Agriculture, Gravelot Service Centre] pers. comm., 18 April 2017). As far as the Western Cape is concerned, the drought and heat affected fruit quality (e.g. size, sunburn, colour and storage ability) in the 2016 and 2017 season, and the demand has decreased in key markets; therefore, the export share is expected to decrease by 4.2%. A similar trend was observed in terms of vegetable production, and one tomato firm was closed down because of climate change (Western Cape Government 
  <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">2017</a>). In the Ceres region, 50% fewer onions and 80% fewer potatoes were planted because of a lack of water. The reduced production could be translated to a R40-million loss in wages to seasonal workers (Agri Western Cape, 20 September 2017) cited by the Western Cape Government (
