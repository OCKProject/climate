 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies show that there is no single factor that causes climate change. Indications from literature are that both humans and non-humans can cause climate change (Cracknell 
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2011</a>; Shabangu 
  <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">2017</a>). Humans could be engaged in activities that increase the amount of heat-trapping gases in the earth’s atmosphere, a phenomenon called ‘greenhouse gases’. According to Cracknell (
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2011</a>), greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere and are important as they make the earth’s temperature warm enough for life to exist. Without these heat-trapping gases, the planet would be far too cold, making it uninhabitable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, as humans increase the amount of these gases in the atmosphere, more and more heat is trapped, which, in turn, is causing the climate to change. Human activities release a range of greenhouse gases; however, there are four major gases that cause climate change: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. Carbon dioxide, according to Cracknell (
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2011</a>), is the major global contributor to climate change and is released through the burning of fossil fuels (oil, coal and gas) and the removal of biomass, especially through deforestation in the tropical regions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second most important greenhouse gas is methane. The high emissions of methane arise from agricultural activities and practices, in particular, from the management of manure and the decomposition of organic waste. It is important to indicate that the mismanagement of manure may result in releasing more gases into the atmosphere. These gases are known to be promoting climate change.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third key greenhouse gas is nitrous oxide, which is also released during agricultural activities, mainly through the application of nitrogen fertilisers, depending on the type of fertilisers that are being used; some fertilisers can contribute to climate change, for example, nitrogen fertilisers can decompose under anaerobic conditions to produce a gas known as nitric oxide, which can escape into the atmosphere to cause havoc, thereby destroying the cover of the atmosphere. The final category of greenhouse gas is fluorinated gases; these are emitted during industrial processes but have a minimal impact compared to other gases (Aydinalp &amp; Cresser 
  <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">2008</a>; Cracknell 
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following livestock were reported: 493 380 herd of cattle in February 2004; the Western Cape accounted for just 3.6% of the national herd, although its 2 979 410 sheep make up a more substantial 10.6%. The region also has 239 757 pigs (15.3%) and 244 915 goats (3.7%). The industry is both extensive and field-based (cattle and sheep), or intensive and based on grain feeds (poultry and pigs) (Vink &amp; Tregurtha 
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">n.d.</a>). Furthermore, there are 1267 milk producers in the Western Cape (Vink &amp; Tregurtha 
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">n.d.</a>), and the management of manure becomes important. It should be understood that no matter how little these gasses are produced by livestock, the potential to contribute to damaging the atmospheric layer serving as a cause of climate change exists in the Western Cape based on the numbers of the livestock.
