 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is little understanding about the concept of climate change and how this phenomenon affects smallholder farmers in the Western Cape Province. Climate change has negative impacts on crops and animals, resulting in food insecurity. Given the yearly reduced crop and livestock yields, farmers and communities in the Western Cape have been baffled by a number of questions that point to their lack of understanding of the concept of climate change and variability. The major question is the following: what strategies can be adopted to mitigate climate challenges? The impact of climate change has been reported by a number of studies, people, government departments and non-state actors.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The evidence and impacts of climate change in the Western Cape are largely highlighted in the studies by Shabangu (
  <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">2017</a>); IPCC (
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">2007</a>) and the Government of the Western Cape (
  <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">2014</a>). Agricultural extension services become a must in the drive to increase food production. Such services provide knowledge and advice to primary food producers and facilitate awareness on the changes that occur in the environment and how such changes affect production of food in the Western Cape. This article sought to conceptualise climate change and variability as it affects smallholder farmers in the Western Cape. The impact of climate change on water sources, livestock and crops is highlighted and mitigation strategies are recommended.
