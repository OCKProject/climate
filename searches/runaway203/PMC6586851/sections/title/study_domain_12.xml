  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) and is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal to the East and the Indian peninsula to the west. The region has a tropical climate resulting in high surface temperature during the months of April and May even leading to heat waves. On a climatological basis, most of the state has a mean temperature &gt;26 °C annually with lower temperatures observed over high altitude locations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Odisha experiences an annual average rainfall of ~1500 mm primarily from the south-west monsoon during June to September
