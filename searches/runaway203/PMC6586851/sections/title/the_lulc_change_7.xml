 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis reveals that the largest LULC changes occur over the NE part of the state (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>) which shows the number of pixels that have undergone a change from the earlier classification (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>) at a spatial resolution of 10 km. This was necessary due to heterogeneous land use and land cover change in the region and also to highlight the spatial extent of these changes better. We have therefore not specifically targeted any land use/cover type, but only investigated the land cover change during the study period. Therefore, the change analysis refers to those areas (number of pixels) where land has undergone change over the period 2004 to 2010. Overall, we find that the LULC change map matches well with the OMR trends shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a> during the recent decade since 2001. This provides us an independent confirmation that the OMR and its spatial pattern is due to temperature changes associated with LULC change. Now, the question is what caused these LULC changes? We therefore quantified individual LULC classes and their changes. It is found that there is a decrease in green vegetation over the state of Odisha (Supplementary Information, Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). We also carried out a detailed analysis to understand changes of different land use categories using the Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) datasets between the periods 2004 to 2010 which coincides with the latest decade discussed in previous sections. Our analysis reveals (Supplementary Information, Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>, Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>) that Rabi Crop (October to March) cultivation has increased (~97%) over the state of Odisha during 2004 to 2010. This has occurred at the cost of decrease in the Kharif Crops (July to October) showing agricultural diversification and changing cropping patterns

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. The largest changes are associated with vegetation (Kharif, Rabi crops, Fallow lands, Grasslands, Plantations etc.). Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a> details the individual changes (in terms of area &amp; percentages) to each LULC class. Several studies have also revealed the role of agriculture in changing the vegetation pattern thereby altering the characteristics of local meteorological parameters

  </span>. Our analysis using the NDVI for the period (2001 to 2010) further reveals consistent patterns, with large decrease in vegetation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>) especially over the eastern part of the state.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This further confirms that the change in surface temperature are mostly a consequence of LULC change which is also evidenced by our change analysis using satellite based land cover classification. It may be mentioned that the change in NDVI pattern also coincides with the OMR pattern and LULC change pattern. These multiple line of evidences support the notion that the LULC change is associated with the changes to green cover and is related to vegetation or cropping patterns.</p>
