 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The surface temperatures are increasing globally as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change. However, it is known that observed changes are a result of both climate forcing and numerous other feedbacks including LULC. The LULC could change as a response to climate and also act as a feedback. In addition to these natural forcing and feedback cycles, there are also additional aspects that are linked to anthropogenic activities. This results in further modification to the LULC and meteorological responses thereupon

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. These LULC changes and their effects are mostly discernible over regions having higher population density, industrialization, urbanization, deforestation, agricultural diversification etc. Thus, the most visible effect of anthropogenic activities regionally and locally are changes in the LULC which modifies the surface energy balance which in turn affects the surface temperature altering the region’s micro-climate

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The changes in LULC also modulate the incidence of heat/cold waves, clouds and rainfall patterns

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. In addition, LULC change have also been linked to atmospheric aerosol emissions

  </span> which can modify the surface temperature through both direct and indirect effects, thereby modulating rainfall which can also result in droughts or floods through changes to extreme events under certain favorable circumstances

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the Indian region, there are only a few scientific investigations that have attempted to discern LULC induced temperature changes, but they are either limited to the major metropolitan cities

  </span> or have only focused on aspects related to urbanization

  </span>. For example, the surface temperature over western India is found to be warming by ~0.13 °C/decade due to the combined effect of greenhouse gases and LULC change of which ~50% was attributed to LULC change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Also, in 2001 an area covering 26.4% of New Delhi had a diurnal temperature range (DTR) below 11 °C whereas in 2011 65.3% of New Delhi had a DTR below 11 °C which was attributed to the increase in built up area by 53%

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, the LULC has also been linked to Indian monsoon rainfall changes

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Studies linking LULC to surface temperature changes are limited over Eastern India though this region is among the most rapidly changing landscape over the entire Indian region
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. The region is also rich in mineral deposits and its continued exploitation for mineral wealth has accelerated LULC change in the past few decades. In addition, Odisha being one of the most natural disaster prone regions of India, a very few studies have investigated the relationship between LULC change and surface temperature, heat waves, extreme rainfall etc.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we investigate the surface temperature changes over the state of Odisha using long term ground, satellite and reanalysis datasets and explore its relation to LULC changes. We investigate whether the surface temperature has increased and, if so, whether this is in response to changes in land cover and/or changes in climate. Then multiple line of evidences are used to link LULC to observed spatial and temporal pattern of temperature. This would help in establishing changes associated with local activities such as LULC and those due to regional and global climate change.</p>
