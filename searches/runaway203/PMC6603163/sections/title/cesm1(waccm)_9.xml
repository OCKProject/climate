  </span>, based on the Community Atmospheric Model Version 4 is used. We refer to this setup as CESM1(WACCM), a comprehensive coupled chemistry climate model spanning the whole atmosphere from the surface to the lower thermosphere with model top at ~140 km altitude. The chemistry module in CESM1(WACCM) includes the O
  <sub>x</sub>, NO
  <sub>x</sub>, HO
  <sub>x</sub>, ClO
  <sub>x</sub> and BrO
  <sub>x</sub> chemical families, implementing 52 compounds, 127 gas-phase reactions, 48 photolytic reactions and 17 heterogeneous reactions on three types of aerosols

  </span>. CESM1(WACCM), as a coupled chemistry climate model allows us to explore the coupling between radiation, temperature, circulation, chemistry and composition in the atmosphere. The horizontal resolution is 1.9° longitude by 2.5° latitude with 66 hybrid sigma pressure layers from 992 to 5.5e-6 hPa. The quasi-biennial oscillation is prescribed and fixed in the easterly phase. Sea surface temperatures are prescribed to preindustrial (1850) conditions.
