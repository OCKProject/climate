  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>). The NH poleward of 30 N experiences more than 190% peak increase in UV radiation in the first two years after the eruption, increasing even more in parts of the Arctic (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>). During maximum Antarctic ozone depletion, the increase in biologically active UV exceeds 400%.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify the impact of the ozone depletion on human populations we have calculated the change in the clear sky ultraviolet index (UVI), which is a standard measure of the strength of sunburn-causing ultraviolet radiation (see Methods). Figure 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8b</a> shows the evolution of the zonal mean, monthly mean anomaly of clear-sky UVI at noon for all latitudes. The maximum increase in UVI is more than 7 units in the NH tropics and subtropics. Absolute zonal mean tropical UVI values peak above 22, which is similar to present-day global UV maximum found at high altitudes in the tropics. NH midlatitude UVI increase peaks at 4 units during the summers of the first two post-eruption years. Much of the midlatitudes experiences UVI above 15, which is similar to pre-eruption and present-day values in the tropics. All of the NH has maximum increases in UVI of more than 50%. Because of the low amount of UV radiation over the Antarctic, the peak UVI increase is only 2 units during the active ozone hole period. Still, this represents more than a doubling of weighted UV-B flux at the surface.
