  </span>. In our setup TUV solves the radiative transfer equations given the parameters: date of the year, position, time of day, column ozone values and total aerosol optical depth at 550 nm to take aerosol scattering into account. We use zonal mean ozone column and aerosol optical depth fields to calculate the zonal mean UV flux and Ultraviolet Index (UVI) for both the climatology and the ensemble mean of the full forcing experiment at noon. From this we calculate the change in UVI and UV flux.
