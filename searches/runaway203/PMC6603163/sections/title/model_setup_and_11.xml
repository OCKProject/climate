 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed a 30-year control simulation (called 
  <span class="bold">Ctr</span>) with constant pre-industrial (1850) atmospheric conditions and sea-surface temperatures and three different forcing experiments: (1) Increased stratospheric aerosol SAD using the El Chichón 1982 volcanic forcing

  </span> described above (called 
  <span class="bold">SAD</span>). (2) Chlorine and bromine injections representing an average CAVA eruption (called 
  <span class="bold">Halog</span>). The halogens were injected into four grid cells (12.32°-16.10° N, 86.5°-91.5° W) at 29 hPa (approximately 24 km), which is roughly consistent with the estimated height of the SO
  <sub>2</sub> injection observed for Pinatubo

  </span>. (3) Combined SAD forcing and halogen injections (called 
  <span class="bold">Halog + SAD</span>). The eruption date is set to January 1. In each of the experiments we performed eight ensemble simulations branched from different Januaries of the control run. In all three forcing scenarios the same initial conditions were used for the eight ensemble members and all model experiments were run for 12 years. In addition two sensitivity studies were performed. A single simulation with 1% halogen injection efficiency (
  <span class="bold">1%Halog + SAD</span>) and a simulation of the impact of the SAD forcing under increased background halogen levels (
  <span class="bold">HighHalogLev + SAD</span>).
