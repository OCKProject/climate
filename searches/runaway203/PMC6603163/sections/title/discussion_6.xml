 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our coupled chemistry climate model results show that the global atmosphere will be strongly impacted over a timescale of ~10 years by a tropical sulfur and halogen-rich volcanic eruption of a magnitude similar to an average CAVA eruption. This is a much longer-lasting impact than the well-known and reported one from a sulfur-rich, but halogen-poor eruption of similar size

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. A key difference is that, while sulfuric acid aerosols typically fall out of the atmosphere within the first 3 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>, the halogens being in the gas phase are mixed throughout the stratosphere. Thus, the lifetime of volcanic halogens in the stratosphere is dominated by their chemical life cycle and the stratospheric circulation time scale.

  </span>, using different models and different volcanic eruptions (see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>), come to the following similar conclusions which may be a bit surprising: high halogen loading in the stratosphere lasting up to 10 years, global ozone depletion of ≥20% following the eruption which is strongest in the 2–3 years post-eruption at NH mid-latitudes, and ozone recovery in about a decade. Cadoux 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> takes a stronger volcanic eruption (M
  <sub>v</sub> = 7) at NH mid-latitudes into account but a smaller halogen injection efficiency of 2% whereas we simulate a weaker eruption (M
  <sub>v</sub> = 6.4) with a higher halogens injection efficiency of 10% in the tropics. These different model experiment set-up details (see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) may explain the similar global ozone impact as well as our larger ozone impact in the SH, as can be expected from the transport of a volcanic cloud by the atmospheric general circulation for a tropical versus an extra-tropical eruption

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If we take such an average CAVA eruption scenario into account for a pre-industrial or future climate atmosphere with a low chlorine background, several impacts are obvious: Ozone column values that today are only associated with the Antarctic ozone hole would occur over large parts of the NH, and even prevail in the tropics for two full years, and an Antarctic ozone hole would appear for several years.</p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike the current anthropogenic ozone depletion, which includes only small changes in the tropics and moderate changes in the mid-latitudes, the resulting increase in ultraviolet radiation due to volcanic ozone depletion is large also over populated and biologically important areas. This difference in behavior is caused by the different sources of halogen radicals from anthropogenic and volcanogenic halogens. While most anthropogenic halogenated compounds (such as chlorofluorocarbons) have to be transported to the upper stratosphere before being activated by UV light, volcanic halogens can be activated immediately upon injection into the stratosphere, thus causing larger impacts in the tropics and mid-latitudes (depending on the location of the eruption). Human populations in these areas would experience increased risk of sunburn and DNA damage. The volcanic increase in UV could impact plants and agriculture in detectable ways. Several crops are sensitive to changes in UV exposure, leading to decreased yields

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>
  </span>. Present-day global ozone depletion of 16% (which is similar to the 20% depletion we find) has been estimated to reduce phytoplankton productivity by 5%, with possible losses of up to 7% of fish harvests as a consequence

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impacts of halogen rich volcanism through increases in surface UV radiation has previously been evaluated for the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province volcanism using a simplified analytical formula

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. The reported global impacts of &gt;1000% increase in surface UV-B over much of the planet originates from the enormous size of the eruptive activity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. This type of eruptive activity (long-lasting, mainly non-explosive) is, however, very different from the highly explosive volcanism of the Central American Volcanic Arc.

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given a proxy for past UV radiation with sufficient resolution, such as a well-preserved sediment core containing plant spores or pollen or a high-resolution ice core, the signal from a large sulfur- and halogen-rich eruption like the one we have simulated should be detectable. Indeed, methods for detecting changes in UV radiation using plant spores or pollen have been developed

  </span>. A 192-year series of sulfur- and halogen-rich eruptions on the Antarctic continent was detected to cause increased ultraviolet irradiance at the surface, altering the sulfur isotope ratios and the concentration of bromine in the preserved ice cores. This long period of increased volcanic activity coincided with abrupt warming of the Antarctic continent, consistent with the response to a long-term ozone depletion event
