 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Input data for the coupled chemistry climate modeling is based on our own published data from measurements of the CAVA material, comprising melt inclusions and degassed matrix glasses from basaltic-andesitic to rhyolitic tephras from Plinian eruptions

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. These input data are based on a three-stage procedure where in a first step the eruptive masses of single eruptions were determined using a) tephra mapping (thicknesses and distribution) and b) volume and subsequent mass calculations by including rock densities. The latter follows the exponential decay approach
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>
  </span>. For the second step volatiles (S, Cl, Br) were measured in tephra samples for each eruption using electron microprobe (S, Cl) S) and synchrotron XRF (Br). We use the conventional petrological method where pre-eruptive volatile contents given in melt inclusions of host minerals subtracted by post-eruptive volatile contents given in erupted and degassed glasses give the degassed fraction of volatiles. Knowing the total eruptive mass from step 1 gives the volatile release during the eruption available for atmospheric injection

 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the available data from the CAVA
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, we used an average of 28 eruptions, excluding the extraordinarily large Los Chocoyos eruption, as input parameter for the coupled chemistry climate modeling. These average CAVA data represent a large sulfur- and halogen-rich eruption and are compared to the largest eruptions of the “satellite era”, the Pinatubo, El Chichón eruptions as well as other eruptions (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Degassed volatiles are, where available, presented as both petrological estimates as well as satellite estimates to emphasize the large uncertainties of both methods.
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whereas the satellite data are limited to eruptions in the last three decades the petrological method has the advantage of targeting paleo volcanic eruptions of known geographic sources. Additionally, the bromine releases used are based on measurements in contrast to studies using less well-constrained indirect estimations from element ratios (e.g. Cl/Br, S/Br
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>) that are prone to high, and unsystematic variability due to pre-eruptive fluid partitioning
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, the petrological method might underestimate the volatile release in certain cases, since some volatile species (e.g. S, Br) may strongly be affected by pre-eruptive, magma composition-dependent fluid partitioning, and not be covered by measurements
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, even though the fluid phase contributes to injected volatiles. This may lead to the petrological method underestimating the volatile release of an eruption by a factor of 10 for SO

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since CESM1(WACCM) handles stratospheric sulfuric acid aerosols through prescribed surface area density (SAD) fields, we compare the petrological sulfur estimate of the average CAVA eruption to major present-day eruptions (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). For the average CAVA the petrological estimate of erupted sulfur mass is 5.7 Mt which is in the range of satellite estimate of stratospheric sulfur injection from the 1982 El Chichón eruption (7.5 Mt). Therefore, we adapted the standard El Chichón SAD forcing
