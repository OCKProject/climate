 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical significance was calculated with the scipy.stats module in Python. To test statistical significance of global and regional ozone changes we applied the Studentâ€™s t-test on the individual samples, allowing the distributions to have different variances. For calculating significances of zonal mean anomalies of zonal wind and temperature we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as the data were not normally distributed. By concatenating the ensemble members of the experiment and the individual years of the control run along a record dimension, we could treat each latitude and level index separately for testing. We then tested whether the experiment ensemble differed significantly from the control at each index. This way we could verify where the experiment response was different from the natural variability of the control simulation.</p>
