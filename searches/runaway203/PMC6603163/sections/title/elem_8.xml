We refer to this setup as CESM1(WACCM), a comprehensive coupled chemistry climate model spanning the whole atmosphere from the surface to the lower thermosphere with model top at ~140 km altitude.

The horizontal resolution is 1.9° longitude by 2.5° latitude with 66 hybrid sigma pressure layers from 992 to 5.5e-6 hPa. The quasi-biennial oscillation is prescribed and fixed in the easterly phase. Sea surface temperatures are prescribed to preindustrial (1850) conditions.

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Input data for the coupled chemistry climate modeling is based on our own published data from measurements of the CAVA material, comprising melt inclusions and degassed matrix glasses from basaltic-andesitic to rhyolitic tephras from Plinian eruptions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span>. These input data are based on a three-stage procedure where in a first step the eruptive masses of single eruptions were determined using a) tephra mapping (thicknesses and distribution) and b) volume and subsequent mass calculations by including rock densities. The latter follows the exponential decay approach
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>
   </span>. For the second step volatiles (S, Cl, Br) were measured in tephra samples for each eruption using electron microprobe (S, Cl) S) and synchrotron XRF (Br). We use the conventional petrological method where pre-eruptive volatile contents given in melt inclusions of host minerals subtracted by post-eruptive volatile contents given in erupted and degassed glasses give the degassed fraction of volatiles. Knowing the total eruptive mass from step 1 gives the volatile release during the eruption available for atmospheric injection

  </p>
  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the available data from the CAVA
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span>, we used an average of 28 eruptions, excluding the extraordinarily large Los Chocoyos eruption, as input parameter for the coupled chemistry climate modeling. These average CAVA data represent a large sulfur- and halogen-rich eruption and are compared to the largest eruptions of the “satellite era”, the Pinatubo, El Chichón eruptions as well as other eruptions (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Degassed volatiles are, where available, presented as both petrological estimates as well as satellite estimates to emphasize the large uncertainties of both methods.
  </p>
  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whereas the satellite data are limited to eruptions in the last three decades the petrological method has the advantage of targeting paleo volcanic eruptions of known geographic sources. Additionally, the bromine releases used are based on measurements in contrast to studies using less well-constrained indirect estimations from element ratios (e.g. Cl/Br, S/Br
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span>) that are prone to high, and unsystematic variability due to pre-eruptive fluid partitioning
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, the petrological method might underestimate the volatile release in certain cases, since some volatile species (e.g. S, Br) may strongly be affected by pre-eruptive, magma composition-dependent fluid partitioning, and not be covered by measurements
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span>, even though the fluid phase contributes to injected volatiles. This may lead to the petrological method underestimating the volatile release of an eruption by a factor of 10 for SO

  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since CESM1(WACCM) handles stratospheric sulfuric acid aerosols through prescribed surface area density (SAD) fields, we compare the petrological sulfur estimate of the average CAVA eruption to major present-day eruptions (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). For the average CAVA the petrological estimate of erupted sulfur mass is 5.7 Mt which is in the range of satellite estimate of stratospheric sulfur injection from the 1982 El Chichón eruption (7.5 Mt). Therefore, we adapted the standard El Chichón SAD forcing

  <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed a 30-year control simulation (called 
   <span class="bold">Ctr</span>) with constant pre-industrial (1850) atmospheric conditions and sea-surface temperatures and three different forcing experiments: (1) Increased stratospheric aerosol SAD using the El Chichón 1982 volcanic forcing

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>
   </span> described above (called 
   <span class="bold">SAD</span>). (2) Chlorine and bromine injections representing an average CAVA eruption (called 
   <span class="bold">Halog</span>). The halogens were injected into four grid cells (12.32°-16.10° N, 86.5°-91.5° W) at 29 hPa (approximately 24 km), which is roughly consistent with the estimated height of the SO
   <sub>2</sub> injection observed for Pinatubo
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
   </span>. (3) Combined SAD forcing and halogen injections (called 
   <span class="bold">Halog + SAD</span>). The eruption date is set to January 1. In each of the experiments we performed eight ensemble simulations branched from different Januaries of the control run. In all three forcing scenarios the same initial conditions were used for the eight ensemble members and all model experiments were run for 12 years. In addition two sensitivity studies were performed. A single simulation with 1% halogen injection efficiency (
   <span class="bold">1%Halog + SAD</span>) and a simulation of the impact of the SAD forcing under increased background halogen levels (
   <span class="bold">HighHalogLev + SAD</span>).

In our setup TUV solves the radiative transfer equations given the parameters: date of the year, position, time of day, column ozone values and total aerosol optical depth at 550 nm to take aerosol scattering into account. We use zonal mean ozone column and aerosol optical depth fields to calculate the zonal mean UV flux and Ultraviolet Index (UVI) for both the climatology and the ensemble mean of the full forcing experiment at noon. From this we calculate the change in UVI and UV flux.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical significance testing</div>
  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical significance was calculated with the scipy.stats module in Python. To test statistical significance of global and regional ozone changes we applied the Student’s t-test on the individual samples, allowing the distributions to have different variances. For calculating significances of zonal mean anomalies of zonal wind and temperature we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as the data were not normally distributed. By concatenating the ensemble members of the experiment and the individual years of the control run along a record dimension, we could treat each latitude and level index separately for testing. We then tested whether the experiment ensemble differed significantly from the control at each index. This way we could verify where the experiment response was different from the natural variability of the control simulation.</p>
