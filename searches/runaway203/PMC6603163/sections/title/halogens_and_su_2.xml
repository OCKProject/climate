 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Large amounts of material are ejected into the atmosphere by large, explosive volcanic eruptions. This material consists of tephra (explosively fragmented magma), as well as volatiles (gases) in variable concentrations. Significant volcanic volatile compounds, influencing atmospheric conditions, are carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, which form sulfuric acid aerosols over a period of about one month, and halogens (e.g. chlorine and bromine), that play a major role in ozone chemistry

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Halogen compounds that reach the stratosphere contribute to catalytic ozone loss by releasing halogen radicals and interacting with enhanced sulfuric acid aerosol leading to increased ozone loss through heterogeneous chemistry

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tropical eruptions with eruptive columns rapidly penetrating the tropopause directly inject volatiles in the form of gas, ice or salts precipitated on ash surfaces into the stratosphere where they are distributed globally by the large-scale meridional overturning circulation. Sulfuric acid aerosols and halogens then impact radiation, chemistry and dynamics of the stratosphere. The effects of volcanic sulfur emissions on the global climate is widely studied and accepted

While most erupted sulfur is injected to the stratosphere, halogens are easily scavenged by water and ice in the rapidly ascending eruption column, leaving a large uncertainty concerning how much of the emitted halogen is injected into and remain in the stratosphere

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To study the potential atmospheric impacts of volcanic eruptions we use chemistry climate models. Getting reliable results from climate model simulations requires constraining the relevant parameters of the volcanic eruption. While satellite measurements provide the most appropriate atmospheric input parameters to evaluate volcanic impacts on the atmosphere and climate, very few (sub-)Plinian eruptions have occurred in the satellite era
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>

 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such databases of volatile release can be assessed for a variety of paleo-eruptions where the amount of volcanic gases released is estimated employing the petrological method. By measuring pre-eruptive (in melt inclusions) and post-eruptive (in matrix glass) gas contents of the magma and using the resulting difference together with the erupted magma mass, one can calculate the minimum amount of different volatiles released during an eruption, neglecting the potential amount of volatiles released through the fluid phase, and from that specify the range injected to the stratosphere

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A detailed dataset of degassing budgets of chlorine, bromine and sulfur from large paleo-eruptions of the CAVA is available covering the last 200 ka including 29 eruptions with eruption magnitudes (M

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only few modeling studies concerning stratospheric implications of volcanic halogens and aerosols from explosive volcanism are known to us. In a study of the Bronze-Age eruption of Santorini (~1600 BCE) petrologically determined chlorine and estimated bromine degassing budgets, with 2% halogen injection efficiency, were used as input for the 2D Chemical Transport Model (CTM) with simplified internally generated zonal mean winds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> (These degassing budgets for bromine have later been confirmed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>). Simulations show peak ozone loss in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), ranging from 20–90% depending on the degassing budget scenario. Global ozone depletion reaches approximately 20% in the high volatiles scenario and the ozone layer takes about a decade to completely recover in this study. Similar to that, another 2D CTM study investigated volcanic eruptions under future climate emission scenarios co-injecting sulfur together with chlorine (and varying bromine background levels for sensitivity) of a Pinatubo strength eruption
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. This model study projects column ozone loss up to 4 years maximizing with 5% to 13% depending on the future anthropogenic chlorine level. These model results are, however, limited by the fact that they employ 2D CTMs with simplified mean atmospheric circulation

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the studies of explosive volcanism, a few 2D CTM and 3D General Circulation Model (GCM) studies of chlorine release from the Siberian Traps volcanism 250 Myrs ago

The recovery of the ozone layer took approximately 10 years after the emissions have ended. Ozone depletion caused by halogen release from this type of volcanism is one of the hypothesized triggers for the Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction.

In addition to atmospheric radiation, temperature, circulation and composition changes, we also evaluate the potential impact of global ozone loss on the biosphere by calculating the change in biologically active UV radiation reaching the Earth´s surface after such an eruption. We will discuss our results in light of the existing literature, before giving a summary and perspectives for future studies.
