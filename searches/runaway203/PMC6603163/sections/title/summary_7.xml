 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study highlights that representative volcanic eruptions from the tropics, e.g. Central American Volcanic Arc, had and have the potential to deplete ozone by ~20% globally, causing Antarctic ozone hole conditions across the NH, the tropics and the Antarctic. In our simulations, strong impacts on stratospheric composition, temperature and circulation were found on the pre-industrial atmosphere. Contingent on the assumptions made on eruption location, halogen content and injection efficiency we find that the ozone layer takes up to 10 years to fully recover to pre-eruption conditions confirming previous studies. The inclusion of volcanic halogens in addition to sulfur changes the stratospheric impact of the eruption from a warming to a cooling. In addition, the NH polar vortex is weakened instead of strengthened in the first post-eruption winter. Following, severe ozone depletion over the polar regions causes strengthening of the polar vortices and positive annular mode circulation in years 1–3 in the NH and in years 3–6 in the SH.</p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The depletion of ozone causes large increases of ultraviolet radiation at the surface over the entire globe with &gt;60% peak increase (NH 40–190%, tropics ~40% and Antarctic &gt;400%) with potential consequences for crop plants, marine life as well as human populations during that period. These results may impact upcoming studies on high-resolution proxy ice cores and archives of plant spores and pollen to detect volcanically induced paleo ozone holes of the kind we project in our simulations. The methodology seems to be available, if a suitable high-resolution proxy archive is accessible. Several of the large to extremely large eruptions of the CAVA time series are potential targets for such future investigations.</p>
