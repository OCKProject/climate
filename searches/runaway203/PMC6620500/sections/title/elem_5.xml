 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in climate and their effects have serious threats on the stability and productivity of the agricultural sector (FAO 
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">2010</a>). A study on the economic impact of climate change threats revealed that future economic costs of the impact of climate change on market and non-market sectors (human health and environment) in Kenya might be close to 2.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) per year by 2030 and potentially greater than 50% by 2050 (SEI 
  <a rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0038">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The changing climatic conditions, particularly rainfall and temperature patterns, portend adverse impacts on Kenya’s socio-economic sectors, with current projections indicating that such impacts will worsen in the future if significant reductions in the anthropogenic GHGs emissions that are responsible for climate change are not made (GOK 
  <a rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0015">2010</a>). As agriculture plays a pivotal role in Kenya’s economy, moderating actual or potential climate change damages or adaptation to the climate change risks in a sustainable manner is critical.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">About 40% of dairy cattle in Kenya are found in semi-intensive farming systems. This feature, coupled with information that such production systems have the highest maize densities, indicates a high potential for benefits from maize–livestock integration (Thorne et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0040">2002</a>). In view of the stresses occasioned by climate change and weather variability, maize–dairy integration offers an opportunity to manage production risks in a dairy enterprise. Unlike other fodder production systems, dry MS forage- based systems do not compete for limited food crop production niches (Volenzo 
  <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted in Bungoma and Kakamega counties located between longitude 34°25’E and 35°10’E and latitude 0°1’N and 0°15’ (Jaetzold et al. 2005). The area is characterised by commercial sugarcane farming as well as maize production at subsistence and commercial levels as major economic activities (KNBS 
  <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">2009</a>). Livestock–crop integration that serves a myriad of purposes (Ongadi et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">2010</a>) is a common characteristic in majority of the households.

 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The western Kenya maize–sugar belt is under increased population pressure (Jaetzold et al. 2005). Diminishing land sizes and seasonality in production of the feeds makes it difficult to bridge protein and energy gaps in dairy cattle feeding (Ongadi et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0034">2010</a>). Climate change is expected to widen and compound difficulties in bridging energy and protein gaps. Such scenarios point towards increased vulnerability of dairy farmers to climate change and weather variability risks. Furthermore, high market risks faced by the farmers negatively impact the adoption of technologies that have potential for increased productivity, low net or GHG neutral emission risks as well as poverty alleviation (Volenzo 
  <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>).

 <sec id="s20007" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change refers to the change in the state of climate whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persist for extended period, typically decades or longer (IPCC 
   <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">2007</a>). Methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are the main GHGs that contribute to global warming and depletion of ozone layer (Steinfeld et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0037">2006</a>). Emission of GHGs traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to climate forcing or what is referred to as global warming.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change and weather variability are among the biggest challenges to human development as they present a combination of risks that negatively impact human health, global food security, economic development and the natural environment on which much of the human livelihoods depends (Zakarya et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0050">2015</a>). Therefore, combating climate change and its impacts is at the core of the 17 SDGs agenda. This is on account that several of the targets under climate change action overlap and impinge on other SDGs. Therefore, risk reduction is advocated in addressing disaster risk drivers, such as poor land management, unsustainable use of natural resources and declining ecosystems, in climate change action and pursuit of SDGs (UN 
   <a rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0043">2015</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive capacity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maintaining and improving livelihoods is one of the farmers’ objectives. These require that farmers adapt to changing policy contexts and environment in which they operate. In this context, adaptation is an active decision-making process framed by risk attitude and perception. The risk attitude and perception is influenced both by farmer characteristics and external factors (Maredia &amp; Minde 
   <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">2002</a>). The role of adaptive capacity, adaptation process and their implication on use of GHG emissions as an indicator in sustainability metrics is particularly relevant in this context. Such reality creates the need to reassess traditional policy instruments in terms of their adaptability to better reflect climate-related externalities of production and consumption (Banuri &amp; Opschoor 
   <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2007</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coping capacity defines the ability of people, organisations and systems to face and manage adverse conditions, emergencies and disasters using available skills and resources (UNISDR 
   <a rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0046">2015</a>). Coping strategies are short-term responses to a specific shock such as drought, while adaptive strategies entail long-term change in behaviour patterns as a result of shock or stress (Krantz 
   <a rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0027">2001</a>). The capacity to cope requires continuous awareness, resources and good management both in normal times and during adverse conditions (UNISDR 
   <a rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0046">2015</a>). Coping capacities may thus contribute to reduction of disaster risks. However, some coping strategies such as the use of MS as dairy cattle feed without supplementation may be ecologically undesirable (Volenzo 
   <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reducing farmers’ vulnerability in terms of exposure to risks associated with climate change increases their propensity to engage in more productive economic activities (Siegel 
   <a rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0036">2005</a>). However, high adaptive capacity does not necessarily translate into adaptation actions that reduce vulnerability (IPCC 
   <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">2007</a>; Moser &amp; Ekstrom 
   <a rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0032">2010</a>). Differences in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and value system could account for this conclusion. The observation suggests that other interventions, such as advocacy, sustained publicity and education, are necessary ingredients in spurring sustainability in climate change action.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The challenging task in planning adaptation activities is finding ways to combine different measures in a meaningful way to avoid maladaptation. The most attractive adaptation measures are those that offer benefits in the near future and reduce vulnerabilities in the long-term (Mimura et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2014</a>). This includes the use of integrated adaptation–mitigation–sustainable development (AMSD) frameworks. As an integral part of wider development goals in transition to sustainability, AMSD frameworks are critical in policy formulation, decision-making, governance and behaviour development (Bizikova, Robinson &amp; Cohen 
   <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">2007</a>). Adaptation–mitigation–sustainable development planning frameworks include the creation of local implementation pathways that increase opportunities for social learning processes and capacities for effective adaptation and mitigation (FAO 
   <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">2010</a>). Crop–dairy integration as one of the potential applications from AMSD frameworks, alongside nutrient recycling in MS-based adaptation strategies, invariably reduces methane emission risks and increases carbon sinks, as adaptation co-benefits. This has the potential of contributing to productive and resilient agricultural production systems (Volenzo 
   <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disaster risk reduction</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Disaster risk reduction is the development and application of policies, strategies and practices designed to minimise vulnerabilities and impacts of disasters through a combination of technical measures to reduce physical hazards and enhance social and economic capacity to adapt (UNISDR 
   <a rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0046">2015</a>). Disaster risk reduction is thus a cost-effective investment in preventing future losses and can be addressed within the context of sustainable development and poverty reduction by integrating risk considerations into policies, plans and programmes (UNISDR 
   <a rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0046">2015</a>). Risk reduction planning process involves the knowledge of situations, processes and systems. In dairy production, mitigation of GHG from feeding strategies reduces the vulnerability of livelihoods from enhanced disaster risks associated with methane emissions. However, methane emission risks in dairy cattle feeds adaptation have been accorded low attention.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sustainable livelihoods</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Livelihood refers to activities done by a farmer for earning a living. A livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks (such as droughts) while maintaining or enhancing its capacities and assets and at the same time not undermining the natural resource base at local and global levels in the short and long-term (Chambers &amp; Conway 
   <a rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0011">1992</a>). Particular livelihood activities by the farmers reflect an explicit (or implicit) multidimensional objective function, including sociocultural and environmental outcomes (Carney 
   <a rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0010">1999</a>). In the context of the above definition, livelihood for a dairy farmer would refer to the well-being of the farmer, in terms of production and sale of milk and milk products, food security, profit margin, survival of the animal asset, employment opportunities as well as contribution to farm productivity and environmental quality (Volenzo 
   <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall efficiency, resilience, adaptive capacity and mitigation potential of production systems can be inferred to and improved through its various components, such as soil nutrient management (FAO 
   <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">2010</a>). At farm level, improved soil fertility management, integrated nutrient management, agroforestry and integrated livestock management lower the negative impacts of farming on natural resources and the environment (UNEP 
   <a rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0045">2012</a>). In this article, sustainable adaptation to climate change is used to refer to management decisions and/or technical measures (newly adopted or intensification of the existing ones) that mitigate GHG emission risks. In a dairy enterprise, feed resources including the purchased components, their quality and availability are among the key determinants of enterprise profitability (Uddin et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0042">2010</a>). This also has an impact on productivity and methane emission risks.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above analysis suggests that the cost of feeds and feeding is important in farmers’ decision-making process and choice of risk management strategies. Exploring this linkage is particularly critical with the rising need for inclusion of climate-related targets in SDGs and a more climate-oriented set of indicators as parts of systems for sustainable development and environmental quality.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sustainable adaptation to climate change risks</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Definitions of sustainability vary across sectors, but the common theme is to change the way resources are exploited, and how hazards are managed so that adverse impacts downstream or, for subsequent generations, are reduced. Some of the sustainable development indicators pertain to climate change variables, such as level of GHG emissions (Kates, Parris &amp; Leiserowitz 
   <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">2005</a>). Sustainable principles call for integration of economic and development policies so that in case of conflict between the two, ecological interests are given a preference (UNEP 
   <a rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0045">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of MS, different supplementation regimes and their effect on methane emissions can be used in exploring and extending sustainability concept to emission and mitigation of GHGs. In dairy production, energy and protein supplementation reduces methane emissions at herd level (Mills et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">2003</a>). Thus, supplementation mitigates the negative externalities imposed through CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions and the resultant radiative forcing risks. However, the domino effect of price and production risks in smallholder agriculture with respect to GHG emissions has received little attention. This linkage could be important in the assessment of poverty–maladaptation–environmental degradation nexus.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dairy sub-sector accounts for about 7% of Kenya’s GDP and 17% of agricultural gross domestic product, in addition to supplying domestic requirements for meat and dairy products (ASDS 
   <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2009</a>). Dairy enterprise is one of the few agricultural systems that produce a consistent cash flow over most of the year (Omore et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0033">1999</a>), with small-scale farmers accounting for 80% of the total milk production and 70% of the total marketed milk in the country (ASDS 
   <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2009</a>). The sub-sector employs about 500 000 people directly and 10 million people indirectly (ASDS 
   <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2009</a>). The sub-sector has grown with annual milk production rising from 2.1 billion litres in 2000 to 5.1 billion litres (valued at KES 100 billion) in 2008 (ASDS 
   <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2009</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Risk is a combination of the probability of occurrence of an event such as drought and resultant negative consequences such as reduced revenues (Mimura et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2014</a>). According to Ullah et al. (
   <a rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0049">2016</a>), there are five major types of risk in agriculture: production or technical risk, market or price risk, legal risk, social risk and human sources of risk. The multiple risks are intertwined and exacerbated by climate change (Bharwani et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">2005</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dairy production operations occur in an environment of intertwined risks. Risk refers to any factor that could lower profits or increase expenses, adversely impacting the economic performance of the dairy enterprise (Bailey 
   <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">2001</a>). Risk occurs from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure and hazard (Mimura et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2014</a>). There are many sources of risk in dairy production. These include prices of milk, feeds, crop forage and their production levels, which are influenced by extreme weather variation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Risk management depends on endowment (Satya 
   <a rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0035">2010</a>; Williams, Hiernaux &amp; Fernandez-Rivera 
   <a rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0048">2000</a>). A household’s portfolio of assets influences farmers’ risk attitude and their ability to respond to risk (Siegel 
   <a rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0036">2005</a>). Accumulated assets allow for more innovative strategies to be pursued with impacts that promote sustainability (Bharwani et al. 
   <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">2005</a>). Assets also determine the type of activities that can be undertaken. More productive activities (such as high yielding dairy cows) are typically associated with greater risk. Implicitly, assets or resource endowments and their utilisation impact productivity in terms of risk attitude and their effect on expected income and variability of income.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A farmer may perceive a technology as high risk if it requires investing a higher proportion of his or her limited resources (such as cash for subsistence small-scale farming or improving knowledge and management skills of a farmer) or foregoing a practice that is culturally valued (such as well adapted but low external input-dependent local cattle breeds) in the current system (Maredia &amp; Minde 
   <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">2002</a>). This could explain about the low to non-existent supplementation of MS in the maize–sugarcane belt of western Kenya (Volenzo 
   <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>). The low energy supplementation to non-existent supplementation of MS as a risk management strategy not only reduces income but also increases CH
   <sub>4</sub> emission risks per unit production. The low levels of energy (10 ± 1.1%) and protein (6.5 ± 1.5%) supplementation by households is reflected in low milk production levels (3 ± 1.5 L) against potential of 20 L/day for dairy breeds of medium milk production potential in the study area. As shown in 
   <a rid="T0001" ref-type="table" href="#T0001">Table 1</a>, low energy and protein supplementation increase methane emission risks.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the above analysis, accumulated capital allows for purchase and use of external inputs, such as dairy feed supplements. This can significantly impact poverty outcomes and environmental degradation, as external inputs such as energy and protein supplements in dairy production significantly influence methane emission risks that impact environmental sustainability. Higher productivity of the dairy herd from increased use of external inputs not only reduces poverty but also reduces methane emission per unit litre of milk produced.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The authors have used methane emission levels in the adaptation of dairy feeding strategies as a measure of sustainable development. It is apparent that mitigating GHG emission risks is one of the pillars of sustainable adaptation to climate change in dairy production. In this study, price risks are intricately associated with maladaptation to climate change among resource-poor farmers. While anecdotal evidence points to pollution and/or environmental degradation caused by the use of external inputs in crop agriculture, considerations of GHG emission levels in the use of MS suggest otherwise. Increased levels of energy and protein supplementation mitigate GHG, with positive impacts on environmental and financial sustainability. The counterfactual seems to suggest that any policy on adaptation and poverty–environmental degradation nexus has to be resource specific. From the analysis, it is clear that climate change can be a driver of disaster risks when economic vulnerabilities that reduce access to inputs and resources that mitigate GHGs are prevalent. Tackling the underlying disaster risk drivers, such as cognitive failure, poverty and poor natural resource management, is thus critical to risk reduction.</p>
