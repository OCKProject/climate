 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change refers to the change in the state of climate whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persist for extended period, typically decades or longer (IPCC 
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">2007</a>). Methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are the main GHGs that contribute to global warming and depletion of ozone layer (Steinfeld et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0037">2006</a>). Emission of GHGs traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to climate forcing or what is referred to as global warming.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change and weather variability are among the biggest challenges to human development as they present a combination of risks that negatively impact human health, global food security, economic development and the natural environment on which much of the human livelihoods depends (Zakarya et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0050">2015</a>). Therefore, combating climate change and its impacts is at the core of the 17 SDGs agenda. This is on account that several of the targets under climate change action overlap and impinge on other SDGs. Therefore, risk reduction is advocated in addressing disaster risk drivers, such as poor land management, unsustainable use of natural resources and declining ecosystems, in climate change action and pursuit of SDGs (UN 
  <a rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0043">2015</a>).
