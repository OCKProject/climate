 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unplanned or autonomous adaptation to climate change could be a driver to degradation of land resources, ecosystems and biodiversity, with far-reaching negative impacts on food security, incomes of small-scale farmers and poverty reduction initiatives. According to Jung et al. (2012), development paths and the choices that define adaptation may affect the severity of climate impacts, not only through changes in exposure and sensitivity but also through changes in the capacities of systems to adapt. This includes local-scale disaster risk reduction (DRR) and resource management and broader social dimensions (Haddad 
  <a rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0016">2005</a>). However, under generic adaptation planning, uncertainties remain regarding how effective global actions will be in reducing GHGs (Banuri &amp; Opschoor 
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2007</a>). Anchoring adaptation planning on evidence and verifiable knowledge can reduce such uncertainties and increase the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to C-CIARN Agriculture (
  <a rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0009">2004</a>), adaptation to climate and weather variability risks should not only take advantage of opportunities, but also increase resilience of farmers’ production systems. This implies minimising environmental degradation and/or pollution risks, as well as stabilisation of output and income. In tandem with sustainability paradigm, anticipatory adaptation implies identifying and reducing underlying risk factors associated with development policies, plans and programmes and linking climate change adaptation to DRR in a mutually supportive manner (UNISDR 
  <a rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0046">2015</a>). Climate change adaptation policies in the agricultural sector should, therefore, screen for and evaluate the economic, social and environmental costs (externalities) against potential benefits.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To maintain or improve their livelihoods, farmers have to adapt to changing policy contexts and environment in which they operate (Maredia &amp; Minde 
  <a rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0029">2002</a>). The challenging task in planning adaptation activities involves finding ways to combine different measures in a meaningful way in order to avoid maladaptation. The most attractive adaptation measures are those that offer benefits in the near future as well as reduce vulnerabilities in the long-term (Mimura et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0031">2014</a>). This increases the need to investigate policies, plans and programmes in terms of risks and opportunities. The role of adaptive capacity, adaptation process and their implication on use of GHG emissions as a sustainability indicator is particularly relevant in this context.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that disasters are potentially embedded in implementation of socio-economic policies and interventions formulated to manage climate change, it is posited that failure to identify, quantify and treat risks embedded in dairy feeding adaptation initiatives actually enhances climate change risks and exacerbates small-scale farmers’ vulnerability to climate change and weather variability (Volenzo 
  <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>). Adaptation may result in suboptimal outcomes and unintended adverse impacts for other sectors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maladaptation occurs when adaptation action or investment taken to avoid or reduce climate change impacts increases vulnerability to other adverse impacts or increases the vulnerability of other systems, sectors or social groups (Adger, Arnell &amp; Tompkins 
  <a rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0001">2005</a>; Barnett &amp; O’Neill 
  <a rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0006">2010</a>). Maladaptation imposes negative externalities on third parties and ecosystems. A good example of maladaptation would be suboptimal milk production levels, hence increased CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions per litre of milk from use of MS under low or non-existent energy and protein supplementation. The resultant negative externalities because of radiative forcing may have disproportionate impact on the poor by increasing their vulnerability to other external shocks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main objective in scaling up sustainable agriculture practices is to transform food production from a major GHG emitter to a net neutral and possibly a GHG sink (UNEP 
  <a rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0044">2011</a>). This can be achieved through socio-economic policies and regulatory instruments (UNEP 
  <a rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0045">2012</a>). Sustainable development goals (SDGs) commit subscribing nations to targets aimed at achieving sustainable water use, energy use as well as sustainable agricultural practices (UN 
  <a rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0043">2015</a>). Sustainable adaptation to climate change and climate policies in agriculture presuppose increased farm productivity and income, resilience to shocks and mitigation of GHGs (Asghar et al. 2005; UNEP 
  <a rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0044">2011</a>). Dairy feed supplementation is a risk management strategy, which in turn influence dairy cattle productivity and CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission risks (Volenzo 
  <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have postulated several relationships in the analysis of poverty–environmental degradation nexus. In one of the relationships, poverty–environmental degradation nexus is considered in a bidirectional order for policy making purposes, that is, the prioritisation of environmental management or poverty alleviation interventions. It was argued by Dasgupta et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0012">2005</a>) that irrespective of policy priorities, complementarity between environmental and poverty alleviation strategies should always be pursued. However, there is paucity of research findings on poverty–production risks–maladaptation to climate change nexus. Existing findings on poverty–environmental degradation nexus can be used in gaining insights into the proposed poverty–price–production risks–maladaptation to climate change nexus.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a rid="T0001" ref-type="table" href="#T0001">Table 1</a> provides simulated effect of supplementation on milk production and methane emission risks in maize stover (MS) feeding strategies. The results suggest that the use of MS as standalone ration increases methane emission risks by up to 30.9% per kilogram of un-supplemented MS (18.03 to 26.11 Mj [megajourles] kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The higher marginal increment in CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions, on average, exacerbates radiative forcing than what would be under higher dairy productivity. Addressing the multiple risks faced by the smallholder dairy farmers can positively influence integration and intensification of dairy feeding strategies that use MS to reduce methane emission risks by 30% (Volenzo 
  <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>). In addition, the lack of and/or suboptimal supplementation in dairy cattle feeding undermines participation of resource-poor farmers in better remunerative livelihoods and confines them into the poverty traps.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Volenzo (
  <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>) provides some evidence on centrality of and linkages between farmers’ risk attitude and the adoption of environmentally sustainable technologies, dairy cattle productivity and CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission. Because price and market risks are a function of institutional arrangements and policy contexts, Volenzo argues that policymakers may utilise risk management instruments in influencing dairy sector producers to mitigate climate change risks. This is on the account that short-term decisions about allocation of assets and livelihood adaptation options can have both long-term negative and positive implications on the environment and the cycle of poverty (Siegel 
  <a rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0036">2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modelling and simulation can be used in the assessment of poverty–production risks–maladaptation to climate change nexus. As simulated quantitative models offer a range of scenarios, they can be utilised in an iterative way to develop scenarios that project impacts within a coupled human–environment system (Turner et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0041">2010</a>). The worst-case scenario in the simulation model may be used in disaster planning (Downing &amp; Patwardhan 
  <a rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0013">2002</a>). A model on methane emission in ruminants by Mills et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0030">2003</a>) was used in this study to simulate methane emissions from dairy cattle feeding strategies by resource-constrained farmers.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vulnerabilities to climate change risks, various policy responses and economic actions (adaptation) at household and national levels, as well as resource base can be used to simulate outcomes of adaptive action. In dairy cattle production, energy and protein supplementation are a production risk management strategy. The analogy is applied in this article to assess the effect of MS supplementation on emission of methane.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the above analysis, the authors suggest an analytical framework (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" href="#F0001">Figure 1</a>) for policymakers and the community of practice. The model illustrates the linkage between small-scale dairy farmers’ production risk management strategies and climate change risks. The model can be applied for the diagnosis, development, monitoring and evaluation of adaptation policies training and research programmes, as well as for the development of extension packages for the agricultural sector in general, and small-scale dairy farmers in particular.
