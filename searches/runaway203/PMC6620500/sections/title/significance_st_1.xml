 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nexus approach to environmental resource management examines the inter-relatedness and interdependencies of environmental resources through the concept of trade-offs and synergies (Kurian &amp; Meyer 
  <a rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0028">2015</a>). This underscores the need to investigate policies, plans and programmes in terms of risks and opportunities. Building upon this thinking, and the comprehensive conceptual model for disaster management (Asghar, Alahakoon &amp; Churilov 2005), the concept of sustainable development using levels of GHGs emissions as sustainability indicators is explored. We adapt the comprehensive conceptual model for disaster management, which links strategic planning to hazard assessment, risk management, disaster management actions (mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery) and environmental conditions that impact the severity of a disaster in making inferences.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By investigating risk attitude and risk management among resource-poor small-scale dairy farmers, we are able to link risk attitude and livelihood strategies in adaptation to climate to livelihoods outcomes and GHGs emission levels, hence the poverty–production risk–maladaptation–environmental degradation nexus. The main contribution of this article is thus a robust analytical framework that integrates socio-ecological interfaces in adaptation planning and nexus thinking. The framework makes it possible to analyse climate adaptation-related risks, as well as trade-offs and synergies in climate change action. It further informs policy on holistic and integrated approaches that could bridge mitigation–adaptation divide in climatic change action decision support systems, transdisciplinary and sustainable development agenda.</p>
