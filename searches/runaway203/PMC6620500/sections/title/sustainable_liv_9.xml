 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Livelihood refers to activities done by a farmer for earning a living. A livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks (such as droughts) while maintaining or enhancing its capacities and assets and at the same time not undermining the natural resource base at local and global levels in the short and long-term (Chambers &amp; Conway 
  <a rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0011">1992</a>). Particular livelihood activities by the farmers reflect an explicit (or implicit) multidimensional objective function, including sociocultural and environmental outcomes (Carney 
  <a rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0010">1999</a>). In the context of the above definition, livelihood for a dairy farmer would refer to the well-being of the farmer, in terms of production and sale of milk and milk products, food security, profit margin, survival of the animal asset, employment opportunities as well as contribution to farm productivity and environmental quality (Volenzo 
  <a rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0047">2015</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall efficiency, resilience, adaptive capacity and mitigation potential of production systems can be inferred to and improved through its various components, such as soil nutrient management (FAO 
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">2010</a>). At farm level, improved soil fertility management, integrated nutrient management, agroforestry and integrated livestock management lower the negative impacts of farming on natural resources and the environment (UNEP 
  <a rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0045">2012</a>). In this article, sustainable adaptation to climate change is used to refer to management decisions and/or technical measures (newly adopted or intensification of the existing ones) that mitigate GHG emission risks. In a dairy enterprise, feed resources including the purchased components, their quality and availability are among the key determinants of enterprise profitability (Uddin et al. 
  <a rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0042">2010</a>). This also has an impact on productivity and methane emission risks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above analysis suggests that the cost of feeds and feeding is important in farmersâ€™ decision-making process and choice of risk management strategies. Exploring this linkage is particularly critical with the rising need for inclusion of climate-related targets in SDGs and a more climate-oriented set of indicators as parts of systems for sustainable development and environmental quality.</p>
