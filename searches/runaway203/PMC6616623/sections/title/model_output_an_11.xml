 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use 31 CMIP5 climate models, utilizing the historical and future RCP8.5 first run from each model (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). This output has been obtained from the ESGF LLNL portal
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. We first base model selection on the availability of output, which originally results in 33 climate models. We use the first run from each climate model. We then discard GISS-E2-H model as it reaches ice-free conditions (defined by &lt;1 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> September SIE) before present under the RCP8.5 scenario, and CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 as it has the highest September SIE of all models during the historical period 1979–2004, making it inconsistent with observations. We interpolate all sea ice concentration (sic) model output to a common 1° × 1° latitude-longitude grid using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Interpolating modeled sic to a common grid has been previously performed in the literature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. We calculate September SIE for years 1979–2017, and 2006–2099 as the total area of all cells in the Northern Hemisphere with sic &gt; 0.15
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. To obtain GMST change to melt we use the global mean surface atmospheric temperature difference between the 5 years centered on the  year when Arctic first becomes ice-free, and the 1861–1890 preindustrial climatology for each model. These years were chosen because several models do not have data for the complete period 1850–1861. Before global averaging, we first bilinearly interpolate temperature fields to a 2° × 2° grid.

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use several observational sources for the Arctic September SIE. First, they include HadISST1 observations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span> for years 1979–2017. HadISST1 observations are in the form of monthly sea ice concentrations. We obtain SIE from these observations using the same procedure as used for the CMIP5 models. Second, we use version 3 NSIDC September SIE observations spanning years 1979–2017
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. Third, we utilize NSIDC Sea Ice Extent version 1
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span> for years 1979–2004. The differences in September SIE between the successive versions are small
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. For GMST observations (used to calculate the sea ice sensitivity) we use different randomly chosen realizations of HadCRUT4 dataset
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>. We use different realizations of the same dataset as opposed to using different products, because the difference between HadCRUT4 1979–2010 GMST trend, and the GISS and NCDC datasets, is small compared to HadCRUT4 trend’s own uncertainty range
