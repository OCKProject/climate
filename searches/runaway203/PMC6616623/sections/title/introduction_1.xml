  </span>. Yet, it is well known that such models are dependent, which complicates extracting probabilistic projection information from multi-model ensembles

  </span>. Model dependence can be defined rather qualitatively as sharing of code or belonging to the same modeling group

  </span> or some transformed low-dimensional space
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Ignoring the dependence is expected to disproportionately pull future probabilistic projections towards clusters of similar dependent models. In the worst-case scenario, the future projections may be centered on output from a large group of models which rely on the same erroneous code, yet little weight may be assigned to an independent correct model. This is one of the reasons Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has outright removed any probabilistic global multi-model climate projections from its Fifth Assessment Report

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fortunately, several new studies break important new ground
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. These results indeed show that ignoring model dependence can result in overconfidence and bias in the future projections
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Yet, these methods typically treat model dependence in a simplistic way, without considering higher-order dependence (e.g., dependence between three or more models) or relying on probability theory. Moreover, many studies additionally assume exclusivity, i.e., that only one of the models is correct, e.g., refs.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Hence, “the concept of independence has been frequently mentioned in climate science research, but has rarely been defined and discussed in a theoretically robust and quantifiable manner”

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we first mathematically define model dependence and model exclusivity. Then, we present a novel statistical approach that can test multiple dependent non-exclusive statistical hypotheses, and make probabilistic projections under such hypotheses using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The new approach differs from the traditionally used Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which assumes that hypotheses are exclusive. We apply the new method to provide the first multi-model probabilistic projections of the global mean surface temperature (GMST) change from the preindustrial period at which September Arctic sea ice will effectively disappear (thereafter called GMST change to melt). The projections are based on the output of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models. The method considers both model dependence and skill at capturing known present-day and uncertain future sea ice metrics. GMST change to melt, along with many other statistical model parameters, is jointly estimated using MCMC. Before making actual projections, we calibrate the method in a suite of observation system simulation experiments to provide approximately correct coverage of the 90% posterior credible intervals.</p>
