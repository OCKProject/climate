  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. As it can be seen in the figure, a few models attain considerable weights, while many models receive zero or near-zero weights. The model with the highest weight (model 11, GFDL-CM3), has the mean present-day SIE of 6.43 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, similar to the observed value of 6.40 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> used in this experiment; and the sea ice sensitivity of −2.87 million km

  <span class="sup">−1</span>, similar to the observations (−3.01 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> K
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The model with the second highest weight is HadGEM2-CC, while MRI-CGCM3 has the third highest weight. We note that the weights are a diagnostic of the method, and they are not needed to obtain the pdf of the future projections. Hence, the step of finding weights can be theoretically skipped if only the projections are needed.

    <p>Individual Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model weights for the HadISST_r51_anthro experiment. The weights incorporate both model performance at capturing present-day mean September Arctic sea ice extent and its sensitivity to global mean surface temperature. The experiment assumes that recent sea ice extent decline was solely anthropogenic. This figure illustrates the capacity of the proposed method to find probabilities (weights) for any individual hypothesis in a given hypothesis set. In this case, each hypothesis is that regarding model adequacy at representing Arctic sea ice extent. Weighting is an optional component of the method; should one be interested only in prediction of a new variable given a set of hypotheses, weighting can be skipped entirely</p>

  </div>. Notably, for the HadISST_r51_anthro experiment (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) the pair of 2nd and 11th models (ACCESS1.3 and GFDL-CM3) gets a high weight. These models produce relatively similar mean present-day SIE (5.62 and 6.43 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), future GMST change to melt (both 2.12 K), and present-day SIE sensitivity to temperature change (−3.08 and −2.87 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> K
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). These models have a similar ocean component: it is MOM4.1 for ACCESS1.3 and MOM4-based for GFDL-CM3. However, the sea ice models are not the same: CICE4.1 for ACCESS1.3 and GFDL Sea Ice Simulator (SIS) for GFDL-CM3

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Thus, our results indicate that models may exhibit similar behavior for reasons other than coming from the same modeling center. These other reasons include equifinality (different parameters and modeling structures resulting in the same output by chance), subtler sharing of ideas, using the same observational datasets for input parameter calibration, or a random realization of internal variability. However, our approach accounts for the observed and modeled uncertainty in mean present-day SIE due to internal variability.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A unique feature of our method is the capacity to obtain joint hypothesis probabilities for any desired hypothesis combination. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> illustrates this by showing joint weight of combinations of models 11, 18, and 20 with all other models. This triplet is chosen because of the inter-dependencies between these models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Specifically, these models are included in the top five most dependent model pairs. A combination of (2, 11, 18, 20) gets the highest combined weight (note also that the pair 2 and 11 is the most likely pair in the ensemble), and a combination (29, 11, 18, 20) gets the second highest combined weight (the pair 29 and 11 forms the second most likely pair in the ensemble).

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the probability of having exclusively one model being correct is higher than the probability of more than one model being correct. Specifically, about 1,200,000 of 1,900,000 MCMC samples correspond to just one correct model (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7a</a>) for the HadISST_r51_anthro. Nonetheless, the amount of samples corresponding to more than one model being correct is still considerable. For the progressively increasing number of models the joint model probability tends exponentially to zero (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7a</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparing the HadISST_r51_anthro and other experiments with two constraints to the NSIDC_mean_only experiment (where only one constraint is used), it appears that the model non-exclusivity may be more important in the one-constraint case. There are less instances of high pair weights once the second constraint is introduced (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), and the non-exclusive model probabilities appear lower (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). Moreover, in the NSIDC_mean_only experiment the number of MCMC samples with an exclusively one correct model is smaller than in the rest of the projection experiments. This suggests that using multiple constraints (at least in the context of introduced methodology) may provide key to reducing the impact of non-exclusivity. If this is indeed the case, then performing standard BMA using a large number of constraints may give reasonable results even without accounting for non-exclusivity. Testing this hypothesis should be the subject of future research.
