  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this study, we used the Earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-2 (
   <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
    <span class="italic">24</span>
   </a>), which incorporates the three-dimensional thermomechanical ice sheet model SICOPOLIS (
   <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
    <span class="italic">25</span>
   </a>). SICOPOLIS is a shallow ice approximation model, which treats marine ice by allowing grounded ice to propagate over the continental shelf. This enables the model to resemble to a good approximation the Earth ice cover during the Quaternary, including grounded marine ice, which is a considerable portion of the northern European ice cover during cold phases. SICOPOLIS is applied only to the NH with a spatial resolution of 1.5° × 0.75° and is fully interactively coupled to the low-resolution climate component and a model of deep permafrost (
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
    <span class="italic">39</span>
   </a>). Meltwater and iceberg fluxes directly affect ocean circulation. Forced by orbital variations and prescribed radiative forcing from greenhouse gases, the model has been applied to simulate the last eight glacial cycles (
   <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
    <span class="italic">13</span>
   </a>). CLIMBER-2 also includes a global carbon cycle model (
   <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
    <span class="italic">27</span>
   </a>) and has been the first model to reproduce the main characteristics of the last four glacial cycles with orbital forcing as the only prescribed external forcing (
   <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
    <span class="italic">26</span>
   </a>). Because CLIMBER-2 does not include methane and nitrous oxide cycles and does not account for these greenhouse gases in its radiative scheme, we made use of the fact that CO
   <sub>2</sub> is the dominant greenhouse gas and that, on orbital time scales, variations of the other two follow rather closely CO
   <sub>2</sub> during the past 800 ka (
   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
    <span class="italic">40</span>
   </a>). To account for the effect of methane and nitrous oxide on radiative forcing, we computed the effective CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration used in the radiative scheme of the model in such a way that radiative forcing of equivalent CO
   <sub>2</sub> exceeds radiative forcing of simulated CO
   <sub>2</sub> by 30% at any time (
   <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
    <span class="italic">26</span>
   </a>). Unlike the previous model version, the model used in this study also includes a fully interactive dust cycle model (
   <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
    <span class="italic">41</span>
   </a>), with the atmospheric dust load directly affecting the shortwave radiative balance of the atmosphere and dust deposition on snow reducing surface albedo. Benthic δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O is estimated from the modeled sea level, 
   <span class="italic">z</span>
   <sub>SL</sub>, and deep ocean temperature, 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>d</sub>, as follows: δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O = 4.0 − 0.22 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>d</sub> − 0.01 
   <span class="italic">z</span>
   <sub>SL</sub>. The temperature sensitivity factor is from (

   <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
    <span class="italic">43</span>
   </a>). Sea level is computed from the volume of modeled NH ice sheets assuming an additional 10% contribution from Antarctica. It has to be noted that this assumption rules out possible canceling NH/Southern Hemisphere precessional-phase contributions for δ

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transient simulations, splitting in time technique</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then used CLIMBER-2 to perform transient simulations of the past 3 Ma. In principle, it would be possible to perform one single transient simulation from 3 Ma ago to the present, but this would be impractical because of the long time (more than a month) it would take for a complete simulation. In addition, even very small imbalances in the carbon cycle would cause the model to drift away on such long time scales. We therefore applied a splitting in time technique, which consists of running many model simulations for 500 ka starting at different times from 3.25 Ma ago until 150 ka ago at time intervals of 100 ka. For all runs, the model was initialized using identical preindustrial interglacial conditions as described in (
   <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
    <span class="italic">26</span>
   </a>). All model runs were thus started from the same initial state of the climate-carbon cycle–ice sheet system, but with differing orbital configuration, regolith distribution, and volcanic CO
   <sub>2</sub> outgassing according to the initial astronomical time. We then discarded the initial 100 ka of each simulation as model spin-up and analyzed the remaining 400 ka (fig. S1).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The application of the time-splitting method generates an ensemble of model simulations that are (partly) overlapping in time and may not necessary converge to the same solution at all points in time. However, for spectral and wavelet analysis, a continuous time series is required. The simplest way to derive such a time series is by computing the mean over the ensemble members at each point in time. This is what is used in, e.g., 
   <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>. Using the ensemble median instead results in only small differences compared to the mean. The choice of the method to aggregate the ensemble simulations into one time series has therefore a negligible impact on the power and wavelet spectra.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regolith cover scenarios</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presence of regolith in our model has a dual effect on the ice sheets: (i) It enhances the velocity of ice sheet sliding over regions where the ice base is at its pressure melting point by a factor of 5, implying that basal velocity is five times higher for the same basal shear stress than for a sediment-free surface, roughly consistent with similar modeling approaches (
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
    <span class="italic">22</span>
   </a>), and (ii) it increases the production of glaciogenic dust around the margins of the ice sheets, which affects surface albedo and facilitates surface melt (
   <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">
    <span class="italic">45</span>
   </a>). The present-day regolith mask was derived from the sediment thickness dataset of (
   <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
    <span class="italic">20</span>
   </a>). Areas with sediment thickness larger than 100 m are assumed to be covered by regolith. The remaining areas, mainly large parts of North America and Scandinavia (fig. S3), are characterized by exposed crystalline bedrock. We assumed that the presently exposed bedrock areas are a result of glacial erosion by the Pleistocene ice flow associated with the waxing and waning of NH ice sheets and therefore considered all continents to be covered by regolith at 3 Ma ago, before the onset of NH glaciation. We then created 14 intermediate regolith masks by applying a two-dimensional backward diffusion process to the present-day regolith mask (fig. S3). Over Scandinavia, the applied diffusion coefficient is spatially uniform, while over North America, we started by diffusing the regolith mask northward from the southern margin of exposed bedrock until all continent is covered by regolith. In the resulting scenario, sediments were therefore first removed from the Arctic Archipelago, the area that we expect was the first to be affected by ice sheet growth at the onset of NH glaciation. Then, regolith was gradually removed in the area around the Hudson Bay and successively also further south and over Scandinavia. Some exposed bedrock is assumed to be present over Greenland at 3 Ma ago, but this assumption does not affect the results presented in the paper. With this procedure, we obtained the 16 regolith masks shown in fig. S3. By shifting these masks in time, we then created four scenarios that differ in the timing of regolith removal (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most recent reconstruction of pre-Quaternary geography (
   <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
    <span class="italic">46</span>
   </a>) indicates that the elevation was similar to present (no notable uplift during the past 3 Ma), but Hudson Bay and Canadian Arctic Archipelago were absent. Indirect data also suggest that the Hudson Bay only developed during the late Quaternary. These differences in geography do have some, but not critically important, impact on glacial cycles. However, the temporal evolution of geography is unknown, and we decided to prescribe present-day geography and elevation.

   <sub>2</sub> outgassing scenarios
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To control the mean atmospheric concentration of CO
   <sub>2</sub> in the model, we used small changes in the prescribed volcanic CO
   <sub>2</sub> outgassing. The present-day volcanic outgassing used in the model is 5.3 Tmol C/year, which is the value that balances the weathering rate (
   <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
    <span class="italic">26</span>
   </a>). The value of volcanic CO
   <sub>2</sub> outgassing for ~3 Ma ago has been derived from fitting modeling results to the benthic δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O stack. For that, we used an ensemble of transient model simulations initialized at 3.2 Ma ago and run for 500 ka driven by orbital variations, with continents fully covered by regolith and prescribed constant volcanic CO
   <sub>2</sub> outgassing ranging from 5.3 to 6.5 Tmol C/year. The different values of volcanic CO
   <sub>2</sub> outgassing lead to different modeled CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations. A best fit of modeled benthic δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O to the stack of (
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
    <span class="italic">3</span>
   </a>) during interglacials is used to constrain the value of CO
   <sub>2</sub> outgassing to 6.2 Tmol C/year for the time interval between 3 and 2.7 Ma ago. Some recent studies suggest that Antarctica could have contributed up to 20 m of sea-level equivalent during the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene (
   <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
    <span class="italic">47</span>
   </a>, 
   <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
    <span class="italic">48</span>
   </a>). That would translate in a ~0.2‰ reduction in δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O, which, in turn, would lead to lower volcanic CO
   <sub>2</sub> outgassing values ~6.0 Tmol C/year to be more appropriate for the early Pleistocene. As a consequence, modeled atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration would also be lower by ~30 ppm. We then constructed four different scenarios for the temporal evolution of volcanic CO
   <sub>2</sub> outgassing between 3 Ma ago and the present day. All scenarios consist of a long-term decrease from 6.2 Tmol C/year at 3 Ma ago to 5.3 Tmol C/year at present, but the timing and rate of the decrease vary between scenarios (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>). A decrease from 6.2 to 5.3 Tmol C/year corresponds to a decrease of less than 20%. Because even the value for the present-day volcanic outgassing is known with an uncertainty of more than 100% (~3 to 10 Tmol C/year) (
   <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
    <span class="italic">28</span>
   </a>), changes in volcanic outgassing represent a possible candidate to explain the long-term CO
   <sub>2</sub> decrease. However, the aim of our study is not to explain the causes of the CO
   <sub>2</sub> decrease, and other processes such as changes in weathering (
   <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
    <span class="italic">7</span>
   </a>) or organic carbon burial in deep-sea sediments (
   <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
    <span class="italic">29</span>
   </a>) would also be potential candidates to explain the long-term CO
   <sub>2</sub> decline.
