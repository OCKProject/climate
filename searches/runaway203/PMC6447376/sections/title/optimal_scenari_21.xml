 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the splitting in time technique described above, we then performed transient model simulations driven by orbital forcing and each of the 16 possible combinations of regolith removal and volcanic CO
  <sub>2</sub> outgassing scenarios. We then selected the scenarios that gave the best fit, in terms of root mean square error and correlation, between modeled and observed Î´

  <sub>2</sub> decrease and timing of regolith removal.
