 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then used CLIMBER-2 to perform transient simulations of the past 3 Ma. In principle, it would be possible to perform one single transient simulation from 3 Ma ago to the present, but this would be impractical because of the long time (more than a month) it would take for a complete simulation. In addition, even very small imbalances in the carbon cycle would cause the model to drift away on such long time scales. We therefore applied a splitting in time technique, which consists of running many model simulations for 500 ka starting at different times from 3.25 Ma ago until 150 ka ago at time intervals of 100 ka. For all runs, the model was initialized using identical preindustrial interglacial conditions as described in (

  </a>). All model runs were thus started from the same initial state of the climate-carbon cycleâ€“ice sheet system, but with differing orbital configuration, regolith distribution, and volcanic CO
  <sub>2</sub> outgassing according to the initial astronomical time. We then discarded the initial 100 ka of each simulation as model spin-up and analyzed the remaining 400 ka (fig. S1).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The application of the time-splitting method generates an ensemble of model simulations that are (partly) overlapping in time and may not necessary converge to the same solution at all points in time. However, for spectral and wavelet analysis, a continuous time series is required. The simplest way to derive such a time series is by computing the mean over the ensemble members at each point in time. This is what is used in, e.g., 
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>. Using the ensemble median instead results in only small differences compared to the mean. The choice of the method to aggregate the ensemble simulations into one time series has therefore a negligible impact on the power and wavelet spectra.
