 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presence of regolith in our model has a dual effect on the ice sheets: (i) It enhances the velocity of ice sheet sliding over regions where the ice base is at its pressure melting point by a factor of 5, implying that basal velocity is five times higher for the same basal shear stress than for a sediment-free surface, roughly consistent with similar modeling approaches (

  </a>), and (ii) it increases the production of glaciogenic dust around the margins of the ice sheets, which affects surface albedo and facilitates surface melt (

   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>). Areas with sediment thickness larger than 100 m are assumed to be covered by regolith. The remaining areas, mainly large parts of North America and Scandinavia (fig. S3), are characterized by exposed crystalline bedrock. We assumed that the presently exposed bedrock areas are a result of glacial erosion by the Pleistocene ice flow associated with the waxing and waning of NH ice sheets and therefore considered all continents to be covered by regolith at 3 Ma ago, before the onset of NH glaciation. We then created 14 intermediate regolith masks by applying a two-dimensional backward diffusion process to the present-day regolith mask (fig. S3). Over Scandinavia, the applied diffusion coefficient is spatially uniform, while over North America, we started by diffusing the regolith mask northward from the southern margin of exposed bedrock until all continent is covered by regolith. In the resulting scenario, sediments were therefore first removed from the Arctic Archipelago, the area that we expect was the first to be affected by ice sheet growth at the onset of NH glaciation. Then, regolith was gradually removed in the area around the Hudson Bay and successively also further south and over Scandinavia. Some exposed bedrock is assumed to be present over Greenland at 3 Ma ago, but this assumption does not affect the results presented in the paper. With this procedure, we obtained the 16 regolith masks shown in fig. S3. By shifting these masks in time, we then created four scenarios that differ in the timing of regolith removal (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most recent reconstruction of pre-Quaternary geography (
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
   <span class="italic">46</span>
  </a>) indicates that the elevation was similar to present (no notable uplift during the past 3 Ma), but Hudson Bay and Canadian Arctic Archipelago were absent. Indirect data also suggest that the Hudson Bay only developed during the late Quaternary. These differences in geography do have some, but not critically important, impact on glacial cycles. However, the temporal evolution of geography is unknown, and we decided to prescribe present-day geography and elevation.
