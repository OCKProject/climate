 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test the effect of a gradual CO
  <sub>2</sub> decrease on Quaternary climate dynamics, we use prescribed volcanic CO
  <sub>2</sub> outgassing to control the mean CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration in the model. Small changes in volcanic outgassing represent a possible candidate to explain a long-term CO
  <sub>2</sub> decrease, because even the value for the current volcanic outgassing is very uncertain (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). Alternatively, the same trend in CO
  <sub>2</sub> can be explained by a similarly small increase in average weathering rate and/or organic carbon burial in deep-sea sediments (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of the evidence for CO
  <sub>2</sub> decrease and regolith removal over the Quaternary, we created different scenarios for CO
  <sub>2</sub> outgassing and regolith distribution, which were then used to drive the model together with orbital variations (see Materials and Methods; 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, B and C</a>; and fig. S3). The need for these scenarios originates from the absence of appropriate models that can be used to simulate the evolution of these two factors on the million-year time scale. The initial and final values of volcanic outgassing are determined using an inverse modeling approach (see Materials and Methods), while the initial and final spatial distributions of regolith are either known from observation or strongly constrained by empirical data. Therefore, the scenarios differ only in their temporal evolution (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, B and C</a>). For each of the 16 different combinations of regolith and volcanic outgassing scenarios, we run the model over the past 3 Ma using the time-splitting technique and selected the best scenario by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed benthic δ
