 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question of whether glacial cycles are deterministic or stochastic has been highly debated, and a complete spectrum of opinions—from chaotic to perfectly deterministic—exists (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">

  </a>). In most cases, our model simulations that started at different points in time converge to one and the same solution (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> and fig. S1), close to reconstructions, providing a strong indication that glacial cycles are robust. The glacial cycles of the 41-ka world are particularly robust, which is expected because they represent a relatively linear response to variations in obliquity (

   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>). The 100-ka cycles appear to be less robust, because they involve a much more nonlinear response to orbital forcing. However, the good agreement between the bulk of the model simulations and the reconstructed glacial cycles evolution over the past 1 Ma (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>), except for MIS11, indicates that the observed realization was the most likely, although not the only possible one. This finding is fully consistent with that of Tzedakis
