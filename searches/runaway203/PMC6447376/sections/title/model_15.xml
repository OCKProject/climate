 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this study, we used the Earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-2 (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>), which incorporates the three-dimensional thermomechanical ice sheet model SICOPOLIS (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). SICOPOLIS is a shallow ice approximation model, which treats marine ice by allowing grounded ice to propagate over the continental shelf. This enables the model to resemble to a good approximation the Earth ice cover during the Quaternary, including grounded marine ice, which is a considerable portion of the northern European ice cover during cold phases. SICOPOLIS is applied only to the NH with a spatial resolution of 1.5° × 0.75° and is fully interactively coupled to the low-resolution climate component and a model of deep permafrost (
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>). Meltwater and iceberg fluxes directly affect ocean circulation. Forced by orbital variations and prescribed radiative forcing from greenhouse gases, the model has been applied to simulate the last eight glacial cycles (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>). CLIMBER-2 also includes a global carbon cycle model (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>) and has been the first model to reproduce the main characteristics of the last four glacial cycles with orbital forcing as the only prescribed external forcing (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). Because CLIMBER-2 does not include methane and nitrous oxide cycles and does not account for these greenhouse gases in its radiative scheme, we made use of the fact that CO
  <sub>2</sub> is the dominant greenhouse gas and that, on orbital time scales, variations of the other two follow rather closely CO
  <sub>2</sub> during the past 800 ka (
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>). To account for the effect of methane and nitrous oxide on radiative forcing, we computed the effective CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration used in the radiative scheme of the model in such a way that radiative forcing of equivalent CO
  <sub>2</sub> exceeds radiative forcing of simulated CO
  <sub>2</sub> by 30% at any time (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). Unlike the previous model version, the model used in this study also includes a fully interactive dust cycle model (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>), with the atmospheric dust load directly affecting the shortwave radiative balance of the atmosphere and dust deposition on snow reducing surface albedo. Benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O is estimated from the modeled sea level, 
  <span class="italic">z</span>
  <sub>SL</sub>, and deep ocean temperature, 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>d</sub>, as follows: δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O = 4.0 − 0.22 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>d</sub> − 0.01 
  <span class="italic">z</span>
  <sub>SL</sub>. The temperature sensitivity factor is from (
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
   <span class="italic">42</span>
  </a>), and the sea-level factor is from (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>). Sea level is computed from the volume of modeled NH ice sheets assuming an additional 10% contribution from Antarctica. It has to be noted that this assumption rules out possible canceling NH/Southern Hemisphere precessional-phase contributions for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and sea level (

   <span class="italic">33</span>

  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>) is computed as the annual average SST of the model grid cells that contain the sediment cores from which the stack of (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>) was derived. The SST computed this way turns out to differ substantially from the global SST in the model, particularly in the long-term trend.
