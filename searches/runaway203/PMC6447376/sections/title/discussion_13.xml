 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our transient modeling results demonstrate that both previously proposed mechanisms—regolith removal and gradual lowering of CO
  <sub>2</sub>—are essential to reproduce the realistic evolution of climate variability during the Quaternary, and their combination controls the timing of regime changes of climate variability. Note that a gradual change of the regolith cover causes a rather rapid (few hundred thousand years) transition from the 41- to 100-ka world, in good agreement with observational data. Simulated glacial cycles only weakly depend on initial conditions and therefore represent a quasi-deterministic response of the Earth system to orbital forcing. Our results also support the notion that the current CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration of more than 400 ppm is unprecedented over at least the past 3 Ma and that global temperature did not exceed the preindustrial value by more than 2°C during the Quaternary. In the context of future climate change, this implies that a failure in substantially reducing CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions to comply with the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming well below 2°C will not only bring Earth’s climate away from Holocene-like conditions but also push it beyond climatic conditions experienced during the entire current geological period.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of our study are based on an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, whose high computational efficiency needed for simulations on a million-year time scale is achieved by using a rather coarse spatial resolution and considerable simplifications in the description of individual processes, in particular atmospheric dynamics. Further progress in understanding of Quaternary climate dynamics would require the use of complex Earth system models. However, moving Quaternary modeling to a qualitatively new level would require not only the use of existing complex models but also substantial progress in modeling of ice sheet–solid Earth interaction (
