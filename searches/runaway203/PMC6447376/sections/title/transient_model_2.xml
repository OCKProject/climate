  </a>). It has been recently applied for simulating the last four glacial cycles with a fully interactive carbon cycle (

   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). There, we demonstrated that glacial lowering of atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> in the model is controlled by lowered sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and changes in ocean circulation, in particular enhancement of Antarctic bottom waters and decrease of deep ocean ventilation. Elevated carbonate weathering on exposed shelves and enhanced nutrient utilization in the Southern Ocean due to enhanced dust deposition also play important roles, especially toward glacial maxima (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). Reorganizations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during glacial terminations contribute substantially to deglacial CO
  <sub>2</sub> rise. The terrestrial carbon cycle, which includes novel components such as permafrost carbon, peat, and carbon buried under ice sheets, plays a minor role in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> dynamics on orbital time scales (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To perform multiple simulations covering the entire Quaternary, we use a novel technique of splitting long-term simulations over the past 3 Ma into shorter intervals. In total, we perform more than 1000 model simulations, each 500 ka long, starting from the same initial conditions but at different points in time (Materials and Methods and fig. S1). This approach allows us to analyze the robustness of glacial cycles by testing whether different simulations converge to the same solution, and also has the advantage that it reduces the potential problem with long-term model drifts in the global carbon cycle. Model drifts can occur because, in our modeling setup, the carbon cycle is not closed. There are geologic sinks (burial in ocean sediments) and sources (carbonate weathering and volcanic CO
  <sub>2</sub> outgassing), and even a tiny imbalance between them can cause a pronounced drift toward too high or too low CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations on time scales of millions of years.
