   <span class="bold">c</span>) CESM-LE 42 ensemble member mean VWS (solid lines) and the 25% and 75% ensemble spread (light solid lines) averaged over the same three regions. Shadings in all three panels indicate the amplitude of the VWS or potential intensity associated with average AMV in the U.S. East Coast (light blue), Gulf Coast (purple) and MDR (light green).
