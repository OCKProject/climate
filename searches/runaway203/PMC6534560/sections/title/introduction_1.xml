 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hurricanes are one of the most devastating and costly natural disasters to befall the United States coastal regions
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. They account for about 20% of the total billion dollars weather and climate related disasters and over 50% of the total loss in the U.S.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Previous studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span> have shown that there has been increased destruction associated with Atlantic hurricanes in the past few decades. How human activity may contribute to hurricane intensity change in the future, particularly landfalling hurricanes, is thus an extremely urgent question for society at large. The longer-term change in hurricane intensity in the observational record, however, is somewhat uncertain
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. The uncertainty is partly due to the lack of long reliable historical hurricane data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, and partly due to the large natural multidecadal variability in the North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST) that are known to affect hurricane activity in the tropical Atlantic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Large scale environmental variables, such as SST and vertical wind shear (VWS), are often used as a proxy for hurricane potential intensity (PI)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> and genesis
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, respectively. The VWS, defined as the magnitude of the vector wind difference between the upper (200 hPa) and lower (850 hPa) troposphere, is well known to affect hurricane activity on various time-scales, with weak VWS favorable for hurricane convective organization and intensification
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. A recent study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> noted that hurricane intensification rates near the U.S. southeast coast were suppressed in recent decades due to enhanced VWS. That study, as well as previous studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, further noted that there is a large decadal variation in the dominant mode of VWS, which is characterized by a dipole spatial pattern with one node along the U.S. East Coast and one in the tropical North Atlantic, or the hurricane main development region (MDR)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. The dipole structure also exists in the SST pattern, with slightly weaker warming in the region of increased VWS and stronger warming in the MDR. During the phase when the tropical Atlantic experiences weak VWS and warm SST, and thus greater hurricane activity in the MDR region, the U.S. coast is shielded from strong landfalling hurricanes due to the strong VWS and weak SST warming along the coastal regions. Thus the dipole mode provides a protective barrier to the U.S. East Coast when hurricanes are particularly active and strong in the tropical Atlantic MDR, which seems to be the case in recent decades. It is not clear, however, whether the dipole pattern and the related recent increases in VWS along the U.S. East Coast are driven entirely by natural decadal variability, or there may be contributions from anthropogenic forcing.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, it is essential to understand how landfalling hurricanes along the U.S. East Coast may change in the future as greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing increases. While it is certain that SST will continue to rise as a result of GHG forcing, it is not clear how VWS may respond to GHG forcing along the coastal regions. Using the IPCC AR4 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> Century projection of the tropical Atlantic VWS changes, Vecchi and Soden
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> projected an increase in VWS in the Atlantic MDR region by the end of the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> Century. They further attributed the VWS increase to the weakened Pacific Walker Circulation. Similar changes have been noted for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. In this study, we focus on the future changes in VWS in terms of their projection onto the VWS dipole pattern between the U.S. East Coast and the tropical Atlantic MDR
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> in the current climate. The main goal here is to distinguish the contribution to the dipole VWS pattern from anthropogenic forcing and natural decadal and multidecadal variability and the implication to hurricane intensification along the U.S. East Coast in the future.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examine the change in both hurricane potential intensity (PI) and VWS due to anthropogenic changes using CMIP5 coupled ocean atmosphere simulations as well as the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, in the presence of the background natural multidecadal variability. We address two related questions here: is the change over the past 70 years in hurricane PI and VWS along the U.S. East Coast dominated by anthropogenic forcing or natural multidecadal variability, and how would the future changes of these conditions impact hurricane intensity and formation in the region?
