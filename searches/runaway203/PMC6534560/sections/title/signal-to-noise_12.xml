  </span> to the global SST from multi-model CMIP5 or CESM-LE outputs. The S/N EOF method first applies a spatial pre-whitening transformation to the model SST aimed at removing the spatially coherent structure due to the internally-generated climate variability, which is defined by the modes of variability contained in the control simulations of the same set of models with pre-industrial radiative forcing. Thus the spatial and temporal variations in the ensemble average SST are purely caused by external radiative forcing after the pre-whitening. An EOF analysis is then applied to the pre-whitened multi-model ensemble average global SST and the first mode usually contains over 80% of the total forced variance. The first principal component (PC1) is then taken as representing the radiatively forced SST changes. The S/N EOF analysis here is applied to the ASO seasonal mean SST to extract the forced signal for the peak hurricane season. The North Atlantic SST in observations or each ensemble member at each grid point can then be separated into two components as follows:

  <sub>i,j</sub>(t) is the observed or modeled ASO seasonal mean SST at time t and grid point (i, j), α
  <sub>i,j</sub> is the regression coefficient between SST at that grid point and PC1, and ε

  <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">2</a>) forms the forced SST index and the second term the internally varying SST index. We apply a 10-year Butterworth filter to the SST data prior to the S/N EOF analysis, thus the internal variability component only contains those with time scale longer than 10-years, and is called Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, or AMV component, as shown in Supplementary Fig.

The spatial patterns of VWS, SST or hurricane PI can be obtained by regressing these fields onto the forced and AMV component of the corresponding observations or model ensembles.
