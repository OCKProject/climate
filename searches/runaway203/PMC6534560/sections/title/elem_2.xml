  <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first isolate the VWS and SST patterns that are externally forced due to radiative forcing change from those due to natural climate variability. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows the observed VWS and SST linearly regressed to the external radiative forcing component and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) for the period 1950 to 2015. The external radiative forcing and AMV here are defined using the signal-to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal function (SNEOF) analysis

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>. We also confirm the results in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> using the CESM-LE historical simulations with a total of 42 ensemble members started from slightly different initial conditions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span> (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Results in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> (and that in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>) indicate that the observed VWS dipole pattern during the peak hurricane season (August, September and October, or ASO), with enhanced shear along the U.S. East Coast and suppressed shear in the tropical North Atlantic, is primarily due to the positive phase of AMV. The contribution from anthropogenic and natural radiative forcing to the dipole pattern is rather weak during this period. The SST anomalies in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> indicate a basin-wide warming due to anthropogenic forcing and a horseshoe pattern with stronger warming in the tropical and midlatitude North Atlantic compared to that in the subtropical North Atlantic during AMV positive phase. Previous studies have shown that the warmer the SST the stronger the hurricane PI
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
   </span>. Thus Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> implies that when anthropogenic warming is combined with the positive phase of AMV, PI increases in the entire tropical North Atlantic. While the suppressed VWS in MDR enhances the possibility of hurricane formation and intensification, the stronger VWS along the U.S. East Coast suppresses the intensification rate in that region, consistent with Kossin
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>. In contrast, when the anthropogenic warming is combined with the negative phase of AMV, the SST warming in the basin is slightly dampened while the intensification rate along the U.S. coast is enhanced due to the suppressed VWS. In summary, AMV modulates considerably the hurricane activity in both the tropical North Atlantic where hurricanes often form, and the U.S. East Coast where hurricanes make landfall. When hurricane activity is enhanced in the MDR region during the positive phase of AMV, the intensification along the U.S. East Coast is often suppressed due to stronger VWS and less SST warming there, and vice versa. Thus the AMV-related dipole pattern in VWS and SST provides a natural protective barrier for the U.S. East Coast from strong hurricane intensification and landfalls.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">VWS forced by future anthropogenic radiative forcing</div>
  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The VWS has not been substantially influenced by the anthropogenic radiative forcing in the past few decades (see top left panel in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). However, as GHG forcing increases, the VWS associated with anthropogenic forcing may also increase in amplitude. To explore future changes in VWS and its relative role as compared to the AMV, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the CMIP5 multi-model mean (MMM) changes in VWS as the difference between two time periods, between 1971–2005 and 1871–1905 for the historical period, and between 2070–2099 and 1971–2000 for the two future scenarios (rcp4.5 and rcp8.5). As a comparison, we also average the periods identified as positive and negative AMV (defined as one standard deviation above or below the AMV index), and take the difference between the positive and negative phases to illustrate the VWS pattern associated with AMV. It is clear that the VWS patterns simulated by the model associated with AMV (right panels of Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) have a similar dipole structure to observations (lower left panel in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), with enhanced VWS along the U.S. coast and suppressed VWS in the tropical Atlantic MDR for positive AMV. The radiatively forced VWS change, however, paints a very different picture. Along the U.S. East Coast, the VWS shows an opposite sign to that corresponding to positive AMV, with suppressed VWS along the coastal region. In the tropical North Atlantic extending from the Caribbean to the Gulf of Mexico, the VWS is enhanced. However, the enhanced VWS in the tropical Atlantic is only limited to the western part of the MDR, with the exception of the historical period, when the intensified VWS extends to the central tropical Atlantic including most of the MDR region. The differences between historical and future scenarios may be linked to aerosol forcing, which is relatively strong during the historical period
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
   </span>. The forced patterns with enhanced VWS in the Caribbean region are somewhat similar to those shown in CMIP3 models
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span> and a subset of the CMIP5 models
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>. But the strong suppressed shear along the U.S. East Coast, although present in the CMIP3 models, is much stronger in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, particularly for the rcp8.5 future scenario. The implication of the anthropogenically forced future VWS suppression along the U.S. East Coast is that future hurricanes may go through stronger intensification and cause more powerful destructions when moving into the coastal region.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relative amplitude of VWS due to climate change and AMV</div>
  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the future, AMV modulation of the tropical cyclone activity as seen during the historical period should continue and the relative amplitude of the anthropogenically forced change and the AMV could help determine the projections of future hurricane activity. This relative relationship is illustrated in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a> which shows the area averaged VWS for three geographical regions, the U.S. East Coast (25N–40N, 80W–60W), the Gulf Coast (20–30N, 95W–82W), and the MDR, for 1900 to 2100. The future anthropogenic emissions following both the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 are included. The VWS associated with AMV is also indicated in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a> which illustrates the amplitude range of VWS due to AMV. While the magnitude of the MMM VWS associated with anthropogenic forcing is largely within the natural variability for the historical period, the decrease in the U.S. East Coast VWS (increase in the Gulf Coast) starts to dominate over the AMV VWS in the second half of the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> century. By the end of the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> century, the forced VWS in the coastal regions is almost twice as strong as that associated with the positive or negative phases of AMV, making possible for hurricanes to intensify faster along the U.S. East Coast (slower along the Gulf Coast). In the MDR, the VWS associated with AMV is rather large, and the increase in forced VWS only starts to dominate at the end of the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> Century. The model spread of the VWS is fairly large, indicated by the light solid lines showing the 25th to 75th percentile of models’ values. But for the U.S. East Coast, the majority of the models indicate decreased VWS with magnitude ranging from +0.5 m/s to −2 m/s at the end of the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> Century. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a> shows the VWS change in the CESM-LE. The ensemble spread in the single model is clearly much smaller than the multi-model spread in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>, with magnitude ranging from −1.5 m/s to −2.5 m/s at the end of the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> Century. The VWS change in the CESM-LE is at the high end of the model spectrum as can be seen comparing Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,c</a>. The MDR VWS changes show the largest multi-model spread and a relatively small amplitude. The large spread in this case is not surprising, as the spatial pattern in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> indicates a nodal point of VWS change in the MDR. The Gulf Coast shows an increase in VWS with the multi-model magnitude ranging from −0.5 m/s to +2 m/s. In the CESM-LE, both the MDR and the Gulf Coast show a similar magnitude increase in VWS with an ensemble range from +1 m/s to +2 m/s.

   </span>. For the PI, the multi-model spread is not as large as for VWS, showing a more robust SST warming in all models – the main driver of the PI change. The fast increase in PI along the U.S. East Coast, coupled with the more favorable wind shear environment for hurricane intensification there, suggests that hurricanes tracking toward the U.S. East Coast will have a better chance of achieving its PI in the future, which may be much stronger than what we’ve experienced in the past. For the Gulf Coast, the two effects, warmer SST and stronger wind shear, oppose each other. How future hurricane intensity may change there will depend on the relative influence of the two factors, leaving future projections of hurricane intensity along the Gulf Coast less certain.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Time of emergence of forced VWS signal relative to AMV</div>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time when anthropogenically forced VWS may be strong enough to erode the natural AMV-induced dipole VWS pattern in the future is of particular interest, as the AMV dipole pattern provides a natural protection to the U.S. East Coast hurricane intensification during active MDR tropical cyclone epochs. Based on CMIP5 MMM, the anthropogenic forced VWS will reach a similar amplitude as that due to AMV by around 2050. However, the multi-model spread is large and thus the time of emergence differs widely from model to model. Using Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>, the CESM-LE VWS change indicates that by 2020, the anthropogenic forced VWS will reach the same amplitude as that due to AMV, and by 2050, the forced VWS will be twice as strong as that associated with AMV. This suggests that anthropogenic forcing will substantially erode the natural protection of AMV to the U.S. East Coast hurricane activity by 2050. The AMV amplitude is relatively weak in the Gulf Coast region, thus anthropogenic forcing will not substantially change the natural variability of the hurricanes moving into that region. There, as shown earlier, the relative role of the increasing PI and enhanced VWS may cancel out some of the future changes in hurricane intensity and which factor may prevail is an interesting question to explore further. For the MDR region, where AMV amplitude is rather large, and the anthropogenic influence on PI and VWS also oppose each other, we expect that the natural variability of hurricane activity may continue to dominate into the future.

The northward shift of the jet is clearly seen at both the upper and lower levels and in the Atlantic and the Pacific regions. There is also a clear indication of a southward flow at the lower level and northward flow at the upper level, implying an enhanced and northward extended Hadley circulation, at least in the tropical North Atlantic. Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a> strongly suggests that not only the VWS decreases along the U.S. East Coast, but this is also the case for the East Coast of Asia, where one might expect that in the future typhoons would intensify more than in the historical climate and reach higher potential intensity values.
