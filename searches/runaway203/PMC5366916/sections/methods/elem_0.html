         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the QRA detection scheme of Kornhuber 
            <span>et al</span>.
            <a>3</a> but in this case applied it to near-surface temperature rather than upper level winds,
            to develop a zonal mean QRA temperature fingerprint. We used the Jun-Aug (JJA) 1979–2015
            ERA interim reanalysis (2.5° × 2.5°). Near-surface atmospheric temperature profiles
            were calculated using z = 1000 mb daily data over the full Northern Hemisphere (0°N–90°N)
            in 37 steps (2.5°). We focused on long duration (≥10 days) wavenumber 7 events to
            define QRA-favorable time intervals, and confined zonal-mean profiles to the mid-latitude
            latitude range (25N–75N) analyzed in previous work
            <a>1</a><a>2</a><a>3</a>. Such events have been shown to be closely related to Northern Hemisphere JJA heat
            extremes
            <a>24</a>. The fingerprint was interpolated to a 5° latitude grid that is consistent with the
            grid of the model simulations and observational datas (see below) and centered on
            zero. This yields an 11 element zero-centered row vector that defines the QRA fingerprint.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projection of the fingerprint was estimated in both CMIP5 simulated (see below)
            and observational (see below) datasets through linear regression of the 11 element
            row vectors defined by the individual yearly (JJA) model or observational zonal mean
            surface temperatures onto the QRA fingerprint defined above.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CMIP5 Historical Simulations</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical experiment
            <a>38</a> multimodel ensemble simulations, including both the anthropogenic+natural forced
            simulations (
            <span>N</span> = 164 realizations; 
            <span>M</span> = 48 models) and anthropogenic-only forced simulations (
            <span>N</span> = 40 realizations; 
            <span>M</span> = 10 models) spanning 1861–2005 (
            <a>Table S1</a>). Each physics version of a model was considered a separate model. The analysis was
            limited to the common time period of overlap for all models and realizations (1861–2005).
            Those with a start year later than 1861 were not included in the analysis.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational Surface Temperatures</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed zonal mean boreal summer (JJA) average temperatures (Surface Air Temperature
            over land and Sea Surface Temperature over oceans) using each of three alternative
            datasets: GISTEMP
            <a>39</a> (1880–2015), HadCRUT4
            <a>40</a> (1894–2015) and Cowtan &amp; Way
            <a>41</a> (1894–2015). These three different datasets make alternative assumptions about how
            to account for historical data gaps, which is particularly important in the Arctic
            region that is key to this study, due to the large spatial gaps in this region coupled
            with the amplified high-latitude warming in the Northern Hemisphere in recent decades.
            The time period of analysis was constrained by continuous data availability for each
            latitude band. For example, the HadCRUT4 and Cowtan &amp; Way datasets contain at least
            one grid cell temperature value in each latitude band across the range of interest
            (25–75N) from 1894 to present. Accordingly, the grid cell coverage is relatively sparse
            in the early segments of the records and increases toward present day.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with the model output, we used a simple area-weighted average to create zonal means

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trend Assessment</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linear trends for both simulations and observations were computed based on ordinary
            least squares (OLS) using the post-1970 interval of dominant anthropogenic forcing.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the observational series, trends were calculated both for the 1970–2005 (
            <span>N</span> = 36) interval of overlap with the CMIP5 historical simulations, and for the longer
            1970–2015 (
            <span>N</span> = 46 years) updated to include the most recent decade of observations. In both cases,
            
            <span>p</span> values were assessed by taking into account reduced degrees of freedom owing to serial
            correlation of regression residuals via 
            <span>N</span>’ = 
            <span>N</span>(1 − 
            <span>ρ</span>)/(1 + 
            <span>ρ</span>) where 
            <span>ρ</span> is the lag-one autocorrelation coefficient of the actual series (
            <a>Table 1</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the CMIP5 multimodel mean all-forcing and anthropogenic-only series, trends over
            1970–2005 (
            <span>N</span> = 36) and statistical significance were assessed as described above.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also diagnosed trends for the full CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, assessing the +/−1
            sigma range (or more precisely, the 16%ile and 84%ile of the distribution, which is
            slightly asymmetric with respect to the mean) across the ensemble as reported in 
            <a>Table 1</a>. We also calculated, as a measure of robustness across the multi-model ensemble,
            the percent of ensemble members (“% &gt; 0” in 
            <a>Table 1</a>) with positive trends and performed Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 realizations)
            modeling each multi-model ensemble member fingerprint series as AR(1) red noise (preserving
            the standard deviation and lag-one autocorrelation of the series). Using the distribution
            among the Monte Carlo surrogates of the 1970–2005 trends across the multimodel ensemble,
            we then assessed 
            <span>p</span> values for the “% &gt; 0” statistic (the minimum possible 
            <span>p</span> value calculable using 10,000 surrogates is 10
            <span>−4</span>).
