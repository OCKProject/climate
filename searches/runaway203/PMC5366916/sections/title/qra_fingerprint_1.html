      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the QRA detection scheme of Kornhuber 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <a>3</a> but in this case applied it to near-surface temperature rather than upper level winds,
         to develop a zonal mean QRA temperature fingerprint. We used the Jun-Aug (JJA) 1979–2015
         ERA interim reanalysis (2.5° × 2.5°). Near-surface atmospheric temperature profiles
         were calculated using z = 1000 mb daily data over the full Northern Hemisphere (0°N–90°N)
         in 37 steps (2.5°). We focused on long duration (≥10 days) wavenumber 7 events to
         define QRA-favorable time intervals, and confined zonal-mean profiles to the mid-latitude
         latitude range (25N–75N) analyzed in previous work
         <a>1</a><a>2</a><a>3</a>. Such events have been shown to be closely related to Northern Hemisphere JJA heat
         extremes
         <a>24</a>. The fingerprint was interpolated to a 5° latitude grid that is consistent with the
         grid of the model simulations and observational datas (see below) and centered on
         zero. This yields an 11 element zero-centered row vector that defines the QRA fingerprint.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projection of the fingerprint was estimated in both CMIP5 simulated (see below)
         and observational (see below) datasets through linear regression of the 11 element
         row vectors defined by the individual yearly (JJA) model or observational zonal mean
         surface temperatures onto the QRA fingerprint defined above.
