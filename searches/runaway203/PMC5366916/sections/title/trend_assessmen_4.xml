 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linear trends for both simulations and observations were computed based on ordinary least squares (OLS) using the post-1970 interval of dominant anthropogenic forcing.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the observational series, trends were calculated both for the 1970–2005 (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 36) interval of overlap with the CMIP5 historical simulations, and for the longer 1970–2015 (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 46 years) updated to include the most recent decade of observations. In both cases, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> values were assessed by taking into account reduced degrees of freedom owing to serial correlation of regression residuals via 
  <span class="italic">N</span>’ = 
  <span class="italic">N</span>(1 − 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span>)/(1 + 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span>) where 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span> is the lag-one autocorrelation coefficient of the actual series (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the CMIP5 multimodel mean all-forcing and anthropogenic-only series, trends over 1970–2005 (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 36) and statistical significance were assessed as described above.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also diagnosed trends for the full CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, assessing the +/−1 sigma range (or more precisely, the 16%ile and 84%ile of the distribution, which is slightly asymmetric with respect to the mean) across the ensemble as reported in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>. We also calculated, as a measure of robustness across the multi-model ensemble, the percent of ensemble members (“% &gt; 0” in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>) with positive trends and performed Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 realizations) modeling each multi-model ensemble member fingerprint series as AR(1) red noise (preserving the standard deviation and lag-one autocorrelation of the series). Using the distribution among the Monte Carlo surrogates of the 1970–2005 trends across the multimodel ensemble, we then assessed 
  <span class="italic">p</span> values for the “% &gt; 0” statistic (the minimum possible 
  <span class="italic">p</span> value calculable using 10,000 surrogates is 10
  <span class="sup">−4</span>).
