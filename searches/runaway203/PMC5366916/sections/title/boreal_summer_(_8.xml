 <div class="title">Boreal Summer (JJA) Zonal Mean Temperature Profiles.</div>
 <p>Shown are (
  <span class="bold">a</span>) JJA 1000 mb temperatures from ERA reanalysis data (1979–2015) for both climatological mean and QRA-favorable conditions (at 2.5° latitudinal resolution), (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) The difference between the two i.e. the anomalous zonal mean temperature profile associated with QRA-favorable conditions, (
  <span class="bold">c</span>) The QRA fingerprint defined as the former quantity, confined to the extatropical region 25–75N, centered on zero, and interpolated onto 5° latitudinal grid commensurate with model simultions, and (
  <span class="bold">d</span>) the associated meridional temperature gradient.
