      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical experiment
         <a>38</a> multimodel ensemble simulations, including both the anthropogenic+natural forced
         simulations (
         <span>N</span> = 164 realizations; 
         <span>M</span> = 48 models) and anthropogenic-only forced simulations (
         <span>N</span> = 40 realizations; 
         <span>M</span> = 10 models) spanning 1861–2005 (
         <a>Table S1</a>). Each physics version of a model was considered a separate model. The analysis was
         limited to the common time period of overlap for all models and realizations (1861–2005).
         Those with a start year later than 1861 were not included in the analysis.
