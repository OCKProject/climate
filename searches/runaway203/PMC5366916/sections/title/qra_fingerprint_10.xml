 <p>Shown for both the (

  <span class="bold">b</span>) anthropogenic-only simulations is the QRA series for each member of the multimodel ensemble (colored curves) along with the multimodel mean (black) series. The corresponding multimodel mean QRA series are shown along with the exatropical mean temperatures series for the (
  <span class="bold">c</span>) all forcing and (
