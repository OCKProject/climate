            ensemble (colored curves) along with the multimodel mean (black) series. The corresponding
            multimodel mean QRA series are shown along with the exatropical mean temperatures
            series for the (
            <span>c</span>) all forcing and (
            <span>d</span>) anthropogenic-only simulations, along with the linear trend over 1970â€“2005 (red
            line).
