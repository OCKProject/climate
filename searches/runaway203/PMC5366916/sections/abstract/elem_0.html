      <p>Persistent episodes of extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere summer have been
         shown to be associated with the presence of high-amplitude quasi-stationary atmospheric
         Rossby waves within a particular wavelength range (zonal wavenumber 6–8). The underlying
         mechanistic relationship involves the phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA)
         of synoptic-scale waves with that wavenumber range becoming trapped within an effective
         mid-latitude atmospheric waveguide. Recent work suggests an increase in recent decades
         in the occurrence of QRA-favorable conditions and associated extreme weather, possibly
         linked to amplified Arctic warming and thus a climate change influence. Here, we isolate
         a specific fingerprint in the zonal mean surface temperature profile that is associated
         with QRA-favorable conditions. State-of-the-art (“CMIP5”) historical climate model
         simulations subject to anthropogenic forcing display an increase in the projection
         of this fingerprint that is mirrored in multiple observational surface temperature
         datasets. Both the models and observations suggest this signal has only recently emerged
         from the background noise of natural variability.
