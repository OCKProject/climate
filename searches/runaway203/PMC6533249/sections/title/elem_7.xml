 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">IDF curves for observed rainfall indicate that around 162% increase in the intensity of rainfall from 2 year to 100 year return period. Comparison between observed and projected IDF curves under changing climate scenario shows that there is an increase of 12% intensity for 2 year return period rainfall and 87% increase for 100 year return period. The assessment of Velachery drainage system response to storm events of various return periods under present and future climate change scenarios idendifies the vulnerable hot-spots including critically flooded channels and outflows. The highest peak discharge is observed in Outfall 1 which is located near to Velachery lake and joins with Pallikarani marshland. Maximum flooding is noticed at junction VB-179 which is located very near to Velachery Lake. Out of 234 nodes/junctions, 9 nodes are identified as hotspots and flooding noticed under all storm events. These nodes are inundated for nearly 24 hours. Proper maintenance should be taken routinely inorder to make a free way to drain out the flow and to avoid the blockages in storm drains. It will help to reduce the detention period. Construction of the new road should not obstruct the passage or the inlet of the storm drains. Storm drains constructed in some places should be redesigned to cope with future flood events. Increasing size of the Okkiam Maduvu weir width from 120 m to 200 m, will reduce the depth of the flow over the weir from 3.43 m to 2.44 m for 100 yr return period rainfall thus reducing the backwater effect. At Okkiam Maduvu, minimum width of 200 m in the downstream channel is essential to ensure the free flow of flood water. The carrying capacity of the channel may be improved by removing vegetation and blockages and lining with stone pitching.</p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study provides a holistic approach to study flood management through integrating the climate knowledge with the flood frequency of Chennai. The present study undertakes a hybrid approach by combining climate scenarios with urban storm drainage network to address the pluvial flooding problem of the study area. There is a good agreement with the data analyzed on climate extremities and frequency of urban flooding. The successful incorporation of the scientifically reliable climate information in hydrologic and hydraulic models demonstrates the versatility of this technique for site specific flood management studies. Moreover, in this study, hydrologic and hydraulic modelling are well supported with strong field data and actual flow measurements. This work uses high resolution DEM (10 m resolution) procured from National Remote Sensing Center. However it is desirable to have fine resolution DEM preferably with sub meter accuracy which can be opted better results. Besides, incorporating real time flood forecasting with Low Impact Development (LID) practices such as permeable pavements, rain gardens, green roofs, street planters, rain barrels, infiltration trenches and vegetative swales in Hydrologic modelling in future studies will provide more accurate and effective flood management system.</p>

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The critical rainfall events and different physical characteristics are used to describe the response of Velachery drainage system. The present study uses GCMs for future climate scenarios, HEC-HMS model for watershed runoff and SWMM for storm drainage network to estimate the discharge and flooded areas of Velachery zone and to suggest mitigation measures.</p>

  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The past rainfall data for the period (rainfall 1975–2015) were procured from Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), India Meteorological Department (IMD), Chennai. The occurrence of extreme events were calculated based on IMD norms. The extremely heavy rainfall event (&gt;244.5 mm/day) and very heavy rainfall event (&gt;124.5 mm/day) for the period of 1975–2015 were calculated. Potential anthropogenic climate change scenarios of future and their underlying driving forces are always an important component of any impact assessments. The driving forces are well captured and updated in IPCC’s continuous assessment reports and in Global Climate Models (GCM). The recent IPCC AR5 adopted Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) to illustrate the concentration of future anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions via., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5. RCP 2.6 is peak scenario and represents very low greenhouse gas concentration levels. RCP 4.5 is balanced mitigation scenario or stabilization scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized before the year 2100 by the employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. RCP 6.0 is stabilization scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized before 2100 without overshoot employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. RCP 8.5 is business-as-usual scenario leading to high greenhouse gas concentration levels

Physical characteristics such as the river length and slope, the sub-basin centroid location and elevation, the longest flow path for each sub-basin, and the length along the stream path are extracted using ArcGIS

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence HEC-HMS model was used for runoff simulation at Okkiyam Maduvu and then calculate the carrying capacity of the channel to drain the storm water into Buckingham canal. The watershed delineation for Okkiyam Maduvu was done using CartoDEM. The basin model created using HEC-GeoHMS was imported to HEC-HMS model. The land use data, hydrologic soil group and curve numbers were given as inputs for HEC-HMS model. The peak discharge calculated from the model simulation was used to evaluate the carrying capacity of Okkiyam Maduvu and possible mitigation measures were suggested. Based on this peak discharge, adequate width required to reduce the flood depth through Okkiyam Maduvu was calculated using the formula for rectangular weir (Eq.
