 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rainfall extremities are one of the major concerns of changing the climate. The occurrences of extreme events in the study area were calculated based on Indian Meteorological Department norms. The extremely heavy rainfall event (&gt;244.5 mm/day) and very heavy rainfall event (&gt;124.5 mm/day) for the period of 1975–2015 were calculated. The results show that the occurrence of the extremely heavy rainfall events and very heavy rainfall events are increasing in recent years. Out of 46 occurrences of very rainfall events, 15 events recorded within the period 2000–2015. Eight extreme heavy rainfall events occurred during 1975–2015. In 1976 extremely heavy rainfall event was recorded with the intensity of 346.6 mm/day and 345.1 mm/day was recorded in 2015. Rainfall data from the 4 GCM (Global Climate Models) models for the period 2015–2085 were estimated to project the future rainfall trends are shown in Fig.
