 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CartoDEM data of 10â€‰m resolution was procured from National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad. Nearly 4 tiles which covered the study area were obtained. All the procured tiles were merged with a mosaic option in ERDAS IMAGINE and geo-corrected in ArcGIS 10.1 software. Velachery ward maps (ward nos. 177, 178 and 179) were collected from Corporation of Chennai. Using ward maps as base, the administrative boundary layer of the study area was digitized using 1:50000 scale toposheet (66 D1 &amp; D5) which were from Survey of India. This map was used to clip study area from the DEM. Both DEM and boundary map were used to delineate the sub-catchments using ArcGIS. Terrain characteristics like slope were derived from DEM and used for further hydrological modelling. The impervious areas were marked using Google Earth and percentage imperviousness was calculated.</p>
