 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, peak discharge has increased about 185% from 2 year to 100 year return period. To reduce the flood depth, the width of the weir can be increased. Hence, it is suggested to increase the width of weir from 120 m to 200 m. Thus, it can significantly reduce the flood depth by increasing the width of Okkiyam Maduvu in order to cope with extreme events. A minimum width of 200 m in the downstream channel is required to ensure the free flow of flood water. The head over the weir for 2 year return period is 1.45 m when the channel width is 120 m and when the channel width is increased to 200 m the head is decreased by 42 cm. For 100 year return period, flood depth would decrease by 85 cm when the width of the channel is increased from 120 m to 200 m.
