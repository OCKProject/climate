  <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rainfall extremities are one of the major concerns of changing the climate. The occurrences of extreme events in the study area were calculated based on Indian Meteorological Department norms. The extremely heavy rainfall event (&gt;244.5 mm/day) and very heavy rainfall event (&gt;124.5 mm/day) for the period of 1975–2015 were calculated. The results show that the occurrence of the extremely heavy rainfall events and very heavy rainfall events are increasing in recent years. Out of 46 occurrences of very rainfall events, 15 events recorded within the period 2000–2015. Eight extreme heavy rainfall events occurred during 1975–2015. In 1976 extremely heavy rainfall event was recorded with the intensity of 346.6 mm/day and 345.1 mm/day was recorded in 2015. Rainfall data from the 4 GCM (Global Climate Models) models for the period 2015–2085 were estimated to project the future rainfall trends are shown in Fig.

  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Design storms were estimated for different return periods under past and future scenarios. IDF (Intensity Duration Frequency) curves were developed for observed (historical climate) and 4 GCMs of RCP 4.5 pathway (projected climate scenarios) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). IDF curves were developed for 5 different durations (1 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h) with 5 return periods of 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 years for observed and projceted climate scenario. Therefore, 25 annual maximum time series were used for the frequency analysis to develop the IDF curves. The result shows that the intensity of rainfall for 2 year return period is 33.57 mm/hr under observed climate. Similarly, for 10 year return period, the intensity is 57.89 mm/hr and 88.22 mm/hr intensity is estimated for 100 year return period rainfall. Intensities for 2 year return period for models cesm1_cam5, mpi_esm_mr, ncar_ccsm4, bnu_esm are 37.61 mm/hr, 33.32 mm/hr, 36.50 mm/hr and 36.03 mm/hr respectively. Intensities for 100 year return periods are 165.67 mm/hr, 126.6 mm/hr, 117.75 mm/hr and 130.79 mm/hr. These estimated time series were used in the model for the simulation process.

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Delineation of the sub-catchment was done by using ArcSWAT in ArcGIS software (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The total watershed area is 697.1 ha and further delineated to 121 smaller sub-catchments. The parameter details like area, width, imperviousness rate and average slope were derived from these sub-catchments. Nearly 88.5% area is impervious and the elevation ranges from 1.87 m to 13.2 m. Performance of the storm drain in the study area was analyzed by simulating the model for rainfall of 5 different return periods as (2 yr, 5 yr, 10 yr, 50 yr and 100 yr). Likewise, the model was used to simulate for future projected rainfall data. All the inputs except design storm were same for all the simulations. The simulation results on rainfall, infiltration, runoff and inflow/outflow for the conveyance system show that most of the rainfall in the study area is converted into a surface runoff. For 2 yr return period the simulated runoff is 32.402 mm for a given rainfall of 33.567 mm. Infiltration loss is only 0.455 mm due to the imperviousness of the study area. Similarly from 88.223 mm rainfall, 87.292 mm is converted into a surface runoff for 100 yr return period. Final surface storage is ranged from 0.847 to 0.894 mm for 2 to 100 yr return period. The result shows that infiltration is very less due to high imperviousness of the study area. Surface storage also very less due to flat terrain. Most of the rainfall results into surface runoff because the capacity of the storm drains is inadequate for intense rainfall and flooding takes place.

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Outfall 1 is the major outlet. This outlet is located near Velacherry railway station and joins with Pallikaranai marshland. Most of the storm drains in the study area are connected to outfall 1. (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The model predicts a total peak discharge as 13.918 m
   <span class="sup">3</span>/sec for 2 year return period rainfall and 52% of the total peak discharge is from outfall 1 as 7.29 m
   <span class="sup">3</span>/sec. Total peak discharge is recorded as 21.9 m
   <span class="sup">3</span>/sec for 100 year return period rainfall at outfall 1 which is 64% in total peak discharge from the study area. Out of 4 outfalls, outfall 1, 2 and 4 joins with the Pallikaranai marshland and outfall 3 is connected with Buckingham canal. The maximum flooding occurred at junction VB-179 which was located in 100 ft road very near to Velachery lake and the flow rate was 36.554 m
   <span class="sup">3</span>/s. Nearly 15 nodes were flooded for many hours for even a 2 year return period rainfall. There was little inflow in 48 nodes due to the elevation change. It shows that the existing storm drains are poorly designed and constructed. Reconstruction of the drains according to the flow routing of that area will reduce the flood risk and will minimize the flooding duration.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> shows the number of nodes flooded for different return periods under observed and projected climate scenarios. Duration of flooding were categorized as 0–5 h, 5–10 h, 10–15 h, 15–20 h and &gt;20 h. A number of nodes flooded for different return periods of observed climate were compared with GCMs models results. The number of nodes flooded are increased with the increase in return period. Nearly 23 nodes were flooded for about 5 hours for a 2 year return period and nearly 50 nodes were flooded for the 100 year return period. Some of the nodes idenfied flooding nearly 1 day for all the return period under observed and projected climate scenarios. These vulnerable nodes were located near Taramani link road connecting with Velachery main road towards Tambaram. During rainy days these places have been noticed severely affected by floods for many hours and sometimes for days. Inundated water stagnation on the roads create a heavy traffic jam and also spread waterborne diseases.

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The result clearly shows that the existing storm drain network cannot withstand even for a 2 year return period rainfall. In some places, the inlets of the storm drains are either blocked with debris or blocked by elevated roads. Due to this, the surface runoff could neither enter nor freely flow into the storm drains. The inadequacy of the storm drains along with poor maintenance increases the duration of ponding.</p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among conduits, L32B-179, L23–177, Loe-178, Lof-178, Lod-178, out-178, out-179 attained maximum/full depth. Based on the observed condition, 84 conduits attained full depth for 2 year return period. It may increase up to 88 conduits under projected cliamte scenario. For 100 year return period, 111 conduits surcharged under the observed condition and 121 for projected future climate scenario. The number of nodes that surcharge are 51, 58, 60, 78 and 81 for rainfall of return periods 2 yr, 5 yr, 10 yr, 50 yr and 100 yr respectively.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, peak discharge has increased about 185% from 2 year to 100 year return period. To reduce the flood depth, the width of the weir can be increased. Hence, it is suggested to increase the width of weir from 120 m to 200 m. Thus, it can significantly reduce the flood depth by increasing the width of Okkiyam Maduvu in order to cope with extreme events. A minimum width of 200 m in the downstream channel is required to ensure the free flow of flood water. The head over the weir for 2 year return period is 1.45 m when the channel width is 120 m and when the channel width is increased to 200 m the head is decreased by 42 cm. For 100 year return period, flood depth would decrease by 85 cm when the width of the channel is increased from 120 m to 200 m.
