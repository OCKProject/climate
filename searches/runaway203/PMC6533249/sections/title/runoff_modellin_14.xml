 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The runoff from Velachery zone discharges into Pallikaranai marshland. Pallikaraani marshland receives run-off from its adjoining catchment including Velachery, Madipakkam, and Perumbakkam etc., the storm water then passes through the Okkiyam Maduvu channel. Okkiyam Maduvu is a 2.8 kilometers long water channel originates as a narrow canal from the Pallikaranai marshland and drains into the Buckingham canal which flows south and enters the Kovalam estuary as shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. However, modelling of urban drainage system needs integrated modelling while considering flood mitigation measures for Velachery, peak discharge at Okkiyam Maduvu, is essential.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. The inputs to the model include land use information, hydrologic soil group and rainfall. Physical characteristics such as the river length and slope, the sub-basin centroid location and elevation, the longest flow path for each sub-basin, and the length along the stream path are extracted using ArcGIS

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. The impact of climate change on the basin hydrology is examined by comparing the present and future streamflow using HEC-HMS. The simulations are carried out using statistically downscaled Global Climate Models (GCM) models to determine the future climate impacts on the flow

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence HEC-HMS model was used for runoff simulation at Okkiyam Maduvu and then calculate the carrying capacity of the channel to drain the storm water into Buckingham canal. The watershed delineation for Okkiyam Maduvu was done using CartoDEM. The basin model created using HEC-GeoHMS was imported to HEC-HMS model. The land use data, hydrologic soil group and curve numbers were given as inputs for HEC-HMS model. The peak discharge calculated from the model simulation was used to evaluate the carrying capacity of Okkiyam Maduvu and possible mitigation measures were suggested. Based on this peak discharge, adequate width required to reduce the flood depth through Okkiyam Maduvu was calculated using the formula for rectangular weir (Eq.
