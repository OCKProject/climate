 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The critical rainfall events and different physical characteristics are used to describe the response of Velachery drainage system. The present study uses GCMs for future climate scenarios, HEC-HMS model for watershed runoff and SWMM for storm drainage network to estimate the discharge and flooded areas of Velachery zone and to suggest mitigation measures.</p>
