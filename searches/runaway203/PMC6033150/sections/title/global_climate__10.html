      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “Dust Bowl” droughts ended with the onset of a strong El Niño event in the tropical
         Pacific in 1939/1940. El Niño conditions then predominated for the next 3 years. During
         this period, global climate anomalies emerged, including cold winters in Europe (see
         below), warm winters in Alaska, wet springs in central Europe, a drought in Australia
         and warm conditions in West Antarctica (Steig et al., 
         <a>2013</a>). In the stratosphere, total column ozone was extremely high over Europe, the Arctic,
         North America, and East Asia.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of these observed climatic anomalies (including the change in ozone and the cold
         winters in Europe) could have been contributed to by the strong, long‐lasting El Niño
         event (Brönnimann et al., 
         <a>2004</a>) combined with negative NAO conditions (which could have been made more likely by
         El Niño's imprint in the North Pacific [Li &amp; Lau, 
         <a>2012</a>]). Planetary wave activity appeared to have increased, weakening the stratospheric
         polar vortex and increasing poleward transport of ozone.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of World War II, and changes in observational coverage and observational practice
         (in particular SSTs), the data uncertainty is unfortunately rather large in these
         years. Nevertheless, a recent experimental reanalysis incorporating surface and upper‐air
         data (Hersbach et al., 
         <a>2017</a>) confirmed the anomalies in atmospheric circulation.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of the circulation features are also successfully modeled in atmospheric model
         simulations driven by SSTs. The strong but southward shifted Hadley cell and positive
         PNA mode are well reproduced, for instance, in ERA‐20CM (Figure 
         <a>S7</a>). Models typically also produce cold winters in Europe (Brönnimann et al., 
         <a>2004</a>), although the effect competes with strong interannual variability (Kenyon &amp; Hegerl,
         
         <a>2008</a>) and the magnitude in simulations is much smaller than in the observations, implying
         that internal atmospheric variability contributed significantly to the cold winters
         in Europe.
