      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What caused the long‐term warming from 1900 to 1950? The global temperature rise during
         the ETCW implies a change in the energy budget of the Earth's atmosphere, which in
         turn suggests either an external forcing (volcanic, solar, greenhouse gases, tropospheric
         aerosols), changes in clouds, or ocean heat release (Brönnimann, 
         <a>2015b</a>). Figure 
         <a>4</a> shows that changes in several external forcings over the ETCW could be important,
         such as: a greenhouse gas increase, a small change in solar irradiance, and a reduction
         in stratospheric aerosols associated with reduced volcanic activity.

               <sub>2</sub> concentrations (from reconstructions [Yoshimori, Stocker, Raible, &amp; Renold, 
               <a>2005</a>] and Mauna Loa measurements, NOAA), total solar irradiance (TSI; Coddington, Lean,
               Pilewskie, Snow, &amp; Lindholm, 
               <a>2016</a>); note that effective solar forcing of 1 W/m
               <span>2</span> in TSI translates to ca. 0.175 W/m
               <span>2</span> when correcting for insulated area and albedo, which is accounted for by using a
               different scale), as well as estimated forcing from stratospheric and tropospheric
               aerosols (from NASA/GISS CMIP5). (Bottom) Indices of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
               (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The AMO index is defined (Trenberth
               &amp; Shea, 
               <a>2006</a>) as the difference in SST averages over the regions (0–60°N, 0–80°W) and (60°S–60°N).
               The PDO is calculated by projecting the first Empirical Orthogonal Function mode onto
               the median realization of HadSST3.1.1.0 at 5° resolution (from the Climate Explorer,
               following Mantua, Hare, Zhang, Wallace, and Francis (

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solar irradiance slightly increased from about 1900 onward (the period around 1890
         is sometimes called the “Gleissberg minimum”), although the magnitude of this increase
         is uncertain (Coddington et al., 
         <a>2016</a>) with an overall forcing estimate shown in Figure 
         <a>4</a> of about 0.25 W/m
         <span>2</span>, which is on the large side compared to other estimates (Wang, Lean, &amp; Sheeley Jr,
         
         <a>2005</a>). The magnitude and pattern of the response to an increase in solar forcing is highly
         uncertain (Gray et al., 
         <a>2010</a>). A detection and attribution analysis of temperature reconstructions of the past
         centuries suggests a rather small influence of solar variability on hemispheric scales
         (Schurer, Tett, &amp; Hegerl, 
         <a>2014</a>), which, however, does not preclude regional and seasonal effects such as an influence
         on circulation contributing to cold European winters (Lockwood, Harrison, Woollings,
         &amp; Solanki, 
         <a>2010</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tropical volcanic eruptions, which were frequent in the 19th century (e.g., Tambora
         in 1815, and Krakatoa in 1883), became much rarer after the Santa Maria eruption of
         1902 and the 1912 Katmai eruption. The relative muting of eruptions between this period
         and the eruption of Mount Agung in 1963/1964 thus implies a positive forcing, although
         volcanic emissions during this period are not well known (Neely III &amp; Schmidt, 
         <a>2016</a>). Epoch analyses suggest that periods without volcanic forcing show warming as the
         climate relaxes back into a less volcanically cooled background state (Hegerl, Crowley,
         Baum, Kim, &amp; Hyde, 
         <a>2003</a>; Schurer, Hegerl, Mann, Tett, &amp; Phipps, 
         <a>2013</a>), and climate models show long‐term climate change in response to changes in the
         statistics of eruptions (Gregory, 
         <a>2010</a>; Schurer et al., 
         <a>2014</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration increased from the beginning of industrialization in the 18th century,
         continuing to increase over the early 20th century and then accelerating more recently.
         Since CO
         <sub>2</sub> forcing is logarithmic with concentration, early forcing is disproportionally important.
         Callendar (
         <a>1938</a>) already attributed the ETCW to increased CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration in the late 1930s. Some of the effect of CO
         <sub>2</sub> increases should have been counteracted by an increase in anthropogenic aerosols,
         which were important already over this period (Undorf, Bollasina, &amp; Hegerl, 
         <a>2018</a>; Undorf, Polson, et al., 
         <a>2018</a>), and alone should have caused a substantial cooling effect. However, even by 1900,
         reconstructions of hemispheric temperatures show evidence for a detectible warming
         driven by increases in greenhouse gases, particularly relative to slightly reduced
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> during the Little Ice Age (Abram et al., 
         <a>2016</a>; Schurer et al., 
         <a>2013</a>) consistent with attribution of a substantial fraction of the ETCW in temperature
         reconstructions to greenhouse gas increases (Schurer et al., 
         <a>2013</a>). This is in addition to the warming over much of the 19th century that was driven
         by the recovery from an active volcanic period early in that century (Brönnimann &amp;
         Krämer, 
         <a>2016</a>; Raible et al., 
         <a>2016</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A further possible contributor to the ETCW is decadal variability in the climate system.
         Figure 
         <a>2</a> shows that the ETCW involves pronounced SST anomalies; with anomalously warm Atlantic
         temperatures both in the boreal cool and warm season; and more neutral land temperatures
         on average (where covered). The pronounced Atlantic warming can be interpreted in
         terms of shifts in multidecadal oceanic or coupled variability modes (see Hartmann
         et al., 
         <a>2013</a>), most notably the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; Schlesinger &amp; Ramankutty,
         
         <a>1994</a>). The AMO is usually described as the smoothed basin‐averaged SST anomalies in the
         North Atlantic, although its physical mechanism is not fully clear. It has been suggested
         that the AMO expresses the strength of the meridional overturning circulation of the
         Atlantic Ocean (Knight, Allan, Folland, Vellinga, &amp; Mann, 
         <a>2005</a>; McCarthy et al., 
         <a>2015</a>). Model studies on the other hand suggest that many features of the AMO can be reproduced
         without a dynamic ocean (Clement et al., 
         <a>2015</a>; Srivastava &amp; DelSole, 
         <a>2017</a>). While some authors emphasize an effect of AMO‐related SST anomalies on the atmosphere
         (Gastineau &amp; Frankignoul, 
         <a>2015</a>), many recent studies emphasize the atmosphere as a driver (Häkkinen, Rhines, &amp; Worthen,
         
         <a>2011</a>), or portray a “delayed‐oscillator”‐type coupled mode (Sun, Li, &amp; Jin, 
         <a>2015</a>). With respect to forcings, the AMO appears to be partly driven by external forcing
         (Faurschou Knudsen, Jacobsen, Seidenkrantz, &amp; Olsen, 
         <a>2014</a>), including possibly aerosol forcing (Booth et al. (
         <a>2012</a>), although this has been questioned (Zhang et al., 
         <a>2013</a>), as well as to volcanic (Otterå, Bentsen, Drange, &amp; Suo, 
         <a>2010</a>) and solar forcing (Malik, Brönnimann, &amp; Perona, 
         <a>2017</a>). This complicates attribution of observed change to forcing or internal variability.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is also evidence for a role of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, Mantua
         et al., 
         <a>1997</a>) during some of the ETCW (Tokinaga, Xie, &amp; Mukougawa, 
         <a>2017</a>), although data coverage is not great and uncertainties are substantial (see Fig
         2 in Tokinaga et al. (
         <a>2017</a>). The PDO is here defined as the leading mode of North Pacific SST anomalies North
         of 20°N (Mantua et al., 
         <a>1997</a>), and is related to the decadal realization of the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO;
         Zhang, Wallace, &amp; Battisti, 
         <a>1997</a>; Cai, van Rensch, Cowan, &amp; Sullivan, 2010) and probably describes a combination of
         processes, some of which operate on different time scales (Newman et al., 
         <a>2016</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PDO and AMO indices both increased during the ETCW (Figure 
         <a>4</a>, bottom panel), and remained elevated, peaking in the early 1940s. The AMO index
         increased sharply in the 1920s, peaked around 1930 yet remained high in the 1940s.
         Thus, the period of the ETCW coincides with upward trends in both modes. From observations
         alone it is difficult to determine the role of these decadal modes on climatic anomalies
         during the ETCW due to the short record, although there is evidence that both PDO
         and AMO contribute to phenomena observed during the ETCW, such as the US drought in
         the 1930s (McCabe, Palecki, &amp; Betancourt, 
         <a>2004</a>).
