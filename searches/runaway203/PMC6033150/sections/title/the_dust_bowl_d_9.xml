 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1930s, concurrent with the Arctic warming, North America experienced a decadal scale climatic anomaly known as the “Dust Bowl droughts” which were accompanied by intense heat waves (see Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0009">9</a>). These followed prior wetter years, including the Great Mississippi flood of 1927 (Barry, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0007">1997</a>).

The heat wave amplitude in summers following the driest springs is significantly larger than those following random springs. TXx and TNx values are taken from HadEX2 (1901–2010) and GHCNDEX (1951–2016). (Based on data from Cowan et al. (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 1930s the Midwestern United States (including southern Canada) suffered a decade of drought and intense dust storms that destroyed farmland (Worster, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0153" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0153">1979</a>), contributing, along with the “Great Depression,” to the migration of farmers that is described in the novel “
  <span class="italic">Grapes of Wrath</span>” by John Steinbeck. Negative precipitation anomalies covered the entire central belt of the United States and reached to the Canadian Plains and to the Pacific Northwest during the 1930s (Schubert et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0118">2004b</a>; Schubert, Suarez, Pegion, Koster, &amp; Bacmeister, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0117" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0117">2004a</a>); although larger ones are reconstructed for periods early in the Last Millennium (Woodhouse &amp; Overpeck, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0152" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0152">1998</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Atmospheric simulations driven with observed SSTs typically reproduce drought conditions over the southern United States, although the location and intensity may vary (Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Ewen, et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0019">2009</a>; Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Fischer, et al.,

  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0030">2008</a>; Schubert et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0117" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0117">2004a</a>,

  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0124" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0124">2005</a>) and both tropical and extratropical SST anomalies are needed to reproduce the pattern. Additionally, these papers suggest that many atmospheric features are reproduced, such as a decreased southerly inflow of moist air (in accordance with a weakening of the Great Plains Low Level Jet), a continental‐wide mid‐tropospheric ridge, and a 200 hPa geopotential height anomaly pattern similar as in the observation‐based data. Observed SSTs at the time comprise a cooler tropical and North Pacific compared to preceding and following years, concurring with a warm tropical and North Atlantic (Schubert et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0118">2004b</a>; Seager et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0125">2008</a>; Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0010">10</a>) which may both have contributed to the establishment of a circulation pattern that caused a precipitation deficit in the Great Plains.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, SSTs alone do not suffice as an explanation. Without land‐surface coupling an atmospheric model did not reproduce a strong drought in their model simulations (Schubert et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0118">2004b</a>), while the inclusion of land degradation (i.e., bare soil) and dust made the simulated drought much more realistic in terms of warmer temperature patterns and greater precipitation deficits (Cook et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0031">2009</a>). Rapid land cover changes prior to the 1930s contributed to new agricultural land being vulnerable to drought and erosion. Land–atmosphere interactions, such as reduced evaporation contributing to a precipitation deficit, and dust forcing heating and stabilizing the atmosphere may have amplified the droughts (Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Ewen, et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0019">2009</a>; Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Fischer, et al.,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The droughts were also accompanied by extreme heatwaves, with heat records set during the peak years of 1934 and 1936 still standing at the time of writing (Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0009">9</a>a). Given record temperatures, set over a large fraction of the United States (Abatzoglou &amp; Barbero, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0001">2014</a>), were measured for both daily maxima and minima this was unlikely due to exposure changes or instrumentation biases but a real phenomenon. Heat waves during the 1930s were more frequent and intense than those during the 1950s drought decade (see Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0009">9</a>b–e). In general, heat waves over the North American Great Plains are closely linked to drought (Cowan et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0034">2017</a>); that is, heat waves following dry springs tend to be significantly earlier, hotter, and more frequent than those following average or wet springs (Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0009">9</a>f; note that heat wave frequency (HWF) describes the total number of heat wave days per season, whereas heat wave amplitude (HWA), is the anomaly of the hottest day of the hottest seasonal heat wave) consistent with findings for other regions (Hirschi et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0069">2010</a>; Mueller &amp; Seneviratne, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0092">2012</a>). Dry springs were hence an important factor during the hottest Dust Bowl summers of 1934 and 1936 (Cowan et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0034">2017</a>). However, the role of SSTs in spring drought specifically is less than clear (Donat et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0040">2016</a>), as are the driving mechanisms of high decadal heat wave activity overall.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Could such heat waves occur again, possibly stronger due to global warming? In order to better understand and quantify the risk of recurrence, or strengthening, of such the damaging heat and drought events we need to better quantify the contribution by SSTs, random and unpredictable atmospheric variability, land surface feedbacks, and land management.</p>
