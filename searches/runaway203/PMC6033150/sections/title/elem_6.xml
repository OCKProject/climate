 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EXTREME WEATHER AND CLIMATE EVENTS</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ETCW encompasses several prominent climatic anomalies, which have mostly been studied in isolation, but form an integral part of the ETCW. For example, warm North American summer anomalies and Arctic winter anomalies make a large contribution to the early 20th century scale average anomaly (Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Ewen, et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0019">2009</a>; Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Fischer, et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0020">2009</a>). While extreme events are often associated with unique weather systems or local forcings, large‐scale factors such as those discussed above can substantially influence the probability of unusual events (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0094">2016</a>). For example, greenhouse gas increases have significantly increased the probability of some recent heat wave events (Stott et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0132">2016</a>). It is important to understand the mechanisms and forcing involved in events prior to the middle of the 20th century, since early events provide a test for our understanding of climate change, evaluate the range of extreme events simulated by present climate models, and provide test cases for impacts associated with extreme events. Yet analysis of these early events is still in its infancy. In the following section this review article describes six major climatic anomalies in chronological order, and relates them to large‐scale factors where possible, summarizing in a schematic figure at the end of the article.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The weak Indian monsoon 1890s–1910s</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall was below normal in the 1890s–1910s (Goswami, Madhusoodanan, Neema, &amp; Sengupta, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0051">2006</a>; see Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0007">7</a>) consistent with low values in the Dynamic Indian Monsoon index (Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#wcc522-supitem-0001">S7</a>). A complete monsoon failure (phenomenal drought according to Wang (
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0148" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0148">2006</a>), accompanied by a devastating famine) occurred in 1899. Severe droughts affected India also in 1902, and 1905. As a direct result of these events John Eliot, director of the India Meteorological Department, hired Gilbert Walker to analyze (and possibly forecast) monsoon variability. This period of weak monsoons ended after another complete monsoon failure (phenomenal drought) in 1918 and a severe drought in 1920.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These anomalous monsoons are linked to large scale anomalies discussed above. The Indian Summer Monsoon has been shown to be affected by SSTs in the Atlantic (Goswami, Madhusoodanan, Neema, &amp; Sengupta, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0051">2006</a>; Krishnamurthy &amp; Krishnamurthy, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0079">2016</a>) and the Pacific. Specifically, decadal phases of monsoon failure in climate model simulations have been found to coincide with phases of negative AMO and concurrent positive PDO (Malik et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0084">2017</a>). The AMO may be linked to the Indian monsoon through changes in the summer NAO and Eurasian temperatures, which affect the meridional temperature gradient over south Asia (Goswami, Madhusoodanan, Neema, &amp; Sengupta, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0051">2006</a>). The downwelling branch of the Indian Ocean Walker circulation over the Indian subcontinent is strongest when uplift in the tropical west Pacific is strongest, linking to the Walker circulation through the developing phase of ENSO events over the summer. El Niño events with largest SST anomalies near the dateline are more likely to produce a weak Indian monsoon (Krishna Kumar, Rajagopalan, Hoerling, Bates, &amp; Cane, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0078">2006</a>), although there is considerable variability in the ENSO‐monsoon relationship and the monsoon system itself (Sinha et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0127" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0127">2015</a>). SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean during the 1899–1918 period correspond to a positive mode of the subtropical Indian Ocean dipole (Saji, Goswami, Vinayachandran, &amp; Yamagata, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0110">1999</a>). The monsoon failure around 1900 coincides with a negative phase of the AMO (Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0004">4</a>), which is consistent with the mechanisms outlined above. The PDO phase is more uncertain during this period, although there is evidence to suggest that it may be have been in a weak positive phase (McCabe, Palecki, &amp; Betancourt, 2004). Hence, the weak Indian monsoon in the 1900s perhaps partly reflects the cold Atlantic–Eurasian sector, which is the starting point from which the ETCW then unfolded.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The warming of the Arctic from the 1910s to the 1940s</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After 1918 a pronounced warming started in the northern North Atlantic region (e.g., Yamanouchi, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0154" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0154">2011</a>). In Spitsbergen, the average temperature of the years 1919–1924 was 3 °C higher than in the years 1913–1918 (Grant et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0052">2009</a>). The step‐like temperature increase was noted by contemporary scientists, but no obvious change could be found in the instrumentation or station surroundings, and the change concurred with a decrease of sea ice (Birkeland, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0010">1930</a>; Scherhag, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0113">1939a</a>, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0114" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0114">1939b</a>). A recent homogenization (Nordli, Przybylak, Ogilvie, &amp; Isaksen, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0097">2014</a>) also did not remove the step change. Unlike the recent Arctic warming period, which is strongest near the ground (Grant, Brönnimann, &amp; Haimberger, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0053">2008</a>), the Arctic warming in the European sector in the 1920s was most pronounced in the rather sparse upper‐air data at 700 hPa (Brönnimann et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0016">2012</a>; Grant et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0052">2009</a>). Temperatures then further increased until the late 1940s, with an interruption in the 1940–1942 period. A rapid transition toward lower temperatures occurred in the late 1940s, and is particularly strong in reanalysis data at 700 hPa in winter (Wegmann et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0150">2017</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The step change in temperature in 1918/1919 coincides with a tendency toward a pressure dipole over the Atlantic Sector that leads to southerly flow into the Arctic (Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0008">8</a>, which is sometimes termed a negative trend in the Barents Oscillation and related to the Arctic dipole discussed above, Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0007">7</a>). This is not only found in reanalysis data sets and reconstructions, but is also reflected in (trace) aerosols in an ice core from Svalbard (Grant et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0052">2009</a>). Spikes in the sulfate concentration in the 1930s point to increased transport of polluted air from central and Western Europe toward the Arctic, in very good agreement with circulation reconstructions, and also increased transport of black carbon aerosols, presumably from North America, to Greenland during the 1910s–1930s (McConnell et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0088">2007</a>).

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed in the previous section, the anomalous warming in the European Arctic was arguably related to the warm North Atlantic (see also Fyfe et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0047">2013</a>), and extratropical North Pacific (Tokinaga et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0139" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0139">2017</a>), yet the exact role of the atmosphere versus the ocean is unclear. Simulations with coupled climate models support that a large fraction of the Arctic warming is caused by internal climate variability and can occur in large climate model ensembles (Beitsch, Jungclaus, &amp; Zanchettin, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0008">2014</a>). However, a small part of the Arctic winter warming is also linked to external forcing, particularly anthropogenic forcing (see Figure S2), consistent with Fyfe et al. (
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0047">2013</a>) and attribution results. Feedback mechanisms, such as feedbacks caused by sea‐ice retreat (see Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0003">3</a>) or aerosols on snow (see Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0008">8</a>) may have strengthened the extraordinary warming in the Arctic during the 1920s and 1930s.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1930s, concurrent with the Arctic warming, North America experienced a decadal scale climatic anomaly known as the “Dust Bowl droughts” which were accompanied by intense heat waves (see Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0009">9</a>). These followed prior wetter years, including the Great Mississippi flood of 1927 (Barry,

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 1930s the Midwestern United States (including southern Canada) suffered a decade of drought and intense dust storms that destroyed farmland (Worster, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0153" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0153">1979</a>), contributing, along with the “Great Depression,” to the migration of farmers that is described in the novel “
   <span class="italic">Grapes of Wrath</span>” by John Steinbeck. Negative precipitation anomalies covered the entire central belt of the United States and reached to the Canadian Plains and to the Pacific Northwest during the 1930s (Schubert et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0118">2004b</a>; Schubert, Suarez, Pegion, Koster, &amp; Bacmeister, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0117" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0117">2004a</a>); although larger ones are reconstructed for periods early in the Last Millennium (Woodhouse &amp; Overpeck,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Atmospheric simulations driven with observed SSTs typically reproduce drought conditions over the southern United States, although the location and intensity may vary (Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Ewen, et al.,

   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0124" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0124">2005</a>) and both tropical and extratropical SST anomalies are needed to reproduce the pattern. Additionally, these papers suggest that many atmospheric features are reproduced, such as a decreased southerly inflow of moist air (in accordance with a weakening of the Great Plains Low Level Jet), a continental‐wide mid‐tropospheric ridge, and a 200 hPa geopotential height anomaly pattern similar as in the observation‐based data. Observed SSTs at the time comprise a cooler tropical and North Pacific compared to preceding and following years, concurring with a warm tropical and North Atlantic (Schubert et al.,

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, SSTs alone do not suffice as an explanation. Without land‐surface coupling an atmospheric model did not reproduce a strong drought in their model simulations (Schubert et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0118">2004b</a>), while the inclusion of land degradation (i.e., bare soil) and dust made the simulated drought much more realistic in terms of warmer temperature patterns and greater precipitation deficits (Cook et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0031">2009</a>). Rapid land cover changes prior to the 1930s contributed to new agricultural land being vulnerable to drought and erosion. Land–atmosphere interactions, such as reduced evaporation contributing to a precipitation deficit, and dust forcing heating and stabilizing the atmosphere may have amplified the droughts (Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Ewen, et al.,

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The droughts were also accompanied by extreme heatwaves, with heat records set during the peak years of 1934 and 1936 still standing at the time of writing (Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0009">9</a>a). Given record temperatures, set over a large fraction of the United States (Abatzoglou &amp; Barbero, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0001">2014</a>), were measured for both daily maxima and minima this was unlikely due to exposure changes or instrumentation biases but a real phenomenon. Heat waves during the 1930s were more frequent and intense than those during the 1950s drought decade (see Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0009">9</a>b–e). In general, heat waves over the North American Great Plains are closely linked to drought (Cowan et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0034">2017</a>); that is, heat waves following dry springs tend to be significantly earlier, hotter, and more frequent than those following average or wet springs (Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0009">9</a>f; note that heat wave frequency (HWF) describes the total number of heat wave days per season, whereas heat wave amplitude (HWA), is the anomaly of the hottest day of the hottest seasonal heat wave) consistent with findings for other regions (Hirschi et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0069">2010</a>; Mueller &amp; Seneviratne, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0092">2012</a>). Dry springs were hence an important factor during the hottest Dust Bowl summers of 1934 and 1936 (Cowan et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0034">2017</a>). However, the role of SSTs in spring drought specifically is less than clear (Donat et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0040">2016</a>), as are the driving mechanisms of high decadal heat wave activity overall.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Could such heat waves occur again, possibly stronger due to global warming? In order to better understand and quantify the risk of recurrence, or strengthening, of such the damaging heat and drought events we need to better quantify the contribution by SSTs, random and unpredictable atmospheric variability, land surface feedbacks, and land management.</p>

During this period, global climate anomalies emerged, including cold winters in Europe (see below), warm winters in Alaska, wet springs in central Europe, a drought in Australia and warm conditions in West Antarctica (Steig et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0130" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0130">2013</a>). In the stratosphere, total column ozone was extremely high over Europe, the Arctic, North America, and East Asia.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of these observed climatic anomalies (including the change in ozone and the cold winters in Europe) could have been contributed to by the strong, long‐lasting El Niño event (Brönnimann et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0018">2004</a>) combined with negative NAO conditions (which could have been made more likely by El Niño's imprint in the North Pacific [Li &amp; Lau, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0081">2012</a>]). Planetary wave activity appeared to have increased, weakening the stratospheric polar vortex and increasing poleward transport of ozone.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of World War II, and changes in observational coverage and observational practice (in particular SSTs), the data uncertainty is unfortunately rather large in these years. Nevertheless, a recent experimental reanalysis incorporating surface and upper‐air data (Hersbach et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0067">2017</a>) confirmed the anomalies in atmospheric circulation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of the circulation features are also successfully modeled in atmospheric model simulations driven by SSTs. The strong but southward shifted Hadley cell and positive PNA mode are well reproduced, for instance, in ERA‐20CM (Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#wcc522-supitem-0001">S7</a>). Models typically also produce cold winters in Europe (Brönnimann et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0018">2004</a>), although the effect competes with strong interannual variability (Kenyon &amp; Hegerl, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0075">2008</a>) and the magnitude in simulations is much smaller than in the observations, implying that internal atmospheric variability contributed significantly to the cold winters in Europe.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also during the late 1930s and early 1940s drought conditions affected Australia. Dry conditions started in 1937 and worsening during the subsequent years. In January 1939, heat waves and bushfires (known as “Black Friday” fires) had devastating effects on eastern Australia. Drought then worsened during the 1939–1942 El Niño event and persisted through to 1945.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought conditions in Australia are generally influenced by ENSO, Pacific Decadal Variability, the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode, and Southern Annular Mode (SAM; Verdon‐Kidd &amp; Kiem, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0146" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0146">2009</a>; see Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#wcc522-supitem-0001">S7</a>). The strong and extended El Niño event over 1939–1942 might have contributed to worsening the drought conditions, although the World War II drought started and ended during La Niña conditions, whose effect on precipitation might have been offset by the positive PDO (Cai et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0022">2010</a>) and by a positive SAM (Verdon‐Kidd &amp; Kiem, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0146" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0146">2009</a>; note, however, that the SAM indices are very uncertain in these years). A positive SAM is generally associated with a southward shift in cold weather fronts, associated with high precipitation during the austral winter months, leading to drier conditions over southeast Australia (Risbey, Pook, McIntosh, Wheeler, &amp; Hendon, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0106">2009</a>). Also, relative to the southern Indian Ocean, SSTs northwest of Australia were anomalously cool, depriving southeastern Australian of a tropical moisture source as is often the case during positive Indian Ocean dipole events (Ummenhofer et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0143" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0143">2009</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought and hot summers combined with cold winters in Europe in the 1940s</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The end of the ETCW is marked by drought conditions in central and southern Europe. Because economies had not yet recovered from World War II, the drought years (most notably 1945 and 1947) had large impacts in Germany and other European countries. The droughts coincide with a peak in the AMO phase (Sutton &amp; Hodson, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0134" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0134">2005</a>; Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0004">4</a>). Atmospheric models reproduce major multidecadal changes in precipitation and temperature over Europe when driven by SSTs (Sutton &amp; Hodson, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0134" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0134">2005</a>), although with unclear signal‐to‐noise ratio due to high atmospheric variability. Simulations also reproduce a tendency toward decreased precipitation in south‐central Europe and an increased frequency of summer anticyclonic situations in the 1940s (Brönnimann, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0013">2015a</a>). This was also a period of anomalously cold winters, during World War II, linked to anomalously high pressure over the Atlantic/European sector (see Figures 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0008">8</a>, S8, and S9).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The peak of the positive AMO phase was accompanied by the most poleward position of the northern Hadley cell observed during the 20th century (Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0007">7</a>). Central Europe was thus more frequently under the influence of anticyclonic weather (Brönnimann et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0015">2015</a>), leading to summer heatwaves such as the 1947 heat wave which set Swiss records prior to 2003 (Schär et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0112">2004</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ETCW period ended in the 1940s (Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0001">1</a>). Subsequently, the Hadley cell moved equatorward (Figure 
   <a rid="wcc522-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0007">7</a>) and the Northern Hemisphere (and the Arctic) cooled. During the subsequent decades, warming continued in the Southern Hemisphere, while the Northern Hemisphere cooled into the late 1970s (Hansen, Ruedy, Sato, &amp; Lo, 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0057">2010</a>). While anthropogenic aerosols have been suggested to be responsible for a large fraction of the cooling, internal variability also might have contributed (see Bindoff et al., 
   <a rid="wcc522-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0009">2013</a>).
