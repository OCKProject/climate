 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ATTRIBUTION OF EARLY 20TH CENTURY WARMING</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Detection and attribution studies are used to disentangle the effect of external forcings on observed climate by quantifying the fingerprint of responses to each of the forcings relative to each other and internal variability (Bindoff et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0009">2013</a>), including multidecadal variability (which is, at least to some extent, simulated in climate models [Flato et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0045">2013</a>]). Attribution studies analyzing the entire instrumental record have indicated that some of the large‐scale observed warming in the early 20th century exceeds what is expected from internal climate variability and was forced (Bindoff et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0009">2013</a>; Gillett, Arora, Matthews, &amp; Allen, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0050">2013</a>; Hegerl et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0066">1996</a>, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0065">1997</a>; Ribes &amp; Terray, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0104">2013</a>). However, different analyses emphasize different contributors to the warming (Bindoff et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0009">2013</a>). For example, Shiogama, Nagashima, Yokohata, Crooks, and Nozawa (
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0126" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0126">2006</a>) found a contribution from solar and volcanic forcing in the global temperature record, while Hegerl et al. (
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0062">2007</a>) attributed the ETCW in Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions to greenhouse gas increases and decrease in volcanic forcing combined with internal climate variability. Others studies emphasize the strong role of internal variability (Delworth &amp; Knutson, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0039">2000</a>; Ring, Lindner, Cross, &amp; Schlesinger, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0105">2012</a>), consistent with the observed 1918–1940 warming being significantly greater than that simulated by most of the CMIP3 models (Crook &amp; Forster, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0037">2011</a>).

  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0005">5</a> illustrates contributions to ETCW based on a recent detection and attribution analysis for the instrumental record (1863–2012). The results suggest that all factors discussed above contributed: anthropogenic forcing, natural forcing, and anomalous climate variability.

   <p>Top panel: Scaling factors, that is, magnitude of model fingerprint consistent with observations for the response to greenhouse gases (red), other anthropogenic factors (blue) and natural factors (solar and volcanic, green) from an analysis of decadal temperatures over 1862–2012. This translates into an estimated contribution to warming 1901–1950 by increases in greenhouse gases, natural forcings, and other anthropogenic forcings compared to the ensemble of HadCRUT observed warming accounting for uncertainty (gray histogram) shown in the middle panel. Dots: Multimodel unscaled best estimate of contribution by forcing. pdfs: Estimated contribution from attribution analysis allowing for up‐ or down‐scaling as long as consistent with observations. Dashed line: Trend from a proxy reconstruction (Crowley et al., 
    <a rid="wcc522-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0038">2014</a>). Bottom panel: Residual warming not explained by forcing (purple pdf) compared to CMIP5 control run trends over 50 years to estimate internal variability (green). All analysis is done with model data masked to replicate the data coverage of observed data, and merging sea surface temperature with air temperature over land (Cowtan et al., 
    <a rid="wcc522-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0035">2015</a>), solid lines show results using an informative prior, dashed lines an uninformative prior. After Schurer et al., 2018

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis is conducted by finding a combination of model derived time–space patterns of response to greenhouse gas, other anthropogenic and natural forcing (so‐called fingerprints) that best matches the observations over the entire instrumental period (see Supporting information for more detail). The amplitude of each fingerprint that is consistent with data is estimated as a distribution of “scaling factors” (top panel in Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0005">5</a>), which when multiplied by the raw model results yields a distribution of the contribution of each forcing to the total observed anomaly (middle panel) and a residual variability not explained by forcings (bottom panel; see also Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0001">1</a>, bottom panel and Hegerl &amp; Zwiers, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0063">2011</a> for more detail). The analysis indicates that both external forcing and internal climate variability contributed to the observed warming, with a strong greenhouse warming contributing substantially to the ETCW, natural forcings contributing as well, and other anthropogenic forcing agents such as aerosols counteracting the warming. The natural signal is, at least in climate model simulations, largely due to a hiatus in volcanic eruptions (see Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#wcc522-supitem-0001">S4</a>). Overall, about a half (40–54%; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; .8) of the global warming from 1901 to 1950 is estimated to have been forced. Forcings can, however, not fully explain the warming (indicated by the histogram of observed, positive, residual trends, Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0005">5</a>; compare also Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0002">2</a> top panels with Figure S2). Note that the residual from a proxy‐based global reconstruction is much smaller (Crowley et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0038">2014</a>), raising questions if the strong bias of observed data toward the Atlantic sector enhances the residual warming. This residual warming is, however, not extraordinary relative to samples of 50‐year trends in climate models. Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0005">5</a> also shows that there is substantial data uncertainty in the strength of the warming over the data covered part of the globe, indicated in the gray histogram of observed trends. Note that the analysis is conducted utilizing only data covered parts of the globe; and that model SST data are used over ocean and combined with surface air temperature (Cowtan &amp; Way, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0036">2014</a>) for best comparability with HadCRUT data (see Appendix 
  <a rid="wcc522-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#wcc522-supitem-0001">S1</a> for more details of the analysis).
