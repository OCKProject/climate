 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Longer records including recently digitized old records, together with reanalyses and large ensembles covering the entire 20th century provide new and important insight into the climatic anomalies during the early 20th century. These are not only interesting historically, but provide important evidence for events and anomalies that can occur and challenge climate models to explain or at least, sample them. Key events and anomalies include anomalously poor monsoon years around the turn of the century, the rapid Arctic warming into the 1920s, the Dust Bowl drought and heat waves in North America in the 1930s, and, approximately coincident with World War II, drought in Australia, and cold winters and hot summers in Europe in the 1940s (see overview schematic in Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0010">10</a>). These anomalous events occurred during a period of strong global‐scale warming, which can be attributed to a combination of external forcing (particularly, greenhouse gas increases, combined with a hiatus in volcanic events) and internal decadal variability. The exact contribution of each factor to large‐scale warming remains uncertain, largely due to uncertainty in the role of aerosols in the cooling or stabilization of climate following the middle of the 20th century.
