      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The end of the ETCW is marked by drought conditions in central and southern Europe.
         Because economies had not yet recovered from World War II, the drought years (most
         notably 1945 and 1947) had large impacts in Germany and other European countries.
         The droughts coincide with a peak in the AMO phase (Sutton &amp; Hodson, 
         <a>2005</a>; Figure 
         <a>4</a>). Atmospheric models reproduce major multidecadal changes in precipitation and temperature
         over Europe when driven by SSTs (Sutton &amp; Hodson, 
         <a>2005</a>), although with unclear signal‐to‐noise ratio due to high atmospheric variability.
         Simulations also reproduce a tendency toward decreased precipitation in south‐central
         Europe and an increased frequency of summer anticyclonic situations in the 1940s (Brönnimann,
         
         <a>2015a</a>). This was also a period of anomalously cold winters, during World War II, linked
         to anomalously high pressure over the Atlantic/European sector (see Figures 
         <a>8</a>, S8, and S9).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The peak of the positive AMO phase was accompanied by the most poleward position of
         the northern Hadley cell observed during the 20th century (Figure 
         <a>7</a>). Central Europe was thus more frequently under the influence of anticyclonic weather
         (Brönnimann et al., 
         <a>2015</a>), leading to summer heatwaves such as the 1947 heat wave which set Swiss records
         prior to 2003 (Schär et al., 
         <a>2004</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ETCW period ended in the 1940s (Figure 
         <a>1</a>). Subsequently, the Hadley cell moved equatorward (Figure 
         <a>7</a>) and the Northern Hemisphere (and the Arctic) cooled. During the subsequent decades,
         warming continued in the Southern Hemisphere, while the Northern Hemisphere cooled
         into the late 1970s (Hansen, Ruedy, Sato, &amp; Lo, 
         <a>2010</a>). While anthropogenic aerosols have been suggested to be responsible for a large
         fraction of the cooling, internal variability also might have contributed (see Bindoff
         et al., 
         <a>2013</a>).
