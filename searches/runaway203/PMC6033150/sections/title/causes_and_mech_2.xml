 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What caused the long‐term warming from 1900 to 1950? The global temperature rise during the ETCW implies a change in the energy budget of the Earth's atmosphere, which in turn suggests either an external forcing (volcanic, solar, greenhouse gases, tropospheric aerosols), changes in clouds, or ocean heat release (Brönnimann, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0014">2015b</a>). Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0004">4</a> shows that changes in several external forcings over the ETCW could be important, such as: a greenhouse gas increase, a small change in solar irradiance, and a reduction in stratospheric aerosols associated with reduced volcanic activity.

    <a rid="wcc522-bib-0141" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0141">2006</a>) as the difference in SST averages over the regions (0–60°N, 0–80°W) and (60°S–60°N). The PDO is calculated by projecting the first Empirical Orthogonal Function mode onto the median realization of HadSST3.1.1.0 at 5° resolution (from the Climate Explorer, following Mantua, Hare, Zhang, Wallace, and Francis (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solar irradiance slightly increased from about 1900 onward (the period around 1890 is sometimes called the “Gleissberg minimum”), although the magnitude of this increase is uncertain (Coddington et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0028">2016</a>) with an overall forcing estimate shown in Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0004">4</a> of about 0.25 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, which is on the large side compared to other estimates (Wang, Lean, &amp; Sheeley Jr, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0149">2005</a>). The magnitude and pattern of the response to an increase in solar forcing is highly uncertain (Gray et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0054">2010</a>). A detection and attribution analysis of temperature reconstructions of the past centuries suggests a rather small influence of solar variability on hemispheric scales (Schurer, Tett, &amp; Hegerl, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0122">2014</a>), which, however, does not preclude regional and seasonal effects such as an influence on circulation contributing to cold European winters (Lockwood, Harrison, Woollings, &amp; Solanki, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0082">2010</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tropical volcanic eruptions, which were frequent in the 19th century (e.g., Tambora in 1815, and Krakatoa in 1883), became much rarer after the Santa Maria eruption of 1902 and the 1912 Katmai eruption. The relative muting of eruptions between this period and the eruption of Mount Agung in 1963/1964 thus implies a positive forcing, although volcanic emissions during this period are not well known (Neely III &amp; Schmidt, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0095" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0095">2016</a>). Epoch analyses suggest that periods without volcanic forcing show warming as the climate relaxes back into a less volcanically cooled background state (Hegerl, Crowley, Baum, Kim, &amp; Hyde, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0064">2003</a>; Schurer, Hegerl, Mann, Tett, &amp; Phipps, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0119">2013</a>), and climate models show long‐term climate change in response to changes in the statistics of eruptions (Gregory, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0055">2010</a>; Schurer et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0122">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration increased from the beginning of industrialization in the 18th century, continuing to increase over the early 20th century and then accelerating more recently. Since CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing is logarithmic with concentration, early forcing is disproportionally important. Callendar (
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0023">1938</a>) already attributed the ETCW to increased CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration in the late 1930s. Some of the effect of CO
  <sub>2</sub> increases should have been counteracted by an increase in anthropogenic aerosols, which were important already over this period (Undorf, Bollasina, &amp; Hegerl, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0144" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0144">2018</a>; Undorf, Polson, et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0145" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0145">2018</a>), and alone should have caused a substantial cooling effect. However, even by 1900, reconstructions of hemispheric temperatures show evidence for a detectible warming driven by increases in greenhouse gases, particularly relative to slightly reduced CO
  <sub>2</sub> during the Little Ice Age (Abram et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0002">2016</a>; Schurer et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0119">2013</a>) consistent with attribution of a substantial fraction of the ETCW in temperature reconstructions to greenhouse gas increases (Schurer et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0119">2013</a>). This is in addition to the warming over much of the 19th century that was driven by the recovery from an active volcanic period early in that century (Brönnimann &amp; Krämer, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0017">2016</a>; Raible et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0103">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A further possible contributor to the ETCW is decadal variability in the climate system. Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0002">2</a> shows that the ETCW involves pronounced SST anomalies; with anomalously warm Atlantic temperatures both in the boreal cool and warm season; and more neutral land temperatures on average (where covered). The pronounced Atlantic warming can be interpreted in terms of shifts in multidecadal oceanic or coupled variability modes (see Hartmann et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0058">2013</a>), most notably the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; Schlesinger &amp; Ramankutty, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0115">1994</a>). The AMO is usually described as the smoothed basin‐averaged SST anomalies in the North Atlantic, although its physical mechanism is not fully clear. It has been suggested that the AMO expresses the strength of the meridional overturning circulation of the Atlantic Ocean (Knight, Allan, Folland, Vellinga, &amp; Mann, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0077">2005</a>; McCarthy et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0087">2015</a>). Model studies on the other hand suggest that many features of the AMO can be reproduced without a dynamic ocean (Clement et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0027">2015</a>; Srivastava &amp; DelSole, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0129">2017</a>). While some authors emphasize an effect of AMO‐related SST anomalies on the atmosphere (Gastineau &amp; Frankignoul, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0048">2015</a>), many recent studies emphasize the atmosphere as a driver (Häkkinen, Rhines, &amp; Worthen, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0056">2011</a>), or portray a “delayed‐oscillator”‐type coupled mode (Sun, Li, &amp; Jin, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0133" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0133">2015</a>). With respect to forcings, the AMO appears to be partly driven by external forcing (Faurschou Knudsen, Jacobsen, Seidenkrantz, &amp; Olsen, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0044">2014</a>), including possibly aerosol forcing (Booth et al. (
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0011">2012</a>), although this has been questioned (Zhang et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0156" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0156">2013</a>), as well as to volcanic (Otterå, Bentsen, Drange, &amp; Suo, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0098">2010</a>) and solar forcing (Malik, Brönnimann, &amp; Perona, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0083">2017</a>). This complicates attribution of observed change to forcing or internal variability.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is also evidence for a role of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, Mantua et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0085">1997</a>) during some of the ETCW (Tokinaga, Xie, &amp; Mukougawa, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0139" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0139">2017</a>), although data coverage is not great and uncertainties are substantial (see Fig 2 in Tokinaga et al. (
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0139" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0139">2017</a>). The PDO is here defined as the leading mode of North Pacific SST anomalies North of 20°N (Mantua et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0085">1997</a>), and is related to the decadal realization of the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO; Zhang, Wallace, &amp; Battisti, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0157" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0157">1997</a>; Cai, van Rensch, Cowan, &amp; Sullivan, 2010) and probably describes a combination of processes, some of which operate on different time scales (Newman et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0096">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PDO and AMO indices both increased during the ETCW (Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0004">4</a>, bottom panel), and remained elevated, peaking in the early 1940s. The AMO index increased sharply in the 1920s, peaked around 1930 yet remained high in the 1940s. Thus, the period of the ETCW coincides with upward trends in both modes. From observations alone it is difficult to determine the role of these decadal modes on climatic anomalies during the ETCW due to the short record, although there is evidence that both PDO and AMO contribute to phenomena observed during the ETCW, such as the US drought in the 1930s (McCabe, Palecki, &amp; Betancourt, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0086">2004</a>).
