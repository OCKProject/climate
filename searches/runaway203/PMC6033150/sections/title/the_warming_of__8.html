      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After 1918 a pronounced warming started in the northern North Atlantic region (e.g.,
         Yamanouchi, 
         <a>2011</a>). In Spitsbergen, the average temperature of the years 1919–1924 was 3 °C higher
         than in the years 1913–1918 (Grant et al., 
         <a>2009</a>). The step‐like temperature increase was noted by contemporary scientists, but no
         obvious change could be found in the instrumentation or station surroundings, and
         the change concurred with a decrease of sea ice (Birkeland, 
         <a>1930</a>; Scherhag, 
         <a>1939a</a>, 
         <a>1939b</a>). A recent homogenization (Nordli, Przybylak, Ogilvie, &amp; Isaksen, 
         <a>2014</a>) also did not remove the step change. Unlike the recent Arctic warming period, which
         is strongest near the ground (Grant, Brönnimann, &amp; Haimberger, 
         <a>2008</a>), the Arctic warming in the European sector in the 1920s was most pronounced in the
         rather sparse upper‐air data at 700 hPa (Brönnimann et al., 
         <a>2012</a>; Grant et al., 
         <a>2009</a>). Temperatures then further increased until the late 1940s, with an interruption
         in the 1940–1942 period. A rapid transition toward lower temperatures occurred in
         the late 1940s, and is particularly strong in reanalysis data at 700 hPa in winter
         (Wegmann et al., 
         <a>2017</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The step change in temperature in 1918/1919 coincides with a tendency toward a pressure
         dipole over the Atlantic Sector that leads to southerly flow into the Arctic (Figure
         
         <a>8</a>, which is sometimes termed a negative trend in the Barents Oscillation and related
         to the Arctic dipole discussed above, Figure 
         <a>7</a>). This is not only found in reanalysis data sets and reconstructions, but is also
         reflected in (trace) aerosols in an ice core from Svalbard (Grant et al., 
         <a>2009</a>). Spikes in the sulfate concentration in the 1930s point to increased transport of
         polluted air from central and Western Europe toward the Arctic, in very good agreement
         with circulation reconstructions, and also increased transport of black carbon aerosols,
         presumably from North America, to Greenland during the 1910s–1930s (McConnell et al.,
         
         <a>2007</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed in the previous section, the anomalous warming in the European Arctic
         was arguably related to the warm North Atlantic (see also Fyfe et al., 
         <a>2013</a>), and extratropical North Pacific (Tokinaga et al., 
         <a>2017</a>), yet the exact role of the atmosphere versus the ocean is unclear. Simulations with
         coupled climate models support that a large fraction of the Arctic warming is caused
         by internal climate variability and can occur in large climate model ensembles (Beitsch,
         Jungclaus, &amp; Zanchettin, 
         <a>2014</a>). However, a small part of the Arctic winter warming is also linked to external forcing,
         particularly anthropogenic forcing (see Figure S2), consistent with Fyfe et al. (
         <a>2013</a>) and attribution results. Feedback mechanisms, such as feedbacks caused by sea‐ice
         retreat (see Figure 
         <a>3</a>) or aerosols on snow (see Figure 
         <a>8</a>) may have strengthened the extraordinary warming in the Arctic during the 1920s and
         1930s.
