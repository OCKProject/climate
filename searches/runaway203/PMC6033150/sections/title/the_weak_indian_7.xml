 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall was below normal in the 1890s–1910s (Goswami, Madhusoodanan, Neema, &amp; Sengupta, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0051">2006</a>; see Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0007">7</a>) consistent with low values in the Dynamic Indian Monsoon index (Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#wcc522-supitem-0001">S7</a>). A complete monsoon failure (phenomenal drought according to Wang (
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0148" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0148">2006</a>), accompanied by a devastating famine) occurred in 1899. Severe droughts affected India also in 1902, and 1905. As a direct result of these events John Eliot, director of the India Meteorological Department, hired Gilbert Walker to analyze (and possibly forecast) monsoon variability. This period of weak monsoons ended after another complete monsoon failure (phenomenal drought) in 1918 and a severe drought in 1920.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These anomalous monsoons are linked to large scale anomalies discussed above. The Indian Summer Monsoon has been shown to be affected by SSTs in the Atlantic (Goswami, Madhusoodanan, Neema, &amp; Sengupta, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0051">2006</a>; Krishnamurthy &amp; Krishnamurthy, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0079">2016</a>) and the Pacific. Specifically, decadal phases of monsoon failure in climate model simulations have been found to coincide with phases of negative AMO and concurrent positive PDO (Malik et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0084">2017</a>). The AMO may be linked to the Indian monsoon through changes in the summer NAO and Eurasian temperatures, which affect the meridional temperature gradient over south Asia (Goswami, Madhusoodanan, Neema, &amp; Sengupta, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0051">2006</a>). The downwelling branch of the Indian Ocean Walker circulation over the Indian subcontinent is strongest when uplift in the tropical west Pacific is strongest, linking to the Walker circulation through the developing phase of ENSO events over the summer. El Niño events with largest SST anomalies near the dateline are more likely to produce a weak Indian monsoon (Krishna Kumar, Rajagopalan, Hoerling, Bates, &amp; Cane, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0078">2006</a>), although there is considerable variability in the ENSO‐monsoon relationship and the monsoon system itself (Sinha et al., 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0127" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0127">2015</a>). SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean during the 1899–1918 period correspond to a positive mode of the subtropical Indian Ocean dipole (Saji, Goswami, Vinayachandran, &amp; Yamagata, 
  <a rid="wcc522-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc522-bib-0110">1999</a>). The monsoon failure around 1900 coincides with a negative phase of the AMO (Figure 
  <a rid="wcc522-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc522-fig-0004">4</a>), which is consistent with the mechanisms outlined above. The PDO phase is more uncertain during this period, although there is evidence to suggest that it may be have been in a weak positive phase (McCabe, Palecki, &amp; Betancourt, 2004). Hence, the weak Indian monsoon in the 1900s perhaps partly reflects the cold Atlantic–Eurasian sector, which is the starting point from which the ETCW then unfolded.
