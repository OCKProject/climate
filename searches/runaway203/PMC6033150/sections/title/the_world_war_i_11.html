      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also during the late 1930s and early 1940s drought conditions affected Australia.
         Dry conditions started in 1937 and worsening during the subsequent years. In January
         1939, heat waves and bushfires (known as “Black Friday” fires) had devastating effects
         on eastern Australia. Drought then worsened during the 1939–1942 El Niño event and
         persisted through to 1945.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drought conditions in Australia are generally influenced by ENSO, Pacific Decadal
         Variability, the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode, and Southern Annular Mode (SAM; Verdon‐Kidd
         &amp; Kiem, 
         <a>2009</a>; see Figure 
         <a>S7</a>). The strong and extended El Niño event over 1939–1942 might have contributed to
         worsening the drought conditions, although the World War II drought started and ended
         during La Niña conditions, whose effect on precipitation might have been offset by
         the positive PDO (Cai et al., 
         <a>2010</a>) and by a positive SAM (Verdon‐Kidd &amp; Kiem, 
         <a>2009</a>; note, however, that the SAM indices are very uncertain in these years). A positive
         SAM is generally associated with a southward shift in cold weather fronts, associated
         with high precipitation during the austral winter months, leading to drier conditions
         over southeast Australia (Risbey, Pook, McIntosh, Wheeler, &amp; Hendon, 
         <a>2009</a>). Also, relative to the southern Indian Ocean, SSTs northwest of Australia were anomalously
         cool, depriving southeastern Australian of a tropical moisture source as is often
         the case during positive Indian Ocean dipole events (Ummenhofer et al., 
         <a>2009</a>).
