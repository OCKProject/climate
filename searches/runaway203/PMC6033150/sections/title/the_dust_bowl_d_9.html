      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1930s, concurrent with the Arctic warming, North America experienced a decadal
         scale climatic anomaly known as the “Dust Bowl droughts” which were accompanied by
         intense heat waves (see Figure 
         <a>9</a>). These followed prior wetter years, including the Great Mississippi flood of 1927
         (Barry, 
         <a>1997</a>).

            <p>Record heat waves in the Midwestern United States and the role of spring drought:
               (a) time evolution of maximum of daily maximum (TXx) and minimum (TNx) temperature
               averaged over the Great Plains; (b, c) summer heat wave frequency (HWF [days per summer]),
               and (d, e) heat wave amplitude (HWA [°C]) averaged over the (left) 1930s and (right)
               1950s decade; (f) the summer HWA over the Great Plains, following the 10 driest (orange,
               average red) and wettest springs (light blue, average dark blue) respectively, calculated
               from two separate drought indices (standardized precipitation index [SPI], and palmer
               drought severity index [PDSI]), taken from all springs and summers over 1920–2012
               and compared to a 5–95% range for an average of 1000 sets of 10 randomly sampled springs.
               The heat wave amplitude in summers following the driest springs is significantly larger
               than those following random springs. TXx and TNx values are taken from HadEX2 (1901–2010)
               and GHCNDEX (1951–2016). (Based on data from Cowan et al. (
               <a>2017</a>))

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 1930s the Midwestern United States (including southern Canada) suffered
         a decade of drought and intense dust storms that destroyed farmland (Worster, 
         <a>1979</a>), contributing, along with the “Great Depression,” to the migration of farmers that
         is described in the novel “
         <span>Grapes of Wrath</span>” by John Steinbeck. Negative precipitation anomalies covered the entire central belt
         of the United States and reached to the Canadian Plains and to the Pacific Northwest
         during the 1930s (Schubert et al., 
         <a>2004b</a>; Schubert, Suarez, Pegion, Koster, &amp; Bacmeister, 
         <a>2004a</a>); although larger ones are reconstructed for periods early in the Last Millennium
         (Woodhouse &amp; Overpeck, 
         <a>1998</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Atmospheric simulations driven with observed SSTs typically reproduce drought conditions
         over the southern United States, although the location and intensity may vary (Brönnimann,
         Stickler, Griesser, Ewen, et al., 
         <a>2009</a>; Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Fischer, et al., 
         <a>2009</a>; Cook et al., 
         <a>2009</a>; Cook, Miller, &amp; Seager, 
         <a>2008</a>; Schubert et al., 
         <a>2004a</a>, 
         <a>2004b</a>; Seager, 
         <a>2007</a>; Seager, Kushnir, Herweijer, Naik, &amp; Velez, 
         <a>2005</a>) and both tropical and extratropical SST anomalies are needed to reproduce the pattern.
         Additionally, these papers suggest that many atmospheric features are reproduced,
         such as a decreased southerly inflow of moist air (in accordance with a weakening
         of the Great Plains Low Level Jet), a continental‐wide mid‐tropospheric ridge, and
         a 200 hPa geopotential height anomaly pattern similar as in the observation‐based
         data. Observed SSTs at the time comprise a cooler tropical and North Pacific compared
         to preceding and following years, concurring with a warm tropical and North Atlantic
         (Schubert et al., 
         <a>2004b</a>; Seager et al., 
         <a>2008</a>; Figure 
         <a>10</a>) which may both have contributed to the establishment of a circulation pattern that
         caused a precipitation deficit in the Great Plains.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, SSTs alone do not suffice as an explanation. Without land‐surface coupling
         an atmospheric model did not reproduce a strong drought in their model simulations
         (Schubert et al., 
         <a>2004b</a>), while the inclusion of land degradation (i.e., bare soil) and dust made the simulated
         drought much more realistic in terms of warmer temperature patterns and greater precipitation
         deficits (Cook et al., 
         <a>2009</a>). Rapid land cover changes prior to the 1930s contributed to new agricultural land
         being vulnerable to drought and erosion. Land–atmosphere interactions, such as reduced
         evaporation contributing to a precipitation deficit, and dust forcing heating and
         stabilizing the atmosphere may have amplified the droughts (Brönnimann, Stickler,
         Griesser, Ewen, et al., 
         <a>2009</a>; Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Fischer, et al., 
         <a>2009</a>; Cook et al., 
         <a>2008</a>, 
         <a>2009</a>; Cook, Seager, &amp; Miller, 
         <a>2011</a>; Schubert et al., 
         <a>2004b</a>; Seager et al., 
         <a>2005</a>, 
         <a>2008</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The droughts were also accompanied by extreme heatwaves, with heat records set during
         the peak years of 1934 and 1936 still standing at the time of writing (Figure 
         <a>9</a>a). Given record temperatures, set over a large fraction of the United States (Abatzoglou
         &amp; Barbero, 
         <a>2014</a>), were measured for both daily maxima and minima this was unlikely due to exposure
         changes or instrumentation biases but a real phenomenon. Heat waves during the 1930s
         were more frequent and intense than those during the 1950s drought decade (see Figure
         
         <a>9</a>b–e). In general, heat waves over the North American Great Plains are closely linked
         to drought (Cowan et al., 
         <a>2017</a>); that is, heat waves following dry springs tend to be significantly earlier, hotter,
         and more frequent than those following average or wet springs (Figure 
         <a>9</a>f; note that heat wave frequency (HWF) describes the total number of heat wave days
         per season, whereas heat wave amplitude (HWA), is the anomaly of the hottest day of
         the hottest seasonal heat wave) consistent with findings for other regions (Hirschi
         et al., 
         <a>2010</a>; Mueller &amp; Seneviratne, 
         <a>2012</a>). Dry springs were hence an important factor during the hottest Dust Bowl summers
         of 1934 and 1936 (Cowan et al., 
         <a>2017</a>). However, the role of SSTs in spring drought specifically is less than clear (Donat
         et al., 
         <a>2016</a>), as are the driving mechanisms of high decadal heat wave activity overall.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Could such heat waves occur again, possibly stronger due to global warming? In order
         to better understand and quantify the risk of recurrence, or strengthening, of such
         the damaging heat and drought events we need to better quantify the contribution by
         SSTs, random and unpredictable atmospheric variability, land surface feedbacks, and
         land management.
