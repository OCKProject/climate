      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given external forcing can only partly explain the ETCW (see above, see also Ting,
         Kushnir, &amp; Li, 
         <a>2014</a>), we now address which modes of variability may have contributed. When removing the
         multimodel mean of the response to all historical forcings combined (or similar, when
         removing optimal fitted fingerprints, not shown), a substantial residual variability
         remains (Figures 
         <a>1</a>d and 
         <a>5</a>c). This variability is investigated more closely in Figure 
         <a>6</a>, showing that there is substantial involvement of both the tropics and extratropics
         in warming and cooling periods related to decadal climate variability. It also highlights
         that the ETCW started from a very unusual cold anomaly in the first decade of the
         20th century, originating both from tropical and Southern Hemisphere SSTs (Figure
         
         <a>6</a>). These cool anomalies began in the South Atlantic, with some land datapoints also
         showing cool conditions, and then spread globally in the subsequent decade (Figure
         
         <a>2</a>, bottom) leading to cold anomalies in both Atlantic and Pacific (see also Figure
         
         <a>S5</a>). This rarely discussed cold period was followed by strong warming in the Northern
         Hemisphere, which was particularly pronounced in high latitudes.

               units of zonal mean variability in the data‐covered parts of each zone relative to
               multimodel interannual variability from control simulations. Data are masked when
               data coverage for a particular zonal band drops below 10% (shown in gray; see Figure

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What mechanisms might be linked to the strong residual warming? Using proxy data,
         Thompson, Cole, Shen, Tudhope, and Meehl (
         <a>2015</a>), suggested that a PDO warm phase served as a trigger for the ETCW through weaker
         Pacific Trade winds. This is supported by targeted model simulations (Tokinaga, Xie,
         Deser, Kosaka, &amp; Okumura, 
         <a>2012</a>) and is consistent with several recent studies suggesting that tropical Pacific SSTs
         play a key role as pacemakers for decadal periods of fast and slow warming (England
         et al., 
         <a>2014</a>; Meehl, Arblaster, Fasullo, Hu, &amp; Trenberth, 
         <a>2011</a>; Roberts, Palmer, McNeall, &amp; Collins, 
         <a>2015</a>; Schurer, Hegerl, &amp; Obrochta, 
         <a>2015</a>). Ocean interbasin energy exchange makes it difficult to attempt to trace the location
         of heat uptake (Chen &amp; Tung, 
         <a>2014</a>; Drijfhout et al., 
         <a>2014</a>; Hedemann, Mauritsen, Jungclaus, &amp; Marotzke, 
         <a>2017</a>; Lee et al., 
         <a>2015</a>). Gaps in data coverage cause higher uncertainty during the early 20th century than
         for recent periods. Particularly, very little information is available on the Indo‐Pacific
         and Southern Oceans during that period, and none for the ocean interior.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several questions arise: to what extent was the Atlantic Ocean driving an anomalous
         atmospheric circulation contributing to Arctic warming, and to what extent was the
         atmosphere driving the ocean. While many publications consider the AMO as an internal
         oceanic mode (Chylek, Folland, Lesins, Dubey, &amp; Wang, 
         <a>2009</a>; Knight, 
         <a>2009</a>; Tung &amp; Zhou, 
         <a>2013</a>), others argue that the SST anomalies in the Atlantic Ocean during the ETCW were
         largely driven by anomalous atmospheric circulation (Wood &amp; Overland, 
         <a>2010</a>), consistent with the idea that atmospheric variability drives decadal ocean‐related
         variability (Hasselmann, 
         <a>1976</a>). Forcing an ocean model with wind fields from the 20th century reanalysis (20CR),
         Müller et al. (
         <a>2015</a>) reproduced important features (e.g., salinity anomalies) of the North Atlantic Ocean
         anomalies in the early 20th century, and others find a contribution from the Pacific
         through a shift in the Aleutian low (Overland &amp; Wang, 
         <a>2005</a>) to the Arctic warming and a contribution of the Pacific sector to poleward heat
         advection into the Arctic particularly during the early phase (1910s and 1920s) of
         the Arctic warming (Wegmann, Brönnimann, &amp; Compo, 
         <a>2017</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, SSTs over both the Atlantic and Pacific sectors are required to reproduce
         the Arctic warming in recent simulations (Ting et al., 
         <a>2014</a>; Tokinaga et al., 
         <a>2017</a>). Independent of why the Arctic warmed, most studies also agree that the warming
         did affect atmospheric circulation by shifting the ITCZ and the entire northern Hadley
         circulation poleward (Brönnimann, 
         <a>2015a</a>; Ting et al., 
         <a>2014</a>).
