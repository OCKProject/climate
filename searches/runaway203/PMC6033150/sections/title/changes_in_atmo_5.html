      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Short‐term climate variability changes the probability of extreme events (Kenyon &amp;
         Hegerl, 
         <a>2008</a>; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 
         <a>2016</a>) and can both show decadal preferences itself and cause longer‐term changes in slower
         climate components (Hasselmann, 
         <a>1976</a>). Recent reanalysis efforts such as 20CR (Compo et al., 
         <a>2011</a>) provide researchers with the means to address the causes of atmospheric circulation
         changes over the 20th century and the role of SSTs in driving such changes. Figure
         
         <a>7</a> shows the seasonal mean strength of key circulation indices such as the boreal Hadley
         cell, its latitudinal position, the Pacific Walker cell, the North Atlantic Oscillation
         (NAO) and the Arctic Dipole Mode from observations, reconstructions, and two historical
         reanalyses (20CR version 2c [Compo et al., 
         <a>2011</a>], and ERA‐20C [Poli et al., 
         <a>2016</a>]) and from an ensemble of 10 atmospheric climate model simulations from ERA‐20CM
         (Hersbach et al., 
         <a>2015</a>). When the SST driven simulations reproduce the index this indicates a strong driving
         role for SSTs.

            <p>Annual time series of circulation indices, expressed as anomalies from 1961 to 1990.
               Shown are series from two reanalyses (20CRv2c, ERA20C), the atmospheric model simulations
               ERA20CM (10 members; ensemble mean and spread are indicated (Hersbach et al., 
               <a>2015</a>) and series based on observations or reconstructions. Shown are the seasonal mean
               strength of the boreal Hadley cell (the maximum of the meridional mass stream function),
               its latitudinal position (latitude of the maximum), the Pacific Walker cell (difference
               in 500 hPa 
               <span>ω</span> between the areas [10°S–10°N, 180–100°W] and [10°S–10°N, 100–150°E]), the North Atlantic
               oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic dipole mode (here defined as the SLP difference north
               of 60°N between the western and the eastern hemisphere; after Brönnimann et al. (
               <a>2009</a>) and Brönnimann et al. (
               <a>2009</a>). Additionally, a statistical reconstruction of the Pacific Walker cell is shown
               (Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Ewen, et al., 
               <a>2009</a>; Brönnimann, Stickler, Griesser, Fischer, et al., 
               <a>2009</a>) and an observation‐based NAO index based on HadSLP2p data (Allan &amp; Ansell, 
               <a>2006</a>). All series are for December–February except Hadley cell position (January–December)
               and Indian summer monsoon rainfall (June–August, Sontakke et al., 
               <a>2008</a>). Colored numbers indicate correlations between the correspondingly colored reanalyses
               or observations with the ERA20CM ensemble mean (* and ** denote 95 and 99% significance).
               The purple line for Indian summer monsoon rainfall is based on a reconstruction (Zhou
               et al., 
               <a>2010</a>). Severe and phenomenal droughts (Wang, 
               <a>2006</a>) over India are added as circles

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The boreal winter Hadley cell appears to have weakened from the 1920s into the 1950s,
         then strengthened until the late 1990s. However, uncertainties even in the latter
         signal are large (Hartmann et al., 
         <a>2013</a>). The position of the northern tropical belt shifts poleward until the early 1940s,
         then equatorward until the 1980s (Brönnimann, 
         <a>2015a</a>), followed again by a slight poleward shift. For both indices, different data sets
         agree, and they agree with atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) simulations
         (Brönnimann, 
         <a>2015a</a>), which implies that these changes are consistent with and influenced by SSTs. In
         fact, from the stronger warming of the Northern Hemisphere relative to the Southern
         Hemisphere, we expect a poleward shift of the northern Hadley cell.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dependence on SSTs is also found for the Pacific Walker circulation, which is closely
         related to ENSO, with interannual variability being more prominent than decadal variability.
         Individual events such as the 1918/1919 El Niño event (Giese et al., 
         <a>2010</a>) or the 1939–1942 El Niño appear prominently in all series, and there is proxy evidence
         for a decrease of the trade winds over the central equatorial Pacific (i.e., a weakening
         of the Walker circulation) in the 1910s (Thompson et al., 
         <a>2015</a>). This is not inconsistent with the indices displayed, although it is not a prominent
         feature in Figure 
         <a>7</a>. Less frequent El Niño conditions (indicated by a high Walker Circulation index)
         are found around 1910, in the early 1920s, the 1930s, the 1950s, the 1970s, and the
         2000s; these coincide with negative PDO phases (Figure 
         <a>4</a>, bottom panel).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Indian Monsoon, according to a reconstructed Dynamic Indian Monsoon Index was
         rather strong in the 1880s (Figure 
         <a>S7</a>, see Zhou et al., 
         <a>2010</a>), then dropped into a pronounced minimum from around 1900 to 1915 near the start
         of the ETCW. This coincides with minimum Indian Monsoon summer rainfall and occurrence
         of droughts (Figure 
         <a>7</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NAO index was high until the mid‐1920s (Rogers, 
         <a>1985</a>), then decreased to the 1960s, followed by a strengthening to the mid‐1990s (Hurrell,
         
         <a>1995</a>). Hence, during the latter part of the ETCW, the winter circulation over the North
         Atlantic weakened. This suppressed some of the winter warming that would have occurred
         otherwise over this time period, and likely also influenced SSTs (Iles &amp; Hegerl, 
         <a>2017</a>), hence the NAO downward trend not only does not contribute to the early 20th century
         warming but slightly counteracted it. Different NAO indices agree well, but are not
         well reproduced by the SST driven GCM (Scaife et al., 
         <a>2009</a>), consistent with a largely atmospheric origin of low‐frequency NAO variability.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decadal changes are also found in the Arctic Dipole Mode (here shown for the annual
         mean). The index decreased (note the inverted scale in Figure 
         <a>7</a>) from the late 1910s to the 1940s. During the latter part of the ETCW (Grant, Brönnimann,
         Ewen, Griesser, &amp; Stickler, 
         <a>2009</a>; Overland &amp; Wang, 
         <a>2005</a>; Wegmann et al., 
         <a>2017</a>), positive pressure anomalies over Eurasia contrasted with negative anomalies over
         North America. This is consistent with a tendency toward warm air advection into the
         European Arctic and hence Arctic warming. In the 1930s, circulation related to a negative
         Pacific‐North American (PNA) pattern also allowed poleward transport of warm air masses
         over the northwestern Pacific (Wegmann et al., 
         <a>2017</a>), (see also Figure 
         <a>S7</a>). A strong positive peak in the PNA then followed in the early 1940s (Ewen, Brönnimann,
         &amp; Annis, 
         <a>2008</a>), which brought warm air toward western Canada and into Alaska, followed by an abrupt
         drop in the 1950s. Both these circulation anomalies contributed to Arctic warming.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, pronounced interannual and, to some extent, decadal atmospheric variability
         occurred over the ETCW period, including a poleward shift of the northern Hadley cell,
         and a weakening of the NAO and of the Arctic Dipole Mode. While these circulation
         anomalies are linked to regional anomalies during portions of the ETCW, none of them
         provides a strong contribution to the large‐scale warming over the entire ETCW.
