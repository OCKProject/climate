      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the late 19th century, the globe was approximately 0.8 °C cooler than during
         the early 21st century (Hartmann et al., 
         <a>2013</a>). However, the warming between this period and the present did not proceed at a constant
         pace. Multidecadal phases of accelerated warming alternated with phases of slowed
         warming, the most recent expressions of which were the accelerated warming during
         the 1990s and the subsequent reduction in the global warming rate (Fyfe et al., 
         <a>2016</a>; Medhaug, Stolpe, Fischer, &amp; Knutti, 
         <a>2017</a>; Trenberth, 
         <a>2015</a>). The ongoing discussion on the causes of that so‐called “hiatus” reveals that decadal
         variability in the large‐scale climate is still poorly understood, emphasizing the
         need for a longer‐time perspective on periods of warming and cooling during the transition
         to the strongly human‐influenced late 20th century climate.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most prominent accelerated warming periods was the “Early Twentieth Century
         Warming” (ETCW) from the 1890s to the 1940s. This article discusses climate change
         prior to and during the ETCW, including its causes and the exceptional phenomena that
         were observed during this extraordinary warming period. The mid‐20th century end to
         the warming signaled the first period in that century that shows a detectable temperature
         change outside internal variability over 2–5 decades (e.g., for the trend 1916–1945
         [Hegerl et al., 
         <a>1996</a>, 
         <a>1997</a>]), which then re‐emerged in trends ending in the 1990s. The ETCW was followed by
         a period of slow or no warming until the 1970s, which may have been partly caused
         by aerosol cooling, and partly by internal variability (see below; as well as Bindoff
         et al., 
         <a>2013</a>; Booth, Dunstone, Halloran, Andrews, &amp; Bellouin, 
         <a>2012</a>; Jones et al., 
         <a>2009</a>; Undorf et al., 
         <a>2018</a>). Data uncertainties are larger prior to the middle of the 20th century (Morice,
         Kennedy, Rayner, &amp; Jones, 
         <a>2012</a>) and are discussed as well.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ETCW featured a pronounced Arctic warming in the 1920s and 1930s, and embedded
         in this period were several important climatic anomalies such as Indian monsoon failures
         in the 1900s (Wang, 
         <a>2006</a>; Zhou et al., 
         <a>2010</a>), the North American “Dust Bowl” droughts and record‐breaking heat waves in the 1930s
         (Cook, Miller, &amp; Seager, 
         <a>2009</a>; Cowan et al., 
         <a>2017</a>; Donat et al., 
         <a>2016</a>; Schubert, Suarez, Pegion, Koster, &amp; Bacmeister, 
         <a>2004b</a>), the cold European winters of 1940–1942 (Brönnimann et al., 
         <a>2004</a>), and the World War II period drought in Australia between 1937 and 1945 (e.g., Verdon‐Kidd
         &amp; Kiem, 
         <a>2009</a>). The European summer droughts and heat waves of the mid and late 1940s (e.g., Sutton
         &amp; Hodson, 
         <a>2005</a>), such as 1947 (Schär et al., 
         <a>2004</a>), followed the anomalously cold winters during WWII. These regional climatic anomalies
         had severe impacts on societies and the environment (e.g., Worster, 
         <a>1979</a>), and they are relevant for our understanding of the ETCW.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ETCW received a lot of prominence from the scientific community even during the
         period itself (Scherhag, 
         <a>1939a</a>). Callendar (
         <a>1938</a>) attributed the warming to atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> rise. It was later discussed in the context of long‐term variability (Parker, Jones,
         Folland, &amp; Bevan, 
         <a>1994</a>; Schlesinger &amp; Ramankutty, 
         <a>1994</a>) and again in the context of the recent “hiatus” discussion. Limited observational
         coverage and uncertainties in forcing, particularly by aerosols (Stevens, 
         <a>2015</a>), still causes uncertainty in the attribution of the ETCW. The mechanisms involved
         are starting to reveal themselves as new and improved data products such as reanalyses
         (Compo et al., 
         <a>2011</a>) and reconstructions become available. In this article, we review the scientific
         understanding of the causes of the ETCW, and of regional climate trends and specific
         climatic events within this period. We discuss the proposed mechanisms underlying
         both the 50‐year warming trend and regional anomalies. Finally, we ask what we can
         learn from this period for our understanding of the interplay of decadal variability
         and increased greenhouse warming.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first part of the article discusses the global perspective of observed climatic
         changes during the ETCW and its causes, followed by a discussion of regional climatic
         anomalies and extreme events, and conclusions.
