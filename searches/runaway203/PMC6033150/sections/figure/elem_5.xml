  <p>Top panel: Hovmoeller diagram of standardized zonal mean temperature anomalies over land and ocean (top), land only (middle) and sea surface temperature (bottom) after the multimodel mean forced signal, represented by the average of model simulations forced by historical forcing has been subtracted. The diagram is in standard deviation units of zonal mean variability in the data‚Äêcovered parts of each zone relative to multimodel interannual variability from control simulations. Data are masked when data coverage for a particular zonal band drops below 10% (shown in gray; see Figure
