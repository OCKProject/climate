  <p>Record heat waves in the Midwestern United States and the role of spring drought: (a) time evolution of maximum of daily maximum (TXx) and minimum (TNx) temperature averaged over the Great Plains; (b, c) summer heat wave frequency (HWF [days per summer]), and (d, e) heat wave amplitude (HWA [°C]) averaged over the (left) 1930s and (right) 1950s decade; (f) the summer HWA over the Great Plains, following the 10 driest (orange, average red) and wettest springs (light blue, average dark blue) respectively, calculated from two separate drought indices (standardized precipitation index [SPI], and palmer drought severity index [PDSI]), taken from all springs and summers over 1920–2012 and compared to a 5–95% range for an average of 1000 sets of 10 randomly sampled springs. The heat wave amplitude in summers following the driest springs is significantly larger than those following random springs. TXx and TNx values are taken from HadEX2 (1901–2010) and GHCNDEX (1951–2016). (Based on data from Cowan et al. (
