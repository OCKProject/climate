         <p>Spatial maps showing decadal temperature trends for boreal cold (a, November–March)
            and warm season (b, April–October) for the early 20th century (1901–1940) in HadCRUT4
            (Morice et al., 
            <a>2012</a>). (c, d) Spatial temperature anomalies from HadCRUT4 after the multimodel mean CMIP5
            response to all historical forcings combined has been subtracted based on analysis
            discussed below. All panels are masked where coverage is too sparse (gray); in panels
            (a) and (b) where coverage in either the first or second half of the period drops
            below 30%; in panels (c) and (d) where coverage in any season drops below 30% in either
            the first or second half of the decade. For details see Supporting information
