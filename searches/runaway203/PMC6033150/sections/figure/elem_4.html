         <p>Top panel: Scaling factors, that is, magnitude of model fingerprint consistent with
            observations for the response to greenhouse gases (red), other anthropogenic factors
            (blue) and natural factors (solar and volcanic, green) from an analysis of decadal
            temperatures over 1862–2012. This translates into an estimated contribution to warming
            1901–1950 by increases in greenhouse gases, natural forcings, and other anthropogenic
            forcings compared to the ensemble of HadCRUT observed warming accounting for uncertainty
            (gray histogram) shown in the middle panel. Dots: Multimodel unscaled best estimate
            of contribution by forcing. pdfs: Estimated contribution from attribution analysis
            allowing for up‐ or down‐scaling as long as consistent with observations. Dashed line:
            Trend from a proxy reconstruction (Crowley et al., 
            <a>2014</a>). Bottom panel: Residual warming not explained by forcing (purple pdf) compared to
            CMIP5 control run trends over 50 years to estimate internal variability (green). All
            analysis is done with model data masked to replicate the data coverage of observed
            data, and merging sea surface temperature with air temperature over land (Cowtan et
            al., 
            <a>2015</a>), solid lines show results using an informative prior, dashed lines an uninformative
            prior. After Schurer et al., 2018
