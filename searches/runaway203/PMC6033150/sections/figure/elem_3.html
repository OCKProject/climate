         <p>(Top) Annual mean time series of climate forcings agents: CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentrations (from reconstructions [Yoshimori, Stocker, Raible, &amp; Renold, 
            <a>2005</a>] and Mauna Loa measurements, NOAA), total solar irradiance (TSI; Coddington, Lean,
            Pilewskie, Snow, &amp; Lindholm, 
            <a>2016</a>); note that effective solar forcing of 1 W/m
            <span>2</span> in TSI translates to ca. 0.175 W/m
            <span>2</span> when correcting for insulated area and albedo, which is accounted for by using a
            different scale), as well as estimated forcing from stratospheric and tropospheric
            aerosols (from NASA/GISS CMIP5). (Bottom) Indices of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
            (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The AMO index is defined (Trenberth
            &amp; Shea, 
            <a>2006</a>) as the difference in SST averages over the regions (0–60°N, 0–80°W) and (60°S–60°N).
            The PDO is calculated by projecting the first Empirical Orthogonal Function mode onto
            the median realization of HadSST3.1.1.0 at 5° resolution (from the Climate Explorer,
            following Mantua, Hare, Zhang, Wallace, and Francis (
            <a>1997</a>)
