         <p>Top panel: Hovmoeller diagram of standardized zonal mean temperature anomalies over
            land and ocean (top), land only (middle) and sea surface temperature (bottom) after
            the multimodel mean forced signal, represented by the average of model simulations
            forced by historical forcing has been subtracted. The diagram is in standard deviation
            units of zonal mean variability in the data‚Äêcovered parts of each zone relative to
            multimodel interannual variability from control simulations. Data are masked when
            data coverage for a particular zonal band drops below 10% (shown in gray; see Figure
            
            <a>S6</a> for a version restricted to &gt;30% coverage)
