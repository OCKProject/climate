         <p>Mean surface temperature over (a) land, (b) ocean (sea surface temperatures), and
            (c) global (combined land + ocean) in observations (mean: black; gray lines: possible
            realizations given uncertainty [Kennedy et al., 
            <a>2011</a>; Morice et al., 
            <a>2012</a>]), CMIP5 multimodel mean simulations with all historical forcings (thick red line:
            average and thin lines: individual simulations) relative to an average over the full
            period. All model data are masked to observational coverage, and for combined land
            and sea a blend of surface air temperatures and sea surface temperature is calculated
            following Cowtan and Way (
            <a>2014</a>). (d) Residual variability for land and sea blend after subtracting the multimodel
            mean forced component, compared to 5–95% uncertainty ranges of multimodel control
            simulations (Method and models used the same as in Schurer et al., 
            <a>2018</a>). The blue line in panel (c) shows a global proxy‐based reconstruction (Crowley,
            Obrochta, &amp; Liu, 
            <a>2014</a>) and the pink bar highlights the ETCW
