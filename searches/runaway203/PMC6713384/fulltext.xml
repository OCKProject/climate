Populations of predators and their prey are affected by changing climate and other anthropogenic factors, and these changing trophic interactions could have profound effects on breeding populations of Arctic birds. Variable abundance of lemmings (a primary prey of generalist Arctic predators) and increasing abundance of light geese (Lesser Snow and Ross&#x02019; Geese; a secondary prey) could have negative consequences for numerous sympatric shorebirds (an incidental prey). Using 16 years of predator-prey observations and 13-years of shorebird nest survival data at a site near a goose colony we identify relationships among geese, lemmings, and their shared predators and then relate predator indices to shorebird risk of nest predation. During two years, we also placed time-lapse cameras and artificial shorebird nests at increasing distances from a goose colony to document spatial trends in predators and their effect on risk of predation. In the long-term data, yearly indices of light geese positively influenced indices of gulls and jaegers, and shorebird nest predation rate was negatively correlated with jaeger and fox indices. All three predator indices were highest near the goose colony and artificial nest predation probability was negatively correlated with distance from goose colony, but these effects were less apparent during the second year. Combined, these results highlight the variation in predator-mediated interactions between geese and shorebirds and outline one mechanism by which hyperabundant geese may be contributing to local or regional declines in Arctic-nesting shorebird populations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000243</institution-id><institution>W.

These changes could significantly influence populations of Arctic-breeding birds, the most diverse and vertebrate taxa of the circumpolar Arctic [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Northward shifts in vegetation communities have already influenced the availability of nesting habitat for sub-arctic breeding shorebirds [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and advances in peak prey availability have created a mismatch with the phenology of chick hatch [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and lower growth and chick survival in some [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] but not all cases [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While at large scales these changes have the potential to alter bird distribution, phenology, and demography, at smaller spatial scales the trophic interactions among predators and their prey may play a more dominant role in structuring communities [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These predator-prey interactions can have cascading effects on the populations of sympatric birds.</p><p>In northern regions, arctic foxes (<italic>Vulpes lagopus</italic>) and jaegers (Parasitic, <italic>Stercorarius parasiticus</italic> and to a lesser extent, Long-tailed Jaeger, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>longicaudus</italic>) depredate shorebird nests &#x0201c;incidentally&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] lemmings (<italic>Dicrostonyx spp</italic>., <italic>Lemmus spp</italic>.) and the eggs and chicks of larger birds such as geese are the primary or secondary prey, and shorebird nests may be depredated opportunistically when they are encountered [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nonetheless, these predators constitute the primary cause of nest failure for shorebirds across the Arctic [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, lemmings, goose eggs, and goslings interact with shorebirds indirectly by influencing the abundance and behaviour of their shared predators.</p><p>Predator populations may exhibit numerical responses (increases in abundance) to lemming peaks [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and more specifically, aggregative responses [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to goose colonies, in both cases resulting in higher incidental predation of nearby shorebird nests. Alternatively, predators may switch their search efforts between prey items (functional response; [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or become satiated during lemming peaks or within goose colonies, alleviating predation pressure on shorebird nests [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Local or regional changes in the availability of lemmings and/or geese could therefore dramatically affect the risk of predation and reproductive success of tundra-nesting shorebirds.</p><p>In the last 30 years climate-induced changes in environmental conditions have resulted in decreases in the frequency and amplitude of lemming peaks at some northern sites ([<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but see Ehrich et al. <italic>in press</italic>). Five-fold decreases in peak magnitude have been reported in Greenland [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. By contrast, North American populations of Greater (<italic>Chen caerulescens atlantica</italic>) and Lesser Snow (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>c</italic>. <italic>caerulescens</italic>), and Ross&#x02019; Geese (<italic>Chen rossii</italic>; hereafter collectively referred to as &#x02018;light geese&#x02019;) have increased exponentially in abundance over the last 60 years [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], in response to food subsidies on their wintering grounds [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Band-recoveries now suggest that the adult midcontinent lesser snow goose population may be greater than 15 million individuals, an estimate significantly higher than the ~2.5 million estimated in the early 1970s [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Decadal declines and increases in the abundances of lemmings and light geese, respectively, could have negative consequences for numerous Arctic-breeding shorebirds whose populations have declined over this same period [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although these declines could arise from a multitude of factors across shorebirds&#x02019; large ranges, reproductive success for Arctic-breeding shorebirds is low at some locations (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) and theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that breeding failure has the potential to explain shorebirds&#x02019; negative population trends [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Despite low biodiversity in comparison to lower latitudes, Arctic systems are governed by complex trophic interactions among shorebirds, lemmings, and geese. Interactions mediated through shared predators may vary regionally depending on guilds of predators and prey, or climate. The objectives of our study were therefore to identify the numerical and functional responses of generalist predators to varying prey availability (i.e. lemming availability and goose colony presence), and relate these responses to predation risk for shorebird nests in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Using long-term field observations from a study site near a light goose colony, we identify temporal trends in predator-prey indices over a 16-year period and relate these trends to survival of shorebird nests. We then used 24-hour time-lapse cameras in concert with artificial shorebird nests both placed in plots situated at increasing distances from the goose colony to record spatial variation in predator indices and experimentally test for variation in predation risk in relation to the presence of nesting light geese.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study sites and plots</title><p>We conducted research within three primary study sites and four plots in the eastern Canadian Arctic. The first study site is situated within a Lesser Snow Goose colony in the East Bay Migratory Bird Sanctuary (EBMBS) on Southampton Island, Nunavut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221727.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The populations of geese within this colony and an adjacent colony to the southwest (the &#x0201c;Coral Harbour&#x0201d; colony) have increased from 156,700 breeding birds in 1997 to 289,700 in 2014 ([<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], J.

The second site, the East Bay Mainland Shorebird Camp (hereafter East Bay Mainland), is a long-term shorebird study site initiated in 1999 and is also situated within the EBMBS ~10km from the goose colony. Although the site is not typically used for breeding by light geese, family groups use the site extensively later in the season for foraging. The third study site, the Coats Island Shorebird Camp, is situated on Coats Island approximately 135km south of Southampton Island. Light geese do not breed regularly at this study site and lemmings are absent from the island [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0221727.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0221727.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Map of study region.</title><p>Study plots (a) Within, (b) Near, and (c) Far (East Bay Mainland) from a goose colony, and (d) on Coats Island, Nunavut.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0221727.g001"/></fig><p>To gauge spatial effects of light goose presence on predator indices and risk of predation we established four 10-12ha plots at increasing distances from the goose colony by drawing coordinates in a random-stratified fashion.

We conducted fieldwork at these three sites during the shorebird breeding season from early-June to late-July, in 2015&#x02013;2016.

Measuring the spatial patterns in shorebird nest predation was challenging, in that too few shorebird nests were found Within and Near the goose colony for statistical analyses; presumably because of reduced nesting densities and nest survival in these heavily goose-affected areas. Therefore, in 2015 and 2016, we placed artificial nests within each of the four study plots to relate predation risk to spatial variation in camera predator indices. The Animal Care Committee of Environment and Climate Change Canada approved our procedures, and permits were granted from Federal and Territorial Governments (e.g., NUN-SCI-14-05, WL2016-053). No animals were handled during this study and there were no ethical concerns regarding animal welfare. All research was conducted on territorial land and within the East Bay Migratory Birds Sanctuary under permit NUN-MBS-14-05 granted by Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Fieldwork</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Predator-prey indices</title><p>Arctic Foxes and jaegers prey upon lemmings, and goose and shorebird nests [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Individual observers made an effort to avoid repeat counting of predators and prey, but this repeat counting is difficult to avoid across observers.

Each camera was positioned facing northwest so as to capture the greatest field of view of the plot (and artificial nests) and then programmed to take a picture every five seconds. This timing likely biases indices of foxes, which spend more time intensively searching for nests in plots, high compared to indices of gulls and jaegers, which move quickly in and out of frame of view, but remains constant among study plots and years. At the end of the field season we reviewed all photographs manually and recorded the species, time, and date that individuals entered and left the field of view of the camera. From 16-June to 20-July of each year we installed permanent cameras within plots (Within: 2 cameras, Near: 2, Far: 3, Coats: 3) situated at increasing distances from the goose colony. Similar to observational predator-prey indices, we generated camera predator indices by calculating the number of predator species seen on camera per eight-hour camera-day.

Recent rises in populations of light geese and alterations in cycles of lemmings may therefore influence the cyclic dynamics of generalist predators and indirectly influence the risk of predation and probability of survival of incidental prey such as shorebirds. Over 13 years we found that gull and jaeger abundance and activity indices were positively associated with yearly goose indices, regardless of lemming abundance and that during one of two years of camera monitoring all predator indices were negatively related to distance from goose colony. Long-term monitoring of shorebird nests indicated that predation probability was positively related to fox and jaeger indices. In addition, artificial shorebird nest predation probability, during the two year experiment, was negatively associated with distance from goose colony. These results add to our understanding of variations in predator-prey relationships among Arctic study sites and suggest that, in some areas, light goose presence <italic>has the potential to</italic> indirectly affect the risk of predation for shorebirds by influencing the temporal and spatial distribution, and activity of their shared predators.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Predator indices</title><p>Functional and numerical responses of generalist Arctic predators to their primary prey, lemmings, have been well-documented [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The strength of these relationships may vary by site [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and depend on the presence of allochthonous resources such as geese [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Over a 17-year period, we found no systematic changes in indices of predators or prey at our East Bay Mainland site, 10 km away from a goose colony. Yearly indices of geese did however positively influence indices of two potential nest predators, gulls and jaegers, while lemming abundance had no measurable effect on the abundance of any predators in our time series. When food is abundant, jaegers may have more nests, produce larger clutches, and experience elevated breeding success [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

It is therefore possible that at East Bay Mainland, during years when goose eggs and goslings are abundant in the nearby colony, gulls and jaegers are experiencing higher overall reproductive success and/or exhibiting elevated activity rates in response to the demands of their offspring.</p><p>We also found all predator indices were higher within and near the goose colony compared to far from the colony, but this relationship varied between the two years and may be the result of varying goose abundance and colony size. In 2015 goose, gull, jaeger, and fox indices at East Bay Mainland were 2.96, 1.23, 1.58, and 2.00 times higher, respectively, than in 2016. This trend is consistent with the long-term positive association between geese and predator indices. Inter-annual fluctuations in the size of goose breeding populations are not uncommon [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and may reflect variations in breeding effort due variation in temperature, snow, and other weather conditions on the breeding grounds [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

These factors could have influenced the number and distribution of geese in 2015 vs. 2016, potentially influencing distribution of nest predators captured in our camera indices.</p><p>Regardless of this inter-annual variation, generalist predator indices at the three sites on Southampton Island in both years were substantially higher than on Coats Island where both breeding light geese and lemmings are absent. Lamarre et al., [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] documented aggregative responses of arctic fox and aerial predators to a goose colony on Bylot Island, Nunavut; this effect was pronounced for foxes when lemmings were scarce.

Although we found no effect of lemming abundance on predator indices in our long-term data at East Bay Mainland, over more years of monitoring, particularly within the goose colony, an influence of lemmings on predator indices may still emerge, and show that lemming peaks could be contributing to some of the variation in our predator indices.</p><p>Goose eggs and goslings can sustain elevated predator populations [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] in the absence of abundant and regular lemming cycles and may therefore be responsible for the higher indices on Southampton Island than on Coats Island where predators are limited to depredating patchily distributed waterfowl and shorebird nests. Overall, these results highlight the numerical and aggregative responses of generalist predators to an increasing goose colony and the importance of goose colonies in buffering predators against lemming crashes [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Risk of predation</title><p>Functional and numerical responses of predators to preferred prey can influence the risk of predation for incidental prey [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Across 13 years of nest monitoring on Southampton Island, predation rates of real shorebird nests was positively correlated with our fox and jaeger indices, but lemmings had no effect. Individually, foxes and jaegers increased nest predation probability by ~5% per 0.1 index increase. During years when both predator indices are elevated, predation rates of shorebird nests could reach 91%, an increase of ~42% from low predator years. Considering the average number of nests found per year at our sites is 70, this equates to only 6 successful shorebird nests, excluding abandonment.</p><p>In a large-scale multi-year analysis across 14 shorebird species and 17 sites, Weiser et al. [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] also reported no effect of arvicoline rodents on survival of shorebird nests. Furthermore, this study found evidence of a non-linear fox-related decline in Western Sandpiper (<italic>Calidris mauri</italic>) daily nest survival probability of 0.08 between maximum and minimum fox abundances, further supporting our results and highlighting the variation in predator-prey relationships among sites.</p><p>Over a shorter temporal period (two years) we also found a negative relationship between distance from goose colony and predation rate of artificial shorebird nests that corresponded to the spatial patterns in camera predator indices.

At the same site, [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported survival of artificial shorebird nests was positively related to lemming abundance, but may be reduced in the areas with higher densities of goose nests that foxes are attracted to [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although our artificial nest experiment was confined to two years, one with moderate numbers of lemmings and one without, our long-term data at one site indicated no effect of lemmings on probability of predation of real shorebird nests. It is possible that distance from goose colony is interacting with lemming abundance at a smaller scale that we may not be detecting in our long-term data at the site ~10km from the colony. However, [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] found effects on artificial nest predation greater than ~10km away suggesting our scale may be adequate. Overall, these studies support our results and further highlight that predator-prey relationships may vary among sites and regions as indicated by the lower predation rate [elevated survival probability) in the presence of nesting geese reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Population-level consequences and sub-lethal effects</title><p>The spatio-temporal goose-related trends in predator indices we report have the potential to drive nesting decisions, densities, and reproductive success of shorebirds that breed in northern latitudes in response to their perceived predation risk [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

We found evidence of complex interactions between geese and shorebirds mediated by generalist predators. Light geese bolstered jaeger and to a much lesser extent arctic fox populations, which negatively affected shorebird nest survival. Predator activity was elevated around the goose colony, but exhibited inter-annual variation, which translated to variation in survival of artificial nests. The resulting elevated risk of predation around the colony could be influencing shorebird nesting strategies and ultimately reproductive success. The potential for population-level consequences is further compounded by goose-induced habitat alteration that can reduce vegetative concealment [<xref rid="pone.0221727.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] perhaps increasing predation risk for some shorebird species. Our study highlights the importance of identifying interactions between geese and shorebirds, which may vary by site and prey abundance, and how the effect of light goose colonies on shorebirds can extend further than any habitat-related effects close to the colony.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Support for this research was provided by the Arctic Goose Joint Venture and was funded by scholarships provided to S.A.F. by the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, W.
