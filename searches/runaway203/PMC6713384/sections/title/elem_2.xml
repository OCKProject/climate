  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted research within three primary study sites and four plots in the eastern Canadian Arctic. The first study site is situated within a Lesser Snow Goose colony in the East Bay Migratory Bird Sanctuary (EBMBS) on Southampton Island, Nunavut (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221727.g001" href="#pone.0221727.g001">Fig 1</a>). The populations of geese within this colony and an adjacent colony to the southwest (the “Coral Harbour” colony) have increased from 156,700 breeding birds in 1997 to 289,700 in 2014 ([

   <span class="italic">unpublished</span>). The second site, the East Bay Mainland Shorebird Camp (hereafter East Bay Mainland), is a long-term shorebird study site initiated in 1999 and is also situated within the EBMBS ~10km from the goose colony. Although the site is not typically used for breeding by light geese, family groups use the site extensively later in the season for foraging. The third study site, the Coats Island Shorebird Camp, is situated on Coats Island approximately 135km south of Southampton Island. Light geese do not breed regularly at this study site and lemmings are absent from the island [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To gauge spatial effects of light goose presence on predator indices and risk of predation we established four 10-12ha plots at increasing distances from the goose colony by drawing coordinates in a random-stratified fashion. The plots on Southampton Island were situated 0km (Within: 2 plots), 3-4km (Near: 2 plots) and 8-10km (Far: 3 plots) from the goose colony and predator indices and predation risk were compared to those from plots established on Coats Island (3 plots). We conducted fieldwork at these three sites during the shorebird breeding season from early-June to late-July, in 2015–2016. We also recorded a subset of variables (see below) at the East Bay Mainland site in 2000–2016.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our main objectives were to determine whether indices of predator abundance and activity responded to temporal and spatial variation in light goose and lemming abundance, and whether these changes affected the predation rates of shorebird nests. To identify temporal changes in the abundance and activity of predators and their prey, we generated group-specific indices (see below) from daily observations (hereafter observational predator-prey indices) at East Bay Mainland from 2000–2016 (We did not collect long-term observational indices at our other study sites). We then used shorebird nest survival at East Bay Mainland from 2004–2016 to relate predator-prey abundance and activity indices to risk of predation.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify spatial trends in predator abundance and activity, in 2015 and 2016 we generated predator indices using time-lapse cameras (hereafter camera predator indices) placed within the four study plots established at increasing distances from the goose colony. Measuring the spatial patterns in shorebird nest predation was challenging, in that too few shorebird nests were found Within and Near the goose colony for statistical analyses; presumably because of reduced nesting densities and nest survival in these heavily goose-affected areas. Therefore, in 2015 and 2016, we placed artificial nests within each of the four study plots to relate predation risk to spatial variation in camera predator indices. The Animal Care Committee of Environment and Climate Change Canada approved our procedures, and permits were granted from Federal and Territorial Governments (e.g., NUN-SCI-14-05, WL2016-053). No animals were handled during this study and there were no ethical concerns regarding animal welfare. All research was conducted on territorial land and within the East Bay Migratory Birds Sanctuary under permit NUN-MBS-14-05 granted by Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p>

Nevertheless, we considered both species as potential predators because they can influence artificial shorebird nest predation [Young et al. 
    <span class="italic">In Review</span>) and might act as predators of shorebird chicks. Collared Lemmings (
    <span class="italic">Dicrostonix torquatus</span>) on Southampton Island experience irregular cycles, but are absent from Coats Island [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We generated indices of abundance and activity for predator and prey, respectively, at East Bay Mainland for foxes, jaegers, and lemmings from 2000–2016, and light geese and gulls from 2004–2016 by calculating the number of individuals seen per eight-hour person-day in the field. Individual observers made an effort to avoid repeat counting of predators and prey, but this repeat counting is difficult to avoid across observers. Observational indices are known to be effective at approximating vertebrate abundance [
    <a rid="pone.0221727.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref036">36</a>,
    <a rid="pone.0221727.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref037">37</a>], and are excellent indices in our study because they likely represent a combination of abundances and activity rates, while taking into account non-reproductive individuals. Such a combination is ideal in our study because the impacts of predators on prey likely increase with both the abundance and the activity of predators and prey.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2015–2016, we also generated camera predator indices using Plotwatcher Pro
    <span class="sup">TM</span> time-lapse cameras mounted on camouflaged stands placed at the south-eastern corner of each of the study plots (Within, Near, Far, Coats Island). Each camera was positioned facing northwest so as to capture the greatest field of view of the plot (and artificial nests) and then programmed to take a picture every five seconds. This timing likely biases indices of foxes, which spend more time intensively searching for nests in plots, high compared to indices of gulls and jaegers, which move quickly in and out of frame of view, but remains constant among study plots and years. At the end of the field season we reviewed all photographs manually and recorded the species, time, and date that individuals entered and left the field of view of the camera. From 16-June to 20-July of each year we installed permanent cameras within plots (Within: 2 cameras, Near: 2, Far: 3, Coats: 3) situated at increasing distances from the goose colony. Similar to observational predator-prey indices, we generated camera predator indices by calculating the number of predator species seen on camera per eight-hour camera-day. We did not observe lemmings on cameras and, because of the relatively short distance among study sites on Southampton Island, assume that lemming abundance was consistent among them.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the study plots on Southampton Island, we monitored the nests of eight tundra-nesting shorebird species: American Golden-Plover (
    <span class="italic">Pluvialis dominica</span>), Black-bellied Plover (
    <span class="italic">Pluvialis squatarola</span>), Dunlin (

We used a Global Positioning System (GPS) to mark the location of each nest (±3m) and placed a wooden tongue depressor ~10m from the nest cup to facilitate subsequent monitoring for nest fate.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon discovery of nests, we placed two eggs in warm water and used their degree of flotation to estimate their age and approximate hatch date (±4 days) following [
    <a rid="pone.0221727.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref038">38</a>]. We then revisited each nest weekly throughout the incubation period to document any predation events. Three days prior to expected hatch we visited nests every day to ensure that the fate was documented. We considered nests to be depredated if eggs disappeared before the expected hatch date. For the purposes of this analysis relating to predation, we excluded abandoned nests or any for which we were unsure of their fate.

    <span class="italic">relative</span> temporal and spatial patterns of risk associated with fluctuations in predator-prey abundance and activity indices rather than absolute levels of predation.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the experiment, we placed artificial nests in a stratified-random design, with samples evenly distributed among the six dominant habitat types (Dry Heath, Scrub Willow, Sedge Meadow, Moss Carpet, Intertidal, Gravel Ridge; see [
    <a rid="pone.0221727.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref014">14</a>] for descriptions) within the study plots (Within, Near, Far, Coats Island). We marked the location of each artificial nest with a handheld GPS unit and a tongue depressor stuck in the ground within 10m of the nest.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each year, we deployed and monitored artificial nests during two trials each lasting nine days. We considered artificial nests depredated if at least one egg was taken and successful if the clutch remained intact over the nine-day experiment. Artificial nest experiments were conducted from 28 June– 19 July in 2015, and 28 June– 17 July in 2016. This timing corresponds with the mid- to late-incubation periods for shorebirds breeding at these sites.</p>

We tested models that incorporated combinations of individual and additive effects of each predator/prey species as well as interactions between each predator species and lemming abundance. To account for any unexplained non-predator-prey related indices that may co-vary with time we also tested a model with a single variable of Year. We included shorebird species as a random effect in each model, recognizing the consistent differences in nest survival among species e.g., [
