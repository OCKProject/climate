 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatio-temporal goose-related trends in predator indices we report have the potential to drive nesting decisions, densities, and reproductive success of shorebirds that breed in northern latitudes in response to their perceived predation risk [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref039">39</a>]. When faced with locally elevated predator abundances, birds may choose to nest and suffer elevated predation [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref015">15</a>], abandon, or forego nesting [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref056">56</a>]. Goose-augmented predator communities have already been implicated in the locally depressed densities of shorebirds around goose colonies [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref052">52</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref057">57</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref058">58</a>]). Goose-induced habitat alteration is also well-documented [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref050">50</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref059">59</a>] and may decrease the availability of vegetative concealment that influences nest survival for some species [

  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref060">60</a>], potentially compounding the effects of geese. Furthermore, non-consumptive effects of predators such as elevated stress, fewer or smaller eggs, and increased nest recesses in response to elevated perceived risk of predation have been reported in other species [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref061">61</a>â€“
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref063">63</a>] and warrant investigation in the context of Arctic-nesting shorebirds.
