 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Functional and numerical responses of generalist Arctic predators to their primary prey, lemmings, have been well-documented [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref013">13</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref045">45</a>]. The strength of these relationships may vary by site [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref046">46</a>] and depend on the presence of allochthonous resources such as geese [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref023">23</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref047">47</a>]. Over a 17-year period, we found no systematic changes in indices of predators or prey at our East Bay Mainland site, 10 km away from a goose colony. Yearly indices of geese did however positively influence indices of two potential nest predators, gulls and jaegers, while lemming abundance had no measurable effect on the abundance of any predators in our time series. When food is abundant, jaegers may have more nests, produce larger clutches, and experience elevated breeding success [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref045">45</a>]. Abundant goose eggs and goslings can also contribute to higher growth of gull chicks [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref048">48</a>], potentially bolstering some populations [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref049">49</a>]. It is therefore possible that at East Bay Mainland, during years when goose eggs and goslings are abundant in the nearby colony, gulls and jaegers are experiencing higher overall reproductive success and/or exhibiting elevated activity rates in response to the demands of their offspring.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also found all predator indices were higher within and near the goose colony compared to far from the colony, but this relationship varied between the two years and may be the result of varying goose abundance and colony size. In 2015 goose, gull, jaeger, and fox indices at East Bay Mainland were 2.96, 1.23, 1.58, and 2.00 times higher, respectively, than in 2016. This trend is consistent with the long-term positive association between geese and predator indices. Inter-annual fluctuations in the size of goose breeding populations are not uncommon [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref026">26</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref050">50</a>] and may reflect variations in breeding effort due variation in temperature, snow, and other weather conditions on the breeding grounds [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref051">51</a>]. The boundaries of breeding colonies can also vary inter-annually [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref025">25</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref052">52</a>]. These factors could have influenced the number and distribution of geese in 2015 vs. 2016, potentially influencing distribution of nest predators captured in our camera indices.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of this inter-annual variation, generalist predator indices at the three sites on Southampton Island in both years were substantially higher than on Coats Island where both breeding light geese and lemmings are absent. Lamarre et al., [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref052">52</a>] documented aggregative responses of arctic fox and aerial predators to a goose colony on Bylot Island, Nunavut; this effect was pronounced for foxes when lemmings were scarce. Parasitic jaeger activity can also be elevated within light goose colonies during non-lemming peak years [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref035">35</a>]. Although we found no effect of lemming abundance on predator indices in our long-term data at East Bay Mainland, over more years of monitoring, particularly within the goose colony, an influence of lemmings on predator indices may still emerge, and show that lemming peaks could be contributing to some of the variation in our predator indices.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Goose eggs and goslings can sustain elevated predator populations [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref048">48</a>] in the absence of abundant and regular lemming cycles and may therefore be responsible for the higher indices on Southampton Island than on Coats Island where predators are limited to depredating patchily distributed waterfowl and shorebird nests. Overall, these results highlight the numerical and aggregative responses of generalist predators to an increasing goose colony and the importance of goose colonies in buffering predators against lemming crashes [
