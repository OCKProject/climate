  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref012">12</a>]. Glaucous (
  <span class="italic">Larus hyperboreus</span>) and Herring Gulls (
  <span class="italic">Larus smithsonianus</span>) have been recorded depredating artificial shorebird nests (Young et al. 
  <span class="italic">In Review</span>; [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref012">12</a>]) and regularly depredate goose nests [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref035">35</a>], but neither have been identified as major predators of real shorebird eggs at our sites, based on time lapse camera footage. Nevertheless, we considered both species as potential predators because they can influence artificial shorebird nest predation [Young et al. 
  <span class="italic">In Review</span>) and might act as predators of shorebird chicks. Collared Lemmings (
  <span class="italic">Dicrostonix torquatus</span>) on Southampton Island experience irregular cycles, but are absent from Coats Island [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We generated indices of abundance and activity for predator and prey, respectively, at East Bay Mainland for foxes, jaegers, and lemmings from 2000–2016, and light geese and gulls from 2004–2016 by calculating the number of individuals seen per eight-hour person-day in the field. Individual observers made an effort to avoid repeat counting of predators and prey, but this repeat counting is difficult to avoid across observers. Observational indices are known to be effective at approximating vertebrate abundance [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref036">36</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref037">37</a>], and are excellent indices in our study because they likely represent a combination of abundances and activity rates, while taking into account non-reproductive individuals. Such a combination is ideal in our study because the impacts of predators on prey likely increase with both the abundance and the activity of predators and prey.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2015–2016, we also generated camera predator indices using Plotwatcher Pro
  <span class="sup">TM</span> time-lapse cameras mounted on camouflaged stands placed at the south-eastern corner of each of the study plots (Within, Near, Far, Coats Island). Each camera was positioned facing northwest so as to capture the greatest field of view of the plot (and artificial nests) and then programmed to take a picture every five seconds. This timing likely biases indices of foxes, which spend more time intensively searching for nests in plots, high compared to indices of gulls and jaegers, which move quickly in and out of frame of view, but remains constant among study plots and years. At the end of the field season we reviewed all photographs manually and recorded the species, time, and date that individuals entered and left the field of view of the camera. From 16-June to 20-July of each year we installed permanent cameras within plots (Within: 2 cameras, Near: 2, Far: 3, Coats: 3) situated at increasing distances from the goose colony. Similar to observational predator-prey indices, we generated camera predator indices by calculating the number of predator species seen on camera per eight-hour camera-day. We did not observe lemmings on cameras and, because of the relatively short distance among study sites on Southampton Island, assume that lemming abundance was consistent among them.
