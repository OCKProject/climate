Across 13 years of nest monitoring on Southampton Island, predation rates of real shorebird nests was positively correlated with our fox and jaeger indices, but lemmings had no effect. Individually, foxes and jaegers increased nest predation probability by ~5% per 0.1 index increase. During years when both predator indices are elevated, predation rates of shorebird nests could reach 91%, an increase of ~42% from low predator years. Considering the average number of nests found per year at our sites is 70, this equates to only 6 successful shorebird nests, excluding abandonment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a large-scale multi-year analysis across 14 shorebird species and 17 sites, Weiser et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref043">43</a>] also reported no effect of arvicoline rodents on survival of shorebird nests. Furthermore, this study found evidence of a non-linear fox-related decline in Western Sandpiper (
  <span class="italic">Calidris mauri</span>) daily nest survival probability of 0.08 between maximum and minimum fox abundances, further supporting our results and highlighting the variation in predator-prey relationships among sites.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over a shorter temporal period (two years) we also found a negative relationship between distance from goose colony and predation rate of artificial shorebird nests that corresponded to the spatial patterns in camera predator indices. This effect was most pronounced in 2015 when overall predation rate was higher than in 2016.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a five-year study on Bylot Island, in the Canadian high arctic, [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref052">52</a>] found a similar relationship between distance from goose colony and the probability of predation rate of artificial nests, however, this effect was modulated by lemming abundance. At the same site, [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref017">17</a>] reported survival of artificial shorebird nests was positively related to lemming abundance, but may be reduced in the areas with higher densities of goose nests that foxes are attracted to [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref013">13</a>]. Although our artificial nest experiment was confined to two years, one with moderate numbers of lemmings and one without, our long-term data at one site indicated no effect of lemmings on probability of predation of real shorebird nests. It is possible that distance from goose colony is interacting with lemming abundance at a smaller scale that we may not be detecting in our long-term data at the site ~10km from the colony. However, [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref052">52</a>] found effects on artificial nest predation greater than ~10km away suggesting our scale may be adequate. Overall, these studies support our results and further highlight that predator-prey relationships may vary among sites and regions as indicated by the lower predation rate [elevated survival probability) in the presence of nesting geese reported elsewhere [
