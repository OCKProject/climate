 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted research within three primary study sites and four plots in the eastern Canadian Arctic. The first study site is situated within a Lesser Snow Goose colony in the East Bay Migratory Bird Sanctuary (EBMBS) on Southampton Island, Nunavut (

The second site, the East Bay Mainland Shorebird Camp (hereafter East Bay Mainland), is a long-term shorebird study site initiated in 1999 and is also situated within the EBMBS ~10km from the goose colony. Although the site is not typically used for breeding by light geese, family groups use the site extensively later in the season for foraging. The third study site, the Coats Island Shorebird Camp, is situated on Coats Island approximately 135km south of Southampton Island. Light geese do not breed regularly at this study site and lemmings are absent from the island [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To gauge spatial effects of light goose presence on predator indices and risk of predation we established four 10-12ha plots at increasing distances from the goose colony by drawing coordinates in a random-stratified fashion. The plots on Southampton Island were situated 0km (Within: 2 plots), 3-4km (Near: 2 plots) and 8-10km (Far: 3 plots) from the goose colony and predator indices and predation risk were compared to those from plots established on Coats Island (3 plots). We conducted fieldwork at these three sites during the shorebird breeding season from early-June to late-July, in 2015–2016. We also recorded a subset of variables (see below) at the East Bay Mainland site in 2000–2016.</p>
