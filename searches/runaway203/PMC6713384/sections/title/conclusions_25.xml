 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The opposing population trends of light geese and shorebirds, and significant overlap in range and habitat use [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref064">64</a>] suggest the potential for geese to be influencing the reproductive success of sympatric shorebirds. We found evidence of complex interactions between geese and shorebirds mediated by generalist predators. Light geese bolstered jaeger and to a much lesser extent arctic fox populations, which negatively affected shorebird nest survival. Predator activity was elevated around the goose colony, but exhibited inter-annual variation, which translated to variation in survival of artificial nests. The resulting elevated risk of predation around the colony could be influencing shorebird nesting strategies and ultimately reproductive success. The potential for population-level consequences is further compounded by goose-induced habitat alteration that can reduce vegetative concealment [

Our study highlights the importance of identifying interactions between geese and shorebirds, which may vary by site and prey abundance, and how the effect of light goose colonies on shorebirds can extend further than any habitat-related effects close to the colony.
