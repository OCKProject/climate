 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Arctic is undergoing rapid changes with anthropogenic-driven shifts in climate having important and well-documented impacts on habitat quality, quantity, and spatial distribution (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref001">1</a>]). These changes could significantly influence populations of Arctic-breeding birds, the most diverse and vertebrate taxa of the circumpolar Arctic [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref002">2</a>]. Northward shifts in vegetation communities have already influenced the availability of nesting habitat for sub-arctic breeding shorebirds [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref003">3</a>], and advances in peak prey availability have created a mismatch with the phenology of chick hatch [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref004">4</a>], and lower growth and chick survival in some [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref006">6</a>] but not all cases [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref008">8</a>]. While at large scales these changes have the potential to alter bird distribution, phenology, and demography, at smaller spatial scales the trophic interactions among predators and their prey may play a more dominant role in structuring communities [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref010">10</a>]. These predator-prey interactions can have cascading effects on the populations of sympatric birds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In northern regions, arctic foxes (
  <span class="italic">Vulpes lagopus</span>) and jaegers (Parasitic, 
  <span class="italic">Stercorarius parasiticus</span> and to a lesser extent, Long-tailed Jaeger, 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">longicaudus</span>) depredate shorebird nests “incidentally” [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref012">12</a>] lemmings (
  <span class="italic">Dicrostonyx spp</span>., 
  <span class="italic">Lemmus spp</span>.) and the eggs and chicks of larger birds such as geese are the primary or secondary prey, and shorebird nests may be depredated opportunistically when they are encountered [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref013">13</a>]. Nonetheless, these predators constitute the primary cause of nest failure for shorebirds across the Arctic [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref015">15</a>]. Thus, lemmings, goose eggs, and goslings interact with shorebirds indirectly by influencing the abundance and behaviour of their shared predators.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predator populations may exhibit numerical responses (increases in abundance) to lemming peaks [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref017">17</a>] and more specifically, aggregative responses [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref017">17</a>] to goose colonies, in both cases resulting in higher incidental predation of nearby shorebird nests. Alternatively, predators may switch their search efforts between prey items (functional response; [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref018">18</a>], or become satiated during lemming peaks or within goose colonies, alleviating predation pressure on shorebird nests [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref019">19</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref020">20</a>]. Local or regional changes in the availability of lemmings and/or geese could therefore dramatically affect the risk of predation and reproductive success of tundra-nesting shorebirds.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the last 30 years climate-induced changes in environmental conditions have resulted in decreases in the frequency and amplitude of lemming peaks at some northern sites ([
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref021">21</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref023">23</a>] but see Ehrich et al. 
  <span class="italic">in press</span>). Five-fold decreases in peak magnitude have been reported in Greenland [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref021">21</a>]. By contrast, North American populations of Greater (

  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">c</span>. 
  <span class="italic">caerulescens</span>), and Ross’ Geese (
  <span class="italic">Chen rossii</span>; hereafter collectively referred to as ‘light geese’) have increased exponentially in abundance over the last 60 years [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref024">24</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref025">25</a>], in response to food subsidies on their wintering grounds [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref026">26</a>]. Band-recoveries now suggest that the adult midcontinent lesser snow goose population may be greater than 15 million individuals, an estimate significantly higher than the ~2.5 million estimated in the early 1970s [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref027">27</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decadal declines and increases in the abundances of lemmings and light geese, respectively, could have negative consequences for numerous Arctic-breeding shorebirds whose populations have declined over this same period [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref028">28</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref030">30</a>]. Although these declines could arise from a multitude of factors across shorebirds’ large ranges, reproductive success for Arctic-breeding shorebirds is low at some locations (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref031">31</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref032">32</a>]) and theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that breeding failure has the potential to explain shorebirds’ negative population trends [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref033">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite low biodiversity in comparison to lower latitudes, Arctic systems are governed by complex trophic interactions among shorebirds, lemmings, and geese. Interactions mediated through shared predators may vary regionally depending on guilds of predators and prey, or climate. The objectives of our study were therefore to identify the numerical and functional responses of generalist predators to varying prey availability (i.e. lemming availability and goose colony presence), and relate these responses to predation risk for shorebird nests in the eastern Canadian Arctic. Using long-term field observations from a study site near a light goose colony, we identify temporal trends in predator-prey indices over a 16-year period and relate these trends to survival of shorebird nests. We then used 24-hour time-lapse cameras in concert with artificial shorebird nests both placed in plots situated at increasing distances from the goose colony to record spatial variation in predator indices and experimentally test for variation in predation risk in relation to the presence of nesting light geese.</p>
