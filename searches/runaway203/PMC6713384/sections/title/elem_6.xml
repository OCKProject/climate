  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arctic Foxes and jaegers prey upon lemmings, and goose and shorebird nests [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref011">11</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref012">12</a>]. Glaucous (
   <span class="italic">Larus hyperboreus</span>) and Herring Gulls (
   <span class="italic">Larus smithsonianus</span>) have been recorded depredating artificial shorebird nests (Young et al. 
   <span class="italic">In Review</span>; [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref012">12</a>]) and regularly depredate goose nests [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref011">11</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref035">35</a>], but neither have been identified as major predators of real shorebird eggs at our sites, based on time lapse camera footage. Nevertheless, we considered both species as potential predators because they can influence artificial shorebird nest predation [Young et al. 
   <span class="italic">In Review</span>) and might act as predators of shorebird chicks. Collared Lemmings (
   <span class="italic">Dicrostonix torquatus</span>) on Southampton Island experience irregular cycles, but are absent from Coats Island [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref034">34</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We generated indices of abundance and activity for predator and prey, respectively, at East Bay Mainland for foxes, jaegers, and lemmings from 2000–2016, and light geese and gulls from 2004–2016 by calculating the number of individuals seen per eight-hour person-day in the field. Individual observers made an effort to avoid repeat counting of predators and prey, but this repeat counting is difficult to avoid across observers. Observational indices are known to be effective at approximating vertebrate abundance [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref036">36</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref037">37</a>], and are excellent indices in our study because they likely represent a combination of abundances and activity rates, while taking into account non-reproductive individuals. Such a combination is ideal in our study because the impacts of predators on prey likely increase with both the abundance and the activity of predators and prey.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2015–2016, we also generated camera predator indices using Plotwatcher Pro
   <span class="sup">TM</span> time-lapse cameras mounted on camouflaged stands placed at the south-eastern corner of each of the study plots (Within, Near, Far, Coats Island). Each camera was positioned facing northwest so as to capture the greatest field of view of the plot (and artificial nests) and then programmed to take a picture every five seconds. This timing likely biases indices of foxes, which spend more time intensively searching for nests in plots, high compared to indices of gulls and jaegers, which move quickly in and out of frame of view, but remains constant among study plots and years. At the end of the field season we reviewed all photographs manually and recorded the species, time, and date that individuals entered and left the field of view of the camera. From 16-June to 20-July of each year we installed permanent cameras within plots (Within: 2 cameras, Near: 2, Far: 3, Coats: 3) situated at increasing distances from the goose colony. Similar to observational predator-prey indices, we generated camera predator indices by calculating the number of predator species seen on camera per eight-hour camera-day. We did not observe lemmings on cameras and, because of the relatively short distance among study sites on Southampton Island, assume that lemming abundance was consistent among them.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shorebird species and nest monitoring</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the study plots on Southampton Island, we monitored the nests of eight tundra-nesting shorebird species: American Golden-Plover (
   <span class="italic">Pluvialis dominica</span>), Black-bellied Plover (
   <span class="italic">Pluvialis squatarola</span>), Dunlin (
   <span class="italic">Calidris alpina</span>), Red Phalarope (
   <span class="italic">Phalaropus fulicarius</span>), Ruddy Turnstone (
   <span class="italic">Arenaria interpres</span>), Semipalmated Plover (
   <span class="italic">Charadrius semipalmatus</span>), Semipalmated Sandpiper (
   <span class="italic">Calidris pusilla</span>), and White-rumped Sandpiper (
   <span class="italic">Calidris fuscicollis</span>). For each species we used behavioural observations and flushed incubating birds from nests while walking to find nests. We used a Global Positioning System (GPS) to mark the location of each nest (±3m) and placed a wooden tongue depressor ~10m from the nest cup to facilitate subsequent monitoring for nest fate.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon discovery of nests, we placed two eggs in warm water and used their degree of flotation to estimate their age and approximate hatch date (±4 days) following [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref038">38</a>]. We then revisited each nest weekly throughout the incubation period to document any predation events. Three days prior to expected hatch we visited nests every day to ensure that the fate was documented. We considered nests to be depredated if eggs disappeared before the expected hatch date. For the purposes of this analysis relating to predation, we excluded abandoned nests or any for which we were unsure of their fate.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Artificial nest experiment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Artificial shorebird nests comprised four Japanese Quail (
   <span class="italic">Coturnix japonica</span>) eggs supplied by CRO Quail Farms Inc., which were placed in a divot in the ground. Quail eggs mimic the size and colouration of 
   <span class="italic">Calidris</span> shorebird eggs. Survival of artificial and real shorebird nests may differ because of the ability of shorebirds to conceal nests or use distraction displays [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref039">39</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref040">40</a>], but nevertheless, they have proven to be an effective measure of relative predation risk in several Arctic predation risk experiments [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref014">14</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref039">39</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref041">41</a>]. Our intent with the experiment was therefore to identify 
   <span class="italic">relative</span> temporal and spatial patterns of risk associated with fluctuations in predator-prey abundance and activity indices rather than absolute levels of predation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the experiment, we placed artificial nests in a stratified-random design, with samples evenly distributed among the six dominant habitat types (Dry Heath, Scrub Willow, Sedge Meadow, Moss Carpet, Intertidal, Gravel Ridge; see [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref014">14</a>] for descriptions) within the study plots (Within, Near, Far, Coats Island). We marked the location of each artificial nest with a handheld GPS unit and a tongue depressor stuck in the ground within 10m of the nest.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each year, we deployed and monitored artificial nests during two trials each lasting nine days. We considered artificial nests depredated if at least one egg was taken and successful if the clutch remained intact over the nine-day experiment. Artificial nest experiments were conducted from 28 June– 19 July in 2015, and 28 June– 17 July in 2016. This timing corresponds with the mid- to late-incubation periods for shorebirds breeding at these sites.</p>
