 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Arctic and sub-Arctic systems where food availability is seasonal and unpredictable, generalist predators may exhibit functional and numerical responses, thereby affecting the survival of multiple prey species. Recent rises in populations of light geese and alterations in cycles of lemmings may therefore influence the cyclic dynamics of generalist predators and indirectly influence the risk of predation and probability of survival of incidental prey such as shorebirds. Over 13 years we found that gull and jaeger abundance and activity indices were positively associated with yearly goose indices, regardless of lemming abundance and that during one of two years of camera monitoring all predator indices were negatively related to distance from goose colony. Long-term monitoring of shorebird nests indicated that predation probability was positively related to fox and jaeger indices. In addition, artificial shorebird nest predation probability, during the two year experiment, was negatively associated with distance from goose colony. These results add to our understanding of variations in predator-prey relationships among Arctic study sites and suggest that, in some areas, light goose presence 
  <span class="italic">has the potential to</span> indirectly affect the risk of predation for shorebirds by influencing the temporal and spatial distribution, and activity of their shared predators.

   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref046">46</a>] and depend on the presence of allochthonous resources such as geese [

   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref047">47</a>]. Over a 17-year period, we found no systematic changes in indices of predators or prey at our East Bay Mainland site, 10 km away from a goose colony. Yearly indices of geese did however positively influence indices of two potential nest predators, gulls and jaegers, while lemming abundance had no measurable effect on the abundance of any predators in our time series. When food is abundant, jaegers may have more nests, produce larger clutches, and experience elevated breeding success [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref002">2</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref045">45</a>]. Abundant goose eggs and goslings can also contribute to higher growth of gull chicks [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref048">48</a>], potentially bolstering some populations [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref049">49</a>]. It is therefore possible that at East Bay Mainland, during years when goose eggs and goslings are abundant in the nearby colony, gulls and jaegers are experiencing higher overall reproductive success and/or exhibiting elevated activity rates in response to the demands of their offspring.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also found all predator indices were higher within and near the goose colony compared to far from the colony, but this relationship varied between the two years and may be the result of varying goose abundance and colony size. In 2015 goose, gull, jaeger, and fox indices at East Bay Mainland were 2.96, 1.23, 1.58, and 2.00 times higher, respectively, than in 2016. This trend is consistent with the long-term positive association between geese and predator indices. Inter-annual fluctuations in the size of goose breeding populations are not uncommon [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref026">26</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref050">50</a>] and may reflect variations in breeding effort due variation in temperature, snow, and other weather conditions on the breeding grounds [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref051">51</a>]. The boundaries of breeding colonies can also vary inter-annually [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref025">25</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref052">52</a>]. These factors could have influenced the number and distribution of geese in 2015 vs. 2016, potentially influencing distribution of nest predators captured in our camera indices.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of this inter-annual variation, generalist predator indices at the three sites on Southampton Island in both years were substantially higher than on Coats Island where both breeding light geese and lemmings are absent. Lamarre et al., [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref052">52</a>] documented aggregative responses of arctic fox and aerial predators to a goose colony on Bylot Island, Nunavut; this effect was pronounced for foxes when lemmings were scarce. Parasitic jaeger activity can also be elevated within light goose colonies during non-lemming peak years [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref011">11</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref035">35</a>]. Although we found no effect of lemming abundance on predator indices in our long-term data at East Bay Mainland, over more years of monitoring, particularly within the goose colony, an influence of lemmings on predator indices may still emerge, and show that lemming peaks could be contributing to some of the variation in our predator indices.

   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref048">48</a>] in the absence of abundant and regular lemming cycles and may therefore be responsible for the higher indices on Southampton Island than on Coats Island where predators are limited to depredating patchily distributed waterfowl and shorebird nests. Overall, these results highlight the numerical and aggregative responses of generalist predators to an increasing goose colony and the importance of goose colonies in buffering predators against lemming crashes [

Across 13 years of nest monitoring on Southampton Island, predation rates of real shorebird nests was positively correlated with our fox and jaeger indices, but lemmings had no effect. Individually, foxes and jaegers increased nest predation probability by ~5% per 0.1 index increase. During years when both predator indices are elevated, predation rates of shorebird nests could reach 91%, an increase of ~42% from low predator years. Considering the average number of nests found per year at our sites is 70, this equates to only 6 successful shorebird nests, excluding abandonment.

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over a shorter temporal period (two years) we also found a negative relationship between distance from goose colony and predation rate of artificial shorebird nests that corresponded to the spatial patterns in camera predator indices.

   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref013">13</a>]. Although our artificial nest experiment was confined to two years, one with moderate numbers of lemmings and one without, our long-term data at one site indicated no effect of lemmings on probability of predation of real shorebird nests. It is possible that distance from goose colony is interacting with lemming abundance at a smaller scale that we may not be detecting in our long-term data at the site ~10km from the colony. However, [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The opposing population trends of light geese and shorebirds, and significant overlap in range and habitat use [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref064">64</a>] suggest the potential for geese to be influencing the reproductive success of sympatric shorebirds. We found evidence of complex interactions between geese and shorebirds mediated by generalist predators. Light geese bolstered jaeger and to a much lesser extent arctic fox populations, which negatively affected shorebird nest survival. Predator activity was elevated around the goose colony, but exhibited inter-annual variation, which translated to variation in survival of artificial nests. The resulting elevated risk of predation around the colony could be influencing shorebird nesting strategies and ultimately reproductive success. The potential for population-level consequences is further compounded by goose-induced habitat alteration that can reduce vegetative concealment [
   <a rid="pone.0221727.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref057">57</a>] perhaps increasing predation risk for some shorebird species. Our study highlights the importance of identifying interactions between geese and shorebirds, which may vary by site and prey abundance, and how the effect of light goose colonies on shorebirds can extend further than any habitat-related effects close to the colony.
