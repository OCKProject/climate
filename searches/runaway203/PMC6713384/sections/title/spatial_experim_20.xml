 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the two years of camera monitoring within the four study plots situated at increasing distances from the goose colony, we recorded 413 independent predator sightings during 9,613 hours of camera monitoring. We also deployed 530 artificial nests. Overall camera predator indices varied significantly (F
  <sub>2, 12</sub>: 20.41, p &lt; 0.001) with gull indices being the highest (0.23 sightings per camera day), followed by fox (0.06) and jaeger indices (0.02). Camera predator indices were negatively related to distance from the goose colony (F
  <sub>1, 12</sub>: 13.31, p &lt; 0.001), but this effect varied by year (F
  <sub>1, 12</sub>: 5.24, p &lt; 0.05; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221727.g005" href="#pone.0221727.g005">Fig 5A</a>). The predation probability of artificial nests varied by year (F
  <sub>1, 522</sub>: 15.68, p &lt; 0.001; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221727.g005" href="#pone.0221727.g005">Fig 5B</a>) with it lower in 2016 compared to 2015 and was inversely related to distance from the goose colony (F
  <sub>1, 522</sub>: 77.22, p &lt; 0.001), during one year (F
  <sub>1, 522</sub>: 14.26, p &lt; 0.001).
