 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a general linear model to determine the effect of distance from the goose colony on camera predator indices (response) with plot distance (Within, Near, Far, Coats), predator species (fox, gull, or jaeger), and year (2015 and 2016), and interactions between the three variables as predictors. For the results from the artificial nest experiment we used a generalized linear mixed effects model with a binomial distribution to identify the influence of plot distance from goose colony, year (2015 and 2016), and an interaction between the two on the probability of predation of an artificial nest during the nine-day experiment. In this model we also included trial as a random effect. All statistical analyses were performed in R Version 3.3.1 (R Core Team 2017).</p>
