 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the study plots on Southampton Island, we monitored the nests of eight tundra-nesting shorebird species: American Golden-Plover (
  <span class="italic">Pluvialis dominica</span>), Black-bellied Plover (
  <span class="italic">Pluvialis squatarola</span>), Dunlin (
  <span class="italic">Calidris alpina</span>), Red Phalarope (
  <span class="italic">Phalaropus fulicarius</span>), Ruddy Turnstone (
  <span class="italic">Arenaria interpres</span>), Semipalmated Plover (
  <span class="italic">Charadrius semipalmatus</span>), Semipalmated Sandpiper (
  <span class="italic">Calidris pusilla</span>), and White-rumped Sandpiper (
  <span class="italic">Calidris fuscicollis</span>). For each species we used behavioural observations and flushed incubating birds from nests while walking to find nests. We used a Global Positioning System (GPS) to mark the location of each nest (±3m) and placed a wooden tongue depressor ~10m from the nest cup to facilitate subsequent monitoring for nest fate.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon discovery of nests, we placed two eggs in warm water and used their degree of flotation to estimate their age and approximate hatch date (±4 days) following [
  <a rid="pone.0221727.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0221727.ref038">38</a>]. We then revisited each nest weekly throughout the incubation period to document any predation events. Three days prior to expected hatch we visited nests every day to ensure that the fate was documented. We considered nests to be depredated if eggs disappeared before the expected hatch date. For the purposes of this analysis relating to predation, we excluded abandoned nests or any for which we were unsure of their fate.
