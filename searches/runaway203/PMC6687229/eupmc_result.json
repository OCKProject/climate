    "The real emission mitigation by the ecological restoration projects depends upon the integrated effect of all greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets rather than the carbon sequestration alone. However, a comprehensive and robust methodology for estimating the relevant GHG budgets and net mitigation of China's ecological restoration projects is still urgently to await development. Based on the methods from IPCC and statistical data of the management practices under the projects, we constructed a methodology for carbon accounting and determining net mitigation for ecological restoration projects in China (CANM-EP). GHG emissions generated from different processes and practices of the projects were included in the CANM-EP, and by this methodology, carbon sequestration, GHG balance changes induced by ecological response, on-site and off-site GHG emissions could be estimated. Therefore, the CANM-EP provides comprehensive methods to estimate the whole GHG budgets as well as the net mitigation of China's ecological restoration projects. •The CANM-EP provides accounting methods for comprehensive processes and management practices under respective ecological restoration projects in China.•The CANM-EP could simultaneously estimate carbon sequestration and GHG emissions of the projects.•The CANM-EP indicates net carbon sequestration and net contribution of China's ecological restoration projects to climate change mitigation."
