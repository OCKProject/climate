 <p id="par0325" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In some of the key national ecological restoration projects (e.g., Natural Forest Resource Protection), due to the management of the timber yield reduction, the use of coal is popularized to compensate for the reduced supply and consumption of firewood. Firewood bioenergy is almost carbon neutral, but the use of coal leads to additional carbon emissions and results in carbon leakage. The off-site GHG emissions generated by the substitution of coal for bioenergy were derived from Eq.
