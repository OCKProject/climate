 <p id="par0075" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reduced yield of wood is one of the project measures in ecological restoration projects that contributes to carbon sequestration via reduced logging and the corresponding loss of biomass. The carbon sequestration from a reduced wood yield was determined via the following equation Eq.
