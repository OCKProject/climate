 <p id="par0250" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the transport of compensatory grain, off-site GHG emissions were also generated by the reclamation of farmland. Due to a decreased farmland area, the production of grain declined in the early period of the project, during which the conversion of cropland to forest was implemented [
  <a rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0220">44</a>], resulting in increased grain prices and the expansion of farmland [
  <a rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0225">45</a>]. Accordingly, carbon emissions increased due to increased vegetation and soil carbon loss when forestland, shrubs and grassland were converted into farmland. In this study, we hypothesized that the reclamation of farmland within each project county resulted from the implementation of conversion of cropland to forest. Off-site GHG emissions from the reclamation of farmland were calculated according to the following equation Eq.

Such databases take domestic satellite HJ as the main data source, using resolutions of 30 m and assisted by Landsat TM data, and the data processing was automatic due to the use of a supercomputing platform. Object-oriented technology was adopted for the classification of remote sensing imagery based on system characters, and three first-level classifications were adopted from related studies to measure the farmland conversion area. Based on superposition and the tests of 31,675 random sampling points, the resolutions of the classifications for forestland, shrubs, grassland and farmland were 96%, 95%, 93% and 94%, respectively [
