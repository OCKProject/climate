 <p id="par0025" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the end of the last century, China has launched a series of national ecological restoration projects with long temporal scales and large spatial scales; these projects aim to achieve general environmental improvement as well as the restoration of deteriorated ecosystems. A series of ecological management practices are employed under these ecological restoration projects to improve the regional and even the national ecosystem services [
  <a rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0005">[1]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0010">[2]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0015">[3]</a>], including afforestation and reforestation (Natural Forest Protection Project, ‘Grain-for-Green’ Project, Three-North Shelter Forest Project, Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project), forest protection (Natural Forest Protection Project), conversion of cropland to forest (‘Grain-for-Green’ Project, Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project), grassland management (Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project, Returning Grazing Land to Grassland Project) and ecological migration (Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project) [
  <a rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0020">4</a>]. Additionally, various categories of activity transfer are emerged due to the initiation of projects in the field of agriculture (‘Grain-for-Green’ Project, Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project), forestry (Natural Forest Protection Project), livestock husbandry (Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project, Returning Grazing Land to Grassland Project), energy consumption (Natural Forest Protection Project) and ecological migration (Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project) [
  <a rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0020">[4]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0025">[5]</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="par0030" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ecological management practices within ecological restoration projects could increase the forest and grassland area, prevent carbon loss from vegetation and soil, and subsequently enhanced carbon stocks and carbon sinks [
  <a rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0020">4</a>]. Such carbon benefits arising from ecological construction and restoration in the project region are denoted as ‘carbon sequestration’ (CS).
 </p>
 <p id="par0035" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nitrogen cycling and nutrient transportation induced by the projects modify the GHG budget through the ecological system response, which includes nitrous oxide (N
  <sub>2</sub>O) emissions from the application of nitrogen fertilizer in the afforestation of economic forests as well as grass planting and emissions mitigation from the reduced use of fertilizer associated with nutrient retention from decreased soil erosion. This part of carbon budget is denoted as ‘GHG balance changes induced by ecological system response’(ER) [
  <a rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0030">[6]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0035">[7]</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="par0040" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fossil fuels and fossil fuel products are consumed on-site with the construction and the operation of the projects, which generates ‘on-site GHG emissions’ (NG). The initiation of projects influence the transfer of activities, production and energy, including the transfer of agricultural activity, the transfer of livestock husbandry activity, the transfer of forestry activity, the ecological migration and the increased coal substitution associated with the reduced yield of firewood, which results in ‘off-site GHG emissions’ (FG). GHG emissions, including GHG balance changes induced by ecological system response, on-site GHG emissions and off-site GHG emissions negate part of increased carbon sequestration by ecological restoration projects [
  <a rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0040">8</a>]. Thus, the real, credible and verifiable emission reductions by the projects depends upon the net carbon sequestration combining the effects of all GHG emissions rather than the carbon sequestration alone [
  <a rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0040">[8]</a>, 
  <a rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0045">[9]</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="par0045" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CANM-EP method covers the major GHG emissions and leakages of afforestation, reforestation (including conversion from cropland to forest or grassland) and forest management reported around the world [
  <a rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0050">10</a>]. Therefore, it could be applied to large scale ecological restoration projects initiated elsewhere. However, the parameters of current CANM-EP methods are based on the managements and situation in China. When the CANM-EP is applied elsewhere, region-specific parameters would provide estimations with smaller uncertainties.

Such databases take domestic satellite HJ as the main data source, using resolutions of 30 m and assisted by Landsat TM data, and the data processing was automatic due to the use of a supercomputing platform. Object-oriented technology was adopted for the classification of remote sensing imagery based on system characters, and three first-level classifications were adopted from related studies to measure the farmland conversion area. Based on superposition and the tests of 31,675 random sampling points, the resolutions of the classifications for forestland, shrubs, grassland and farmland were 96%, 95%, 93% and 94%, respectively [

    <p id="par0275" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the production and transport of compensatory feed grain, off-site GHG emissions were also generated from the overgrazing of grasslands that resulted from the transfer of livestock husbandry activities from within-project counties to the counties outside of the project area. During the project period of 2001-2010, the proportions of bovine and caprine stocks as stocking sheep unit (SU) within the project regions of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and Shanxi to the total stocking SU in the corresponding provinces fluctuated with no obvious regularity. Thus, it is difficult to obtain the relationship between the implementation of the BTSSCP and the dynamics of the livestock amounts, which is regarded as a key element of the GHG leakage. However, the proportions in Inner Mongolia declined during the period of the BTSSCP. At the same time, the proportion of stocking SU in Inner Mongolia to that of the total SU in China increased during the project period [
     <a rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0220">44</a>]. Thus, we assume that the animal husbandry industry of the whole Inner Mongolia was not hindered by the BTSSCP.

     <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig.2</a>). We found that before the implementation of BTSSCP (1990-2000), the trends of the variances of the stocking SU were similar within the project region, outside the project region and over the whole of Inner Mongolia. However, since 2001, when the BTSSCP started, the variance of the stocking SU within the project region did not change obviously, while the stocking SU outside the project region and for the whole of Inner Mongolia increased significantly (
     <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig.2</a>). Thus, we assume that the portion of the stocking SU which would otherwise have been reared within the project region of Inner Mongolia was transferred to regions outside of the project region.

We assume that this transfer was confined to within Inner Mongolia, according to China’s relative regulations and systems. The transfer of livestock could exert additional grazing pressure on grasslands, which would induce a decline in the soil organic carbon due to overgrazing [
