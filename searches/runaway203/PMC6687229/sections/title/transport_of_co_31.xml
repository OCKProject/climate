 <p id="par0230" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The provision of compensatory grain to farmers by the government is one of the main aspects of the conversion of cropland to forest. Compensatory grain was supplied directly to farmers from 2001 to 2003 and has been converted to subsidies since 2004 due to an adjustment of the compensatory grain policy [
  <a rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0185">37</a>]. Additional GHG emissions are generated via fossil fuel combustion when farmers transport the compensatory grain supplied by the government directly or bought using subsidies.

 <p id="par0245" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the frame of conversion of cropland to forest, the amount of compensation grain was set in accordance with the yield of the hilly or poor croplands before their conversion [
  <a rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0215">43</a>]. Using this methodology, the amount of compensation grain is assumed to be almost the same as the yield of the cropland before conversion, and subsequently, it could be considered as the grain production transferred from the project area to other agricultural regions together with the GHG emissions during the production processes. The GHG emissions due to fertilizer and pesticide applications, machinery operations, and irrigation move from the conversion area to other agricultural regions; therefore, the changes in the total GHG emissions due to grain production at the national or regional scales are not considered [
