 <p id="par0310" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along with the economic development of China, the supply and demand of timber did not decrease gradually [
  <a rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0055">11</a>]. In some of the key national ecological restoration projects, such as the Natural Forest Resource Protection, the commercial harvest of timber was forbidden within the project region. Therefore, this part of the reduced timber supply due to ecological restoration projects needs to be produced off-site.
