   <p id="par0275" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the production and transport of compensatory feed grain, off-site GHG emissions were also generated from the overgrazing of grasslands that resulted from the transfer of livestock husbandry activities from within-project counties to the counties outside of the project area. During the project period of 2001-2010, the proportions of bovine and caprine stocks as stocking sheep unit (SU) within the project regions of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and Shanxi to the total stocking SU in the corresponding provinces fluctuated with no obvious regularity. Thus, it is difficult to obtain the relationship between the implementation of the BTSSCP and the dynamics of the livestock amounts, which is regarded as a key element of the GHG leakage. However, the proportions in Inner Mongolia declined during the period of the BTSSCP. At the same time, the proportion of stocking SU in Inner Mongolia to that of the total SU in China increased during the project period [
    <a rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0220">44</a>]. Thus, we assume that the animal husbandry industry of the whole Inner Mongolia was not hindered by the BTSSCP.

   <p id="par0280" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we compared the variance of the stocking SU in the whole Inner Mongolia, counties within the project region and counties outside the BTSSCP during 1990-2010 (
    <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig.2</a>). We found that before the implementation of BTSSCP (1990-2000), the trends of the variances of the stocking SU were similar within the project region, outside the project region and over the whole of Inner Mongolia. However, since 2001, when the BTSSCP started, the variance of the stocking SU within the project region did not change obviously, while the stocking SU outside the project region and for the whole of Inner Mongolia increased significantly (
    <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig.2</a>). Thus, we assume that the portion of the stocking SU which would otherwise have been reared within the project region of Inner Mongolia was transferred to regions outside of the project region.

We assume that this transfer was confined to within Inner Mongolia, according to China’s relative regulations and systems. The transfer of livestock could exert additional grazing pressure on grasslands, which would induce a decline in the soil organic carbon due to overgrazing [
