 </p>
 <p id="par0275" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the production and transport of compensatory feed grain, off-site GHG emissions were also generated from the overgrazing of grasslands that resulted from the transfer of livestock husbandry activities from within-project counties to the counties outside of the project area. During the project period of 2001-2010, the proportions of bovine and caprine stocks as stocking sheep unit (SU) within the project regions of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and Shanxi to the total stocking SU in the corresponding provinces fluctuated with no obvious regularity. Thus, it is difficult to obtain the relationship between the implementation of the BTSSCP and the dynamics of the livestock amounts, which is regarded as a key element of the GHG leakage. However, the proportions in Inner Mongolia declined during the period of the BTSSCP. At the same time, the proportion of stocking SU in Inner Mongolia to that of the total SU in China increased during the project period [
  <a rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0220">44</a>]. Thus, we assume that the animal husbandry industry of the whole Inner Mongolia was not hindered by the BTSSCP.
 </p>
 <p id="par0280" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we compared the variance of the stocking SU in the whole Inner Mongolia, counties within the project region and counties outside the BTSSCP during 1990-2010 (
  <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig.2</a>). We found that before the implementation of BTSSCP (1990-2000), the trends of the variances of the stocking SU were similar within the project region, outside the project region and over the whole of Inner Mongolia. However, since 2001, when the BTSSCP started, the variance of the stocking SU within the project region did not change obviously, while the stocking SU outside the project region and for the whole of Inner Mongolia increased significantly (
  <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig.2</a>). Thus, we assume that the portion of the stocking SU which would otherwise have been reared within the project region of Inner Mongolia was transferred to regions outside of the project region.

We assume that this transfer was confined to within Inner Mongolia, according to China’s relative regulations and systems. The transfer of livestock could exert additional grazing pressure on grasslands, which would induce a decline in the soil organic carbon due to overgrazing [

 <p id="par0295" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained a database from the Agricultural Information Institution, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. This database supplied stocking data of bovine and caprine for 75 counties within the BTSSCP at annual intervals from 2000 to 2010. The stocking of bovine and caprine in Inner Mongolia was calculated as SU using the following equation Eq.

The stock-carrying capacity per unit grassland outside of the project region of the BTSSCP was calculated, and the grazing intensity was evaluated based on the different grassland types and their areas. A baseline scenario was designed for the year 2000 before the implementation of the BTSSCP. We assumed that under the baseline scenario, the proportion of stocking SU outside of the project region to the total stocking SU in Inner Mongolia in the year t was the same as the proportion in the year 2000 (Eq.
