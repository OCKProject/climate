 <p id="par0050" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A methodology for carbon accounting and determining net mitigation for ecological restoration projects in China (CANM-EP) was designed, and this method was used to estimate the GHG budgets of the national ecological restoration projects as well as its net carbon mitigation. A detailed graphical framework of CANM-EP was presented as 
  <a rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0005">Fig.1</a>, which shows all the possible project measures involved in ecological restoration projects and the corresponding ecosystem processes as well as the GHG budgets induced by the implementation of the project measures.
