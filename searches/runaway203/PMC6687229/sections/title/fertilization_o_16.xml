 <p id="par0130" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An economically viable forest requires base fertilizer at the beginning of each year and topdressing later in the year. The most common frequency of topdressing is three times annually and usually includes stages during early flowering (flower promoting fertilizer) and late flowering (fruit promoting fertilizer). The fertilizer used for base fertilizer and topdressing is usually a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) compound fertilizer [
