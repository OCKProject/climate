The pens for cows and sheep are usually cuboids with a length of 60 m, a width of 10 m, average heights of 4.5 m (cow pen) or 2.5–3 m (sheep pen), and a wall thickness of 0.24 m. Therefore, the volume of each shed is calculated to be 118 m
  <span class="sup">3</span>. The construction of each cubic meter of wall requires 522 standard bricks, 64.6 kg of cement, and 9.68 kg of water. Based on the carbon emission factors of the above building materials, the carbon emission factor of shed construction per unit area (EF
  <sub>SN</sub>) is calculated to be 15.31 kg C·m
