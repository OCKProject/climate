 <p id="par0135" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The on-site GHG emissions of afforestation and reforestation via aerial seeding result from the diesel consumption of the transport of seeds and aviation gasoline consumption for aerial seeding. The emissions of the diesel consumption for the seed transport were determined via the following formula Eq.
