  <a rid="ijerph-16-01528-t002" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-01528-t002">Table 2</a> shows the statistical comparisons between the observations and the modeling results from PREMET. OBS and SIM are represented the observation and simulation. For T
  <sub>2</sub>, the model slightly overvalues T
  <sub>2</sub> at all sites, which might result from the uncertainty of urban canopy and surface parameters [
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-16-01528">28</a>,
  <a rid="B29-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-16-01528">29</a>,
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-01528">36</a>,
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-16-01528">37</a>]. However, the overestimation is acceptable because the MB values of T
  <sub>2</sub> are only 0.5–1.7 °C, the RMSE of T
  <sub>2</sub> is 2.8–3.9 °C, and the CORR between observations and simulations are over 0.8 at all sites (statistically significant at the 95% confidence level). Moreover, the lowest value 0.5 °C for MB and the highest value 0.9 for CORR show that the best simulation of T
  <sub>2</sub> is at NJ. For RH
  <sub>2</sub>, though the modeling results are slightly underestimated, the CORR values are over 0.8 at most sites. Therefore, the simulations for RH
  <sub>2</sub> are relatively acceptable. The lowest value 0.7 for CORR is at SH, which may be attributed to the uncertainty of the land-use data that cannot well describe waters around SH [
  <a rid="B29-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-16-01528">29</a>]. For WS
  <sub>10</sub>, the modeling values are overestimated at HZ and SH but underestimated at NJ. The CORR (close to 0.5) for WS
  <sub>10</sub> is the lowest in three meteorological factors. The wind components were not simulated very well, just as in previous studies, which may be caused by urban canopy parameters [
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-16-01528">28</a>,
  <a rid="B29-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-16-01528">29</a>,
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-16-01528">37</a>]. Compared with previous studies, the biases in this study are acceptable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to O
  <sub>3</sub>, the CORRs are more than 0.6 at most sites. The lowest value for MB (−1.2 ppb) and the highest CORR value (close to 0.7) indicate that the simulation at SH is good. However, the modeling results overestimate O
  <sub>3</sub> concentrations at NJ and HZ, and the values of MB are around 8.0. These biases might be related to the modeled stronger solar radiation reaching the surface, which can cause positive biases in T
  <sub>2</sub> and thereby produces more O
  <sub>3</sub> [
  <a rid="B29-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-16-01528">29</a>,
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-16-01528">37</a>]. At the same time, the high bias about simulated wind might result in the O
  <sub>3</sub> concentration uncertainty. In addition, there are also some uncertainties in the emission, which might cause O
  <sub>3</sub> concentration bias.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All in all, the performance of WRF-Chem in modeling climate and air quality is acceptable over the YRD region in this study. Some biases are still found in simulations, but the difference between PREMET and FUTMET can still demonstrate how meteorological factors could impact O
  <sub>3</sub>, as all other settings are the same in both simulations.
