 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, WRF-Chem version 3.5 (NOAA, Colorado, USA) was applied to investigate the impacts of climate change on air quality over the YRD. WRF-Chem is a new generation of air quality modeling system, which is composed of the meteorological component (WRF) and the air quality component (Chem). The two components are fully coupled, and they use the same coordinates and physical parameterizations [

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f001" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f001">Figure 1</a>, three nested domains were used. The model domains were centered at (32.8° N, 87.5° E) with Lambert Conformal Conic projection. The grid sizes of these domains were 56 × 42, 109 × 82, and 178 × 136, with grid spacings of 81, 27, and 9 km, respectively. The outer domain covered a fairly large area of East Asia. The inner domain covered the YRD and its surrounding waters. For all domains, there were 31 vertical layers from the surface to the model top of 100 hPa, with about 10 layers in the planetary boundary layer.

  <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-01528">38</a>] makes progress that the addition of a snow field to the cloud model significantly modifies the microphysical processes; it is more consummate. In the RRTM (Rapid Radiative Transfer Model) longwave radiation scheme, the speed of execution compares favorably with those of other rapid radiation models, and the model can be used in general circulation models [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-01528">39</a>]. The Goddard shortwave radiation scheme results in considerable improvement in reproducing the model’s thermal structure, such as the zonal mean air temperature, its latitudinal gradient, and vertically integrated temperature [

In the Kain–Fritsh cumulus parameterization scheme, the specific formation of the modifications can produce desired effects in numerical weather prediction and render the scheme closer to observations and cloud-resolving modeling studies [

The NOAH/LSM (NCAR, Boulder, CO, USA) scheme can not only provide reasonable diurnal variations of surface heat flues but also correct seasonal evolutions of soil moisture in the context of a long-term data assimilation system [

The CBMZ is developed from a new lumped-structure mechanism, largely based on the widely used Carbon Bond Mechanism (CBM-IV). Major improvements include a revised inorganic chemistry, an explicit treatment of the lesser reactive paraffins, methane, and ethane [

The adopted option for aerosol is the four-bin sectional Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC). MOSAIC is found to be in excellent agreement with a benchmark version of the model using a rigorous solver for integrating the stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Therefore, MOSAIC is a good choice in air quality and regional/global aerosol models [
