 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The regional meteorological changes caused by global climate change are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f003">Figure 3</a>. The values in these figures present the differences between FUTMET and PREMET. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a> shows the changes during the daytime (from 7:00 to 18:00 LST (Local standard time)). For solar radiation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>a), the values in the land area of YRD significantly increase, with the average value of 33.2 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>. The maximum increase of 76.0 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> appears in the southwest. The changing pattern of T
  <sub>2</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>b) is similar to that of solar radiation. The average increase of T
  <sub>2</sub> is predicted to be 1.5 °C over the entire region. High values can be found in the southwest of the YRD, with a maximum of 3.6 °C. The good relevancy between 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>a,b can be explained by the fact that the increase of T
  <sub>2</sub> is caused by solar radiation. For absolute humidity (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>c), it increases over 10.0 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span> in the northern and central YRD, which is related to the precipitation increase with the value over 4.0 mm in those areas (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>d). However, in the southern YRD, the air becomes dryer (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>c), caused by the precipitation decrease there (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>d). For planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>e), it increases by the maximum value (about 234.3 m) in the southern YRD, which can be attributed to high increments of solar radiation and air temperature. However, PBLH decreases by 200.0 m in most of northern and central areas. The decreases may be caused by the small increase of T
  <sub>2</sub> and the high humidity, which can increase latent heat and lower PBLH. For WS
  <sub>10</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>f), the change pattern is similar to that of T
  <sub>2</sub>. The regional mean increment is 1.2 m/s, and the high increases appear in the south with the maximum value of 4.2 m/s. For the wind direction, a southerly wind will dominate the YRD in the future under the strengthening of the Northwest Pacific Subtropical High.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f003">Figure 3</a> shows the changes at night (from 19:00 to 6:00 LST). For T
  <sub>2</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f003">Figure 3</a>a), it is predicted to increase about 1.9 °C over the entire YRD, with the higher increases over 5.0 °C in the southwest. The increments are slightly higher than those in the daytime, which may be related to more clouds at night. More clouds may strengthen the insulation effect. For absolute humidity (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f003">Figure 3</a>b), the regional mean changing value (9.6 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>) is smaller than that in the daytime, related to a weaker evaporation at night. For PBLH (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f003">Figure 3</a>c), higher increasing values occur in the southwest of the YRD, with a maximum of 268.6 m. The pattern is similar to 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f003">Figure 3</a>a, implying the effect of air temperature on PBLH. For wind field (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f003">Figure 3</a>d), due to the rising of T
  <sub>2</sub>, the wind speed increases as well. The regional average increase is 0.8 m/s, and the maximum increase is 3.9 m/s. For the wind direction, the southerly wind dominates the region at night just as the changes in the daytime.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated change trends and intensities of the above meteorological factors are in agreement with previous findings [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-01528">7</a>,
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-01528">8</a>,
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-16-01528">26</a>]. During the daytime, the increase of solar radiation and T
  <sub>2</sub> can enhance the O
  <sub>3</sub> photochemical reactions over the entire YRD. Although the increase of PBLH in the north can dilute O
  <sub>3</sub> concentration in lower atmosphere, the decrease in the south can increase the O
  <sub>3</sub> pollution level. However, the strengthened southerly wind can transport more O
  <sub>3</sub> from the south to north, which may increase O
  <sub>3</sub> in the north and decrease O
  <sub>3</sub> in the south. The change trend of O
  <sub>3</sub> in the daytime might be different from that at night. The increase of T
  <sub>2</sub> can enhance the titration reaction between NO and O
  <sub>3</sub>. The increase of PBLH in the north can bring surface O
  <sub>3</sub> to the higher layers. The southerly wind may increase O
  <sub>3</sub> in the north but decrease it in the south. Consequently, it is hard to tell the change of O
  <sub>3</sub> just by the changes in meteorological factors either in the daytime or at night. Further analyses are needed.
