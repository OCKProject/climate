 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the PREMET case, the anthropogenic emissions in China are from the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory (MEIC) developed by Tsinghua University based on a technology-based emission model. The MEIC inventory contains monthly anthropogenic emissions of SO
  <sub>2</sub>, NO
  <sub>X</sub>, CO, NH
  <sub>3</sub>, PM
  <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
  <sub>10</sub>, BC, OC, and VOCs in five sectors (agriculture, industry, power plants, residential, and transportation) [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-16-01528">46</a>]. Those for the areas out of China are mainly from the inventory developed by the NASA INTEX-B (NASA, Washington, DC, USA), including the emissions of SO
  <sub>2</sub>, NO
  <sub>x</sub>, CO, PM
  <sub>10</sub>, PM
  <sub>2.5</sub>, BC, OC, and VOCs from the power, residential, industry, and transportation sectors with a resolution of 0.5Â° [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-16-01528">47</a>]. Furthermore, these data have been specially modified for simulations in the YRD following the work of Xie et al. [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-01528">8</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For future anthropogenic emissions, some previous investigations estimated them by some hypothetical growth factors [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-01528">7</a>,
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-16-01528">26</a>]. However, the Chinese government has formulated a series of strict emission reduction policies to protect air quality, implying that the hypothetical increase of emissions is inapplicable. On the other hand, the main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the changes of meteorological factors under future climate and their effects on individual processes of O
  <sub>3</sub> formation. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the future anthropogenic emissions will remain at the current level. In the FUTMET case, the emissions are set to be the same as PREMET.
