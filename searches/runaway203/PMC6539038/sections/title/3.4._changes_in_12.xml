  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f006" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f006">Figure 6</a> shows the differences of surface ozone between FUTMET and PREMET in the YRD. During the daytime (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f007">Figure 7</a>a), O
  <sub>3</sub> increases in the north but decreases in the south. The high increase values with a maximum of 18.5 ppb are along the coastal areas of Jiangsu Province, while the high reductions (over −15.1 ppb) are mainly in the inland areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces. At night (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f007">Figure 7</a>b), the change pattern of O
  <sub>3</sub> is similar to that in the day, but the increase and the decrease values are lower. The regional averaged change value is just −0.2 ppb, the maximum increase is 17.5 ppb, and the maximum decrease is about −12.0 ppb. Less O
  <sub>3</sub> variations at night may be attributed to nocturnal O
  <sub>3</sub> chemical reactions. Moreover, the above O
  <sub>3</sub> change patterns are similar to those of NO
  <sub>x</sub>, VOCs, and CO, implying that O
  <sub>3</sub> changes are tightly related to O
  <sub>3</sub> precursors and are highly affected by chemical processes.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f007">Figure 7</a> shows the different spatial distributions of major individual O
  <sub>3</sub> formation processes between FUTMET and PREMET during the daytime. The changes in O
  <sub>3</sub> chemical production (Chem_O
  <sub>3</sub>) vary from −2 to 4 ppb/h (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f007">Figure 7</a>a). The increases of Chem_O
  <sub>3</sub> occur in most areas of the YRD, which should be induced by enhanced gas phase reactions related to the increases of solar radiation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>a) and surface air temperature (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>b). The higher increments over 3.0 ppb/h are mainly located along the coastal areas of Jiangsu Province, which is also the area with great increase of O
  <sub>3</sub> precursor concentration (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f004" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f004">Figure 4</a>a,c,e). Over the southern YRD, the decreases of absolute humidity and O
  <sub>3</sub> precursor concentration should result in reductions of Chem_O
  <sub>3</sub> in extensive areas, with the maximum decrease about −2.2 ppb/h to the south of Hangzhou. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f007">Figure 7</a>b illustrates that the changes in transport process of O
  <sub>3</sub> (Advt_O
  <sub>3</sub>) are between −3.0 to 4.0 ppb/h, which is closely related to the variation of horizontal wind speed and wind direction [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-01528">7</a>]. Advt_O
  <sub>3</sub> rises up over 0–4.0 ppb/h in most areas of the northern YRD, with the higher increments over 2.1 ppb around Shanghai. The decreases of Advt_O
  <sub>3</sub> are mainly located in the southern YRD. The change pattern of Advt_O
  <sub>3</sub> further proves that the strengthened southerly wind in the YRD (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>f) can bring O
  <sub>3</sub> from the south to the north. For the vertical mixing and dry deposition process (Vmix_O
  <sub>3</sub>), it ranges between –4.0 to 4.0 ppb (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f007" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f007">Figure 7</a>c). Though PBLH would decrease in the north (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f002" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f002">Figure 2</a>e, may increase O
  <sub>3</sub> at surface), Chem_O
  <sub>3</sub> can produce more O
  <sub>3</sub> in lower atmospheres (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f008" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f008">Figure 8</a>a) and more O
  <sub>3</sub> would be transported to the upper atmospheric layer or deposition to the ground (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f008" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f008">Figure 8</a>b). Thus, Vmix_O
  <sub>3</sub> in the northern YRD mainly decreases. In the south, however, there is little change in Vmix_O
  <sub>3</sub> (0–1.0 ppb/h). The high values close to some cities would be caused by the local atmospheric circulation related to urban heat island [
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-16-01528" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-16-01528">28</a>,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At night, the changes in three main processes are smaller. The changes in Chem_O
  <sub>3</sub> vary from −1.0 to 2.0 ppb (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f009" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f009">Figure 9</a>a). The decreases of Chem_O
  <sub>3</sub> mainly appear in the north, which should be attributed to the enhancement of an O
  <sub>3</sub> titration reaction with NO at night due to temperature increase (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f003">Figure 3</a>a) and the sufficient NO
  <sub>x</sub> in the north (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f004" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f004">Figure 4</a>b). In a similar way, the increases in the south are related with the decrease of NO
  <sub>x</sub> there (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f004" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f004">Figure 4</a>b), which would weaken the O
  <sub>3</sub> consumption reaction. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f010" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f010">Figure 10</a>b shows that the changes in Advt_O
  <sub>3</sub> are between −3.0 and 2.0 ppb in most areas. O
  <sub>3</sub> accumulation along the Nanjing-Shanghai line is due to the strengthening of the easterly wind. The changes in Vmix_O
  <sub>3</sub> range between −3.0 and 2.0 ppb (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f009" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f009">Figure 9</a>c). The decreases of Vmix_O
  <sub>3</sub> are related to the increases of nocturnal PBLH over the YRD (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f003">Figure 3</a>c). The maximum increases of Vmix_O
  <sub>3</sub> are in the south of the YRD. The increases are caused by great increases of wind speed that can weaken the dry deposition in this area (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01528-f003" href="#ijerph-16-01528-f003">Figure 3</a>d).
