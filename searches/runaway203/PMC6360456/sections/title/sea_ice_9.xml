 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea ice thickness and concentration directly respond to local forcing, including atmospheric and oceanic heat transport. The heat transport of Atlantic water through the Fram Strait determines the Arctic Ocean temperature in the top 300 m. Warm water at this depth can influence the sea ice through the ocean‐to‐ice heat flux which in turn can moderate the basal growth in winter (Keen et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0038">2013</a>). The Fram Strait heat transport in HadGEM3 GC3.1 varies with ocean model spatial resolution, since (a) Fram Strait is only 12 grid points wide in NEMO ORCA1 (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0014" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0014">14</a>a); and (b) NEMO ORCA1 uses a parameterization for mesoscale eddies (see section 
  <a rid="jame20790-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" href="#jame20790-sec-0002">2</a>), as opposed to NEMO ORCA025. This parameterization tends to smooth out ocean fronts and so reduces the flow through straits (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0014" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0014">14</a>). The Fram Strait heat transport in ORCA025 varies interannually in the range 26–49 TW, in good agreement with the observationally derived value of 28–46 TW (Schauer et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0060">2004</a>). However, the equivalent ORCA1 heat annual mean transport is 3–5 TW, which, being a factor 10 smaller, results in colder Arctic waters year‐round. As a consequence the winter mixed layer entrainment of deeper warm water will not result in warmer water in contact with the ice, and in spring the onset of enhanced basal melt will be absent, both effects causing annual mean ice to be thicker than observed.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compensate for the lack of basal melt, the surface albedo of snow covered ice is reduced from 0.98 to 0.96 in the visible spectral band and from 0.70 to 0.68 in the near infrared spectral band. The albedo reduction of 0.02 balances the desired effect in the Arctic Ocean with a tendency toward increased ocean heat uptake. Such an albedo reduction allows a slightly earlier onset of snow melt and subsequently longer sea ice melt season. A greater summer melt can thus offset the reduced basal sea ice melt to match the observed Arctic sea ice thickness. The values of snow albedo, in both model resolutions, lie within the observational uncertainty.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the high‐ and low‐resolution models are in good agreement with the seasonal Arctic sea ice extent (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0015" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0015">15</a>) when compared with the HadISST.2 sea ice analysis (Titchner &amp; Rayner, 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0068">2014</a>). In the Southern Ocean, N96ORCA1 shows a better agreement because the Southern Ocean warm bias (Williams et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0075">2017</a>) is less severe than at high resolution (cf. section 
  <a rid="jame20790-sec-0007" ref-type="sec" href="#jame20790-sec-0007">3.2</a>). The sea ice volume in N96ORCA1 is larger than in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0015" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0015">15</a>). In the Antarctic this is solely associated with the greater ice extent, whereas in the Arctic the thicker ice means that more ice survives the summer melt season becoming thicker multiyear ice.
