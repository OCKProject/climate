 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A cold bias in the SST develops in the first 20 years of the PD simulation of N96ORCA1. In the global average the SST in N96ORCA1 is about 0.4 K lower than observed (Climate Change Initiative SST; Merchant et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0052">2014</a>). There is a distinct geographical pattern to this SST bias (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>c). The cold bias is strongest in the midlatitudes of the NH, while in the Southern Ocean there is actually a warm bias of up to 2 K in the region south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). These patterns are found in many of the CMIP5 climate models (see Figure 9.2b in Flato et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0021">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In N216ORCA025 the globally averaged SST cold bias is much smaller, just above 0.1 K. This is linked with the larger Southern Ocean warm bias (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>d), while the NH cold bias is smaller in N216ORCA025 and reduces the root‐mean‐square error in comparison to observations. Williams et al. (
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0075">2017</a>) provide a more detailed discussion of those large‐scale SST biases in N216ORCA025.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a few distinct regional cold‐spot features in the SST in N96ORCA1. Notably the northwest Atlantic is too cold by up to 6 K. This is a known issue in ocean GCMs of 1° grid resolution (Danabasoglu et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0012">2014</a>), probably because this resolution is too coarse to correctly represent the poleward and eastward direction of the North Atlantic Current; the current appears too zonal (cf. the central North Atlantic SST contours in Figures 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>a and 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>b). On a smaller spatial scale, similar problems with representing the position of the Kuroshio and the Brazil Current are discernible in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>c; these appear in a forced, ocean‐only simulation as well (Storkey et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0067">2018</a>; Figure 16), indicating that the reason lies in the ocean model rather than with the surface buoyancy fluxes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that the cold bias in most of the low‐latitude to midlatitude Northern Pacific is very similar across the two resolutions in the coupled simulations (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>) but is not found in forced simulations (Storkey et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0067">2018</a>), pointing to resolution‐independent causes related to the coupling to the UM. The warm surface bias in subtropical regions of coastal upwelling (west coasts of South America and Southern Africa) is larger in N96ORCA1. It is likely that the representation of this upwelling is improved at higher resolution.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is worth noting that, while N96ORCA1 has a lower SST than N216ORCA025 at all latitudes on average, the zonal mean net heat flux into the ocean, diagnosed from atmosphere‐only simulations, is roughly the same for N96 and N216 (with minor differences in the tropics and the high northern latitudes). Preliminary analyses suggest that the varying extent of the Southern Ocean warm bias may be related to a resolution dependence in the spin‐up of the coupled ocean‐sea ice‐wind system (and associated ocean heat transports in the initial 5 years of the run) into different stable states. This resolution dependence is not evident in consistent, forced ocean‐only runs, strongly suggesting that it is a coupled phenomenon. Further investigation of the Southern Ocean warm bias in our models is under way.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For sea surface salinity (SSS) there are some marked regional biases in N96ORCA1 (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0005">5</a>c), while on the global average the bias against the EN4 climatology (1995–2014 average; Good et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0026">2013</a>) is only −0.16. The pattern in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0005">5</a>d) is very similar, notably the strong salty bias in the Bay of Bengal and the fresh biases in the subtropical Pacific on both hemispheres. To some degree, these regional biases also appear in ocean‐only, forced simulations (Storkey et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0067">2018</a>), indicating that they occur independent of coupled feedbacks.

 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strong fresh bias in the midlatitude North Atlantic, by contrast, occurs only in N96ORCA1. The full simulated SSS (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0005">5</a>a) indicates a freshwater tongue extending directly eastward from the Grand Banks. This is not visible in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0005">5</a>b). It is tempting to conclude that, for this reason, this SSS bias has—directly or indirectly—the same cause as the SST bias in the northwest Atlantic discussed above. Note, however, that the SSS bias minimum is at a more eastern location than the SST bias minimum.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The maximum monthly mixed layer depth (MLD) is calculated from monthly mean model output. MLD indicates where water masses are ventilated and deep water is formed, both of which are also relevant for the nutrient distributions in the Earth system context. The maximum MLD occurs in different months across the globe, for instance, in the high latitudes usually at the end of winter on either hemisphere. Figures 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0006">6</a>a and 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0006">6</a>b show the maximum MLD from both models, while the bias against observations is shown in Figures 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0006">6</a>c and 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0006">6</a>d. There are notable differences between the two models. For N96ORCA1, in the northwestern Atlantic the region of the cold and fresh bias stands out with a too small maximum MLD. The maximum MLD tends to be too large in the subtropical latitudes on both hemispheres (including poleward of the ACC) and in the deepwater formation regions of the North Atlantic; in large parts of the Pacific (northern midlatitude, southern tropical) they are too small. In the northern North Atlantic, there is a significant difference in that N96ORCA1 has a very deep mixed layer in the central Nordic Seas, as opposed to N216ORCA025 which, by contrast, shows a deeper mixed layer in larger parts of the Labrador and Irminger Seas. This might point to different preferred deepwater formation regions in the two model versions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The zonally averaged temperature bias (Figures

  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>b) of the two models shows their different behavior with regards to ocean heat uptake. A significant ocean heat uptake is expected in PD simulations because of the positive incoming net radiation at TOA. In N96ORCA1 (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>a), this heat is mostly found above 1,000 m depth, transported northward and eventually downward by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). In N216ORCA025 (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>b), the warm bias in the upper 1,000 m is smaller, but there is a warm bias throughout the entire depth of the Southern Ocean. We suggest that this Southern Ocean deep warm bias is a result of the warm bias at the surface.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The zonally averaged biases are smaller for salinity. In N96ORCA1, there is a saline bias in the warm subsurface layer on the NH (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>c). N216ORCA025 is comparatively fresh in the upper layers of the high‐latitude Southern Ocean (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>d); the relation to the Antarctic coastal current present at this resolution will be discussed in a companion paper. At both resolutions, there is a positive salinity bias in the upper 2,000 m around 44°N. This stems from a high salinity in the Black Sea whose circulation with the Mediterranean through the Dardanelles is very confined in the model geometry and more so in N216ORCA025 with its higher resolution—hence the larger Black Sea salinity bias here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Turning to the depth‐time structure of the temperature bias in N96ORCA1 (against the EN4 climatology), in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0008">8</a> we find that in all basins there is a subsurface warming between about 200 m and 1,000 m depth (while extending less far up in the Pacific). This warming trend is strongest in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and after a few centuries the deep Atlantic warms too (the warm bias being transported downward and then southward by the AMOC). In the Pacific and Southern Oceans the warming has a smaller vertical extent and a much slower rate; in both basins the top few hundred meters of ocean water is colder than in observations, with only weak trends. For the Southern Ocean, this holds in spite of the warm bias at the surface in large parts. The combination of a too cold mixed layer and too warm subsurface waters indicates a too small global vertical temperature gradient, a common feature in CMIP5 models (Kuhlbrodt &amp; Gregory, 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0040">2012</a>).

  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0010">10</a>b) at the two resolutions displays the different spin‐up behavior. An initial cooling in N216ORCA025 is small and lasts for only about 30 years. By contrast, the initial cooling is stronger and much more sustained in N96ORCA1. Here the SST time series passes the PD observed value of 18.3 °C after about 200 years. The initial SST cooling (and AMOC weakening; see below) when spinning up a coupled model from an observational climatology is fairly typical for this resolution, compare HadGEM1 in Banks et al. (
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0003">2007</a>) and the GFDL ESM2 models in Dunne et al. (

  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0050">2015</a>) the volume transport of the AMOC is estimated to be 17.2 ± 0.9 Sv for annual means, where 1 Sv = 10

  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>f) show that, for the average of the years 50–100, the AMOC is somewhat weaker than observations in N96ORCA1 (maximum 15.2 Sv), while in N216ORCA025 it is very close to observations (maximum 16.9 Sv). In line with the stronger deepwater formation in the Nordic Seas discussed above, the overturning cell extends further north in N96ORCA1. Note that the deep overturning cell of Antarctic bottom water is stronger in N96ORCA1 (&gt;2 Sv); this could be related to the Antarctic bottom water being colder in N96ORCA1.

After the first century, the AMOC is comparatively stable and close to observations at both resolutions. It is worth noting that, when comparing the AMOC as computed using the full velocity field in models to the RAPID estimate, the RAPID method may actually underestimate the full transport by ~1.5 Sv (Sinha et al.,

  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0012" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0012">12</a> it is clear that at this resolution the poleward heat transport on both hemispheres is smaller than in the eddy‐permitting N216ORCA025 resolution. In future work we will assess the reason for that.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ACC is in balance with the meridional density gradient in the Southern Ocean and is partly driven by the wind stress. We show the ACC, diagnosed as the volume transport through Drake Passage, in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0013" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0013">13</a>. For comparison, the latest observational estimate is 173 ± 11 Sv (Donohue et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0017">2016</a>), while previous estimates could not fully and consistently assess the barotropic component of the Drake Passage transport and hence were markedly smaller, for instance, 137 ± 8 Sv in Cunningham et al. (
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0011">2003</a>). By these measures, the ACC in N96ORCA1 is within observational estimates in the first decade or two into the PD simulation, while a small but persistent downward trend lets the ACC appear as too weak afterward. Note, however, that in past climate model intercomparisons (Kuhlbrodt et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0042">2012</a>; Meijers, 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0051">2014</a>) a very wide intermodel spread was found (155 ± 51 Sv for CMIP5). Seen in this light, the ACC strength in N96ORCA1 remains reasonable. In N216ORCA025, by contrast, the ACC quickly slows down to less than 100 Sv and then decreases further to about 50 Sv. This is a consequence of heat uptake poleward of 60°S throughout the entire water column (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>), not being density compensated by a trend in salinity.
