 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">HadGEM3 GC3.1 N96ORCA1 is a new, low‐resolution configuration of HadGEM3 GC3.1, the climate model of the UK Met Office in its current release. N96ORCA1 requires 1 order of magnitude less computing power per model year than the medium‐resolution version of HadGEM3 GC3.1, N216ORCA025. At the same time, the PD global climate is represented almost as well as in the medium‐resolution version.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The near‐surface temperature in the simulated PD climate is too low in almost all regions in N96ORCA1. In the North Atlantic and adjacent regions, this exacerbates a cold bias that, to some extent, the medium‐resolution version shows as well. This cold bias might stem from the inability of the 1° ocean model to correctly represent the pathway of the North Atlantic Current; this is a typical deficiency of 1° ocean models.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the midlatitude to high‐latitude SH it is beneficial that N96ORCA1 has a colder surface (or near‐surface) temperature because this mitigates the Southern Ocean warm bias that both resolutions of HadGEM3 GC3.1 display. In consequence, the representation of Southern Ocean climate in N96ORCA1 has smaller errors than N216ORCA025 in that, for instance, the volume transport of the ACC and the seasonal cycle of sea ice extent are much closer to observations in N96ORCA1.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the spin‐up of the simulated climate state when starting a simulation from an observational climatology for the ocean, centuries‐long time series of global radiation at the top of the atmosphere suggest that after about 300 or 400 years the modeled climate state in N96ORCA1 reaches an equilibrium, in similarity to other coupled climate models (Banks et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0003">2007</a>; Dunne et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0019">2012</a>). An initial loss of heat from the ocean's mixed layer, during the first few decades of the model simulation, is followed by a continuous ocean heat uptake—mostly in the top 1,000 m—whose rate decreases over the first two or three centuries in N96ORCA1.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">N96ORCA1 has been developed with a high degree of traceability to the medium‐resolution version N216ORCA025, meaning that any changes in the model's parameterizations are directly justified by the coarser horizontal resolution, for example, for horizontal viscosity and isopycnal tracer diffusion in the ocean component. However, there is a single exception. In N96ORCA1, not enough warm Atlantic water is transported northward into the Arctic Ocean. This leads to the water temperature being too low in the subsurface Arctic, and hence to insufficient bottom melt of sea ice, and thus to too thick sea ice in comparison with observations. This is a consequence of Fram Strait being only 12 grid points wide—as above, a deficiency that is hard to correct in a 1° ocean model. In order to obtain a realistic sea ice thickness in the Arctic Ocean, we have slightly reduced the albedo for snow on sea ice. This reduction, by 0.02, is still well within the observational uncertainty of this quantity.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ocean component of N96ORCA1, 
  <span class="italic">shaconemo</span> NEMO ORCA1, is being used in a number of other current coupled climate models and ESMs, providing an opportunity to analyze the impact on oceanic circulation (and biogeochemistry) of different atmosphere and sea ice models coupled to the same ocean model.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">HadGEM3 GC3.1 N96ORCA1 is the physical core of UKESM1 and is used for many CMIP6 experiments, including CMIP‐DECK. Because of its computational efficiency and good scientific performance, it lends itself to multicentury simulations and ensemble experiments.</p>
