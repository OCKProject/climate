 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earth loses energy in the NH (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0002">2</a>a, solid lines) and gains energy in the SH (dashed lines). As a consequence, an interhemispheric, northward energy transport is required (Marshall et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0048">2013</a>). In terms of TOA net radiation this NH to SH gradient is ~1.2 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> more negative in N96ORCA1 (about −4.6 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) than in N216ORCA025 (about −3.4W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>; see Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0002">2</a>b). This results from (i) the SH receiving more radiation in N96ORCA1 (dashed lines in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0002">2</a>a) and (ii) the NH losing more energy at TOA (full lines in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0002">2</a>a) in N96ORCA1. To evaluate the hemispheric gradients of TOA radiation and better understand the cause of differences between the two models, we look at the hemispheric components and gradients of both OSR and OLR.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stephens et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0064">2016</a> and Voigt et al. (
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0070">2013</a>) show that observed SH and NH mean OSR are almost equal (e.g., central estimates in Stephens et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0064">2016</a>, are SH OSR 99.7 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> and NH OSR 99.6 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>), while the NH to SH OLR gradient is ~1.3 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> (Stephens et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0064">2016</a>; SH OLR 238.9 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, NH OLR 240.2 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>; although is important to note that observed estimates of OSR and OLR are subject to an uncertainty of ±2 to 3 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>). Considering OSR, in both hemispheres N216ORCA025 is 1–2 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> less reflective than N96ORCA1, with the SH OSR likely more accurate in N96ORCA1 and the NH OSR more accurate in N216ORCA025 (cf. sea ice extent in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0015" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0015">15</a>). Put another way, the N216ORCA025 model is not sufficiently reflective to solar radiation in the SH, where N96ORCA1 performs better. In the NH the N96ORCA1 model is likely too reflective and N216ORCA025 is more accurate. Nevertheless, both models have very similar NH to SH OSR gradients of ~1.5 to 2 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> (NH more reflective than SH), in contrast to the near‐zero gradient in observations. Problems simulating the hemispheric gradient in OSR have been documented in numerous studies (e.g., Trenberth and Fasullo, 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0069">2010</a>; Bodas‐Salcedo et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0007">2012</a>; Hwang and Frierson, 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0032">2013</a>) and can result both from errors in simulating climatological cloud‐radiation interactions over the Southern Ocean, particularly model underestimates of the prevalence of supercooled liquid clouds in the region (Bodas‐Salcedo et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0006">2016</a>; Kay et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0037">2016</a>), and from biases in simulated historical anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing, which is primarily a NH phenomenon (Ghan et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0025">2016</a>; Myhre et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0053">2013</a>; Regayre et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0058">2018</a>). How much, one or both, of these problems contributes to the OSR error in HadGEM3‐GC3.1 requires further analysis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to hemispheric OLR, the evolution of NH mean OLR is rather similar in both models, with slightly higher values in N216ORCA025. The models differ more in the SH, where after 100 years, N216ORCA025 OLR is ~2 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> greater than N96ORCA1 (240 vs. 238 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, with a central observational estimate in Stephens et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0064">2016</a>, of 238.9 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>). The N216ORCA025 model (as shown in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0009">9</a>) develops a warm Southern Ocean SST bias, which is partly due to an underestimate of SH atmospheric reflectivity and an associated overestimate in surface downwelling solar radiation (i.e., simulated OSR in N216ORCA025 is ~98 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> compared to a central observed estimate of ~99.7 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>). A positive bias in SH OLR is consistent with (and also a consequence of) such a Southern Ocean warm bias. Over the NH N216ORCA025 OLR is at the upper end of the observed range (~242 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> at year 100 compared to a central observed estimate of 240.2 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>). The hemispheric OLR gradient in N216ORCA025 is therefore quite accurate but results from both hemispheres emitting too much OLR. In contrast, N96ORCA1 is closer to the central observed OLR estimates for both the NH and SH, slightly overestimating in the NH and underestimating in the SH, leading to a hemispheric gradient that is ~1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> more positive than N216ORCA025 and observations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combination of similar hemispheric OSR gradients, but different OLR gradients, leads to the difference in hemispheric gradient (NH minus SH) of net TOA radiation between the two models: −4.6 (N96ORCA1) and −3.4 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> (N216ORCA025), compared to a central observed estimate of −1.8 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>. The bulk of these errors against observations are associated with a common positive bias in the NH minus SH OSR gradient, which may have different drivers in the two models (i.e., SH atmosphere not sufficiently reflective in N216ORCA025, NH atmosphere too reflective in N96ORCA1). The more realistic (weaker) net TOA radiation gradient in N216ORCA025 arises from a weaker (more realistic) NH minus SH OLR gradient, which unfortunately results from the N216ORCA025 SH emitting OLR too strongly due to the warm surface Southern Ocean bias.

  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0066">2015</a>). Both models show a decrease in planetary albedo, with the N216ORCA025 model consistently lower by ~0.5%. A significant fraction of this trend in planetary albedo can be attributed to decreases in surface albedo, associated with loss of sea ice and snow cover due to the positive net TOA radiation balance in both simulations. This decrease is greater in N216ORCA025, mainly due to a greater decrease in the SH associated with the surface ocean warm bias in that model. Considering hemispheric albedos, the NH surface albedos (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0003">3</a>d) are quite similar in both models, while the NH planetary albedo is clearly higher in N96ORCA1. This is consistent with the N96ORCA1 NH OSR being 1–2 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> greater than in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0002">2</a>e) and suggests the OSR difference is primarily due to atmospheric (i.e., cloud‐aerosol‐solar radiation) differences between the two models.
