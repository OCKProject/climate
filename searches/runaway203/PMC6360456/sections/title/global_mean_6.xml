 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We begin by considering the time‐dependent global and hemispheric radiation balance on centennial time scales, including surface and planetary albedo. Since our simulations have a continuous year 2000 forcing, these time series are not meant to reproduce observed variability. Rather, we believe that this analysis is instructive to understand the evolving and differing biases in N96ORCA1 and N216ORCA025.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0001">1</a>a shows how the N96ORCA1 model, starting from PD conditions, reaches a temporally stable top of atmosphere (TOA, at 85 km) net radiation balance between +0.3 and +0.4 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> after 300 to 400 years. The N216ORCA025 model appears to reach an equilibrium somewhat earlier (after about 150 to 200 years) and at a more positive value (+0.5–0.6 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) that is closer to observed estimates for recent decades (Allan et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0002">2014</a>). As well as analyzing total net radiation, it is also important to consider the shortwave and longwave components of the TOA radiation budget as these may tell a different story to the net radiation.

  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0001">1</a>b and 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0001">1</a>c show the evolution of TOA outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and outgoing shortwave radiation (OSR) in the two models. While both start from almost identical initial states, they quickly diverge in terms of global mean OLR. In N96ORCA1 OLR initially drops during the first 20–40 years, as the ocean mixed layer cools relative to its initial conditions. After this adjustment, OLR slowly increases in N96ORCA1 in line with a gradual increase in global mean SST (see Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0010">10</a>), stabilizing after ~400 years. In contrast, the N216ORCA025 model does not show an initial drop in OLR (and a much smaller drop in global mean SST; see Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0010">10</a>); rather, there is an immediate increase in OLR. This different behavior over the first ~20–40 simulation years is due to the rapid development of a warm upper ocean/SST bias in the N216ORCA025 model across the Southern Ocean, with spatial mean SSTs increasing by ~1.3 °C in the first 30 years of simulation (not shown). This results in a dipolar pattern in SST biases (relative to observations), warm over the Southern Ocean balancing cold elsewhere with respect to global mean values and, therefore, no initial adjustment in either global mean SST or OLR. There is a tendency for the Southern Ocean surface to also warm in N96ORCA1 but at a significantly slower rate than N216ORCA025. By year 30, N96ORCA1 Southern Ocean mean SSTs are 0.3 °C warmer than the initial conditions and 1 °C cooler than N216ORCA025. In terms of global mean SST, the weaker Southern Ocean warming in N96ORCA1 does not balance the cooling SST trend over the rest of the globe and an adjustment of global mean SST and OLR does occur. Beyond the first ~40 years, both models exhibit a gradual increase in global mean OLR. There is a suggestion that the N216ORCA025 OLR stabilizes around year 275, at a value of ~242 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, although the period of stable OLR is too short to be conclusive. What is clear is that the apparent stabilization of net TOA radiation from year ~150 onward in N216ORCA025 is not a result of the TOA radiation components stabilizing but rather due to near cancellation of opposite signed trends in global mean OLR and OSR.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with OLR, global mean OSR also shows opposite initial trends between N96ORCA1 (increasing over the first 20–40 years) and N216ORCA025 (decreasing over the same period). The increase in N96ORCA1 is associated with an increase in sea ice cover during this adjustment period, as the ocean loses heat (cools). This is seen in the increase in surface albedo in that model (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0003">3</a>c), which primarily occurs in the NH (Arctic sea ice increasing, Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0003">3</a>d). The inverse (negative) OSR trend in N216ORCA025 is connected to a rapid decrease in surface albedo (Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0003">3</a>), with this primarily occurring in the Southern Hemisphere (SH; Antarctic sea ice loss) as a consequence of the warm SST bias in N216ORCA025 over the Southern Ocean. After this adjustment period, both models exhibit a gradual decrease in OSR, again associated with a decrease in surface albedo, with the trend being stronger in N216ORCA025, primarily in the SH.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A continuous decrease in sea ice (and therefore planetary albedo) is expected in a coupled simulation using continuous year 2000 forcing, as this model will have a positive net TOA radiation balance (as seen in Figure 
  <a rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0001">1</a>). It is for this reason we use the period 50–100 years into the respective simulations to compare against observations. This period is after the initial ocean mixed layer adjustment (in N96ORCA1) but early enough in the simulation so the integrated forcing of the model will be similar to that experienced by the real climate system during the period ~1980 to 2010, when the bulk of observations have been made. Over the first 50–100 years of the two simulations OLR and OSR are within the uncertainty range of observations in Loeb et al. (
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0046">2009</a>), Stephens et al. (
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0065">2012</a>), and L'Ecuyer et al. (
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0044">2015</a>) suggesting the model experiences a radiative forcing representative of recent decades.
