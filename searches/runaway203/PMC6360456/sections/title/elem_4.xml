 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scientific evaluation of HadGEM3 GC3.1 N96ORCA1 we present here covers a long simulation (752 years) under PD forcing (2000 AD). It starts from the EN4 climatology, an objective analysis product based on observational data (Good et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0026">2013</a>), using a 1995–2014 average. For the atmosphere and the sea ice, initial conditions from PD model simulations at the previous version of HadGEM3 (GC3.0) are used. For reference and comparison we use a PD simulation (297 years long) from N216ORCA025 with nearly identical initial conditions (Williams et al., 
  <a rid="jame20790-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0075">2017</a>). In doing so, we ensure that the present paper documents the traceability between N96ORCA1 and N16ORCA025.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the following, the analysis focuses on the comparison of the PD simulations with observational data. The alternative to using PD simulations for evaluating a coupled climate model against observations is to run a full set of so‐called historical simulations that include time‐varying forcing over the 165 years up to 2015. This exercise requires a fully spun‐up PI control simulation to be completed in advance of running an ensemble of historical simulations. At the point of documenting our coupled model, such a spin‐up and PI control run had not yet been completed. Furthermore, if a climate model is developed using historical simulations within the development cycle, there is a risk of overtuning toward the observed historical record, which includes both natural climate variability and human forced climate change. Given that models such as HadGEM3‐GC3.1 are developed primarily for investigating the future anthropogenically forced climate change, we chose to avoid this risk and allow the historical climate evolution to be an emergent property of the model rather than a tuned component.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the N96ORCA1 configuration forms the core of UKESM1, we will, for each model component, analyze the typical features of a physical GCM as well as circulation features particularly relevant from an ESM perspective. Part of the analysis deals with the transient behavior to understand how the two models drift from the initial conditions toward their own individual equilibrium states. The bulk of the analysis presents the average of years 50–100, after the first 50 years of spin‐up, to assess how the models represent the PD climate.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We begin by considering the time‐dependent global and hemispheric radiation balance on centennial time scales, including surface and planetary albedo. Since our simulations have a continuous year 2000 forcing, these time series are not meant to reproduce observed variability. Rather, we believe that this analysis is instructive to understand the evolving and differing biases in N96ORCA1 and N216ORCA025.</p>

    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0001">1</a>a shows how the N96ORCA1 model, starting from PD conditions, reaches a temporally stable top of atmosphere (TOA, at 85 km) net radiation balance between +0.3 and +0.4 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span> after 300 to 400 years. The N216ORCA025 model appears to reach an equilibrium somewhat earlier (after about 150 to 200 years) and at a more positive value (+0.5–0.6 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span>) that is closer to observed estimates for recent decades (Allan et al., 
    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0002">2014</a>). As well as analyzing total net radiation, it is also important to consider the shortwave and longwave components of the TOA radiation budget as these may tell a different story to the net radiation.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figures 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0001">1</a>b and 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0001">1</a>c show the evolution of TOA outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and outgoing shortwave radiation (OSR) in the two models. While both start from almost identical initial states, they quickly diverge in terms of global mean OLR. In N96ORCA1 OLR initially drops during the first 20–40 years, as the ocean mixed layer cools relative to its initial conditions. After this adjustment, OLR slowly increases in N96ORCA1 in line with a gradual increase in global mean SST (see Figure 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0010">10</a>), stabilizing after ~400 years. In contrast, the N216ORCA025 model does not show an initial drop in OLR (and a much smaller drop in global mean SST; see Figure 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0010">10</a>); rather, there is an immediate increase in OLR. This different behavior over the first ~20–40 simulation years is due to the rapid development of a warm upper ocean/SST bias in the N216ORCA025 model across the Southern Ocean, with spatial mean SSTs increasing by ~1.3 °C in the first 30 years of simulation (not shown). This results in a dipolar pattern in SST biases (relative to observations), warm over the Southern Ocean balancing cold elsewhere with respect to global mean values and, therefore, no initial adjustment in either global mean SST or OLR. There is a tendency for the Southern Ocean surface to also warm in N96ORCA1 but at a significantly slower rate than N216ORCA025. By year 30, N96ORCA1 Southern Ocean mean SSTs are 0.3 °C warmer than the initial conditions and 1 °C cooler than N216ORCA025. In terms of global mean SST, the weaker Southern Ocean warming in N96ORCA1 does not balance the cooling SST trend over the rest of the globe and an adjustment of global mean SST and OLR does occur. Beyond the first ~40 years, both models exhibit a gradual increase in global mean OLR. There is a suggestion that the N216ORCA025 OLR stabilizes around year 275, at a value of ~242 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span>, although the period of stable OLR is too short to be conclusive. What is clear is that the apparent stabilization of net TOA radiation from year ~150 onward in N216ORCA025 is not a result of the TOA radiation components stabilizing but rather due to near cancellation of opposite signed trends in global mean OLR and OSR.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with OLR, global mean OSR also shows opposite initial trends between N96ORCA1 (increasing over the first 20–40 years) and N216ORCA025 (decreasing over the same period). The increase in N96ORCA1 is associated with an increase in sea ice cover during this adjustment period, as the ocean loses heat (cools). This is seen in the increase in surface albedo in that model (Figure 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0003">3</a>c), which primarily occurs in the NH (Arctic sea ice increasing, Figure 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0003">3</a>d). The inverse (negative) OSR trend in N216ORCA025 is connected to a rapid decrease in surface albedo (Figure 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0003">3</a>), with this primarily occurring in the Southern Hemisphere (SH; Antarctic sea ice loss) as a consequence of the warm SST bias in N216ORCA025 over the Southern Ocean. After this adjustment period, both models exhibit a gradual decrease in OSR, again associated with a decrease in surface albedo, with the trend being stronger in N216ORCA025, primarily in the SH.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A continuous decrease in sea ice (and therefore planetary albedo) is expected in a coupled simulation using continuous year 2000 forcing, as this model will have a positive net TOA radiation balance (as seen in Figure 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0001">1</a>). It is for this reason we use the period 50–100 years into the respective simulations to compare against observations. This period is after the initial ocean mixed layer adjustment (in N96ORCA1) but early enough in the simulation so the integrated forcing of the model will be similar to that experienced by the real climate system during the period ~1980 to 2010, when the bulk of observations have been made. Over the first 50–100 years of the two simulations OLR and OSR are within the uncertainty range of observations in Loeb et al. (
    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0046">2009</a>), Stephens et al. (
    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0065">2012</a>), and L'Ecuyer et al. (
    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0044">2015</a>) suggesting the model experiences a radiative forcing representative of recent decades.

    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0002">2</a>a, solid lines) and gains energy in the SH (dashed lines). As a consequence, an interhemispheric, northward energy transport is required (Marshall et al., 
    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0048">2013</a>). In terms of TOA net radiation this NH to SH gradient is ~1.2 W/m

    <span class="sup">2</span>; although is important to note that observed estimates of OSR and OLR are subject to an uncertainty of ±2 to 3 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span>). Considering OSR, in both hemispheres N216ORCA025 is 1–2 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span> less reflective than N96ORCA1, with the SH OSR likely more accurate in N96ORCA1 and the NH OSR more accurate in N216ORCA025 (cf. sea ice extent in Figure 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0015" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0015">15</a>). Put another way, the N216ORCA025 model is not sufficiently reflective to solar radiation in the SH, where N96ORCA1 performs better. In the NH the N96ORCA1 model is likely too reflective and N216ORCA025 is more accurate. Nevertheless, both models have very similar NH to SH OSR gradients of ~1.5 to 2 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span> (NH more reflective than SH), in contrast to the near‐zero gradient in observations. Problems simulating the hemispheric gradient in OSR have been documented in numerous studies (e.g., Trenberth and Fasullo, 
    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0069">2010</a>; Bodas‐Salcedo et al.,

    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0032">2013</a>) and can result both from errors in simulating climatological cloud‐radiation interactions over the Southern Ocean, particularly model underestimates of the prevalence of supercooled liquid clouds in the region (Bodas‐Salcedo et al., 
    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0006">2016</a>; Kay et al., 
    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0037">2016</a>), and from biases in simulated historical anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing, which is primarily a NH phenomenon (Ghan et al., 
    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0025">2016</a>; Myhre et al.,

    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0058">2018</a>). How much, one or both, of these problems contributes to the OSR error in HadGEM3‐GC3.1 requires further analysis.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to hemispheric OLR, the evolution of NH mean OLR is rather similar in both models, with slightly higher values in N216ORCA025. The models differ more in the SH, where after 100 years, N216ORCA025 OLR is ~2 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span> greater than N96ORCA1 (240 vs. 238 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span>, with a central observational estimate in Stephens et al., 
    <a rid="jame20790-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0064">2016</a>, of 238.9 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span>). The N216ORCA025 model (as shown in Figure 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0009">9</a>) develops a warm Southern Ocean SST bias, which is partly due to an underestimate of SH atmospheric reflectivity and an associated overestimate in surface downwelling solar radiation (i.e., simulated OSR in N216ORCA025 is ~98 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span> compared to a central observed estimate of ~99.7 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span>). A positive bias in SH OLR is consistent with (and also a consequence of) such a Southern Ocean warm bias. Over the NH N216ORCA025 OLR is at the upper end of the observed range (~242 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span> at year 100 compared to a central observed estimate of 240.2 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span>). The hemispheric OLR gradient in N216ORCA025 is therefore quite accurate but results from both hemispheres emitting too much OLR. In contrast, N96ORCA1 is closer to the central observed OLR estimates for both the NH and SH, slightly overestimating in the NH and underestimating in the SH, leading to a hemispheric gradient that is ~1 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span> more positive than N216ORCA025 and observations.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combination of similar hemispheric OSR gradients, but different OLR gradients, leads to the difference in hemispheric gradient (NH minus SH) of net TOA radiation between the two models: −4.6 (N96ORCA1) and −3.4 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span> (N216ORCA025), compared to a central observed estimate of −1.8 W/m
    <span class="sup">2</span>. The bulk of these errors against observations are associated with a common positive bias in the NH minus SH OSR gradient, which may have different drivers in the two models (i.e., SH atmosphere not sufficiently reflective in N216ORCA025, NH atmosphere too reflective in N96ORCA1). The more realistic (weaker) net TOA radiation gradient in N216ORCA025 arises from a weaker (more realistic) NH minus SH OLR gradient, which unfortunately results from the N216ORCA025 SH emitting OLR too strongly due to the warm surface Southern Ocean bias.

A significant fraction of this trend in planetary albedo can be attributed to decreases in surface albedo, associated with loss of sea ice and snow cover due to the positive net TOA radiation balance in both simulations. This decrease is greater in N216ORCA025, mainly due to a greater decrease in the SH associated with the surface ocean warm bias in that model. Considering hemispheric albedos, the NH surface albedos (Figure 
    <a rid="jame20790-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0003">3</a>d) are quite similar in both models, while the NH planetary albedo is clearly higher in N96ORCA1. This is consistent with the N96ORCA1 NH OSR being 1–2 W/m

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In N216ORCA025 the globally averaged SST cold bias is much smaller, just above 0.1 K. This is linked with the larger Southern Ocean warm bias (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>d), while the NH cold bias is smaller in N216ORCA025 and reduces the root‐mean‐square error in comparison to observations. Williams et al. (
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0075">2017</a>) provide a more detailed discussion of those large‐scale SST biases in N216ORCA025.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a few distinct regional cold‐spot features in the SST in N96ORCA1. Notably the northwest Atlantic is too cold by up to 6 K. This is a known issue in ocean GCMs of 1° grid resolution (Danabasoglu et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0012">2014</a>), probably because this resolution is too coarse to correctly represent the poleward and eastward direction of the North Atlantic Current; the current appears too zonal (cf. the central North Atlantic SST contours in Figures 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>a and 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>b). On a smaller spatial scale, similar problems with representing the position of the Kuroshio and the Brazil Current are discernible in Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>c; these appear in a forced, ocean‐only simulation as well (Storkey et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0067">2018</a>; Figure 16), indicating that the reason lies in the ocean model rather than with the surface buoyancy fluxes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that the cold bias in most of the low‐latitude to midlatitude Northern Pacific is very similar across the two resolutions in the coupled simulations (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>) but is not found in forced simulations (Storkey et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0067">2018</a>), pointing to resolution‐independent causes related to the coupling to the UM. The warm surface bias in subtropical regions of coastal upwelling (west coasts of South America and Southern Africa) is larger in N96ORCA1. It is likely that the representation of this upwelling is improved at higher resolution.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is worth noting that, while N96ORCA1 has a lower SST than N216ORCA025 at all latitudes on average, the zonal mean net heat flux into the ocean, diagnosed from atmosphere‐only simulations, is roughly the same for N96 and N216 (with minor differences in the tropics and the high northern latitudes). Preliminary analyses suggest that the varying extent of the Southern Ocean warm bias may be related to a resolution dependence in the spin‐up of the coupled ocean‐sea ice‐wind system (and associated ocean heat transports in the initial 5 years of the run) into different stable states. This resolution dependence is not evident in consistent, forced ocean‐only runs, strongly suggesting that it is a coupled phenomenon. Further investigation of the Southern Ocean warm bias in our models is under way.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For sea surface salinity (SSS) there are some marked regional biases in N96ORCA1 (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0005">5</a>c), while on the global average the bias against the EN4 climatology (1995–2014 average; Good et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0026">2013</a>) is only −0.16. The pattern in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0005">5</a>d) is very similar, notably the strong salty bias in the Bay of Bengal and the fresh biases in the subtropical Pacific on both hemispheres. To some degree, these regional biases also appear in ocean‐only, forced simulations (Storkey et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0067">2018</a>), indicating that they occur independent of coupled feedbacks.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strong fresh bias in the midlatitude North Atlantic, by contrast, occurs only in N96ORCA1. The full simulated SSS (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0005">5</a>a) indicates a freshwater tongue extending directly eastward from the Grand Banks. This is not visible in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0005">5</a>b). It is tempting to conclude that, for this reason, this SSS bias has—directly or indirectly—the same cause as the SST bias in the northwest Atlantic discussed above. Note, however, that the SSS bias minimum is at a more eastern location than the SST bias minimum.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The maximum monthly mixed layer depth (MLD) is calculated from monthly mean model output. MLD indicates where water masses are ventilated and deep water is formed, both of which are also relevant for the nutrient distributions in the Earth system context. The maximum MLD occurs in different months across the globe, for instance, in the high latitudes usually at the end of winter on either hemisphere. Figures 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0006">6</a>a and 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0006">6</a>b show the maximum MLD from both models, while the bias against observations is shown in Figures 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0006">6</a>c and 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0006">6</a>d. There are notable differences between the two models. For N96ORCA1, in the northwestern Atlantic the region of the cold and fresh bias stands out with a too small maximum MLD. The maximum MLD tends to be too large in the subtropical latitudes on both hemispheres (including poleward of the ACC) and in the deepwater formation regions of the North Atlantic; in large parts of the Pacific (northern midlatitude, southern tropical) they are too small. In the northern North Atlantic, there is a significant difference in that N96ORCA1 has a very deep mixed layer in the central Nordic Seas, as opposed to N216ORCA025 which, by contrast, shows a deeper mixed layer in larger parts of the Labrador and Irminger Seas. This might point to different preferred deepwater formation regions in the two model versions.

   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>b) of the two models shows their different behavior with regards to ocean heat uptake. A significant ocean heat uptake is expected in PD simulations because of the positive incoming net radiation at TOA. In N96ORCA1 (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>a), this heat is mostly found above 1,000 m depth, transported northward and eventually downward by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). In N216ORCA025 (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>b), the warm bias in the upper 1,000 m is smaller, but there is a warm bias throughout the entire depth of the Southern Ocean. We suggest that this Southern Ocean deep warm bias is a result of the warm bias at the surface.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The zonally averaged biases are smaller for salinity. In N96ORCA1, there is a saline bias in the warm subsurface layer on the NH (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>c). N216ORCA025 is comparatively fresh in the upper layers of the high‐latitude Southern Ocean (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>d); the relation to the Antarctic coastal current present at this resolution will be discussed in a companion paper. At both resolutions, there is a positive salinity bias in the upper 2,000 m around 44°N. This stems from a high salinity in the Black Sea whose circulation with the Mediterranean through the Dardanelles is very confined in the model geometry and more so in N216ORCA025 with its higher resolution—hence the larger Black Sea salinity bias here.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Turning to the depth‐time structure of the temperature bias in N96ORCA1 (against the EN4 climatology), in Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0008">8</a> we find that in all basins there is a subsurface warming between about 200 m and 1,000 m depth (while extending less far up in the Pacific). This warming trend is strongest in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and after a few centuries the deep Atlantic warms too (the warm bias being transported downward and then southward by the AMOC). In the Pacific and Southern Oceans the warming has a smaller vertical extent and a much slower rate; in both basins the top few hundred meters of ocean water is colder than in observations, with only weak trends. For the Southern Ocean, this holds in spite of the warm bias at the surface in large parts. The combination of a too cold mixed layer and too warm subsurface waters indicates a too small global vertical temperature gradient, a common feature in CMIP5 models (Kuhlbrodt &amp; Gregory,

An initial cooling in N216ORCA025 is small and lasts for only about 30 years. By contrast, the initial cooling is stronger and much more sustained in N96ORCA1. Here the SST time series passes the PD observed value of 18.3 °C after about 200 years. The initial SST cooling (and AMOC weakening; see below) when spinning up a coupled model from an observational climatology is fairly typical for this resolution, compare HadGEM1 in Banks et al. (
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0003">2007</a>) and the GFDL ESM2 models in Dunne et al. (

   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>f) show that, for the average of the years 50–100, the AMOC is somewhat weaker than observations in N96ORCA1 (maximum 15.2 Sv), while in N216ORCA025 it is very close to observations (maximum 16.9 Sv). In line with the stronger deepwater formation in the Nordic Seas discussed above, the overturning cell extends further north in N96ORCA1. Note that the deep overturning cell of Antarctic bottom water is stronger in N96ORCA1 (&gt;2 Sv); this could be related to the Antarctic bottom water being colder in N96ORCA1.

After the first century, the AMOC is comparatively stable and close to observations at both resolutions. It is worth noting that, when comparing the AMOC as computed using the full velocity field in models to the RAPID estimate, the RAPID method may actually underestimate the full transport by ~1.5 Sv (Sinha et al.,

   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0051">2014</a>) a very wide intermodel spread was found (155 ± 51 Sv for CMIP5). Seen in this light, the ACC strength in N96ORCA1 remains reasonable. In N216ORCA025, by contrast, the ACC quickly slows down to less than 100 Sv and then decreases further to about 50 Sv. This is a consequence of heat uptake poleward of 60°S throughout the entire water column (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0007">7</a>), not being density compensated by a trend in salinity.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea ice thickness and concentration directly respond to local forcing, including atmospheric and oceanic heat transport. The heat transport of Atlantic water through the Fram Strait determines the Arctic Ocean temperature in the top 300 m. Warm water at this depth can influence the sea ice through the ocean‐to‐ice heat flux which in turn can moderate the basal growth in winter (Keen et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0038">2013</a>). The Fram Strait heat transport in HadGEM3 GC3.1 varies with ocean model spatial resolution, since (a) Fram Strait is only 12 grid points wide in NEMO ORCA1 (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0014" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0014">14</a>a); and (b) NEMO ORCA1 uses a parameterization for mesoscale eddies (see section 
   <a rid="jame20790-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" href="#jame20790-sec-0002">2</a>), as opposed to NEMO ORCA025. This parameterization tends to smooth out ocean fronts and so reduces the flow through straits (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0014" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0014">14</a>). The Fram Strait heat transport in ORCA025 varies interannually in the range 26–49 TW, in good agreement with the observationally derived value of 28–46 TW (Schauer et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0060">2004</a>). However, the equivalent ORCA1 heat annual mean transport is 3–5 TW, which, being a factor 10 smaller, results in colder Arctic waters year‐round. As a consequence the winter mixed layer entrainment of deeper warm water will not result in warmer water in contact with the ice, and in spring the onset of enhanced basal melt will be absent, both effects causing annual mean ice to be thicker than observed.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compensate for the lack of basal melt, the surface albedo of snow covered ice is reduced from 0.98 to 0.96 in the visible spectral band and from 0.70 to 0.68 in the near infrared spectral band. The albedo reduction of 0.02 balances the desired effect in the Arctic Ocean with a tendency toward increased ocean heat uptake. Such an albedo reduction allows a slightly earlier onset of snow melt and subsequently longer sea ice melt season. A greater summer melt can thus offset the reduced basal sea ice melt to match the observed Arctic sea ice thickness. The values of snow albedo, in both model resolutions, lie within the observational uncertainty.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the high‐ and low‐resolution models are in good agreement with the seasonal Arctic sea ice extent (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0015" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0015">15</a>) when compared with the HadISST.2 sea ice analysis (Titchner &amp; Rayner, 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0068">2014</a>). In the Southern Ocean, N96ORCA1 shows a better agreement because the Southern Ocean warm bias (Williams et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0075">2017</a>) is less severe than at high resolution (cf. section 
   <a rid="jame20790-sec-0007" ref-type="sec" href="#jame20790-sec-0007">3.2</a>). The sea ice volume in N96ORCA1 is larger than in N216ORCA025 (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0015" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0015">15</a>). In the Antarctic this is solely associated with the greater ice extent, whereas in the Arctic the thicker ice means that more ice survives the summer melt season becoming thicker multiyear ice.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For global mean precipitation, the largest biases are in the region of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The geographical pattern of the biases is mostly resolution independent (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0017" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0017">17</a>). Because of a misrepresentation of the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and its seasonal cycle, some tropical regions are too dry (equatorial Pacific, northern tropical Atlantic and Africa, and the Indian subcontinent) while others are too wet (western tropical Pacific and western tropical South America). Some of the equatorial dry biases are stronger in N96ORCA1 (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0017" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0017">17</a>b). The annual global mean precipitation in N96ORCA1 is 3.07 mm/day (3.13 mm/day in N216ORCA025 or 2% more). These values are somewhat too large compared with observational estimates that tend to be just below 3.0 mm/day (Behrangi et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0004">2014</a>; Wild et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0074">2012</a>). This excess global mean precipitation is a long‐standing issue with the UM and other global atmospheric models (Collins et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0010">2010</a>). Indeed, several of the regional annual mean precipitation biases found in N96ORCA1 are common to CMIP5 climate models in the ensemble average (Flato et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0021">2013</a>), for instance, the biases over the oceans mentioned above, the dry bias over the Indian subcontinent, or the dry‐wet dipole over Siberia.

   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0018" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0018">18</a> shows a comparison for the NH summer between the 50‐year mean from the two resolutions and the remotely sensed soil moisture (1996–2015 average) from the combined ESA‐CCI product (Dorigo et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0018">2017</a>; Gruber et al.,

   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0045">2012</a>). Both resolutions capture the global patterns reasonably well (for instance, dry Sahara and wet NH midlatitudes) while they span a wider range of values than the observations: the dry regions are drier and the wet regions wetter than in the ESA‐CCI data. The N96ORCA1 simulation appears to have slightly wetter soil (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0018" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0018">18</a>c), mostly where the simulations show a too high soil moisture to begin with. We suspect that differences in precipitation (cf. Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0017" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0017">17</a>) rather than systematic differences in the land‐surface model are responsible. While most of the wettest regions in the tropics are masked out in the ESA‐CCI data (because of the high cloud cover), the overestimation of high soil moisture is manifest in Southeast Asia and in midlatitude South America. It is likely that this is a result of the excess precipitation in these regions (Figure

This might be related to the low soil moisture in some subtropical regions discussed above.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the largest natural mode of interannual climate variability in the tropics; oscillations between warm and cold phases occur on a 3‐ to 7‐year time scale, and the effects are felt worldwide. A realistic simulation of ENSO is an important goal for climate models. Power spectra for the central east Pacific region, Niño3, for three 100‐year time slices of N96ORCA1 PD and observations show that the model has broadly the correct dominant frequencies, although there may be slightly more power in the 2‐ to 3‐year time scale than observed (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0019" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0019">19</a>). As has been seen in other models, there are multidecadal variations (e.g., Wittenberg et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0076">2006</a>) with ENSO being more active here, on the time scales between 2.5 and 7 years, in the first and third centuries (purple and yellow) than the second (blue).

The amplitude of SST variability (M1 and M2) is well reproduced for central and central east equatorial Pacific regions although the phase locking of the signal to be at a maximum in early boreal winter and a minimum in spring (M4) is a little weak compared with observations. The variance of precipitation in the west Pacific (M5), which gives an indication of the impact on the large‐scale circulation, is reasonable. A key mean state difference between N96ORCA1 and N216ORCA025 is the annual mean equatorial cold bias evident in N96ORCA1 (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0004">4</a>), a bias common to many climate models. There is also an enhanced warm bias in the far eastern Pacific in N96ORCA1—note that these two biases cancel for the Niño3 region (M6). In addition, N96ORCA1 also has overly strong easterlies in the west Pacific (M7). Overall, N96ORCA1 compares favorably with CMIP5 models.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) is a natural variability mode in North Atlantic SST with a period of roughly 65 to 80 years (Deser et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0016">2010</a>). It has a strong influence on precipitation over land masses around the Atlantic basin and Atlantic hurricane activity. The AMV index is defined as the difference between the area‐average SST anomaly over the North Atlantic (0°–60°N) and the global SST anomaly (Buckley &amp; Marshall, 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0008">2016</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0020" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0020">20</a>a shows the AMV index from the N96ORCA1 PD simulation, with the first 80 years removed because of the spin‐up behavior. The power spectrum of the diagnosed AMV time series (Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0020" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0020">20</a>b) displays significant peaks with respect to a theoretical AR(1) spectrum at frequencies of approximately 0.017 ≈ 1/60 year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> and 0.3 ≈ 1/3 year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>. In a power spectrum from the observational data set HadISST (Buckley and Marshall, 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0008">2016</a>; Figure 
   <a rid="jame20790-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#jame20790-fig-0006">6</a>b), these two peaks are at similar frequencies (1/70 and 1/2.3 year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>). This suggests that, in spite of the cold SST bias in the Atlantic discussed above, the N96ORCA1 PD simulation realistically captures large‐scale coupled atmosphere‐ocean Atlantic variability while acknowledging that some of the observed variability may be forced, as opposed to the simulations. This is an improvement compared to a selection of CMIP5 models (Kavvada et al., 
   <a rid="jame20790-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#jame20790-bib-0036">2013</a>), which showed a spectral peak around 1/20 year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> that appears not to be present in the observed AMV index.
