 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stalagmites, TK16, TK131, and TK133, were cut into halves along their growth axes and polished. Powdered subsamples, 50 to 100 mg each, of 61 layers were drilled along the growth axis on the polished surface for U-Th dating. We followed the chemical procedure described in refs.

  <a rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" href="#r59">59</a> to separate uranium and thorium. U-Th isotopic composition and 
  <span class="sup">230</span>Th dates were determined by a multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Neptune, at the High-Precision Mass Spectrometry and Environment Change Laboratory, National Taiwan University (

  <a rid="r61" ref-type="bibr" href="#r61">61</a>). Age models were established by using 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations and a polynomial interpolation procedure in the COPRA (construction of proxy record from age models) routine (
