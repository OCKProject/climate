 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stalagmite subsamples for oxygen stable isotope analyses were drilled at intervals of 2, 1, and 0.5 mm for TK16, TK131, and TK133, respectively. A total of 1,388 subsamples were analyzed on an IsoPrime100 gas source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer equipped with a MultiPrep system at the Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Reported δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values were calculated with respect to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An international standard NBS 19 and a laboratory standard HN were analyzed every 10 to 15 samples to monitor instrumentation and reproducibility. The replicates showed that the external error for δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O was better than ±0.06‰ (1σ).
