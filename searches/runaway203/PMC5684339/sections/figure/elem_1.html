         <p>GWI uncertainty analysis for HadCRUT4. (
            <span>a</span>) Temporal evolution (1950–2017) of fraction contributions to the total uncertainty
            (5–95% range). (
            <span>b</span>) Same as (
            <span>a</span>) but for the variance (square of the standard error). The black line is the combined
            total variance. This differs from the sum because uncertainties are non-gaussian.
            Note the very small contribution of the response model uncertainty at the bottom.
            (
            <span>c</span>) Probability density function for the relative uncertainty contributions to the value
            of the GWI in May 2017. Note that the response model frequency peaks at ~100. In black
            is the PDF of the combined total uncertainty.
