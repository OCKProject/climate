  <p>GWI uncertainty analysis for HadCRUT4. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Temporal evolution (1950–2017) of fraction contributions to the total uncertainty (5–95% range). (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) but for the variance (square of the standard error). The black line is the combined total variance. This differs from the sum because uncertainties are non-gaussian. Note the very small contribution of the response model uncertainty at the bottom. (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Probability density function for the relative uncertainty contributions to the value of the GWI in May 2017. Note that the response model frequency peaks at ~100. In black is the PDF of the combined total uncertainty.
