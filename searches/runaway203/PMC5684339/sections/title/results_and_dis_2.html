      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using HadCRUT4, the human-induced warming in May 2017, calculated relative to the
         period 1850–79, reached +1.01 °C with an uncertainty range of +0.87 to +1.22 °C (5–95%
         confidence interval) as shown in Fig. 
         <a>1</a> (orange line). The corresponding natural externally-driven change is −0.01 ± 0.03 °C
         and hence very small in comparison to the human contribution (blue line in Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). Essentially all the observed warming since 1850–79 is anthropogenic. Using HadCRUT4-CW
         instead, the GWI for May 2017 is +1.08 °C with an uncertainty range of 0.92 to 1.32 °C
         (see Fig. 
         <a>S1b</a> in the supplementary material).

                  The dark red line shows the evolution of the GWI when only past forcing and temperature
                  data are used. It starts in 1944 - the time when a human-induced warming signal can
                  first be detected - followed by a new data point for each month up until May 2017.
                  The evolution of the red line indicates the degree of month-to-month variability of
                  the index. The thin black line are the monthly (HadCRUT4) GMST data. For illustration,
                  blue diamonds indicate when major climate summits took place in context of the monthly
                  GMST at that time.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our uncertainty estimates are consistent with other attribution results: We estimate
         human-induced warming over 1951–2010 to be +0.63 ± 0.08 °C (105% of the total warming)
         in HadCRUT4 (+0.65 °C for HadCRUT4-CW; Fig. 
         <a>S1b</a>), in line with the 2013 IPCC assessment (given to 1 decimal place) of +0.7 ± 0.1 °C
         based on more comprehensive attribution studies using the CMIP5 ensemble. The contributions
         to the uncertainty ranges (5–95% interval) for the current level of warming are −0.06
         to +0.07 °C (observational), −0.07 to +0.19 °C (climate forcing), −0.002 to +0.009 °C
         (response model), and −0.09 to +0.12 °C (internal variability). The fraction of the
         contributions to the total uncertainty, the variance and the distributions of the
         decomposed uncertainty estimates are shown in Fig. 
         <a>2a–c</a>, respectively. The observational uncertainty combines effects of measurement, sampling,
         bias, and coverage uncertainties. It is described in the HadCRUT4 uncertainty model
         <span><a>23</a>,
            <a>45</a>–
            <a>47</a></span> and applied to HadCRUT4-CW in the same way (see Fig. 
         <a>S2</a> in the supplementary material). We note that the coverage uncertainty in HadCRUT4
         might be underestimated as it does not account for different warming rates over unobserved
         or under-sampled regions such as the Arctic. The overall uncertainty is dominated
         by the radiative forcing uncertainty as shown in Fig. 
         <a>2a,b</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, uncertainties in GWI are primarily systematic, and hence do not increase
         its temporal volatility. Re-computing the GWI based only on data up to different points
         in the past leads to variations of no more than ±0.1 °C relative to the estimate based
         on the full data available now (dark red compared to orange line in Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). These deviations are strongly auto-correlated and declining as the signal strengthens.
         Hence the GWI is relatively insensitive to the end date as well as short-term GMST
         fluctuations, pre-empting possible misconceptions, for example, that a strong El Niño
         or La Niña event represent an acceleration, “hiatus”, or slowdown in human-induced
         warming.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rate of human-induced warming is estimated using the latest 20 years of data.
         The most recent 20 year trend is +0.16 °C/decade in HadCRUT4, and the uncertainty
         range spans from +0.12 to +0.32 °C/decade. For HadCRUT4-CW, the trend is +0.17 °C/decade
         (0.13–0.33 °C/decade). The range is skewed due to the one-sided uncertainty related
         to anthropogenic aerosols during 1950–80. Our warming rate estimate is compatible
         with the 1979–2010 trend calculated in Foster and Rahmstorf
         <span><a>48</a></span> using multiple regression to filter out natural contributors (+0.17 °C for HadCRUT4).
         Other more physically based methods to remove natural variations yield equally compatible
         results
         <span><a>49</a></span>. Trends of shorter time intervals show larger anthropogenic warming rates in recent
         years, indicating that the trend in GHG forcing has likely been increasing, although
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions have stabilised during the last three years. Non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> GHGs such as methane may be responsible for the accelerated anthropogenic warming
         rate
         <span><a>28</a></span>, with perhaps a minor contribution from reduced Asian aerosol pollution
         <span><a>29</a>,
            <a>50</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Up until this point, we have presented results for HadCRUT4 and HadCRUT4-CW, which
         differ in their global coverage and hence do have a noticeable effect on our results.
         Since the HadCRUT4-CW method has only been fully published for the data after 1979
         <span><a>24</a></span> (with a brief reference to the data before 1979 in the supplementary material of
         Cowtan 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>51</a></span>), we use HadCRUT4 as our main result for the time being. We note, however, that HadCRUT4
         has known negative biases due to incomplete coverage of the Arctic where the globe
         is warming the fastest
         <span><a>52</a></span> which may lead to an underestimated anthropogenic warming
         <span><a>6</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further test the notion that our results are sensitive to the choice of the GMST
         dataset, we analysed NASA/GISS
         <span><a>53</a></span>, the NOAA Merged LandOcean Surface Temperature Analysis
         <span><a>54</a></span> and the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature analysis
         <span><a>55</a></span> in the same way (see Fig. 
         <a>S3</a> in the supplementary material). Note that NASA/GISS and NOAA/MLOST data are only
         available after 1880, i.e. the reference period is 1881–1910. The GWI for May 2017
         varies from +1.08 °C  (NOAA) to +1.13 °C  (Berkeley), suggesting that the current
         warming rate in HadCRUT4 may indeed be at the lower end. That said, NASA/GISS, for
         example, uses ERSSTv4
         <span><a>56</a></span> over oceans, which appears to have substantial biases during WWII
         <span><a>57</a></span>. While attempts have been made to correct this bias in ERSSTv5
         <span><a>57</a></span>, the problem may still not be resolved. HadSST3 (used in HadCRUT4, HadCRUT4-CW and
         Berkeley Earth) does not show the same anomalous behaviour. Accordingly, our fit between
         total forcing and NASA/GISS is worse than for the two HadCRUT4 versions (Fig. 
         <a>S3c</a>). The same is true for NOAA/MLOST (Fig. 
         <a>S3d</a>). Berkeley Earth has gaps in the early part of the record and NOAA has no Arctic
         coverage either. Hence there really is no “perfect” GMST dataset at the moment, which
         is why we argue that it is defensible to use HadCRUT4. Future versions of those GMST
         datasets may come in to better agreement as data gaps are closed and methodologies
         improved.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As far as the choice of the reference period is concerned, in Fig. 
         <a>S1</a> we illustrate the effect quantitatively. While the difference between the volcano-free
         1861–80 period and the 1850–79 default reference period is not substantial (−0.005 °C
         across the datasets), using the 1851–1900 reference period instead does have a significant
         effect on the main result. The index is reduced by ~0.02 °C due to a shifting mean
         reference time for the anthropogenic forcing to 1875. Natural forcing contributions
         are negative during the 1881–1900 period, moving the natural warming contribution
         to positive values when the 1851–1900 reference period is used. Conveniently, the
         current natural warming contribution is essentially zero in the default reference
         period of 1850–79.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite this array of uncertainties, the GWI comes with a number of advantages compared
         to using GMST from observations or GCMs as global warming metric. The most important
         advantage is that it does not depend on climate models to estimate the anthropogenic
         warming fraction: we make no prior assumptions about the magnitude of the response
         to either anthropogenic or natural forcing, or the climate sensitivity, in computing
         the GWI. Nonetheless, there are a few issues that need to be considered. While the
         GWI reflects global forcing responses by construction, it implicitly assumes globally
         homogeneous forcing. However, anthropogenic aerosols are emitted spatially very inhomogeneous.
         As demonstrated elsewhere
         <span><a>5</a>,
            <a>58</a></span>, this asymmetry leads to globally inhomogeneous temperature responses which need
         to be considered. More land surface area and a generally higher aerosol load over
         land leads to faster forcing response times in the Northern Hemisphere in comparison
         to the ocean-dominated, cleaner Southern Hemisphere. We therefore tested the sensitivity
         of hemispherically asymmetric aerosol forcing upon our results by using different
         response times in both hemispheres. We find that the current GWI is insensitive to
         the treatment of anthropogenic aerosols. This can be explained by the fairly constant
         aerosol emission levels over the last 10–20 years as far as the resulting total hemispheric
         forcing is concerned.
