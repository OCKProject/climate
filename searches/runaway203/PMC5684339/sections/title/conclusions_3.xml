 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have proposed an operationally-updated Global Warming Index following the well established “multi-fingerprinting” approach

  </span>, estimating anthropogenic warming by computing an ordinary least-squares regression with observed GMST as dependent variable and the responses to anthropogenic and natural forcing as the two independent variables. For GMST, we use the UK MetOffice HadCRUT4. The infilled version (HadCRUT4-CW) is shown to provide contextual information with regard to uncertainties related to the choice of the GMST dataset. The response model to convert the forcing into the associated temperature response uses fast and slow time constants

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The central estimate of current anthropogenic warming (+1.01 °C as of May 2017) is well below the monthly peak warming of +1.35 °C in Feb and Mar 2016 and well above the colder pre-2013 period. The rate of human-induced warming may actually be accelerating over the past 20 years and is currently at +0.16 °C/decade based on the 1997–2016 period. The index is insensitive to the aerosol forcing and relatively insensitive to the end date and GMST fluctuations on inter-annual or even inter-decadal timescales. For example, the GWI would have increased monotonically throughout the so-called “hiatus” period

  </span>. We find that there is a considerable difference between our HadCRUT4 and HadCRUT4-CW results due to the coverage issue in the Arctic. GMST warming does not tell the whole climate change story as land warms at least twice as fast as oceans under transient climate change conditions. However, the attribution question remains largely unaffected as both land and ocean show distinct warming patterns that are linked to anthropogenic forcing.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An easily accessible index (see 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.globalwarmingindex.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.globalwarmingindex.org</span>) of how much of the observed warming is attributable to human influence is helpful information that should be permanently available to anyone. Robustness, transparency and salience of the GWI render it a reliable and usable benchmark tool. While the very robustness we have demonstrated here leads to a stable index with little to no month-to-month variability, the real-time factor is indispensable when it comes communicating to the public. Institutions such as the World Meteorological Organisation could provide a regular standardised update of human-induced warming to support future stock-takes of progress towards climate stabilisation. Attribution can no longer be left to periodic academic assessments.
