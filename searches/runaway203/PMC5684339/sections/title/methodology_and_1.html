      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A variety of detection and attribution techniques have been used to conclude consistently
         that most of the observed increase in near-surface temperatures over the second half
         of the 20th century is attributable to anthropogenic influences
         <span><a>13</a>,
            <a>18</a>–
            <a>21</a></span>. The Global Warming Index, or GWI, proposed here is based on the standard “multi-fingerprinting”
         approach introduced by Hasselmann
         <span><a>13</a></span>, as also used by the IPCC and, for example, by Folland 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>22</a></span> who adopted a very similar approach to estimate temperature responses. The “multi-fingerprinting”
         method is, in essence, a linear regression, taking observed GMST (as provided by the
         UK MetOffice HadCRUT4 dataset
         <span><a>23</a></span> together with a variant using Kriging to infill regions without data
         <span><a>24</a></span>, hereinafter referred to as HadCRUT4-CW) as the dependent variable and estimated
         responses to human-induced and natural drivers of climate change as the independent
         variables.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Applying the methodology introduced in Otto 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>12</a></span>, we use the most recent radiative forcing estimates based on IPCC AR5 (Chapter 8)
         <span><a>25</a></span>, updated to 2017 using Greenhouse Gas (GHG) data from NOAA and ECLIPSE (Evaluating
         the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants)
         <span><a>26</a>,
            <a>27</a></span>, including a higher methane (CH
         <sub>4</sub>) forcing estimate
         <span><a>28</a></span>, ozone (O
         <sub>3</sub>) and anthropogenic aerosol data from CICERO
         <span><a>29</a></span>, solar variability data from the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE)
         <span><a>30</a></span> and volcanic forcing data from NASA/GISS
         <span><a>31</a></span>. Radiative forcing due to land-use changes and indirect aerosol effects are included.
         The annual data before 2015 are interpolated to monthly values (except for volcanoes
         where we use monthly data throughout).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temporal evolution of the responses to total anthropogenic (combined greenhouse
         gas and aerosol) and natural (combined solar and volcanic) radiative forcing is calculated
         using the two-time-constant IPCC impulse-response model
         <span><a>25</a>,
            <a>32</a></span>. The best estimate for the fast (slow) adjustment time is 4.1 (209) years
         <span><a>33</a></span>. Long-term slow recovery from volcanic eruptions
         <span><a>34</a>–
            <a>36</a></span> is hence represented in the model. The TCR/ECS ratio (Transient Climate Response/Equilibrium
         Climate Sensitivity; also referred to as Realised Warming Fraction
         <span><a>37</a></span>) is 0.6, close to the CMIP5 model mean of 0.55. The anthropogenic contribution to
         climate change is determined by a simple least-squares-fit between observed temperatures
         and anthropogenic and natural forcing contributions
         <span><a>38</a></span>, allowing observed GMST to be decomposed into human-induced and natural components.
         Ordinary least squares is appropriate because the output of the simple model is almost
         free of stochastic variability, hence the noise is very small.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 5–95% confidence interval in the GWI is estimated on the basis of observational
         (100 possible variations
         <span><a>23</a></span>), forcing (200 possible variations
         <span><a>25</a>,
            <a>39</a></span>), response model uncertainty (20 possible variations
         <span><a>33</a></span>) and uncertainty due to internal variability (50 possible variations, using internal
         variability from the CMIP5 pre-industrial control ensemble). Drifting control runs
         are rejected above a certain threshold (±0.15 °C/century). We note that the magnitude
         of internal variability could be overestimated with our method given that low frequency
         variability in CMIP5 models requires careful calibration
         <span><a>40</a></span>. It may even change in the future
         <span><a>41</a></span>. The radiative forcing time-history uncertainty is estimated using a Monte Carlo
         method
         <span><a>42</a>,
            <a>43</a></span>. The response model uncertainty covers a wide range of Realised Warming Fractions
         (0.2–0.8) as well as a range of fast adjustment timescales (2–10 years). This includes
         slower fast response times, consistent with a real world response different from GCMs
         <span><a>44</a></span>. Since the contribution of the impulse response model uncertainty to the overall
         uncertainty is small, we retain ~4 years for the fast response time.
