 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The outstanding features of our climate reconstructions are the distinct decoupled trends in summer (falling) and winter (rising) temperature across the Eemian, and the two abrupt events in the summer temperature reconstruction. Major features of these pollen-based reconstructions are supported by the aquatic proxy record from this sequence, including green microalgae (this study) and diatoms (ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The diatom data corroborate the trend of increasing 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>jan</sub> reconstructed from pollen. Changes in the diatom composition reflect a prolongation of the open-water period in early Zone V, mainly as an effect of milder winters and an earlier ice-out. Following this, decreasing continentality is further indicated by decreasing stability of summer stratification; this interpretation is however complicated by decreasing water depths (due to lake infilling) which has a similar effect on the stability of stratification
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. The Late-Eemian rise in reconstructed 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>jan</sub> also coincides with occurrences of spores of 
  <span class="italic">Osmunda regalis</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). In modern northern Europe, 
  <span class="italic">O. regalis</span> has a distinctly oceanic distribution, with the most continental occurrences found in southern Sweden. Thus the Late-Eemian fossil occurrences at Sokli support the reconstructed, significantly warmer winters during this time. The heavy spores of 
  <span class="italic">O. regalis</span> are less likely to be transported by wind compared to pollen, however long-distance transport cannot be ruled out
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Although the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>jan</sub> reconstruction should be interpreted with caution, due to the comparatively weak signal of winter temperature in northern European pollen data (see Methods), here we regard the first-order trend towards warmer winters, validated by independent data, as the salient feature.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two cooling events in the pollen-based reconstructions are also seen in the aquatic record, which also provides indications of dry climate during these intervals. The occurrences of the green algae 
  <span class="italic">Pediastrum integrum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Tetraëdron minimum</span>, and algal-type T.225
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>, at the end of Zone III (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) suggest that cooling of the Tunturi event may have started before the strong response in the terrestrial record (from ca. 23.8 m)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Based on the combined multiproxy data, the Tunturi event appears to have two separate cold peaks, with sharp 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>jul</sub> minima at the onset and about two thirds into the event (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). The terrestrial fossil sequence (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) shows a sharp recovery phase halfway through the event, with the pollen of 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> increasing at the expense of 
  <span class="italic">B. pubsescens/pendula</span>, and with a 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> stoma indicating local presence. The diatom data also suggest a mid-event recovery including warming and a rise in lake level
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Juniper is known to be frost-susceptible and prefers a winter snow-cover
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>, and its decreased values during the cooling peaks thus suggest relatively dry climate. This is further suggested by reduced values of 
  <span class="italic">Alnus</span> pollen, expansion of the wetland zone (peak in 
  <span class="italic">Salix</span>) and appearances of the shallow freshwater algae 
  <span class="italic">Spirogyra</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and of aerophilic and halophilic diatoms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. While the Värriö event is seen as a sharp initial peak in the pollen-based reconstructions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), in the aquatic proxies the Värriö event has a longer signature, and is even more distinct than the Tunturi event. Most importantly, peak values of 
  <span class="italic">Spirogyra</span> green algae and littoral diatom taxa indicate sudden drops in lake level during peak cooling
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>, while the cold-oligotrophic green algae 
  <span class="italic">P. integrum</span> has a strong maximum (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), paralleling the response during the Tunturi event.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An increasing body of data from the North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas shows prominent and widespread cold and freshwater events intersecting interglacial conditions during the Eemian

  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). Records from the Eirik Drift, south of Greenland, show a concurrent cooling
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>, together with reductions in North Atlantic Deep Water formation, inferred from low benthic δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C excursions, suggesting a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. When comparing against the SST (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>) and AMOC (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>) proxies, the Tunturi event at Sokli (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>) shows a similar duration and positioning between two warm periods with interglacial conditions, as well as a possible two-pronged structure of the cooling phase. At the East Greenland margin, two major glacial meltwater events have been identified at 128.5 and 126.5 ka, based on negative anomalies in planktic foraminifera δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4e</a>), with Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) melting implicated as the cause
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. The early warm period seen at Sokli (pollen zone III) would thus coincide with the period of high SST’s (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>) and relatively strong AMOC (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>) between the successive meltwater outbursts. Based on alignment of the East Greenland margin and Eirik Drift records, it has been speculated
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> that a further meltwater outburst from the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span> may have prolonged the event initiated by the 126.5 ka meltwater input from the GIS. At the East Greenland Margin, a further meltwater spike has been documented in the Late Eemian (ca. 118 ka; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4e</a>)

  <span class="sup">

  </span>. Continued Late-Eemian events are also seen in the Eirik Drift proxy data (e.g., 117 and 120 ka; Fig.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. However due to lack of absolute dating and the general ambiguity of chronological tie points within the Eemian
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>, we cannot confidently correlate the Late-Eemian Värriö event with a specific marine event.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The numerous continental Eemian sequences from the mid-latitudes of Europe do not reveal a comparable sequence of abrupt climate events, although increasing instabilities are seen in some records towards the Late Eemian

Transient ocean–atmosphere models of the Eemian do not reproduce comparable short-term climatic shifts, however these modelling efforts have focused on long-term trends and have not included possible forcings of abrupt climate events seen in the proxy data, such as meltwater pulses occurring after the major Early-Eemian deglaciation

 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast with the mid-latitude data, the Eemian abrupt events have a strong and repeated expression in the emerging data from the high latitudes, including Sokli and the North Atlantic marine data, suggesting a northern distribution of the events. However, it is uncertain to what extent this distribution is affected by, e.g., resolution of datasets or differences in the seasonality of the events and the seasonal sensitivities of proxies in individual regions. We note that while the Eemian cooling events have proxy expressions lasting up to 2 ka (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), they are both in our data and in the marine data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span> characterised by sharp and strong maxima against a longer event complex. Given the variable resilience and possible threshold responses in individual climate proxies, it might thus require a high-resolution multi-proxy dataset to resolve the events. An illustration of these challenges is provided by the Värriö event in the Sokli data. Here, only the initial sharp maximum is resolved in the pollen record, possibly because the site was located further from the forest–tundra ecotone than during the well-resolved Tunturi event. Meanwhile the Värriö event has a longer and stronger expression in the aquatic proxies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>, likely due to already shallow conditions making the proxies sensitive to further shallowing. While the geographic and seasonal expression and the involved forcings and feedbacks remain to be fully resolved, in the context where the future evolution of the AMOC is poorly constrained (~0 to ~50% reduction by 2100 CE
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>

  <span class="sup">
