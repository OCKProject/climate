      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pollen-based reconstructions for 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> and 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> are presented in Fig. 
         <a>3</a>. After a noisy interval during the pioneer vegetation of Zones I–II, the 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> curves (Fig. 
         <a>3a</a>) show two distinct warm stages. The individual reconstructions peak at ca. 2–3 °C
         above present during Zones III and V, with highest 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> recorded during the early part of Zone V. The Tunturi event (Zone IV) is clearly
         seen, with an extremely rapid onset and gradual, stepwise recovery. The peak cooling
         of the Tunturi event (mean 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> during the largest dip at 23.33–23.37 m vs. mean 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> during preceding warm interval (Zone III)) varies between methods at 2.3–3.5 °C,
         with a mean magnitude of 2.7 °C. During Zone VI a gradual decrease starts in 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub>. This temperature decline is further interrupted by the Värriö event, where the abrupt
         onset represents a distinct fall in the median 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> reconstruction during the otherwise stable warm interval following the Tunturi event.
         During the initial sharp cooling peak (17.37–17.39 m) the individual reconstructions
         show a temperature fall of 0.7–2.7 °C compared to the preceding half-metre interval,
         with a mean magnitude of 1.8 °C, followed by a recovery to near pre-event temperatures.
         Zone VII sees a return to pre-interglacial 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> values.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> reconstruction (Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>) shows a muted variability for Zones I–IV but generally parallels the major features
         of the 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> reconstruction. However in Zones V–VI, 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> takes a distinct, opposite trend compared to 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub>, with all but one reconstruction showing a gradual rise in 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> by ca. 5 °C and ending at 2–3 °C above present.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modern pollen analogue distances for fossil pollen samples are short for the warm
         stages of the Eemian, being similar or lower compared to the mean distance for Late
         Holocene samples (Fig. 
         <a>3c</a>). This suggests a robust reconstruction with small errors due to non-analogue palaeoclimate
         or climate–vegetation disequilibrium. The lack of wetland elements in the microfossil
         record, and the general scarcity of macrofossils, suggest that the coring site was
         situated in the central part of a lake. This is likely to help the pollen-based reconstruction
         as there is little non-climatic noise caused by local azonal vegetation, and the sequence
         rather samples the atmospherically mixed pollen of regional vegetation. Thus strong
         pollen analogues are found in the lake-based modern calibration data. However, the
         pollen analogue distances increase during the Early-Eemian pioneer vegetation stage
         and during the abrupt events characterised by rapid species turnover. This is reflected
         as noise and poor between method robustness in reconstructed temperature within these
         depth intervals.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The geographic locations of the modern pollen analogues are plotted in Fig. 
         <a>3d</a>. For Zones I–II, characterised by semi-open pioneer 
         <span>Betula</span> vegetation (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>) and generally large analogue distances (Fig. 
         <a>3c</a>), the best modern analogues are found from various sectors of the modern forest–tundra
         ecotone of NE Europe. During the first warm stage (Zone III), best analogues are located
         in north-central Finland, south of Sokli, while a distinct shift towards northwest
         occurs during the Tunturi event (zone IV). Zone V reveals a shift in the analogue
         locations from south-central Finland to the southwest, which continues during zone
         VI when the best analogues end up in central Sweden. This parallels the trend towards
         warmer winters reconstructed with most methods (Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In significance testing using a redundancy analysis permutation test
         <span><a>27</a></span> (see Methods for details), the 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> reconstruction is significant (
         <span>p</span> = 0.001), while for the 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> reconstruction a significant result (
         <span>p</span> = 0.011) is yielded for pollen Zones V and VI. This covers the long and stable 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> increase across the upper ~60% of the sequence, but leaves out the relatively noisy
         
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> reconstruction from Zones I–IV (Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>), possibly biased by the poor modern pollen analogues (Fig. 
         <a>3c</a>).
