         site located between boreholes Sokli A/B-series and 900/901 from the central part
         of the Sokli basin and 902/905 from the basin margin
         <span><a>21</a>,
            <a>22</a></span>. Additionally, several samples from core 901 were re-analysed for pollen
         <span><a>21</a></span>. The latter core records the final birch phase that is missing (truncated) at the
         site of borehole Sokli 2010/4.
