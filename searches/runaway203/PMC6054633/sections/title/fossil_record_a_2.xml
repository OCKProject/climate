    <p>Fossil data (pollen, spores, stomata, non-pollen palynomorphs, and plant macrofossils) from the Eemian sequence at Sokli. The end of the Eemian is recorded in a parallel core, shown on top. The parallel core is shown with 3× exaggeration of the depth scale. Abrupt climate events are indicated with coloured bars (yellow = Tunturi event, pink = Värriö event). Lithology is from ref.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Zones I (28.41–25.17 m) and II (25.17–24.65 m), pollen percentage values of 
  <span class="italic">Betula</span> up to 80% (including 
  <span class="italic">B. pubescens/pendula</span> (downy birch/silver birch; deciduous tree) and 
  <span class="italic">B. nana</span> (dwarf birch; deciduous shrub)) indicate the presence of pioneering birch vegetation. Abundant pollen of 
  <span class="italic">Juniperus</span> and the presence of a variety of light-demanding herbs (
  <span class="italic">Artemisia</span>, Chenopodiaceae, 
  <span class="italic">Polygonum bistorta</span> type, and 
  <span class="italic">Saxifraga oppositifolia</span> type) suggest the forest remained relatively open. The sandy/silty sediments of Zone I and early Zone II are interpreted to represent a deglacial ice-lake stage. Zone III (24.65–23.40 m) saw dynamic forest development, from open pine forest (
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> pollen up to 75%) to mixed boreal forest with spruce (
  <span class="italic">Picea abies</span>) and then back to relatively open larch (
  <span class="italic">Larix</span> sp.) and pine dominated forest.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zone IV (23.40–22.51 m) corresponds with the Tunturi cooling event defined in ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. In the pollen record, the event is manifested by a sudden increase of 
  <span class="italic">B. pubsescens/pendula</span> pollen from 20 to 50%, and increased 
  <span class="italic">Juniperus</span> and lycopods, indicating the replacement of boreal forest by sub-arctic, open birch–pine forest.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The onset of Zone V (22.51–17.98 m) represents the abrupt return of mixed boreal forest with spruce and larch. 
  <span class="italic">Corylus</span> becomes near continuously recorded, with relative pollen abundances (ca. 1%) only seen in Finnish surface-lake sediments samples within the modern occurrence limits of hazel
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>, suggesting local presence. The sparse pollen of 
  <span class="italic">Quercus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Ulmus</span> were most probably long-distance transported. 
  <span class="italic">Pinus</span> pollen reaches maximum values (ca. 75%) about halfway through the zone, followed by a gradual decline at the expense of spruce. In Zone VI (17.98–15.98 m and 20.60–20.47 m in parallel core) the forest composition remains generally similar, however with gradual increases in Poaceae and Cyperaceae pollen, and overall increased values for 
  <span class="italic">B. pubsescens/pendula</span>, indicating the start of the Late-Eemian climatic cooling. Noteworthy about Zone VI are the numerous finds of both pollen and stomata of 
  <span class="italic">Larix</span> indicating its local presence. Larch is absent from modern-day Finland, with nearest natural occurrences of 
  <span class="italic">L. sibirica</span> found at the shores of the White Sea in NW Russia
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. In Zone VII (20.47–20.38 m in parallel core), the boreal forest is replaced by birch forest in response to continued cooling.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between depths 17.40–17.05 m, i.e., within Zone VI, shifts are recorded in the examined proxies. This abrupt cooling and drying event is here defined the Värriö event. This event has a relatively muted signal in the terrestrial pollen record, however the initial peak (two samples at 17.37–17.39 m) is seen as a sharp minimum in total tree pollen, with the ratio of arboreal to non-arboreal pollen (mean = 2.9) below the lowest value reached during the Tunturi event (4.8) indicating the opening of tree cover, while a maximum in 
  <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> suggests the extension of the wetland zone. A more distinct and longer lasting signal for the Värriö event is found in the aquatic proxy record (see Discussion).
