      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pollen samples were prepared from 1 cm
         <span>3</span> subsamples, using HCl, KOH, sieving (212 µm mesh), Na-pyrophosphate, acetolysis,
         and bromoform heavy-liquid treatments, and mounted in glycerol. 
         <span>Eucalyptus</span> markers were added to estimate absolute pollen concentrations. A mean of 401 (min = 220.5,
         max = 526) terrestrial pollen and spore grains were counted from each sample. Pollen
         percentages were calculated from the sum of all terrestrial pollen and spores. Conifer
         stomata, charcoal, marker grains, and non-pollen palynomorphs were also counted from
         the pollen slides. A total of 217 pollen samples were counted, mostly at 4 or 6 cm
         intervals but going down to 2 cm in sections with rapid species turnover, providing
         a generally sub-centennial resolution across the Eemian.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A pollen zonation was calculated with a multivariate regression tree
         <span><a>55</a></span>, implemented using the 
         <span>mvpart</span> library
         <span><a>56</a></span> (version 1.6-1) for R. Fossil assemblages for terrestrial pollen and spores were
         used as multivariate response and core depth as the sole predictor. The tree size
         was determined by cross-validation, using the smallest tree within one standard error
         of the best tree.

         ca. 5 cm
         <span>3</span>. The sediment was sieved using a 100 µm mesh under running water and the residue
         examined using stereo and high-magnification light microscopes.
