      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key fossil proxy data from the Sokli Eemian sequence, including pollen and spores,
         stomata, non-pollen palynomorphs, and plant macrofossils, are summarised in Fig. 
         <a>2</a>. The fossil sequence is divided into seven local pollen zones using a multivariate
         regression tree (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>3</a>).

               <p>Fossil data (pollen, spores, stomata, non-pollen palynomorphs, and plant macrofossils)
                  from the Eemian sequence at Sokli. The end of the Eemian is recorded in a parallel
                  core, shown on top. The parallel core is shown with 3× exaggeration of the depth scale.
                  Abrupt climate events are indicated with coloured bars (yellow = Tunturi event, pink = Värriö
                  event). Lithology is from ref.
                  <span><a>16</a></span>. Selected taxa are shown. The full pollen and macrofossil data and the multivariate
                  regression tree defining the pollen zonation are shown in Supplementary Figs.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Zones I (28.41–25.17 m) and II (25.17–24.65 m), pollen percentage values of 
         <span>Betula</span> up to 80% (including 
         <span>B. pubescens/pendula</span> (downy birch/silver birch; deciduous tree) and 
         <span>B. nana</span> (dwarf birch; deciduous shrub)) indicate the presence of pioneering birch vegetation.
         Abundant pollen of 
         <span>Juniperus</span> and the presence of a variety of light-demanding herbs (
         <span>Artemisia</span>, Chenopodiaceae, 
         <span>Polygonum bistorta</span> type, and 
         <span>Saxifraga oppositifolia</span> type) suggest the forest remained relatively open. The sandy/silty sediments of Zone
         I and early Zone II are interpreted to represent a deglacial ice-lake stage. Zone
         III (24.65–23.40 m) saw dynamic forest development, from open pine forest (
         <span>Pinus</span> pollen up to 75%) to mixed boreal forest with spruce (
         <span>Picea abies</span>) and then back to relatively open larch (
         <span>Larix</span> sp.) and pine dominated forest.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zone IV (23.40–22.51 m) corresponds with the Tunturi cooling event defined in ref.
         <span><a>16</a></span>. In the pollen record, the event is manifested by a sudden increase of 
         <span>B. pubsescens/pendula</span> pollen from 20 to 50%, and increased 
         <span>Juniperus</span> and lycopods, indicating the replacement of boreal forest by sub-arctic, open birch–pine
         forest.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The onset of Zone V (22.51–17.98 m) represents the abrupt return of mixed boreal forest
         with spruce and larch. 
         <span>Corylus</span> becomes near continuously recorded, with relative pollen abundances (ca. 1%) only
         seen in Finnish surface-lake sediments samples within the modern occurrence limits
         of hazel
         <span><a>25</a></span>, suggesting local presence. The sparse pollen of 
         <span>Quercus</span> and 
         <span>Ulmus</span> were most probably long-distance transported. 
         <span>Pinus</span> pollen reaches maximum values (ca. 75%) about halfway through the zone, followed
         by a gradual decline at the expense of spruce. In Zone VI (17.98–15.98 m and 20.60–20.47 m
         in parallel core) the forest composition remains generally similar, however with gradual
         increases in Poaceae and Cyperaceae pollen, and overall increased values for 
         <span>B. pubsescens/pendula</span>, indicating the start of the Late-Eemian climatic cooling. Noteworthy about Zone
         VI are the numerous finds of both pollen and stomata of 
         <span>Larix</span> indicating its local presence. Larch is absent from modern-day Finland, with nearest
         natural occurrences of 
         <span>L. sibirica</span> found at the shores of the White Sea in NW Russia
         <span><a>26</a></span>. In Zone VII (20.47–20.38 m in parallel core), the boreal forest is replaced by birch
         forest in response to continued cooling.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between depths 17.40–17.05 m, i.e., within Zone VI, shifts are recorded in the examined
         proxies. This abrupt cooling and drying event is here defined the Värriö event. This
         event has a relatively muted signal in the terrestrial pollen record, however the
         initial peak (two samples at 17.37–17.39 m) is seen as a sharp minimum in total tree
         pollen, with the ratio of arboreal to non-arboreal pollen (mean = 2.9) below the lowest
         value reached during the Tunturi event (4.8) indicating the opening of tree cover,
         while a maximum in 
         <span>Sphagnum</span> suggests the extension of the wetland zone. A more distinct and longer lasting signal
         for the Värriö event is found in the aquatic proxy record (see Discussion).
