      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use an age of 130.9 ± 1 ka (2σ) for the onset of the Eemian based on correlation
         to the base of an abrupt warming event recorded in speleothem δ
         <span>18</span>O records from the Northern Alps (SCH-5 and HÖL-10; Fig. 
         <a>4i</a>)
         <span><a>28</a></span>. This event is inferred to represent the initiation of the interglacial in the Alps,
         where interglacial conditions were established at latest by ~130 ka
         <span><a>28</a></span>. This age is earlier than the start of the last interglacial when inferred from an
         abrupt intensification of the Asian Monsoon recorded by speleothem δ
         <span>18</span>O records from Sanbao Cave in China
         <span><a>57</a></span> and linked to the North Atlantic warming following the Heinrich Event 11, but coincides,
         within the chronological uncertainties, with a smaller monsoon intensification event
         <span><a>28</a></span>. Although there will always remain ambiguities in such event-stratigraphic correlations,
         we have chosen to use the event in the Alpine speleothem records as the starting point
         for the Eemian in Sokli. This correlation is supported by recent U/Th dating of a
         stalagmite from the Korallgrottan (Coral Cave) in northern Sweden, indicating deglaciation
         of central parts of the northern Fennoscandian Ice Sheet and onset of stalagmite growth
         by 130.17 ± 0.66 ka (Fig. 
         <a>4i</a>) (Personal communication: Frank, N. Institute of Environmental Physics, Heidelberg,
         Germany). An early deglaciation of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet is also inferred from
         a speleothem record from the Okshola cave in Northern Norway
         <span><a>58</a></span>. The latter record is, however, dated by alpha-spectrometry having a comparatively
         low chronological precision. We argue that the Sokli site became deglaciated earlier
         than the Korallgrottan site during the penultimate deglaciation, by analogy to the
         last deglaciation when the Sokli site is estimated to have become ice free about 1 ka
         before the Korallgrottan
         <span><a>59</a>,
            <a>60</a></span>. Based on this phasing and the dating from Korallgrottan, we analogously infer that
         Sokli had been deglaciated at the time of the Alpine warming starting at 130.9 ka.
         We therefore use this date for the transition into the Eemian at Sokli.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the end of the Eemian we use an age of 117.5 ± 0.5 ka (2σ), based on U/Th dating
         of several speleothem records from Belgium indicating establishment of cold and dry
         conditions, suggesting end of interglacial conditions in Northern Europe (Han-9; Fig. 
         <a>4i</a>)
         <span><a>29</a>,
            <a>30</a></span>. Similarly, a major 3% drop in calcite δ
         <span>18</span>O recorded in a speleothem record from Entrische Kirche cave in Austria
         <span><a>46</a></span> indicates a decline in temperatures along with other climatic changes at ca. 118 ka
         (TKS; Fig. 
         <a>4i</a>). This abrupt cooling is, however, not as prominent in other Alpine speleothem δ
         <span>18</span>O records
         <span><a>28</a></span>. A concurrent end of interglacial temperatures in the high latitude North Atlantic
         region is further suggested by δ
         <span>18</span>O data from the NGRIP and NEEM ice cores
         <span><a>31</a>,
            <a>32</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>4f</a>) that has been linked to a shift in the ocean circulation interpreted from proxy
         records in a core (MD99-2289) from the eastern Norwegian Sea
         <span><a>33</a></span>. Here, the arrival of ice rafted tephra from Jan Mayen and an abrupt drop in the
         sediment calcium content suggest that the strong Eemian inflow of Atlantic Water via
         the Norwegian Atlantic Current came to an end, and that the eastern Norwegian Sea
         became dominated by Arctic Water. This event may also correlate with a first ice-rafted
         detritus pulse recorded at the Eirik Drift south of Greenland
         <span><a>18</a></span>. With glacial-like climatic conditions thus established in the eastern Norwegian
         Sea
         <span><a>33</a></span>, we find it very unlikely that warmer than present summer temperatures would have
         prevailed in Northern Fennoscandia. Earlier work on Sokli
         <span><a>16</a></span> used a tentative Eemian chronology based on alignment of the pollen-based 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> curve with a SST record from the Norwegian Sea
         <span><a>7</a></span>. However with the availability of local absolute dating for Northern Fennoscandian
         deglaciation, this chronology is revised here.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Sokli sequence, the beginning of forest development at the base of pollen Zone
         II marks the onset of interglacial conditions, while the decline is placed where the
         boreal forest is replaced by birch forest at the base of pollen Zone VII (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). We thus assign the ages of 130.9 ± 1 ka (2σ) and 117.5 ± 0.5 ka (2σ) to the bases
         of Zones II and VII, respectively.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the age uncertainties within the Eemian, we model the sediment deposition
         as a Poisson process (the P_Sequence option) using Oxcal 4.3
         <span><a>61</a>–
            <a>63</a></span>. In the P_Sequence option, the parameter, 
         <span>k</span>, needs to be specified as it defines the size of each depositional event and therefore
         how variable and uncertain the sedimentation is. It is possible for Oxcal to estimate
         the 
         <span>k</span> by using the variable 
         <span>k</span> option
         <span><a>63</a></span>, however having only two age control points, this is impossible for the Eemian sequence.
         We therefore apply a 
         <span>k</span> estimated by the variable 
         <span>k</span> function from a 
         <span>14</span>C-dated lake sequence deposited in the Sokli basin during the Holocene, showing a
         moderate variation in deposition rate
         <span><a>64</a></span>. By contrast, deposition during the Eemian appears generally stable, based on the
         homogenous lithology (diatom gyttja) and the stable sediment pollen concentration
         (represented by the marker grain fraction; Fig. 
         <a>2</a>) which during a period of consistent vegetation structure (boreal forest) suggests
         a stable sedimentation rate. We therefore regard the age uncertainty estimates of
         the Eemian Sokli record as conservative. The chronological errors suggested by the
         age–depth model (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>4</a>) are largest in the Mid Eemian, increasing with distance from the tie points, reaching
         2σ values of ~1500 a.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The silty ice-lake beds below tie point 1 likely represent a shorter time interval
         than suggested by a linear extrapolation. Following the later MIS 2 and MIS 4 glaciations
         at Sokli, the durations of glacio-lacustrine sedimentation are estimated at less than
         100 years
         <span><a>65</a>,
            <a>66</a></span> and up to ca. 400 years
         <span><a>64</a>,
            <a>67</a></span>. Based on these analogues, we show the glacio-lacustrine section (Zone I) as representing
         250 years in Fig. 
         <a>4</a>. In the age–depth modelling the parallel core covering the end of the Eemian is assumed
         a continuous extension of the main sequence. Some hiatus or overlap is likely, however,
         there is no clear indication of either in the microfossil content. The assumed continuity
         is supported by the pollen zonation, which finds no zone boundary at the base of the
         parallel core, but Zone VI runs from the main sequence into the parallel core.
