  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Zones I (28.41–25.17 m) and II (25.17–24.65 m), pollen percentage values of 
   <span class="italic">Betula</span> up to 80% (including 
   <span class="italic">B. pubescens/pendula</span> (downy birch/silver birch; deciduous tree) and 
   <span class="italic">B. nana</span> (dwarf birch; deciduous shrub)) indicate the presence of pioneering birch vegetation. Abundant pollen of 
   <span class="italic">Juniperus</span> and the presence of a variety of light-demanding herbs (
   <span class="italic">Artemisia</span>, Chenopodiaceae, 
   <span class="italic">Polygonum bistorta</span> type, and 
   <span class="italic">Saxifraga oppositifolia</span> type) suggest the forest remained relatively open. The sandy/silty sediments of Zone I and early Zone II are interpreted to represent a deglacial ice-lake stage. Zone III (24.65–23.40 m) saw dynamic forest development, from open pine forest (
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span> pollen up to 75%) to mixed boreal forest with spruce (
   <span class="italic">Picea abies</span>) and then back to relatively open larch (
   <span class="italic">Larix</span> sp.) and pine dominated forest.
  </p>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zone IV (23.40–22.51 m) corresponds with the Tunturi cooling event defined in ref.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
   </span>. In the pollen record, the event is manifested by a sudden increase of 
   <span class="italic">B. pubsescens/pendula</span> pollen from 20 to 50%, and increased 
   <span class="italic">Juniperus</span> and lycopods, indicating the replacement of boreal forest by sub-arctic, open birch–pine forest.
  </p>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The onset of Zone V (22.51–17.98 m) represents the abrupt return of mixed boreal forest with spruce and larch. 
   <span class="italic">Corylus</span> becomes near continuously recorded, with relative pollen abundances (ca. 1%) only seen in Finnish surface-lake sediments samples within the modern occurrence limits of hazel
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span>, suggesting local presence. The sparse pollen of 
   <span class="italic">Quercus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Ulmus</span> were most probably long-distance transported. 
   <span class="italic">Pinus</span> pollen reaches maximum values (ca. 75%) about halfway through the zone, followed by a gradual decline at the expense of spruce. In Zone VI (17.98–15.98 m and 20.60–20.47 m in parallel core) the forest composition remains generally similar, however with gradual increases in Poaceae and Cyperaceae pollen, and overall increased values for 
   <span class="italic">B. pubsescens/pendula</span>, indicating the start of the Late-Eemian climatic cooling. Noteworthy about Zone VI are the numerous finds of both pollen and stomata of 
   <span class="italic">Larix</span> indicating its local presence. Larch is absent from modern-day Finland, with nearest natural occurrences of 
   <span class="italic">L. sibirica</span> found at the shores of the White Sea in NW Russia
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
   </span>. In Zone VII (20.47–20.38 m in parallel core), the boreal forest is replaced by birch forest in response to continued cooling.
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between depths 17.40–17.05 m, i.e., within Zone VI, shifts are recorded in the examined proxies. This abrupt cooling and drying event is here defined the Värriö event. This event has a relatively muted signal in the terrestrial pollen record, however the initial peak (two samples at 17.37–17.39 m) is seen as a sharp minimum in total tree pollen, with the ratio of arboreal to non-arboreal pollen (mean = 2.9) below the lowest value reached during the Tunturi event (4.8) indicating the opening of tree cover, while a maximum in 
   <span class="italic">Sphagnum</span> suggests the extension of the wetland zone. A more distinct and longer lasting signal for the Värriö event is found in the aquatic proxy record (see Discussion).

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modern pollen analogue distances for fossil pollen samples are short for the warm stages of the Eemian, being similar or lower compared to the mean distance for Late Holocene samples (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). This suggests a robust reconstruction with small errors due to non-analogue palaeoclimate or climate–vegetation disequilibrium. The lack of wetland elements in the microfossil record, and the general scarcity of macrofossils, suggest that the coring site was situated in the central part of a lake. This is likely to help the pollen-based reconstruction as there is little non-climatic noise caused by local azonal vegetation, and the sequence rather samples the atmospherically mixed pollen of regional vegetation. Thus strong pollen analogues are found in the lake-based modern calibration data. However, the pollen analogue distances increase during the Early-Eemian pioneer vegetation stage and during the abrupt events characterised by rapid species turnover. This is reflected as noise and poor between method robustness in reconstructed temperature within these depth intervals.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The geographic locations of the modern pollen analogues are plotted in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>. For Zones I–II, characterised by semi-open pioneer 
   <span class="italic">Betula</span> vegetation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and generally large analogue distances (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>), the best modern analogues are found from various sectors of the modern forest–tundra ecotone of NE Europe. During the first warm stage (Zone III), best analogues are located in north-central Finland, south of Sokli, while a distinct shift towards northwest occurs during the Tunturi event (zone IV). Zone V reveals a shift in the analogue locations from south-central Finland to the southwest, which continues during zone VI when the best analogues end up in central Sweden. This parallels the trend towards warmer winters reconstructed with most methods (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>).
