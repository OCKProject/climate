  <span class="sup">3</span> subsamples, using HCl, KOH, sieving (212 µm mesh), Na-pyrophosphate, acetolysis, and bromoform heavy-liquid treatments, and mounted in glycerol. 
  <span class="italic">Eucalyptus</span> markers were added to estimate absolute pollen concentrations. A mean of 401 (min = 220.5, max = 526) terrestrial pollen and spore grains were counted from each sample. Pollen percentages were calculated from the sum of all terrestrial pollen and spores. Conifer stomata, charcoal, marker grains, and non-pollen palynomorphs were also counted from the pollen slides. A total of 217 pollen samples were counted, mostly at 4 or 6 cm intervals but going down to 2 cm in sections with rapid species turnover, providing a generally sub-centennial resolution across the Eemian.
