         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> and 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> were prepared for the fossil pollen samples using all terrestrial pollen and spore
         taxa. An ensemble of pollen–climate calibration models (Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a>) were used, including regression tree-based machine-learning approaches (boosted
         regression tree (BRT), random forest (RF)), unimodal multivariate transfer functions
         (weighted averaging (WA), weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS), maximum
         likelihood response surfaces (MLRC)), and the matching of fossil samples with most
         similar modern samples (modern-analogue technique (MAT)). The calibration models were
         built on a set of 807 surface pollen samples from Europe, with modern climate data
         extracted for each sample. The climate reconstructions were extensively validated,
         including calibration model cross-validations (Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a>), analysis of the quality of modern analogues found for the fossil pollen samples
         (Fig. 
         <a>3c</a>), analysis of model structure and comparison against ecological knowledge (Supplementary
         Tables 
         <a>2</a> and 
         <a>3</a>), testing the statistical significance of the palaeo-reconstructions, and validation
         against palaeoclimate inferences from independent aquatic proxy data. For a full description
         of the reconstruction method, see Supplementary Methods.
