      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Eemian (also Last Interglacial, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e; ca. 129–116 thousand
         years (ka) ago) is of special interest as the most recent case of widespread climatic
         warming in the geological record. Marine sediment records suggest that the Eemian
         was characterised by an average global annual sea surface temperature of +0.5 ± 0.3 °C
         above preindustrial levels
         <span><a>1</a></span> and by summer surface warming of up to 4–5 °C above Arctic lands
         <span><a>2</a></span>. Also, the Eemian global sea level was an estimated 6–9 m above present, associated
         with reduced ice sheets in Greenland and possibly in western Antarctica
         <span><a>3</a></span>. The Eemian is an imperfect analogue for anthropogenic global warming as the climate
         forcing was different, with only minor changes in total greenhouse-gas forcing compared
         to preindustrial
         <span><a>4</a></span> but some of the strongest anomalies in orbital forcing in the past 1 million years
         <span><a>5</a></span>. However, despite the different forcing, the resultant latitudinal temperature distribution
         of the Eemian appears to have been similar to projected warming under an optimistic
         scenario for greenhouse gas emissions
         <span><a>6</a></span>. The Eemian thus provides a valuable opportunity to explore the response of the global
         environment (e.g., biosphere, cryosphere, sea level) to climate warming relative to
         preindustrial
         <span><a>3</a>,
            <a>7</a></span> and to constrain the role of individual feedbacks
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>8</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite decades of work on the Eemian, existing climate syntheses continue to be hampered
         by fragmented data. This is especially true for land areas where the available temperature
         proxy data are strongly concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes (ca.
         30–60 °N)
         <span><a>9</a>–
            <a>12</a></span>. In the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes (60–90 °N), the lack of data is due to
         widespread glacial erosion during the last Ice Age, compounded by poor dating control
         on the highly fragmented sedimentary record
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>11</a>,
            <a>13</a></span>. Data from the northern high latitudes are especially important, as observations
         and modelling of modern climate change, as well as data on past warm climate stages,
         suggest that the Arctic can take a highly distinct trajectory during climatic warming.
         Typically, the modelled and observed Arctic warming is strongly amplified compared
         to the Northern Hemisphere average, due to a suite of high-latitude feedbacks involving
         the cryosphere, vegetation, surface hydrology, and oceanic circulation
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>14</a></span>. Moreover, recent studies on proxy datasets from the North Atlantic Ocean and the
         North-European continent have revealed surprising complexities in the evolution of
         Eemian climate and environment. These new findings include abrupt shifts in climate
         and oceanic circulation
         <span><a>7</a>,
            <a>15</a>–
            <a>20</a></span> and asynchronous hemispheric surface temperature changes
         <span><a>7</a>,
            <a>8</a></span>. However, due to paucity of high-resolution datasets, the geographic expression and
         causes of these events remain elusive
         <span><a>15</a>,
            <a>16</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we present a high-resolution (sub-centennial) palaeoclimate reconstruction for
         the Eemian from northern Finland utilising a pollen and plant macrofossil record.
         At the Sokli site, a local bedrock anomaly has allowed the preservation of a long
         and continuous sedimentary sequence spanning the last glacial cycle
         <span><a>11</a>,
            <a>21</a>,
            <a>22</a></span> and the entire Eemian
         <span><a>16</a></span>, despite the location in the central part of northern European continental glaciations
         (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>), providing a benchmark record of Eemian climatic evolution in the high-latitude
         land areas. The Eemian sequence at Sokli has earlier been the focus of multi-proxy
         studies (including pollen, diatoms, and chironomids) on a Mid-Eemian cooling event
         <span><a>16</a></span>, as well as limnology and geochemistry
         <span><a>23</a>,
            <a>24</a></span>. Here we present quantitative reconstructions of July, as well as January mean air
         temperature (
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub>, 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub>) in the Eemian, using an ensemble of pollen–climate calibration models including
         classical and machine-learning approaches. The chronological constraints are improved
         by new northern European speleothem datings. Our aim is to resolve the long-term seasonal
         evolution, as well as possible abrupt changes of Eemian climate in the European high
         latitudes. Our climate reconstructions provide a robust record of repeated Eemian
         abrupt events, and reveal a complex interplay of insolation and marine forcings and
         ice-sheet dynamics.
