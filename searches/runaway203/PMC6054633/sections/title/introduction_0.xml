 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Eemian (also Last Interglacial, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e; ca. 129–116 thousand years (ka) ago) is of special interest as the most recent case of widespread climatic warming in the geological record. Marine sediment records suggest that the Eemian was characterised by an average global annual sea surface temperature of +0.5 ± 0.3 °C above preindustrial levels
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span> and by summer surface warming of up to 4–5 °C above Arctic lands
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Also, the Eemian global sea level was an estimated 6–9 m above present, associated with reduced ice sheets in Greenland and possibly in western Antarctica
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. The Eemian is an imperfect analogue for anthropogenic global warming as the climate forcing was different, with only minor changes in total greenhouse-gas forcing compared to preindustrial
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span> but some of the strongest anomalies in orbital forcing in the past 1 million years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. However, despite the different forcing, the resultant latitudinal temperature distribution of the Eemian appears to have been similar to projected warming under an optimistic scenario for greenhouse gas emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. The Eemian thus provides a valuable opportunity to explore the response of the global environment (e.g., biosphere, cryosphere, sea level) to climate warming relative to preindustrial

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span> and to constrain the role of individual feedbacks

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite decades of work on the Eemian, existing climate syntheses continue to be hampered by fragmented data. This is especially true for land areas where the available temperature proxy data are strongly concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes (ca. 30–60 °N)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. In the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes (60–90 °N), the lack of data is due to widespread glacial erosion during the last Ice Age, compounded by poor dating control on the highly fragmented sedimentary record
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Data from the northern high latitudes are especially important, as observations and modelling of modern climate change, as well as data on past warm climate stages, suggest that the Arctic can take a highly distinct trajectory during climatic warming. Typically, the modelled and observed Arctic warming is strongly amplified compared to the Northern Hemisphere average, due to a suite of high-latitude feedbacks involving the cryosphere, vegetation, surface hydrology, and oceanic circulation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. Moreover, recent studies on proxy datasets from the North Atlantic Ocean and the North-European continent have revealed surprising complexities in the evolution of Eemian climate and environment. These new findings include abrupt shifts in climate and oceanic circulation

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> and asynchronous hemispheric surface temperature changes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. However, due to paucity of high-resolution datasets, the geographic expression and causes of these events remain elusive

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we present a high-resolution (sub-centennial) palaeoclimate reconstruction for the Eemian from northern Finland utilising a pollen and plant macrofossil record. At the Sokli site, a local bedrock anomaly has allowed the preservation of a long and continuous sedimentary sequence spanning the last glacial cycle

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), providing a benchmark record of Eemian climatic evolution in the high-latitude land areas. The Eemian sequence at Sokli has earlier been the focus of multi-proxy studies (including pollen, diatoms, and chironomids) on a Mid-Eemian cooling event
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>

  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>jul</sub>, 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>jan</sub>) in the Eemian, using an ensemble of pollen–climate calibration models including classical and machine-learning approaches. The chronological constraints are improved by new northern European speleothem datings. Our aim is to resolve the long-term seasonal evolution, as well as possible abrupt changes of Eemian climate in the European high latitudes. Our climate reconstructions provide a robust record of repeated Eemian abrupt events, and reveal a complex interplay of insolation and marine forcings and ice-sheet dynamics.
