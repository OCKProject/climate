  <sub>jan</sub> were prepared for the fossil pollen samples using all terrestrial pollen and spore taxa. An ensemble of pollen–climate calibration models (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) were used, including regression tree-based machine-learning approaches (boosted regression tree (BRT), random forest (RF)), unimodal multivariate transfer functions (weighted averaging (WA), weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS), maximum likelihood response surfaces (MLRC)), and the matching of fossil samples with most similar modern samples (modern-analogue technique (MAT)). The calibration models were built on a set of 807 surface pollen samples from Europe, with modern climate data extracted for each sample. The climate reconstructions were extensively validated, including calibration model cross-validations (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), analysis of the quality of modern analogues found for the fossil pollen samples (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>), analysis of model structure and comparison against ecological knowledge (Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>), testing the statistical significance of the palaeo-reconstructions, and validation against palaeoclimate inferences from independent aquatic proxy data. For a full description of the reconstruction method, see Supplementary Methods.
