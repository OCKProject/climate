      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Sokli basin in north-east Finland (67°48′ N 29°18′ E, 220 m a.s.l.) is one of
         the few terrestrial sites in northern Europe where Eemian sediments have been found
         preserved in a stratigraphic sequence, with overlying glacial till beds and non-glacial
         sediments of Weichselian age. The Sokli sequence has escaped major glacial erosion
         due to non-typical bedrock conditions. The Eemian diatom gyttja deposit at Sokli stretches
         as a marker horizon near the base of the unconsolidated sediment infill. Its interglacial
         pollen content was first noted in the 1970s and was correlated with the Eemian. Detailed
         stratigraphic studies on the overlying Weichselian sediment sequence, combined with
         absolute dating control, have supported the Eemian age assignment
