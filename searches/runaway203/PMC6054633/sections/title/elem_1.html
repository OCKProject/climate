         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Zones I (28.41–25.17 m) and II (25.17–24.65 m), pollen percentage values of 
            <span>Betula</span> up to 80% (including 
            <span>B. pubescens/pendula</span> (downy birch/silver birch; deciduous tree) and 
            <span>B. nana</span> (dwarf birch; deciduous shrub)) indicate the presence of pioneering birch vegetation.
            Abundant pollen of 
            <span>Juniperus</span> and the presence of a variety of light-demanding herbs (
            <span>Artemisia</span>, Chenopodiaceae, 
            <span>Polygonum bistorta</span> type, and 
            <span>Saxifraga oppositifolia</span> type) suggest the forest remained relatively open. The sandy/silty sediments of Zone
            I and early Zone II are interpreted to represent a deglacial ice-lake stage. Zone
            III (24.65–23.40 m) saw dynamic forest development, from open pine forest (
            <span>Pinus</span> pollen up to 75%) to mixed boreal forest with spruce (
            <span>Picea abies</span>) and then back to relatively open larch (
            <span>Larix</span> sp.) and pine dominated forest.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zone IV (23.40–22.51 m) corresponds with the Tunturi cooling event defined in ref.
            <span><a>16</a></span>. In the pollen record, the event is manifested by a sudden increase of 
            <span>B. pubsescens/pendula</span> pollen from 20 to 50%, and increased 
            <span>Juniperus</span> and lycopods, indicating the replacement of boreal forest by sub-arctic, open birch–pine
            forest.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The onset of Zone V (22.51–17.98 m) represents the abrupt return of mixed boreal forest

            of hazel
            <span><a>25</a></span>, suggesting local presence. The sparse pollen of 
            <span>Quercus</span> and 
            <span>Ulmus</span> were most probably long-distance transported. 
            <span>Pinus</span> pollen reaches maximum values (ca. 75%) about halfway through the zone, followed
            by a gradual decline at the expense of spruce. In Zone VI (17.98–15.98 m and 20.60–20.47 m
            in parallel core) the forest composition remains generally similar, however with gradual
            increases in Poaceae and Cyperaceae pollen, and overall increased values for 
            <span>B. pubsescens/pendula</span>, indicating the start of the Late-Eemian climatic cooling. Noteworthy about Zone
            VI are the numerous finds of both pollen and stomata of 
            <span>Larix</span> indicating its local presence. Larch is absent from modern-day Finland, with nearest
            natural occurrences of 
            <span>L. sibirica</span> found at the shores of the White Sea in NW Russia
            <span><a>26</a></span>. In Zone VII (20.47–20.38 m in parallel core), the boreal forest is replaced by birch
            forest in response to continued cooling.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between depths 17.40–17.05 m, i.e., within Zone VI, shifts are recorded in the examined
            proxies. This abrupt cooling and drying event is here defined the Värriö event. This
            event has a relatively muted signal in the terrestrial pollen record, however the
            initial peak (two samples at 17.37–17.39 m) is seen as a sharp minimum in total tree
            pollen, with the ratio of arboreal to non-arboreal pollen (mean = 2.9) below the lowest
            value reached during the Tunturi event (4.8) indicating the opening of tree cover,
            while a maximum in 
            <span>Sphagnum</span> suggests the extension of the wetland zone. A more distinct and longer lasting signal
            for the Värriö event is found in the aquatic proxy record (see Discussion).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modern pollen analogue distances for fossil pollen samples are short for the warm
            stages of the Eemian, being similar or lower compared to the mean distance for Late
            Holocene samples (Fig. 
            <a>3c</a>). This suggests a robust reconstruction with small errors due to non-analogue palaeoclimate
            or climate–vegetation disequilibrium. The lack of wetland elements in the microfossil
            record, and the general scarcity of macrofossils, suggest that the coring site was
            situated in the central part of a lake. This is likely to help the pollen-based reconstruction
            as there is little non-climatic noise caused by local azonal vegetation, and the sequence
            rather samples the atmospherically mixed pollen of regional vegetation. Thus strong
            pollen analogues are found in the lake-based modern calibration data. However, the
            pollen analogue distances increase during the Early-Eemian pioneer vegetation stage
            and during the abrupt events characterised by rapid species turnover. This is reflected
            as noise and poor between method robustness in reconstructed temperature within these
            depth intervals.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The geographic locations of the modern pollen analogues are plotted in Fig. 
            <a>3d</a>. For Zones I–II, characterised by semi-open pioneer 
            <span>Betula</span> vegetation (Fig. 
            <a>2</a>) and generally large analogue distances (Fig. 
            <a>3c</a>), the best modern analogues are found from various sectors of the modern forest–tundra
            ecotone of NE Europe. During the first warm stage (Zone III), best analogues are located
            in north-central Finland, south of Sokli, while a distinct shift towards northwest
            occurs during the Tunturi event (zone IV). Zone V reveals a shift in the analogue
            locations from south-central Finland to the southwest, which continues during zone
            VI when the best analogues end up in central Sweden. This parallels the trend towards
            warmer winters reconstructed with most methods (Fig.
