   <span class="bold">d</span> Geographic locations of best modern analogues found for each fossil pollen sample. Fossil samples use symbols based on their pollen zone, and are positioned at the mean latitude and longitude (weighted by the analogue quality) of the five most compositionally similar modern pollen samples. For clarity, only fossil samples with relatively good modern analogues are shown (compositional distance to best modern analogue less than 2× the mean analogue distance found for Late-Holocene samples; see panel
