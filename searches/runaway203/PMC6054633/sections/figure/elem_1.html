         <p>Fossil data (pollen, spores, stomata, non-pollen palynomorphs, and plant macrofossils)
            from the Eemian sequence at Sokli. The end of the Eemian is recorded in a parallel
            core, shown on top. The parallel core is shown with 3× exaggeration of the depth scale.
            Abrupt climate events are indicated with coloured bars (yellow = Tunturi event, pink = Värriö
            event). Lithology is from ref.
            <span><a>16</a></span>. Selected taxa are shown. The full pollen and macrofossil data and the multivariate
            regression tree defining the pollen zonation are shown in Supplementary Figs.
