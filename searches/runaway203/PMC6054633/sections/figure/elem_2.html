         <p>Climate reconstruction based on the Eemian pollen data from Sokli. Reconstructions
            are prepared for (
            <span>a</span>) 
            <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> and (
            <span>b</span>) 
            <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub>, using six different pollen–climate calibration models (see Methods for details),
            and summarised as a median of all six reconstructions (black curve). Abrupt climate
            events are indicated with coloured bars. The parallel core covering the end of the
            Eemian is shown with 3× exaggeration of the depth scale. 
            <span>c</span> Analogue quality (squared chord distance
            <span><a>68</a></span>) between each fossil pollen sample and the best matching modern pollen calibration
            sample. The dashed line indicates the mean analogue quality found for Late-Holocene
            samples from a nearby lake core
            <span><a>69</a></span>. 
            <span>d</span> Geographic locations of best modern analogues found for each fossil pollen sample.
            Fossil samples use symbols based on their pollen zone, and are positioned at the mean
            latitude and longitude (weighted by the analogue quality) of the five most compositionally
            similar modern pollen samples. For clarity, only fossil samples with relatively good
            modern analogues are shown (compositional distance to best modern analogue less than
            2× the mean analogue distance found for Late-Holocene samples; see panel 
            <span>c</span>). Locations of the available modern samples and the Sokli fossil site are also indicated
