         <p>Sokli data compared against other proxy and forcing time series. The coloured bars
            indicate intervals of cool climate at Sokli (solid bars) and their suggested counterparts
            in other datasets (hatched bars).

            <span>b</span> Reconstructions for 
            <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> and 
            <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> based on the Sokli pollen sequence. The reconstructions are expressed as the multi-method
            median curves (grey curve) with local regression (LOESS; span 0.03, one robustifying
            iteration) smoothers (red and blue curves) fitted. Black arrows indicate the tie points
            of the absolute chronology used for Sokli. December and June insolation at 60°N
            <span><a>5</a></span> are also shown (orange curves).

            <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> and 
            <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> from the European mid-latitudes. Reconstructions are shown based on the Gröbern (Germany)
            fossil sequence
            <span><a>41</a></span> and for Amsterdam (Netherlands) interpolated from Eemian palaeo-isotherms reconstructed
            based on fossil data from multiple sites (adapted from ref.
            <span><a>50</a></span>). The time scales used are floating chronologies based on estimated pollen zone durations
            <span><a>41</a></span>, shown here anchored at 129 ka. Pollen zones are shown for Central Germany
            <span><a>41</a></span>. 
            <span>i</span> Speleothem stable isotope data underlying the chronology for Sokli, including δ

            <span><a>28</a></span> and the TKS series from the Entrische Kirche cave in the Eastern Alps

            <span><a>29</a></span>. The cross and an error bar indicate the age and associated 2σ uncertainty for the
            onset of speleothem growth at Korallgrottan, northern Sweden
