      <p>The Eemian (the Last Interglacial; ca. 129â€“116 thousand years ago) presents a testbed
         for assessing environmental responses and climate feedbacks under warmer-than-present
         boundary conditions. However, climate syntheses for the Eemian remain hampered by
         lack of data from the high-latitude land areas, masking the climate response and feedbacks
         in the Arctic. Here we present a high-resolution (sub-centennial) record of Eemian
         palaeoclimate from northern Finland, with multi-model reconstructions for July and
         January air temperature. In contrast with the mid-latitudes of Europe, our data show
         decoupled seasonal trends with falling July and rising January temperatures over the
         Eemian, due to orbital and oceanic forcings. This leads to an oceanic Late-Eemian
         climate, consistent with an earlier hypothesis of glacial inception in Europe. The
         interglacial is further intersected by two strong cooling and drying events. These
         abrupt events parallel shifts in marine proxy data, linked to disturbances in the
         North Atlantic oceanic circulation regime.
