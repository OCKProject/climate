 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under a no-dispersal assumption (i.e., assuming that species will not be able to shift their distributions), areas of highest projected climate-driven changes in species richness are located in South America and on New Guinea (reaching potential losses of up to 150 species) (

  </span>). Areas with potential losses of between 20 and 70 species are scattered across all continents. The two emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP6.0) are similar regarding the geographical patterns of potential richness change. However, changes are projected to become more pronounced under the high-emission scenario (RCP 6.0). Under a basic dispersal assumption (

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, 
   <span class="italic">SI Materials and Methods</span>
  </span>), changes in projected species richness become less severe in some regions, and species richness is even projected to increase at high latitudes or altitudes (

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S2 and S3
  </span>). Nevertheless, with few exceptions, the geographical patterns of projected species losses are similar between the two dispersal assumptions. While there was considerable variation among the changes in species richness projected by different species distribution model (SDM) algorithms and global climate models (GCMs), the areas of high potential change in species richness showed comparatively high levels of model agreement (

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S6
  </span>), mainly due to differences in the extent of bioenergy cropland. While under RCP2.6 the percentage cover of bioenergy cropland increases strongly, the projected increase in bioenergy cropland is negligible under RCP 6.0 (see

Barcharts to the left and to the top indicate the change in projected species richness per latitudinal and longitudinal band of 0.5°, separated for the three different vertebrate taxa. Change in species richness was calculated as the difference between 1995 and 2080 in stacked probabilities of occurrence obtained from climate-based SDMs and averaged across two model types and four different GCMs. For a basic dispersal scenario, see

The individual colors indicate the different threats (BC, bioenergy cropland; CC, climate change; CR, nonbioenergy cropland; PA, pastures) and the overlap between each of the threats (see Venn diagram for the color code). Results are shown individually for the three taxa and the two emission scenarios. The map shows the distribution of the threats that are defined for each variable as the (global) top quartile of cells with the highest mean change across RCPs, model types, and GCMs for climate change threat and the top quartile of cells with the highest mean change across RCPs and GCMs for land-use change threat (see

For the bar chart, threat areas were identified individually for each of the eight model types × GCM combinations for climate change threat and for each of the four GCMs for land-use change threat; the bar chart columns show the mean across these eight (four) combinations, with error bars indicating the SDs.
