 <div class="caption">
  <p>Mean number of species and the proportion of their distribution which is projected to become affected by climate and/or land-use threat under the two emission scenarios for 2080, assuming no dispersal. Species ranges can be affected by four different threats (BC, bioenergy cropland; CC, climate; CR, nonbioenergy cropland; PA, pastures) or a combination of multiple threats. Results are based on an ensemble mean across the two model types and the four GCMs for the projected climate change impacts, as well as an ensemble mean across the four GCMs for the projected land-use change impacts.</p>
