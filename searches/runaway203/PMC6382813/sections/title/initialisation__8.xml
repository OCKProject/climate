 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simulations are performed in a time-slice experiment where the model is initialised and then run until it reaches equilibrium. Each simulation is initialised with the conditions of the present climate. The polar surface temperature is set to 10 °C and the equatorial temperature to 28 °C. The conditions being tested cannot maintain such a high surface temperature, and so the system evolves to a new, colder state. The state that the system ends up in primarily depends on the tested value of methane. Simulations are run for a total of 400 years to give the climate enough time to evolve to its new state. But, this time is not sufficient to produce ice sheets of substantial depth to rival the height of the mountain range or reach the stage where the ice would flow a substantial distance due to gravity (which could not be modeled in FOAM anyway). Thirty-day mean values are output from the model 12 times each model year. These data describe the monthly-mean state of the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere (ice and snow) for that year.</p>
