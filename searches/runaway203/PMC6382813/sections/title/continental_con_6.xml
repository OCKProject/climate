  </span>. A box containing the entire supercontinent occupies about 15% of Earth’s total surface area. To replicate this, a rectangular continent (on a latitude–longitude map projection) centred on the equator that is 15.6% of the total surface area is used in this experiment. This continent extends from 56°N to 56°S, and has a west–east width of 68° longitude. The continent surface type is set to desert rock, which has an albedo of 24%
