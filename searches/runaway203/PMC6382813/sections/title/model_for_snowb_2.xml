 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The multiple phases of glaciation that occurred in the PaleoProterozoic have been attributed to changes in the atmospheric composition

  </span>. Our results show that even in the absence of changes in atmospheric composition, changes in the latitudes of mountains (or more precisely, the albedo) is sufficient to change the Earth from a nonSnowball state to a Snowball state. We propose that one or both of two mechanisms may have explained the glaciations observed in the geological record during the PaleoProterozoic. Continental drift of the supercontinent may move mountain ranges from one climate zone to another

  </span>, leading to a change in climate state, or new orogenies by continent–continent collisions may produce new mountains at latitudes leading to a change in Earth’s climate state. Specifically, raising a mountain in lower latitudes in an unglaciated state may cause ice to form more easily, leading to a glaciation. What is surprising is that such an extreme climate of an Earth covered in ice could occur by relatively small and subtle changes in atmospheric composition or paleotopography and paleogeography, especially for a supercontinental landmass that occupies only 15% of the Earth’s surface and extends across 68° of longitude.

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While these results show extreme sensitivity to the position of mountains and Snowball Earth formation, other results on a modern Earth show that the modern topography stabilizes the Earth against forming a Snowball-Earth state so easily
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Changes in the topography can also lead to changes in the ocean circulation, reversing the thermohaline circulation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. These results also may pertain to exoplanets where the flatter surfaces of exoplanets larger than Earth may stabilize the exoplanet against forming an ice-covered state.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, the PaleoProterozoic episodes of glaciation led to important geological and biological changes on Earth. Evidence from numerical model simulations indicates the strong sensitivity to the paleogeography and that differences of tens of ppmv of methane or of 10° latitude in the mountains can lead to the difference between a Snowball Earth or not. We propose that the multiple episodes of glaciation during the PaleoProterozoic were controlled by fluctuations in the paleotopography, paleoalbedo, carbon dioxide, and methane concentrations. As such, our results constitute testable hypotheses and further constraints on the paleoenvironments that were possible during the PaleoProterozoic.</p>
