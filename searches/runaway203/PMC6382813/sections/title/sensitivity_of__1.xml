 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our model simulations, methane concentrations less than or equal to 20 ppmv produce Snowball Earths regardless of the configuration of the mountains, and methane concentrations 300 ppmv or more produce partially ice-covered Earths (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). However, at intermediate methane concentrations of 40–100 ppmv, the latitudes of the mountain ranges affect whether a Snowball Earth forms or not. For example, mountains at ±40° and ±50° latitude and 40 ppmv of methane are sufficient to prevent a Snowball Earth compared to mountains at ±30° latitude where a Snowball Earth forms at 100 ppmv of methane. Mountain ranges in the tropics (0° to ±20°), as well as the flat supercontinent, form Snowball Earths at methane concentrations of 40–80 ppmv.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of Snowball Earth formation or not, meridional profiles of zonally averaged monthly-mean surface temperature, precipitation rate, and snowfall rate as a function of latitude evolve similarly, up until the rapid transition to a Snowball Earth occurs (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). In all cases, snow approaches the equator over time until equilibrium is reached (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e,f</a>). The maximum snowfall rate occurs at the boundary between the snow-covered and snowless latitudes, which also tends to be where the mean surface temperature is about 0 °C (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b</a>). The highest total precipitation rate is found at the Intertropical Convergence Zone (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c,d</a>), explaining why the maximum snowfall rate is at the closest latitude to the equator where snow can exist. For continents featuring mountain ranges, a smaller peak in snowfall rate appears at the latitude of the mountains. This increase in snowfall rate results in additional snow accumulating on the continent, increasing the albedo of Earth, and leading to cooling. Once in the Snowball Earth, precipitation and snowfall rates both drop due to the loss of surface moisture to feed precipitating systems (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c,e</a>).

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the mountains are at ±40° or ±50° latitude, the tropics remain above freezing, and cooling due to sea ice forming is limited to higher latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,d,f</a>), explaining why these simulations are resistant to producing Snowball Earths except when methane is 20 ppmv or less (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Also, cold air from the polar regions is inhibited from reaching the tropics by the mountains at ±40° and ±50° latitude (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). As such, the tropics stay relatively warm compared to the other simulations, and Snowball Earths are inhibited from forming, even at relatively low methane concentrations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the mountains are at ±30° (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,c,e</a>), snow falls on the mountaintops more equatorward than when the mountains are at ±40°. The snow-capped mountains reduce the temperature in the subtropics (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,e</a>), making it easier for the subtropics to cool and for snow to form at higher methane concentrations. Thus, the temperature easily drops below zero and the Snowball Earth forms more easily (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,e</a>). With mountains at even lower latitudes, greater cooling is more difficult because of the higher insolation preventing ice to form on the tropical mountaintops. Thus, Snowball Earths form at concentrations of 40–80 ppmv (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These variations are explained by the snowfall on the mountains lowering the albedo. Sea ice forms when the atmospheric temperature is below freezing. Snow falling on the continent is more likely to remain snow if the temperature is below freezing. Once ice or snow is present, the albedo is reduced, which reduces solar insolation, starting the feedback process toward Snowball Earth. The impact of this additional snow on the radiation budget of the planet depends on its proximity to the equator (i.e. location of maximum insolation), and also to the latitude that snow extends to before a runaway ice-albedo feedback occurs.</p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because temperature and snow/ice cover are intimately linked, we need a way to untangle that feedback. Thus, we perform a different set of simulations at 100 ppmv methane. At such high methane concentrations, only the simulation with mountains at ±30° produced a Snowball Earth (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). In this new set of simulations, the mountain ranges were replaced by flat terrain with an albedo of snow instead of desert rock. The goal was to see if nonSnowball Earths could be changed to Snowball Earths by reducing the albedo in crucial latitudes instead of by raising the elevation of the terrain. Therefore, we test our hypothesis of whether the albedo changes led to the Snowball Earth or whether the changed dynamics of the atmospheric circulation due to the mountains was responsible. Our results show that reducing the albedo at ±40° or ±50° latitude does not affect the likelihood of Snowball Earth formation. Those latitudes are where the mountains are already snow-capped within 100 years into the simulations. In contrast, lowering the albedo at 0°, ±10°, or ±20° latitude from the start of the simulation results in formation of a Snowball Earth. This is because the albedo reduces insolation, cooling the tropics below freezing more easily and leading to further snowfall and albedo reduction. Thus, the increase in albedo in the tropics is crucial to the formation of Snowball Earth, not the location of the mountains affecting the planetary-scale circulation or how the precipitation distribution changes. That Snowball Earths can form at such high methane concentrations merely by changing the albedo indicates the sensitivity of the Earth’s climate at this time in geologic history.
