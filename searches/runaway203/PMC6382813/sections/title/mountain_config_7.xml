 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Little information is available about the topography of this supercontinent, and so we experiment with a number of hypothetical sets of mountain ranges at various latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). They are all placed parallel to latitude lines, and the pairs are placed the same distance from the equator in each hemisphere. The mountains are approximately Gaussian in profile, have a latitudinal width of 10 grid points, which is equivalent to about 1550 m (14° latitude) at the equator, and each mountain spans the entire longitudinal dimension of the continent. The mountain dimensions are restricted by the 128 × 128 grid boxes, which limits how gradual the slope of the mountains can be, but they have a maximum height of 3000 m. A suite of model simulations varying the maximum height of the mountains using the M40 and M50 configurations showed no sensitivity to the onset of the Snowball Earth for mountain heights between 0.5 and 3.0 km. Such results are consistent with those where we vary the albedo of flat terrain at low latitudes and show that the effect of the albedo on climate is greater than the effect of the terrain on climate.
