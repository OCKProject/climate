         <p>(
            <span>a</span>) Shows the daily mean of global-mean TSI and of the global-mean surface temperature
            (gST) as a function of time for a planet around Kepler-35 AB with a orbital semimajor
            axis of 1.225 a.u. for a 700-day period in steady state. (
            <span>b</span>) Shows the same quantities but for a planet around Kepler-35 AB with an orbital semimajor
            axis of 1.195 a.u., (
            <span>d</span>) for a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u. and (
            <span>e</span>) for a semimajor axis of 1.140. (
            <span>c</span>) Sketches the Kepler-35 system with Kepler-35 A being the more luminous and Kepler-35
            B the less luminous star. Note that in this sketch we always assume the stars to be
            at the same position whereas in reality (and in our simulations) they would also orbit
            each other. The orbit of the planet evolves with time. The points in time 
            <span>t</span><sub>1</sub>, 
            <span>t</span><sub>2</sub>, 
            <span>t</span><sub>3</sub> and 
            <span>t</span><sub>4</sub> in 
            <span>d</span> correspond to the orbital times indicated in 
            <span>c</span> and link the oscillation of TSI to the associated orbital constellations. The downward
            spikes in the TSI are due to stellar eclipses.
