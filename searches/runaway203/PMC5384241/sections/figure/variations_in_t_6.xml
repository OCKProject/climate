  <div class="title">Variations in TSI and gST due to the oscillation of the eccentricity of the planetary orbit.</div>
  <p>(
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Shows the monthly mean of global-mean TSI as a function of time in the simulations with a semimajor axis of the binary orbit of 0.25â€‰a.u. for a period of 43,200 Earth-days in steady state. A month counts 30 Earth-days. The downward spikes in the TSI are caused by stellar eclipses. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Shows a time-slice of 700 Earth-days of global-mean TSI and of gST when the eccentricity of the planetary orbit and hence the variations are large and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) a time-slice of 700 Earth-days when the eccentricity is small. Note that for (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) the planet is not yet in steady state.
