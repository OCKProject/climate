      <p>The discovery of planets orbiting double stars at close distances has sparked increasing
         scientific interest in determining whether Earth-analogues can remain habitable in
         such environments and how their atmospheric dynamics is influenced by the rapidly
         changing insolation. In this work we present results of the first three-dimensional
         numerical experiments of a water-rich planet orbiting a double star. We find that
         the periodic forcing of the atmosphere has a noticeable impact on the planet's climate.
         Signatures of the forcing frequencies related to the planet's as well as to the binary's
         orbital periods are present in a variety of climate indicators such as temperature
         and precipitation, making the interpretation of potential observables challenging.
         However, for Earth-like greenhouse gas concentrations, the variable forcing does not
         change the range of insolation values allowing for habitable climates substantially.
