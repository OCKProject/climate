 <p>(
  <span class="bold">a</span>) Shows the daily mean of global-mean TSI and of the global-mean surface temperature (gST) as a function of time for a planet around Kepler-35 AB with a orbital semimajor axis of 1.225 a.u. for a 700-day period in steady state. (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) Shows the same quantities but for a planet around Kepler-35 AB with an orbital semimajor axis of 1.195 a.u., (
  <span class="bold">d</span>) for a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u. and (
  <span class="bold">e</span>) for a semimajor axis of 1.140. (
  <span class="bold">c</span>) Sketches the Kepler-35 system with Kepler-35 A being the more luminous and Kepler-35 B the less luminous star. Note that in this sketch we always assume the stars to be at the same position whereas in reality (and in our simulations) they would also orbit each other. The orbit of the planet evolves with time.
