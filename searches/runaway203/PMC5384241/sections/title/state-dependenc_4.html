      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amplitudes of the response of these quantities change with the mean climate (
         <a>Fig. 5</a>). Temperature variations are larger for both 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> in a colder climate (
         <a>Fig. 5b</a>), because of the smaller thermal inertia of ice compared to open water and because
         of the smaller thermal inertia of the atmosphere in colder and thus drier atmospheres.
         The variations in precipitation on the other hand increase with the global-mean surface
         temperature (
         <a>Fig. 5d</a>). This may be partly due to the general increase of precipitation and atmospheric
         water-vapour with increasing gST. The OLR shows a non-monotonic behaviour with the
         largest amplitudes in Moist Greenhouse and Snowball states (
         <a>Fig. 5c</a>). Understanding the variations in total precipitation and OLR is challenging. This
         becomes apparent, when comparing the amplitude of the global-mean precipitation with
         the global-mean of the amplitude of the zonal-mean precipitation (
         <a>Fig. 5d</a>). These two quantities would be identical if the lag of the maximum in precipitation
         with respect to maximum in TSI did not change with latitude. However, they differ,
         implying that the maximum in precipitation has a different lag with respect to the
         maximum in TSI at different latitudes. This suggests that the mechanisms by which
         precipitation changes due to the variations in TSI changes with latitude. A similar
         behaviour is also seen in the OLR (
         <a>Fig. 5c</a>), implying that the amplitude of global-mean quantities does not necessarily give
         a good approximation of the mean variations in single regions of a planet. Therefore,
         understanding the impact of periodic variations in TSI on the climate is crucial to
         correctly interpret observations of periodically varying quantities.
