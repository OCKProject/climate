      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We perform climate simulations of a fictitious aquaplanet orbiting the two stars of
         the Kepler-35 system with the GCM described further below. Kepler-35 was found to
         have a gas giant orbiting the two stars
         <a>1</a>. Its gravitational effect is not included in the calculations of our orbital model.
         We shall, nonetheless, refer to the simulated system as Kepler-35 for simplicity.
         The orbit-dependent TSI and the substellar points are obtained by the orbital model
         described below.
