      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Periodic variations in total solar irradiance</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Owing to changes in the distance of the planet relative to the two stars of the Kepler-35
         system, the total solar irradiance (TSI) varies with time. The changes in the TSI
         of a planet orbiting the Kepler-35 binary show a double periodic behaviour (
         <a>Fig. 1a,b,d,e</a>). For a (habitable) planet with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u., these periods are
         of around 22 and 360 Earth-days. The oscillation with a period of approximately 22
         Earth-days is caused by the rotation of the stars around the common centre of mass
         and will henceforth be denoted by 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub>. The maximum of TSI with respect to 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> is attained when the more luminous star is closest to the planet (
         <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
         <span>t</span><sub>1</sub>) and the minimum when the less luminous star is closest (
         <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
         <span>t</span><sub>3</sub>). The oscillation with a period of around 360 Earth-days is caused by the eccentricity
         of the planetary orbit and will henceforth be denoted by 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. The maximum of that oscillation is reached when the planet is closest to the centre
         of mass (
         <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
         <span>t</span><sub>2</sub>) and the minimum when the planet is at apastron (
         <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
         <span>t</span><sub>4</sub>). Note that an orbit cannot remain circular around a double star, due to angular
         momentum exchange between the stellar and planetary orbits. In nearly coplanar systems
         such as Kepler-35, solar eclipses occur in intervals of around 11 Earth-days and result
         in a brief but substantial reduction in TSI. An interesting peculiarity of this system
         is that due to the stellar parallax more than one hemisphere of the planet is illuminated
         at all times except during eclipses. A spectral analysis reveals that the amplitude
         of the oscillation of the global-mean TSI (which is equal to TSI/4) with a period
         of 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> is 18.8 W m
         <span>−2</span> and the one of 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> is 5.5 W m
         <span>−2</span> (
         <a>Fig. 2a</a>). Including the solar eclipses, the daily-mean of the global-mean TSI varies roughly
         from 300 to 370 W m
         <span>−2</span> over one orbital period (
         <a>Fig. 1d</a>) during the time-span we have considered. Owing to oscillations of planet's orbital
         eccentricity, the variations in TSI from 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> change. The climates presented here were evaluated over a 10,800-Earth-day period
         where the planet's orbital eccentricity was close to the forced eccentricity.
