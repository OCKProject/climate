  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Periodic variations in total solar irradiance</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Owing to changes in the distance of the planet relative to the two stars of the Kepler-35 system, the total solar irradiance (TSI) varies with time. The changes in the TSI of a planet orbiting the Kepler-35 binary show a double periodic behaviour (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a,b,d,e</a>). For a (habitable) planet with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u., these periods are of around 22 and 360 Earth-days. The oscillation with a period of approximately 22 Earth-days is caused by the rotation of the stars around the common centre of mass and will henceforth be denoted by 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub>. The maximum of TSI with respect to 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> is attained when the more luminous star is closest to the planet (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>, 
   <span class="italic">t</span>
   <sub>1</sub>) and the minimum when the less luminous star is closest (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>, 
   <span class="italic">t</span>
   <sub>3</sub>). The oscillation with a period of around 360 Earth-days is caused by the eccentricity of the planetary orbit and will henceforth be denoted by 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub>. The maximum of that oscillation is reached when the planet is closest to the centre of mass (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>, 
   <span class="italic">t</span>
   <sub>2</sub>) and the minimum when the planet is at apastron (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>, 
   <span class="italic">t</span>
   <sub>4</sub>). Note that an orbit cannot remain circular around a double star, due to angular momentum exchange between the stellar and planetary orbits. In nearly coplanar systems such as Kepler-35, solar eclipses occur in intervals of around 11 Earth-days and result in a brief but substantial reduction in TSI. An interesting peculiarity of this system is that due to the stellar parallax more than one hemisphere of the planet is illuminated at all times except during eclipses. A spectral analysis reveals that the amplitude of the oscillation of the global-mean TSI (which is equal to TSI/4) with a period of 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> is 18.8 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> and the one of 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub> is 5.5 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2a</a>). Including the solar eclipses, the daily-mean of the global-mean TSI varies roughly from 300 to 370 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> over one orbital period (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1d</a>) during the time-span we have considered. Owing to oscillations of planet's orbital eccentricity, the variations in TSI from 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub> change. The climates presented here were evaluated over a 10,800-Earth-day period where the planet's orbital eccentricity was close to the forced eccentricity.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How will variations in insolation affect the mean climate and habitability? The simulations suggest that a habitable climate for an Earth-like planet in the Kepler-35 system with fixed CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations (at 354 ppm volume mixing ratio) is maintained in a region close to planetary semimajor axes of between around 1.165 and 1.195 a.u. (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). The global-mean surface temperature (gST) of a planet with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u. is 291.0 K and that of a semimajor axis of 1.195 a.u. is 271.5 K. For a semimajor axis of 1.140 a.u., the planet goes into a Moist Greenhouse state, whereas a semimajor axis of 1.225 a.u. leads to a Snowball state. In terms of mean TSI we find a habitable climate between 0.954 and 1.004

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By performing simulations of the same planet on a circular orbit around our sun, we find that habitable climates can be maintained at a distance of 1.000 a.u. (1.000

   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Thus, the extent of the region for which our planet can sustain a habitable climate in Kepler-35 in terms of TSI is comparable to that in our solar system (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). However, due to the increased overall TSI, the habitability spans a somewhat larger range of planetary semimajor axes. This suggests that circumbinary systems similar to the one studied here would be good candidates to look for habitable planets. The gST is higher in the two colder states of the aquaplanet in our solar system than at similar TSI in the Kepler-35 system. The Bond albedo of the aquaplanet in our solar system is somewhat higher than that of the same aquaplanet in a similar climate state in the Kepler-35 system (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>), because of the slight red-shift of the combined spectrum of Kepler-35 AB.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find three regimes of stable steady-states of our aquaplanet: The Snowball regime, the Earth-like regime and the Moist Greenhouse regime (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>) that all have a similar temporal-mean structure of surface temperatures and of the large-scale circulation on the aquaplanet in the Kepler-35 and the aquaplanet in our solar system (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). However, when the annual cycle is considered, the imprint of the fluctuations of the TSI is clearly visible for planets around Kepler-35, especially at low surface temperatures (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find the transition to a hot uninhabitable state in the Kepler-35 slightly further away from the centre of mass of the system than a recent estimate of around 1.103 a.u. (ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a>). The maximum TSI to cause global-glaciation in our solar system with fixed CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations is in good agreement with a study performed recently with another GCM in a similar setup

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a>) and thus considerably closer to the stars than in our simulations. The LEBM lacks the vertical dimension that is necessary to represent the climate instabilities at higher temperatures. Hence, the model is neither able to produce a Runaway Greenhouse

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Annual cycle of climate indicators</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How do the variations in TSI affect the climate over one orbital period of the circumbinary planet in the Kepler-35 system? The variations in TSI affect different quantities such as the gST and the global-mean precipitation in surprisingly different ways. We choose to focus on these two quantities, as each of them shows a different behaviour. Moreover, the global-mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is interesting, because it is an observable quantity. A spectral analysis of the daily-mean gST of the habitable planet with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u. reveals the peaks at periods of 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2b</a>). However, unlike for the TSI, for the gST the amplitude of the peak at 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub> is larger with 0.08 K than the one at 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> with 0.03 K. This supports the notion that the changes in the orbit do affect the climate of circumbinary planets. A spectral analysis of the daily mean of the global-mean precipitation shows two peaks as well (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2d</a>). The amplitude of the peak at 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub> is smaller with 0.024 mm per day than the one of the peak at 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> with 0.050 mm per day. Compared to the mean precipitation, these amplitudes are small at all latitudes and thus do not substantially affect the mean climate. The global-mean OLR responds in a similar way as the global-mean precipitation to the variations in TSI, in that the peak for 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> is larger than for 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2c</a>). The amplitude of the global-mean OLR is around one order of magnitude smaller than that of the TSI for both periods, implying that the OLR only slightly buffers the variations in the energy-balance of the planet.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not only does the global-mean response to the double_periodic forcing differ for the aforementioned quantities, but also the meridional contribution of the quantities to the global-mean varies (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>). The largest amplitudes of the surface temperature are found at high latitudes, whereas in the case of the precipitation the amplitudes are largest close to the equator. The meridional distribution of surface-temperature amplitude is also different for the periods 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub>. The contribution from low-latitudes to the global-mean amplitude of surface temperature is substantially larger for 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub> than for 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub>.

 <sec disp-level="2" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">State-dependence of the magnitude of the climate response</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amplitudes of the response of these quantities change with the mean climate (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a>). Temperature variations are larger for both 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub> in a colder climate (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5b</a>), because of the smaller thermal inertia of ice compared to open water and because of the smaller thermal inertia of the atmosphere in colder and thus drier atmospheres. The variations in precipitation on the other hand increase with the global-mean surface temperature (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5d</a>). This may be partly due to the general increase of precipitation and atmospheric water-vapour with increasing gST. The OLR shows a non-monotonic behaviour with the largest amplitudes in Moist Greenhouse and Snowball states (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5c</a>). Understanding the variations in total precipitation and OLR is challenging. This becomes apparent, when comparing the amplitude of the global-mean precipitation with the global-mean of the amplitude of the zonal-mean precipitation (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5d</a>). These two quantities would be identical if the lag of the maximum in precipitation with respect to maximum in TSI did not change with latitude. However, they differ, implying that the maximum in precipitation has a different lag with respect to the maximum in TSI at different latitudes. This suggests that the mechanisms by which precipitation changes due to the variations in TSI changes with latitude. A similar behaviour is also seen in the OLR (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5c</a>), implying that the amplitude of global-mean quantities does not necessarily give a good approximation of the mean variations in single regions of a planet. Therefore, understanding the impact of periodic variations in TSI on the climate is crucial to correctly interpret observations of periodically varying quantities.
