      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How do the variations in TSI affect the climate over one orbital period of the circumbinary
         planet in the Kepler-35 system? The variations in TSI affect different quantities
         such as the gST and the global-mean precipitation in surprisingly different ways.
         We choose to focus on these two quantities, as each of them shows a different behaviour.
         Moreover, the global-mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is interesting, because
         it is an observable quantity. A spectral analysis of the daily-mean gST of the habitable
         planet with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u. reveals the peaks at periods of 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> (
         <a>Fig. 2b</a>). However, unlike for the TSI, for the gST the amplitude of the peak at 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> is larger with 0.08 K than the one at 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> with 0.03 K. This supports the notion that the changes in the orbit do affect the
         climate of circumbinary planets. A spectral analysis of the daily mean of the global-mean
         precipitation shows two peaks as well (
         <a>Fig. 2d</a>). The amplitude of the peak at 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> is smaller with 0.024 mm per day than the one of the peak at 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> with 0.050 mm per day. Compared to the mean precipitation, these amplitudes are small
         at all latitudes and thus do not substantially affect the mean climate. The global-mean
         OLR responds in a similar way as the global-mean precipitation to the variations in
         TSI, in that the peak for 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> is larger than for 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> (
         <a>Fig. 2c</a>). The amplitude of the global-mean OLR is around one order of magnitude smaller than
         that of the TSI for both periods, implying that the OLR only slightly buffers the
         variations in the energy-balance of the planet.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not only does the global-mean response to the double_periodic forcing differ for the
         aforementioned quantities, but also the meridional contribution of the quantities
         to the global-mean varies (
         <a>Fig. 4</a>). The largest amplitudes of the surface temperature are found at high latitudes,
         whereas in the case of the precipitation the amplitudes are largest close to the equator.
         The meridional distribution of surface-temperature amplitude is also different for
         the periods 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. The contribution from low-latitudes to the global-mean amplitude of surface temperature
         is substantially larger for 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> than for 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub>.
