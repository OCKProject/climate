      <p>(
         <span>a</span>) Shows the amplitude for the gST and (
         <span>b</span>) the amplitude for the global-mean precipitation as a function of period as calculated
         by the feedback model (
         <a>equation (1)</a>). The dashed patterns denote solutions for different values of the applied forcing
         and the solutions for different values of 
         <span>α</span> are coloured. Note that 
         <span>α</span><sub>M</sub> denotes the value obtained by solving the system of two equations that result from
         applying our GCM results of the simulations with a planetary semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u.
         in the Kepler-35 system for each 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> separately to 
         <a>equation (1)</a>. The subscript ‘B' denotes the binary orbital period and the subscript ‘P' the planetary
         orbital period. The parameter 
         <span>β</span> in 
         <a>equation (1)</a> is calculated separately for each value of 
         <span>α</span> such that the amplitude of the forced quantity for each value of 
         <span>α</span> is the same for a period of 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub>. As a consequence all lines with equal dash patterns intersect at 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
         <span>β</span> is inversely proportional to the amplitude of the forcing. The grey vertical lines
         denote the binary period 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and planetary period 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. The black marks denote the amplitude of the forced quantities obtained with the
         GCM for each of the periods. Note that because we calculate 
         <span>α</span><sub>M</sub> from model results, the marks for 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> must lie on the red dashed line obtained for 
         <span>α</span><sub>M</sub> and 
         <span>F</span><sub>P</sub>. (
         <span>c</span>) Shows the lag of the gST and (
         <span>d</span>) the lag of the global-mean precipitation with respect to the solar forcing as calculated
         by the feedback model (
         <a>equation (4)</a>). The different colours denote again the different values of 
         <span>α</span>. The lag calculated with 
         <a>equation (4)</a> is independent of the forcing. Note that because 
         <span>α</span> was calculated using 
         <a>equation (1)</a> the marks denoting the results from the GCM do not necessarily lie on the red line.
         The orange line is not visible on panels 
         <span>c</span> and 
         <span>d</span> as the lag for such a large value of 
         <span>α</span> is very close to zero.
