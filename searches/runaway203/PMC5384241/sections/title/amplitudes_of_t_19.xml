 <div class="title">Amplitudes of the oscillations of zonal-mean quantities.</div>
 <p>(
  <span class="bold">a</span>) Shows the amplitude of zonal-mean TSI for 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> (blue) and 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> (red) as a function of latitude, (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) the amplitude of zonal-mean surface temperature, (
  <span class="bold">c</span>) the amplitude of the zonal-mean OLR and (
  <span class="bold">d</span>) the amplitude of the zonal-mean precipitation. The temporal spectrum was taken over 10,800 Earth-days in steady state. Note that the horizontal axes are scaled with the cosine of latitude.
