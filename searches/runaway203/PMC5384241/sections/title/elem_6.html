         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We perform climate simulations of a fictitious aquaplanet orbiting the two stars of
            the Kepler-35 system with the GCM described further below. Kepler-35 was found to
            have a gas giant orbiting the two stars
            <a>1</a>. Its gravitational effect is not included in the calculations of our orbital model.
            We shall, nonetheless, refer to the simulated system as Kepler-35 for simplicity.
            The orbit-dependent TSI and the substellar points are obtained by the orbital model
            described below.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The binary star—planet configuration constitutes a hierarchical three body problem,
            see 
            <a>Fig. 1</a>. The planet's orbit tends to evolve rapidly and significantly in such systems. Yet,
            its time evolution can be modelled analytically given the following assumptions
            <a>14</a><a>43</a><a>44</a>. We assume the system to be co-planar, that is, all bodies move in the same plane
            perpendicular to the system's total angular momentum vector. The variations in the
            semimajor axes of both binary and planetary orbit are negligible, so that they shall
            be considered to remain constant, and the planet is not in mean motion resonance with
            the binary. Furthermore, we assume that the eccentricity vector of the binary star
            evolves due to perturbations of the outer body and General Relativity. The planet
            is started on an initially circular orbit, but the orbit will evolve with time to
            account for the gravitational perturbations of the binary following the prescriptions
            in ref. 
            <a>14</a>. Starting the planet on a circular orbit generally produces a more excited state
            of the planet's eccentricity evolution with larger amplitudes variations compared
            to using the so-called ‘forced eccentricity'. (In linear secular theory, the planet's
            eccentricity vector is a composite of a forced component—the binary's immutable contribution
            to the planet's eccentricity—as well as a free component that represents the planets
            proper initial conditions. For a detailed discussion see, for instance ref. 
            <a>45</a>.) However, it is still unclear whether circumbinary planets actually form close to
            the relaxed dynamical state, that is, with the forced eccentricity or whether migration,
            resonances, as well as interaction with other protoplanets and/or the disc can excite
            the free eccentricity of planets
            <a>46</a><a>47</a>. Hence, we have chosen zero initial eccentricity for the planet, in order to be able
            to compare our results with those of a single star single planet system on a circular
            orbit—the model that is predominantly used to determine the habitability of planets
            <a>16</a><a>19</a>.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We employ a modified version of the atmospheric GCM ECHAM6 (ref. 
            <a>48</a>) that has been described in detail in ref. 
            <a>13</a>. Therefore, we will just summarize the general features of the model setup and explain
            how the orbital model is incorporated into the GCM. We run the model with a spectral
            truncation of T31, which corresponds to a Gaussian grid with a grid-point spacing
            of 3.75°. The atmosphere is resolved vertically by 47 layers up to a pressure (of
            dry air) of 0.01 hPa. The atmosphere is coupled to a slab ocean of 50 m depth and
            the oceanic heat transport is prescribed by a sinusoidal function of latitude. Unlike
            in the simulations performed in ref. 
            <a>13</a> the formation of sea ice is enabled and the direct effect of aerosol on radiation
            turned off in our simulations. The model uses a full hydrological cycle including
            representations of surface exchange, turbulence and vertical diffusion
            <a>49</a><a>50</a>, convection
            <a>51</a><a>52</a>, cloud cover
            <a>53</a> and cloud microphysics
            <a>54</a>. These schemes were adjusted for better representation of the relevant physical processes
            at high temperatures as described in refs 
            <a>15</a>, 
            <a>25</a>. Thus the model can run to surface temperatures of up to 350 K.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The orbital model provides the black-body stellar spectra corresponding to the effective
            temperatures of the stars, as well as the longitude and latitude of the substellar
            point for each star. The solar spectra are divided and integrated over the 14 bands
            required by the short-wave radiative transfer scheme
            <a>55</a><a>56</a>. We employ a modified version of the original radiative-transfer scheme described
            and evaluated in ref. 
            <a>25</a>. The shortwave radiative transfer is then performed for each star separately. The
            zenith angle of each star is also taken into account separately for the surface albedo
            and for calculating the radiative heating. Stellar eclipses from the point of view
            of the planet are taken into account as well.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have considered several initial starting positions for the planet at distances
            of 1.140, 1.165, 1.195 and 1.225 a.u. from the binary stars' centre of mass. The masses
            and properties of the binary system are taken from the Supplementary Table 1 in ref.
            
            <a>1</a> (

            orbit was increased from 0.176 to 0.250 a.u. for a planetary semimajor axis of 1.175 a.u.
            Two additional simulations were performed in which the spectra of the stars were replaced
            by the spectrum of our sun. The semimajor axis of the planet in these simulations
            was set to be 1.165 and 1.195 a.u. respectively. Four additional simulations were
            performed to assess the region where the same aquaplanet could maintain habitable
            states with a perfectly circular orbit around our sun. The semimajor axis of the planet
            in these simulations was set to be 0.975, 1.000, 1.025 and 1.050 a.u. respectively.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assume here that the aquaplanet becomes uninhabitable if either a transition into
            a Snowball or a transition to a Moist Greenhouse occurs.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a Snowball state the planet's surface is fully ice-covered. Snowball states are
            a harsh environment for life, but may well be habitable. In that sense, a transition
            to a Snowball may not render a planet completely uninhabitable. The minimum required
            forcing to keep a planet from falling into a Snowball state depends on the amount
            of atmospheric greenhouse gases such as CO
            <sub>2</sub>. In our simulations we use, however, fixed atmospheric greenhouse concentrations
            (except for water vapour) and, therefore, the transition to a Snowball state may occur
            at different TSI for different atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moist Greenhouse states are characterized by an upper atmosphere that is sufficiently
            moist for the planet to lose its entire water inventory to space in its lifetime as
            a consequence of the photo-dissociation of water and the subsequent escape of hydrogen
            to space. A planet in this state would not be uninhabitable immediately, but would
            eventually become so by losing all of its water to space. Since the humidity increases
            in the upper atmosphere with gST and thus with increasing TSI, the Moist-Greenhouse
            limit, at which rapid water-loss occurs, can be considered as the transition from
            a habitable to an eventually uninhabitable planet. Recent studies have shown that
            the minimum TSI required to cause a transition to a Moist Greenhouse depends also
            on CO
            <sub>2</sub>-concentrations
            <a>13</a><a>57</a><a>58</a>. Previous studies suggest that a planet orbiting a sun-like star would lose the equivalent
            of one Earth ocean, if the mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere exceeds 0.1–0.3% (refs
            
            <a>15</a>, 
            <a>16</a>). The time required for a planet to lose the equivalent of one Earth ocean depends
            on the type of star and therefore the required atmospheric mixing ratio may be different
            for Kepler-35. However, the upper atmospheric mixing ratio of water vapour increases
            very fast with surface temperatures in our model once values of the order of 0.1%
            are attained. Therefore, we choose an upper-atmospheric mixing ratio of 0.3% as the
            Moist Greenhouse limit, as this should not lead to a substantial error in the TSI
            required for our planet to become uninhabitable.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we assume planets to be habitable, if the surface is at least partially
            covered by liquid water and if the upper atmospheric water vapour concentration does
            not exceed the Moist Greenhouse limit.
