         <span>a</span>) Shows the temporal spectrum of the global-mean TSI, (
         <span>b</span>) the temporal spectrum of gST, (
         <span>c</span>) the temporal spectrum of the global-mean OLR and (
         <span>d</span>) the temporal spectrum of the global-mean precipitation of the simulation with a
         semimajor axis of the planetary orbit around Kepler-35 AB of 1.165â€‰a.u. The horizontal
         axes denote the period in days and 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> indicates the period of the binary orbit as seen from the planet and 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> the period of the planetary orbit. The temporal spectrum was taken over 10,800 Earth-days
         in steady state.
