      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assume here that the aquaplanet becomes uninhabitable if either a transition into
         a Snowball or a transition to a Moist Greenhouse occurs.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a Snowball state the planet's surface is fully ice-covered. Snowball states are
         a harsh environment for life, but may well be habitable. In that sense, a transition
         to a Snowball may not render a planet completely uninhabitable. The minimum required
         forcing to keep a planet from falling into a Snowball state depends on the amount
         of atmospheric greenhouse gases such as CO
         <sub>2</sub>. In our simulations we use, however, fixed atmospheric greenhouse concentrations
         (except for water vapour) and, therefore, the transition to a Snowball state may occur
         at different TSI for different atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moist Greenhouse states are characterized by an upper atmosphere that is sufficiently
         moist for the planet to lose its entire water inventory to space in its lifetime as
         a consequence of the photo-dissociation of water and the subsequent escape of hydrogen
         to space. A planet in this state would not be uninhabitable immediately, but would
         eventually become so by losing all of its water to space. Since the humidity increases
         in the upper atmosphere with gST and thus with increasing TSI, the Moist-Greenhouse
         limit, at which rapid water-loss occurs, can be considered as the transition from
         a habitable to an eventually uninhabitable planet. Recent studies have shown that
         the minimum TSI required to cause a transition to a Moist Greenhouse depends also
         on CO
         <sub>2</sub>-concentrations
         <a>13</a><a>57</a><a>58</a>. Previous studies suggest that a planet orbiting a sun-like star would lose the equivalent
         of one Earth ocean, if the mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere exceeds 0.1â€“0.3% (refs
         
         <a>15</a>, 
         <a>16</a>). The time required for a planet to lose the equivalent of one Earth ocean depends
         on the type of star and therefore the required atmospheric mixing ratio may be different
         for Kepler-35. However, the upper atmospheric mixing ratio of water vapour increases
         very fast with surface temperatures in our model once values of the order of 0.1%
         are attained. Therefore, we choose an upper-atmospheric mixing ratio of 0.3% as the
         Moist Greenhouse limit, as this should not lead to a substantial error in the TSI
         required for our planet to become uninhabitable.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we assume planets to be habitable, if the surface is at least partially
         covered by liquid water and if the upper atmospheric water vapour concentration does
         not exceed the Moist Greenhouse limit.
