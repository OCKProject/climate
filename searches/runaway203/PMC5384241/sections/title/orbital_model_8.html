      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The binary star—planet configuration constitutes a hierarchical three body problem,
         see 
         <a>Fig. 1</a>. The planet's orbit tends to evolve rapidly and significantly in such systems. Yet,
         its time evolution can be modelled analytically given the following assumptions
         <a>14</a><a>43</a><a>44</a>. We assume the system to be co-planar, that is, all bodies move in the same plane
         perpendicular to the system's total angular momentum vector. The variations in the
         semimajor axes of both binary and planetary orbit are negligible, so that they shall
         be considered to remain constant, and the planet is not in mean motion resonance with
         the binary. Furthermore, we assume that the eccentricity vector of the binary star
         evolves due to perturbations of the outer body and General Relativity. The planet
         is started on an initially circular orbit, but the orbit will evolve with time to
         account for the gravitational perturbations of the binary following the prescriptions
         in ref. 
         <a>14</a>. Starting the planet on a circular orbit generally produces a more excited state
         of the planet's eccentricity evolution with larger amplitudes variations compared
         to using the so-called ‘forced eccentricity'. (In linear secular theory, the planet's
         eccentricity vector is a composite of a forced component—the binary's immutable contribution
         to the planet's eccentricity—as well as a free component that represents the planets
         proper initial conditions. For a detailed discussion see, for instance ref. 
         <a>45</a>.) However, it is still unclear whether circumbinary planets actually form close to
         the relaxed dynamical state, that is, with the forced eccentricity or whether migration,
         resonances, as well as interaction with other protoplanets and/or the disc can excite
         the free eccentricity of planets
         <a>46</a><a>47</a>. Hence, we have chosen zero initial eccentricity for the planet, in order to be able
         to compare our results with those of a single star single planet system on a circular
         orbit—the model that is predominantly used to determine the habitability of planets
         <a>16</a><a>19</a>.
