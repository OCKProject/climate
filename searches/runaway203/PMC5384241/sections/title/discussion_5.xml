 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to capture the different responses of the gST, the global-mean precipitation and the OLR, we introduce a simple analytic model which can qualitatively explain our results, at least in the same reference climate. We then use the model as a basis to discuss more complex aspects of the climate response to periodic forcings. Similar types of models have been used to describe thermally heated slab-oceans

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How can we understand the influence of 
  <span class="italic">ω</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">k</span>
  </sub> and 
  <span class="italic">α</span> on the amplitude and lag of the solution? The parameter 
  <span class="italic">α</span> describes how strongly the system restores to a steady state from a forcing. If 
  <span class="italic">α</span> is very large, a small change in the forced quantity suffices to restore the imbalance caused by a forcing (
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq2" href="#eq2">equation (2)</a>) and the response will not lag the forcing substantially, because the system quickly readjusts. If 
  <span class="italic">α</span> on the other hand is zero, the system does not restore to a steady state by itself, but only maintains a steady state, because the forcing is zero on average over one period in a steady state. In this case the amplitude only depends on the time it takes for the system to change sign and on the forcing amplitude. Since the time elapsed between the forcing reaching the maximum and the forcing changing sign is exactly a quarter forcing period, the lag in this case will also be a quarter period. The amplitude of the forced quantity decreases with 
  <span class="italic">ω</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">k</span>
  </sub> and hence increases with the forcing period, because the system has more time to readjust to the forcing through feedback mechanisms. The lag of the forced quantity decreases with 
  <span class="italic">ω</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">k</span>
  </sub>, because an oscillation of longer period takes more time to complete one period.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our particular case, the two considered modes are 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub>. For our planet in the Kepler-35 system, the forcing 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">k</span>
  </sub> is, for instance, the change in global-mean TSI. For our planet with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u., the forcing from 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> has a larger amplitude but shorter period than 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub>. Since the amplitude of the response increases both with amplitude and period of the forcing (
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq2" href="#eq2">equation (2)</a>), the amplitude of the response can be larger for either of the two modes, depending on the two parameters 
  <span class="italic">α</span> and 
  <span class="italic">β</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6a,b</a>). If 
  <span class="italic">α</span> is large compared to the frequencies in the considered range of frequencies, 
  <span class="italic">L</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">k</span>
  </sub> depends only weakly on the frequency (
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1" href="#eq1">equation (1)</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6a,b</a>). If in contrast 
  <span class="italic">α</span> is small compared to frequencies in the considered range, then 
  <span class="italic">L</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">k</span>
  </sub> depends strongly on the frequency. If the gST is taken as 
  <span class="italic">L</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">k</span>
  </sub>, our results suggest 
  <span class="italic">α</span> (=2.61 × 10
  <span class="sup">−2</span> day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) to be on the order of magnitude of the frequency corresponding to 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6a</a>). Since the frequency corresponding to 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> is 16 times as large as that corresponding to 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub>, 
  <span class="italic">α</span> is small in our case. Therefore, the dependence of the gST on the frequency is strong. This explains why the amplitude of gST is larger for 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub>. If we identify 
  <span class="italic">L</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">k</span>
  </sub> with the global-mean precipitations then 
  <span class="italic">α</span> (=2.31 × 10
  <span class="sup">−1</span> day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) is of the order magnitude of the frequency corresponding to 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6b</a>) and 
  <span class="italic">α</span> is large in our range of frequencies. In this case the dependence of 
  <span class="italic">L</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">k</span>
  </sub> on frequency is weaker than for the gST and even though 
  <span class="italic">β</span> is smaller than in the case of the gST, the amplitude of the global-mean precipitation is larger for the shorter period associated to 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to illustrate how changes in magnitude and period of the forcing influence the response of the aforementioned quantities, we performed an additional simulation in which the semimajor axis of the binary orbit is increased from 0.176 to 0.250 a.u. As a consequence, both the period and the amplitude of the forcing from 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> increase. Since the planet then would have a higher mean TSI, we moved the planet to a semimajor axis of 1.175 a.u., such that the mean TSI is approximately 1.0 
  <span class="italic">S</span>
  <sub>0</sub> (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). The increase of the semimajor axis of the binary leads to an increased oscillation of the eccentricity of the planetary orbit with a period of around 100 (Earth-) years (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f7" href="#f7">Fig. 7</a>). This causes substantial changes in the forcing coming from 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub>, with an amplitude of around 4 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> in the 10,800-day average when the eccentricity is small (approximately 0.01), to around 15 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> when the eccentricity is large (approximately 0.023) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a>). When the eccentricity is small, the amplitude of gST, precipitation and OLR from 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> is similar or smaller than in the simulations with a semimajor axis of the binary of 0.176 a.u. In particular, 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> increases relative to 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub>. When the eccentricity is large, the amplitude of gST, precipitation and OLR from 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> are all considerably larger (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a>). In the temporal average over a 100-year period (not shown), the amplitude of gST from 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> is still larger than that from 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub>, but the difference is considerably smaller than for a semimajor axis of the binary of 0.176 a.u. Hence, the influence of 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> on the climate relative to 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> is increasing with increasing semimajor axis of the binary. Since both the period and the amplitude of TSI from 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> increase, this is in agreement with 
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq2" href="#eq2">equation (2)</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feedback-model works well to explain how the amplitude of different forced quantities behave, but the model becomes inaccurate when quantitative predictions are required for various reasons. The linear feedback parameter 
  <span class="italic">α</span>, for instance, can depend on time. This is indeed the case in our simulations as is easily illustrated when calculating the lag of the solution for the gST using 
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq4" href="#eq4">equation (4)</a>. By applying our 3D-model results for each 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> separately to 
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1" href="#eq1">equation (1)</a>, we can solve the resulting system of two equations for 
  <span class="italic">α</span>. The Feedback-model overestimates the lag for 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> and underestimates the lag for 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6c</a>) for our habitable planet, when gST is the forced quantity. This suggests that 
  <span class="italic">α</span> and thus the response of the gST depends on the time scale and hence on the period of the forcing and that 
  <span class="italic">α</span> is decreasing with the period in our particular case. Several studies of present-day and future climate change suggest indeed that the feedback parameter is time dependent in transient simulations
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. Our 
  <span class="italic">α</span> with respect to gST is comparable to the climate feedback parameter divided by the specific heat-capacity and by one minus the Bond albedo in climate change experiments, and thus corresponds to the adjustment time-scale of the climate. The feedback parameter is commonly evaluated in climate change experiments by making a linear regression to the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative imbalance as a function of the change in surface temperature, once the model has run into the new steady state. The linear regression can, however, be performed over shorter time periods and that may yield temporally variable feedback parameters. In the first months after a forcing is applied, the feedback parameter and thus 
  <span class="italic">α</span> are known to change due to fast adjustments
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. In fact, the feedback parameter decreases in most climate models that took part in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>). Therefore, 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> with only 22 days is likely too short to justify the assumption that 
  <span class="italic">α</span> is constant. With roughly 360 days, 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> is more likely to be in a regime in which 
  <span class="italic">α</span> changes little. Note that calculating the precipitation lag from the simple model presented in 
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq4" href="#eq4">equation (4)</a> seems to provide even less reliable results for 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6d</a>) than the gST lag, since the phase shift exceeds a quarter of the corresponding period. This indicates that either 
  <span class="italic">β</span> is negative or that the precipitation does not directly depend on TSI.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variations in gST are substantially larger over ice covered surfaces. Ice has only around half the specific heat capacity of liquid water, and since both 
  <span class="italic">α</span> and 
  <span class="italic">β</span> are inversely proportional to the heat capacity, the amplitude according to our analytical model increases with decreasing heat capacity. This difference in thermal inertia between ice-covered and water-covered surfaces also explains why the contribution from low-latitudes to the amplitude of gST is much larger for 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> than for 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub>: 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> is simply too short to cause a change in the surface-temperature of water. The slower response of the open water areas due to the larger thermal inertia of liquid water compared to ice is even further amplified by the larger amount of water vapour in the atmosphere in warmer climates. The atmospheric water vapour increases the thermal inertia of the atmosphere through storage of latent-heat in the atmosphere and by reducing the clear-sky cooling to space through its greenhouse effect. Furthermore, areas of open water are more efficient at mitigating radiative imbalances at the surface through changes in the latent-heat flux. At longer time-scales, the smaller Planck- and lapse-rate-feedbacks at lower surface temperature may also contribute to larger amplitudes in gST over ice-covered areas, as has been found in present-day Earth climate-change simulations
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate of a planet in the Kepler-35 system tends to be cooler than the one in our own solar system in cold states. This could be due to the difference in albedo caused by the different spectra of the solar irradiation in the two systems. To test this hypothesis, we perform two more simulations of the planet in the Kepler-35 system with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u. and with a semimajor axis of 1.195 a.u. of the planetary orbit, but replace the spectral distribution of the two stars by that of our sun. This means that the planet experiences the variations in TSI due to 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>B</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub>, but the solar spectra correspond to that of our own sun. We find no substantial change in gST (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>) in the simulation with 1.165 a.u. and a slight warming in the simulation with 1.195 a.u. However, the gST for the circumbinary planet with 1.195 a.u. is still lower than for an Earth-like planet with comparable but slightly lower TSI in our solar system. Therefore, the cooler climate in the Kepler-35 system must be at least partly due to different processes. We hypothesize here that one of the causes for the cooling is the fact that the black-body emission increases faster than linearly. If we assume two planets with the same average temperature (and no atmosphere to start with), but only one experiencing oscillations in gST, the planet with the oscillation in gST will emit more thermal radiation than the one without oscillations and, therefore, cool. If our hypothesis is true, this could more strongly affect cold states, because the temperature variations are large and because the direct contribution of the surface to the OLR is large. This is indeed seen in our simulations. In warm states on the other hand the oscillations in surface temperature should have a much smaller influence on the OLR, because of the larger opacity of the denser atmosphere, which also appears to be consistent with our results. However, in the warmer climates, feedback mechanisms are more complex and a deeper study of these mechanisms is necessary.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Periodic variations in TSI can have a variety of causes that do not necessarily require multiple stars. The most studied case is the effect of the 11-year solar cycle on present-day Earth. Owing to the relatively small magnitude of the solar cycle amplitude (around 0.6 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>), modelling studies suggest that the effects are relatively small, but still clearly visible even at the surface owing to the relatively long period
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>. As in our case, surface-responses tend to be lagged owing to the thermal inertia of the oceans. Another common case in which planets receive periodically changing amounts of sunlight is non-zero orbital eccentricity in single-star systems. Increased eccentricity was shown to tend to warm Earth-like planets with present-day Earth rotation as both an effect of increased annual-mean insolation
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a> and changes in insolation for fixed annual mean solar insolation
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>. For tidally locked planets, increasing the eccentricity can warm or cool the planet depending on several factors
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>, suggesting a complex climate response to the variable insolation. As in our study, the climate response in these studies is complex and the full extent of the climate response to periodic forcing on Earth-like planets is still to be understood.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conclude, using a state-of-the-art GCM we have demonstrated that the habitable climates of an Earth-like planet with present-day-Earth CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations in the binary-star system Kepler-35 are confined to a region around a distance of 1.165–1.195 a.u. with respect to the centre of gravity of the system. Although this is situated beyond the Earth's current orbit around the sun, its extent is similar to what we would expect for the same planet in our solar system. Periodic variations of TSI caused by the changing orbit of a planet around the two stars and by the orbit of the stars around the common centre of mass have a variety of impacts on the variations of the climate, but lead only to relatively small changes in the mean climate. The magnitude of the climate response does not only depend on the amplitude of the TSI, but also on the efficacy of the forcing in influencing the considered quantity, on the feedback parameter of that quantity and on the period of the forcing. For similar mean TSI, the magnitude of the impact of the variations of TSI will increase with the semimajor axis of the binary system, as both the amplitude and the period of the TSI grow. We have furthermore demonstrated that the linear feedback parameter is most likely time dependent. The global-mean of the amplitude of a zonal-mean quantity, such as precipitation or OLR, can be substantially larger than the amplitude of the global-mean quantity, implying that observers at a distance may have difficulties in estimating the variability of said quantities accurately. This means that, even-though double-star systems similar to the one studied here seem to be good candidates for habitable planets, the interpretation of observations of such planets is bound to be challenging. A detailed understanding of the underlying climate dynamics will be crucial for a correct interpretation of observations.
