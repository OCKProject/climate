  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>P</sub> in a colder climate (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5b</a>), because of the smaller thermal inertia of ice compared to open water and because of the smaller thermal inertia of the atmosphere in colder and thus drier atmospheres. The variations in precipitation on the other hand increase with the global-mean surface temperature (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5d</a>). This may be partly due to the general increase of precipitation and atmospheric water-vapour with increasing gST. The OLR shows a non-monotonic behaviour with the largest amplitudes in Moist Greenhouse and Snowball states (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5c</a>). Understanding the variations in total precipitation and OLR is challenging. This becomes apparent, when comparing the amplitude of the global-mean precipitation with the global-mean of the amplitude of the zonal-mean precipitation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5d</a>). These two quantities would be identical if the lag of the maximum in precipitation with respect to maximum in TSI did not change with latitude. However, they differ, implying that the maximum in precipitation has a different lag with respect to the maximum in TSI at different latitudes. This suggests that the mechanisms by which precipitation changes due to the variations in TSI changes with latitude. A similar behaviour is also seen in the OLR (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5c</a>), implying that the amplitude of global-mean quantities does not necessarily give a good approximation of the mean variations in single regions of a planet. Therefore, understanding the impact of periodic variations in TSI on the climate is crucial to correctly interpret observations of periodically varying quantities.
