      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We employ a modified version of the atmospheric GCM ECHAM6 (ref. 
         <a>48</a>) that has been described in detail in ref. 
         <a>13</a>. Therefore, we will just summarize the general features of the model setup and explain
         how the orbital model is incorporated into the GCM. We run the model with a spectral
         truncation of T31, which corresponds to a Gaussian grid with a grid-point spacing
         of 3.75°. The atmosphere is resolved vertically by 47 layers up to a pressure (of
         dry air) of 0.01 hPa. The atmosphere is coupled to a slab ocean of 50 m depth and
         the oceanic heat transport is prescribed by a sinusoidal function of latitude. Unlike
         in the simulations performed in ref. 
         <a>13</a> the formation of sea ice is enabled and the direct effect of aerosol on radiation
         turned off in our simulations. The model uses a full hydrological cycle including
         representations of surface exchange, turbulence and vertical diffusion
         <a>49</a><a>50</a>, convection
         <a>51</a><a>52</a>, cloud cover
         <a>53</a> and cloud microphysics
         <a>54</a>. These schemes were adjusted for better representation of the relevant physical processes
         at high temperatures as described in refs 
         <a>15</a>, 
         <a>25</a>. Thus the model can run to surface temperatures of up to 350 K.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The orbital model provides the black-body stellar spectra corresponding to the effective
         temperatures of the stars, as well as the longitude and latitude of the substellar
         point for each star. The solar spectra are divided and integrated over the 14 bands
         required by the short-wave radiative transfer scheme
         <a>55</a><a>56</a>. We employ a modified version of the original radiative-transfer scheme described
         and evaluated in ref. 
         <a>25</a>. The shortwave radiative transfer is then performed for each star separately. The
         zenith angle of each star is also taken into account separately for the surface albedo
         and for calculating the radiative heating. Stellar eclipses from the point of view
         of the planet are taken into account as well.
