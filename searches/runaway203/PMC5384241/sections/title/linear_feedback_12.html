      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Let 
         <span>L</span>(
         <span>t</span>) be the departure from the temporal mean of any quantity such as gST at the time
         
         <span>t</span>, and 
         <span>F</span>(
         <span>t</span>) a forcing to which 
         <span>L</span>(
         <span>t</span>) reacts. Then 
         <span>L</span>(

         <span>O</span>(1) and higher-order derivatives are neglected. 
         <span>α</span> can be interpreted as a linear feedback parameter of 
         <span>L</span>(
         <span>t</span>). Note that this feedback parameter is not the feedback parameter used in climate
         change experiments. 
         <span>α</span> is real and can be positive or negative, but a negative 
         <span>α</span> would mean that the system is unstable and, therefore, we will think of 
         <span>α</span> being positive here. 
         <span>β</span> is a real number and describes how strongly 
         <span>L</span>(
         <span>t</span>) reacts to the forcing. Note that 
         <span>β</span> can be positive or negative. Since we consider a real-valued periodic forcing we
         can expand 
         <span>F</span>(

         forcing, with the strength of the coupling between forcing and forced quantity (which
