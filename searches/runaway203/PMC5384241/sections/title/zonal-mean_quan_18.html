      <p>(
         <span>a</span>) Shows the zonal-mean of the surface temperature (ST), (
         <span>b</span>) of the total cloud cover, (
         <span>c</span>) of the effective albedo and (
         <span>d</span>) of the precipitation in temporal average over 10,800 Earth-days in steady state.
         The effective albedo is defined as the ratio of the zonal and temporal means of the
         reflected solar radiation divided by the zonal and temporal means of the incoming
         solar radiation. The Snowball states are in red, the habitable states in yellow and
         blue and the Moist Greenhouse states in black. Note that there is almost no precipitation
         in the snowball states. The temporal mean is taken over a period of 10,800 Earth-days.
         The horizontal axes are scaled with the cosine of the latitude.
