  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>. The planet's orbit tends to evolve rapidly and significantly in such systems. Yet, its time evolution can be modelled analytically given the following assumptions
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">14</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">44</a>. We assume the system to be co-planar, that is, all bodies move in the same plane perpendicular to the system's total angular momentum vector. The variations in the semimajor axes of both binary and planetary orbit are negligible, so that they shall be considered to remain constant, and the planet is not in mean motion resonance with the binary. Furthermore, we assume that the eccentricity vector of the binary star evolves due to perturbations of the outer body and General Relativity. The planet is started on an initially circular orbit, but the orbit will evolve with time to account for the gravitational perturbations of the binary following the prescriptions in ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">14</a>. Starting the planet on a circular orbit generally produces a more excited state of the planet's eccentricity evolution with larger amplitudes variations compared to using the so-called ‘forced eccentricity'. (In linear secular theory, the planet's eccentricity vector is a composite of a forced component—the binary's immutable contribution to the planet's eccentricity—as well as a free component that represents the planets proper initial conditions. For a detailed discussion see, for instance ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" href="#b45">45</a>.) However, it is still unclear whether circumbinary planets actually form close to the relaxed dynamical state, that is, with the forced eccentricity or whether migration, resonances, as well as interaction with other protoplanets and/or the disc can excite the free eccentricity of planets

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a>. Hence, we have chosen zero initial eccentricity for the planet, in order to be able to compare our results with those of a single star single planet system on a circular orbit—the model that is predominantly used to determine the habitability of planets
