 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We perform climate simulations of a fictitious aquaplanet orbiting the two stars of the Kepler-35 system with the GCM described further below. Kepler-35 was found to have a gas giant orbiting the two stars
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">1</a>. Its gravitational effect is not included in the calculations of our orbital model. We shall, nonetheless, refer to the simulated system as Kepler-35 for simplicity. The orbit-dependent TSI and the substellar points are obtained by the orbital model described below.
