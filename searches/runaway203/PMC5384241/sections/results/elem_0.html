         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Owing to changes in the distance of the planet relative to the two stars of the Kepler-35
            system, the total solar irradiance (TSI) varies with time. The changes in the TSI
            of a planet orbiting the Kepler-35 binary show a double periodic behaviour (
            <a>Fig. 1a,b,d,e</a>). For a (habitable) planet with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u., these periods are
            of around 22 and 360 Earth-days. The oscillation with a period of approximately 22
            Earth-days is caused by the rotation of the stars around the common centre of mass
            and will henceforth be denoted by 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub>. The maximum of TSI with respect to 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> is attained when the more luminous star is closest to the planet (
            <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
            <span>t</span><sub>1</sub>) and the minimum when the less luminous star is closest (
            <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
            <span>t</span><sub>3</sub>). The oscillation with a period of around 360 Earth-days is caused by the eccentricity
            of the planetary orbit and will henceforth be denoted by 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. The maximum of that oscillation is reached when the planet is closest to the centre
            of mass (
            <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
            <span>t</span><sub>2</sub>) and the minimum when the planet is at apastron (
            <a>Fig. 1</a>, 
            <span>t</span><sub>4</sub>). Note that an orbit cannot remain circular around a double star, due to angular
            momentum exchange between the stellar and planetary orbits. In nearly coplanar systems
            such as Kepler-35, solar eclipses occur in intervals of around 11 Earth-days and result
            in a brief but substantial reduction in TSI. An interesting peculiarity of this system
            is that due to the stellar parallax more than one hemisphere of the planet is illuminated
            at all times except during eclipses. A spectral analysis reveals that the amplitude
            of the oscillation of the global-mean TSI (which is equal to TSI/4) with a period
            of 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> is 18.8 W m
            <span>−2</span> and the one of 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> is 5.5 W m
            <span>−2</span> (
            <a>Fig. 2a</a>). Including the solar eclipses, the daily-mean of the global-mean TSI varies roughly
            from 300 to 370 W m
            <span>−2</span> over one orbital period (
            <a>Fig. 1d</a>) during the time-span we have considered. Owing to oscillations of planet's orbital
            eccentricity, the variations in TSI from 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> change. The climates presented here were evaluated over a 10,800-Earth-day period
            where the planet's orbital eccentricity was close to the forced eccentricity.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How will variations in insolation affect the mean climate and habitability? The simulations
            suggest that a habitable climate for an Earth-like planet in the Kepler-35 system
            with fixed CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentrations (at 354 ppm volume mixing ratio) is maintained in a region close to
            planetary semimajor axes of between around 1.165 and 1.195 a.u. (
            <a>Table 1</a>). The global-mean surface temperature (gST) of a planet with a semimajor axis of
            1.165 a.u. is 291.0 K and that of a semimajor axis of 1.195 a.u. is 271.5 K. For a
            semimajor axis of 1.140 a.u., the planet goes into a Moist Greenhouse state, whereas
            a semimajor axis of 1.225 a.u. leads to a Snowball state. In terms of mean TSI we
            find a habitable climate between 0.954 and 1.004 
            <span>S</span><sub>0</sub> with TSI values between 0.907 and 0.954 
            <span>S</span><sub>0</sub> leading to a transition to a Snowball and a TSI between 1.004 and 1.052 
            <span>S</span><sub>0</sub> leading to a Moist Greenhouse state.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By performing simulations of the same planet on a circular orbit around our sun, we
            find that habitable climates can be maintained at a distance of 1.000 a.u. (1.000
            
            <span>S</span><sub>0</sub>) to 1.025 a.u. (0.952 
            <span>S</span><sub>0</sub>) with planetary semimajor axes of 1.050 a.u. (0.907 
            <span>S</span><sub>0</sub>) and 0.975 a.u. (1.052 
            <span>S</span><sub>0</sub>) leading to uninhabitable states (
            <a>Table 1</a>). Thus, the extent of the region for which our planet can sustain a habitable climate
            in Kepler-35 in terms of TSI is comparable to that in our solar system (
            <a>Table 1</a>). However, due to the increased overall TSI, the habitability spans a somewhat larger
            range of planetary semimajor axes. This suggests that circumbinary systems similar
            to the one studied here would be good candidates to look for habitable planets. The
            gST is higher in the two colder states of the aquaplanet in our solar system than
            at similar TSI in the Kepler-35 system. The Bond albedo of the aquaplanet in our solar
            system is somewhat higher than that of the same aquaplanet in a similar climate state
            in the Kepler-35 system (
            <a>Table 1</a>), because of the slight red-shift of the combined spectrum of Kepler-35 AB.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find three regimes of stable steady-states of our aquaplanet: The Snowball regime,
            the Earth-like regime and the Moist Greenhouse regime (
            <a>Fig. 3</a>) that all have a similar temporal-mean structure of surface temperatures and of the
            large-scale circulation on the aquaplanet in the Kepler-35 and the aquaplanet in our
            solar system (
            <a>Fig. 3</a>). However, when the annual cycle is considered, the imprint of the fluctuations of
            the TSI is clearly visible for planets around Kepler-35, especially at low surface
            temperatures (
            <a>Fig. 1</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find the transition to a hot uninhabitable state in the Kepler-35 slightly further
            away from the centre of mass of the system than a recent estimate of around 1.103 a.u.
            (ref. 
            <a>17</a>). The maximum TSI to cause global-glaciation in our solar system with fixed CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentrations is in good agreement with a study performed recently with another
            GCM in a similar setup
            <a>18</a>, but is much closer to the sun than in 1D models that use variable CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentrations
            <a>17</a><a>19</a>. A study conducted with an LEBM found the transition to a hot uninhabitable state
            in the Kepler-35 system to lie at around 0.65 a.u. (ref. 
            <a>6</a>) and thus considerably closer to the stars than in our simulations. The LEBM lacks
            the vertical dimension that is necessary to represent the climate instabilities at
            higher temperatures. Hence, the model is neither able to produce a Runaway Greenhouse
            <a>20</a><a>21</a><a>22</a><a>23</a><a>24</a> nor cloud-induced instabilities found in this and two previous studies that lead
            to a transition from a habitable state to a Moist Greenhouse state
            <a>13</a><a>25</a>. This explains why the transition to a hot uninhabitable state occurs so close to
            stars in ref. 
            <a>6</a>. In contrast, the minimum planetary semimajor axis to trigger a global glaciation
            with the same LEBM is in close agreement with ours
            <a>6</a>, because the LEBM captures the large ice-cap instability that causes the transition
            to the Snowball in both energy-balance models
            <a>26</a> and GCMs
            <a>27</a>.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How do the variations in TSI affect the climate over one orbital period of the circumbinary
            planet in the Kepler-35 system? The variations in TSI affect different quantities
            such as the gST and the global-mean precipitation in surprisingly different ways.
            We choose to focus on these two quantities, as each of them shows a different behaviour.
            Moreover, the global-mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is interesting, because
            it is an observable quantity. A spectral analysis of the daily-mean gST of the habitable
            planet with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u. reveals the peaks at periods of 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> (
            <a>Fig. 2b</a>). However, unlike for the TSI, for the gST the amplitude of the peak at 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> is larger with 0.08 K than the one at 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> with 0.03 K. This supports the notion that the changes in the orbit do affect the
            climate of circumbinary planets. A spectral analysis of the daily mean of the global-mean
            precipitation shows two peaks as well (
            <a>Fig. 2d</a>). The amplitude of the peak at 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> is smaller with 0.024 mm per day than the one of the peak at 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> with 0.050 mm per day. Compared to the mean precipitation, these amplitudes are small
            at all latitudes and thus do not substantially affect the mean climate. The global-mean
            OLR responds in a similar way as the global-mean precipitation to the variations in
            TSI, in that the peak for 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> is larger than for 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> (
            <a>Fig. 2c</a>). The amplitude of the global-mean OLR is around one order of magnitude smaller than
            that of the TSI for both periods, implying that the OLR only slightly buffers the
            variations in the energy-balance of the planet.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not only does the global-mean response to the double_periodic forcing differ for the
            aforementioned quantities, but also the meridional contribution of the quantities
            to the global-mean varies (
            <a>Fig. 4</a>). The largest amplitudes of the surface temperature are found at high latitudes,
            whereas in the case of the precipitation the amplitudes are largest close to the equator.
            The meridional distribution of surface-temperature amplitude is also different for
            the periods 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. The contribution from low-latitudes to the global-mean amplitude of surface temperature
            is substantially larger for 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> than for 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub>.

      <div class="sec" title="sec">
         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">State-dependence of the magnitude of the climate response</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amplitudes of the response of these quantities change with the mean climate (
            <a>Fig. 5</a>). Temperature variations are larger for both 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> in a colder climate (
            <a>Fig. 5b</a>), because of the smaller thermal inertia of ice compared to open water and because
            of the smaller thermal inertia of the atmosphere in colder and thus drier atmospheres.
            The variations in precipitation on the other hand increase with the global-mean surface
            temperature (
            <a>Fig. 5d</a>). This may be partly due to the general increase of precipitation and atmospheric
            water-vapour with increasing gST. The OLR shows a non-monotonic behaviour with the
            largest amplitudes in Moist Greenhouse and Snowball states (
            <a>Fig. 5c</a>). Understanding the variations in total precipitation and OLR is challenging. This
            becomes apparent, when comparing the amplitude of the global-mean precipitation with
            the global-mean of the amplitude of the zonal-mean precipitation (
            <a>Fig. 5d</a>). These two quantities would be identical if the lag of the maximum in precipitation
            with respect to maximum in TSI did not change with latitude. However, they differ,
            implying that the maximum in precipitation has a different lag with respect to the
            maximum in TSI at different latitudes. This suggests that the mechanisms by which
            precipitation changes due to the variations in TSI changes with latitude. A similar
            behaviour is also seen in the OLR (
            <a>Fig. 5c</a>), implying that the amplitude of global-mean quantities does not necessarily give
            a good approximation of the mean variations in single regions of a planet. Therefore,
            understanding the impact of periodic variations in TSI on the climate is crucial to
            correctly interpret observations of periodically varying quantities.
