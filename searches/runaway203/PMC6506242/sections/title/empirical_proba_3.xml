  <span class="bold">A</span>) Freeze-up and (

  </a>) (shading and green lines) and from the ensemble mean (blue lines) of CMIP5 data (table S1). The gray shading indicates the normalized empirical probability density value for each variable derived from the satellite data over the period 1979â€“2005. A darker color shows the more frequent days of freeze-up and breakup and the more typical first-year ice area at each latitude. The 50th (solid lines), 10th, and 90th (dashed lines) percentiles from the satellite and model ensemble distributions are shown.
