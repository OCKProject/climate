  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily and monthly simulations of physical properties of sea ice were used to derive empirical probability density functions of sea-ice drivers in latitudinal bands of 2°, based on 18 CMIP5 climate models (table S1) for recent historical (1961–2005) and business-as-usual representative concentration pathways [RCP8.5, 2061–2100 (
   <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
    <span class="italic">28</span>
   </a>)] scenarios (see Materials and Methods for details). This method is superior to the use of zonal averages when dealing with variable events such as the day of freeze-up and breakup of sea ice, and it has been successfully used in climate model analyses (
   <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">

   </a>, 
   <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
    <span class="italic">30</span>
   </a>). It also allows us to derive statistical descriptors of the extremes of the distribution, without any assumption on the shape of the distribution itself. Models were selected according to the availability of high-frequency daily data at the time of analysis. Sea-ice drivers considered were date of freeze-up, date of breakup, maximum sea-ice thickness, first-year ice extent, first month of snow cover, last month of snow cover, maximum snow depth, and minimum near-surface atmospheric temperature, as well as the dates at which the maxima and minima occurred. The climate data were obtained from the same CMIP5 dataset used in earlier works on future Arctic changes under the RCP8.5 scenario [e.g., (
   <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
    <span class="italic">31</span>
   </a>)]. However, here, we considered minimum air temperature rather than mean air temperature, focused on first-year ice only rather than on all Arctic sea ice, and explored daily data of sea-ice drivers rather than monthly averages, providing an original contribution to the analysis of CMIP5 model outputs.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We initially verified the ensemble means of first-year ice freeze-up and breakup days and the area extent for the period 1979–2005 from the 18 single distributions against remote sensing data (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). The observations of sea-ice concentration for current climate conditions were obtained from passive microwave data (
   <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
    <span class="italic">32</span>
   </a>). The sea-ice drivers of phenology (freeze-ups and breakups) from the climate model ensemble distributions compare well with the distributions computed from the satellite data (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, A and B</a>). In particular, the simulated medians of the days of freeze-up and breakup match the observations at all latitudes [root mean square differences (RMSDs) are 4 and 11 days, respectively]. The spread of the modeled distribution with respect to observations is similar for the freeze-up (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>) but narrower for the modeled breakup, indicating less variability in CMIP5 models (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>). Less agreement is found when comparing the medians of observed and modeled sea-ice extent (RMSD = 0.2 × 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span>; 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>), likely because of the known biases of CMIP5 models to simulate this sea-ice driver (

   </a>, 
   <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
    <span class="italic">34</span>
   </a>). The difference is particularly large in the latitudinal band between 70°N and 78°N. Our statistical approach demonstrates acceptable performances of the climate models, especially in terms of making the sea-ice drivers of phenology usable for the analysis of changes in seasonal sea-ice and their impact on ice algal phenology. The larger spread in sea-ice extent will instead be taken into consideration and discussed when integrating our latitudinal-based results on a pan-Arctic scale.

The variation of the freeze-up medians is larger in the future scenario, highlighting the intermodel variance in simulated summer sea-ice losses over the 21st century (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of empirical probability density functions shows that the models have good skills in simulating the latitudinal variation of the observable sea-ice drivers (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>), although it shows the occurrence of first-year ice above 84°N in 12 of the 18 models, which is not seen in the satellite distribution. Another bias that was not previously reported, e.g., by Notz (
   <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
    <span class="italic">33</span>
   </a>), is the underestimation of the areal extent above 70°N (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>). This is due to the large variation in the area of first-year ice between 70°N and 80°N, which causes this latitudinal band to be characterized by the largest increase of seasonal sea-ice extent by the end of the century (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the ensemble means in 
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> to construct representative pan-Arctic sea-ice seasons at 2° latitudinal resolution for both time slices in the form of continuous forcing functions (see Materials and Methods for details). The physical forcings were then used to drive the sea-ice biogeochemical model, simulating the permeability and biogeochemistry of the dynamic bottom permeable sea-ice layer and the development of environmental factors for sea-ice algal growth (
   <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
    <span class="italic">24</span>
   </a>). The biogeochemical model simulated the sympagic system, focusing on one class of sea-ice algae resembling Arctic pennate diatoms, which are the dominant community in bottom sea ice (
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
    <span class="italic">39</span>
   </a>) and are characterized by efficient light acclimation while limited by nutrients found in the bottom permeable layer (see Materials and Methods for details). While the initial composition of the sympagic community can be highly heterogeneous [e.g., (
   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
    <span class="italic">40</span>
   </a>)], mirroring that of the ocean underneath, the blooming phase is usually dominated by pennate diatom species after natural selection of the most adapted taxa to survive and grow when suitable environmental conditions return [e.g., (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite similar latitudinal advances in projected breakup dates, the changes in timing of sea-ice algal blooms are different and grouped into two main clusters. Below 66°N, where the breakup date is projected to occur about 25 days earlier in the future climate (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>), the bloom peak develops between 45 and 70 days earlier than in the historical climate (
   <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>). Above 66°N, the advance of the algal bloom is more in line with the advancing of the breakup dates (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>), i.e., between 15 and 40 days earlier in the future projections (
   <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>). The number of clusters increases to three when we factor in the relative changes in GPP. For these clusters, low-latitude seasonal sea ice is expected to be up to 150% more productive (i.e., increasing from 0.48 to 1.20 g C m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> y
   <span class="sup">−1</span> at 65°N). Smaller and negative variations are expected between 68°N and 74°N (i.e., between −25 and 11% relative change), while the largest increase is expected above 74°N, with up to more than 550% increase in GPP at 77°N (i.e., from 0.05 to 0.33 g C m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> y
   <span class="sup">−1</span>; 
   <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a> and table S2).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With inclusion of the projected latitudinal changes in ice extent (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>), the relative increase in GPP per unit area predicted below 74°N diminishes because of the large loss of seasonal sea ice, while above 74°N, it becomes more important because of first-year ice largely expanding at the expense of multiyear ice (
   <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a> and table S2). The combination of area-specific production increase and first-year ice expansion is expected to give rise to a sea-ice habitat that is more than 2500% more productive than in the recent climate for algae located northward of 80°N (i.e., from 7.48 to 199.48 Gg C y
   <span class="sup">−1</span> at 83°N). Thus, the anticipated increase in first-year ice algal production would make this region productively equivalent to what is currently simulated 10° more to the south (table S2), which is a non-negligible change. In light of the CMIP5 model bias in sea-ice extent (particularly large between 70°N and 78°N; 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>), we anticipate the relative increase in GPP found at these latitudes (
   <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>) to be even underestimated.

   <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>. We specifically investigated alterations in the timing of the peak bloom, driven by latitudinal variation in light availability. The available light in turn is a function of sea-ice and snow thicknesses, length of the biological time window, and photoperiod. We present here one latitude example for each cluster: 58°N to 66°N (lower panels), 66°N to 74°N (mid panels), and 74°N to 84°N (upper panels), representing respectively low-, mid-, and high-latitude pan-Arctic sea-ice ecosystems for historical (left) and RCP8.5 (right) scenario simulations (

   <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, 61°N) is typical of regions such as the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Hudson Bay, or the land-fast ice conditions found in Greenland fjords (

   <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
    <span class="italic">42</span>
   </a>). According to our modeling results, below the Arctic Circle, sea ice is projected to become much thinner and entirely permeable. The thinner snow depth, expected to be less than 0.1 m, leads to a long productive season, with a large and sharp asymmetrical bloom that is characteristic of little light limitation (see also fig. S1C).

    <span class="italic">25</span>
   </a>), the Chukchi Sea, the Baffin Bay, and the Kara Sea, where sea-ice production under current climate conditions is limited by thick ice and snow despite the favorable photoperiod. The latitudes of up to 74°N are currently characterized by one of the largest extents of first-year ice (

   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>). In the RCP8.5 scenario simulation at 71°N, both sea ice and snow are expected to thin largely, although not enough to allow sufficient growth within the narrower biological time window due to earlier breakups. The resulting magnitude of sea-ice production is expected to mimic current climate conditions, but the phenology is nonetheless altered toward earlier blooms (
   <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a> and fig. S1B).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Barents Sea deserves specific mention because it is mostly located within this cluster’s range of latitudes, but it is characterized by sea-ice conditions more similar to that of the first cluster (
   <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, 61°N). In the Barents Sea, we expect an increase in GPP similar to that seen at the lowest latitudes (
   <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>) because of significant sea ice and snow thinning (
   <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, 61°N). However, we expect this to be modulated by the sharper photoperiod typical of these latitudes. This might reduce the length of the ice algal growing season in a way that is similar to the second cluster (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third cluster (

    <span class="italic">43</span>
   </a>). At these high latitudes, sea-ice blooms are limited by low brine permeability and thick ice and snow. The climate model projections indicate a marked thinning of the sea ice to levels similar to the current-day 71°N cluster (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). At these highest latitudes, the key factor responsible for the largest relative increase in GPP in first-year ice (
