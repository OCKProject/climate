 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily and monthly simulations of physical properties of sea ice were used to derive empirical probability density functions of sea-ice drivers in latitudinal bands of 2°, based on 18 CMIP5 climate models (table S1) for recent historical (1961–2005) and business-as-usual representative concentration pathways [RCP8.5, 2061–2100 (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>)] scenarios (see Materials and Methods for details). This method is superior to the use of zonal averages when dealing with variable events such as the day of freeze-up and breakup of sea ice, and it has been successfully used in climate model analyses (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). It also allows us to derive statistical descriptors of the extremes of the distribution, without any assumption on the shape of the distribution itself. Models were selected according to the availability of high-frequency daily data at the time of analysis. Sea-ice drivers considered were date of freeze-up, date of breakup, maximum sea-ice thickness, first-year ice extent, first month of snow cover, last month of snow cover, maximum snow depth, and minimum near-surface atmospheric temperature, as well as the dates at which the maxima and minima occurred. The climate data were obtained from the same CMIP5 dataset used in earlier works on future Arctic changes under the RCP8.5 scenario [e.g., (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>)]. However, here, we considered minimum air temperature rather than mean air temperature, focused on first-year ice only rather than on all Arctic sea ice, and explored daily data of sea-ice drivers rather than monthly averages, providing an original contribution to the analysis of CMIP5 model outputs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We initially verified the ensemble means of first-year ice freeze-up and breakup days and the area extent for the period 1979–2005 from the 18 single distributions against remote sensing data (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). The observations of sea-ice concentration for current climate conditions were obtained from passive microwave data (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>). The sea-ice drivers of phenology (freeze-ups and breakups) from the climate model ensemble distributions compare well with the distributions computed from the satellite data (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, A and B</a>). In particular, the simulated medians of the days of freeze-up and breakup match the observations at all latitudes [root mean square differences (RMSDs) are 4 and 11 days, respectively]. The spread of the modeled distribution with respect to observations is similar for the freeze-up (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>) but narrower for the modeled breakup, indicating less variability in CMIP5 models (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>). Less agreement is found when comparing the medians of observed and modeled sea-ice extent (RMSD = 0.2 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>; 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>), likely because of the known biases of CMIP5 models to simulate this sea-ice driver (
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>). The difference is particularly large in the latitudinal band between 70°N and 78°N. Our statistical approach demonstrates acceptable performances of the climate models, especially in terms of making the sea-ice drivers of phenology usable for the analysis of changes in seasonal sea-ice and their impact on ice algal phenology. The larger spread in sea-ice extent will instead be taken into consideration and discussed when integrating our latitudinal-based results on a pan-Arctic scale.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At all latitudes (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>), the projected physical drivers of sea ice trend toward thinner sea ice (approximately from 0.3 m thinner in the low latitudes to 1.3 m thinner at high latitudes), warmer near-surface minimum atmospheric temperature (up to 15°C warmer above 70°N), later freeze-ups (average, 1.5 months), earlier breakups (average, 1 month), thinner snow depth (0.05 to 0.15 m), and generally shorter ice seasons. The variation of the freeze-up medians is larger in the future scenario, highlighting the intermodel variance in simulated summer sea-ice losses over the 21st century (

   <span class="italic">35</span>

  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of empirical probability density functions shows that the models have good skills in simulating the latitudinal variation of the observable sea-ice drivers (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>), although it shows the occurrence of first-year ice above 84°N in 12 of the 18 models, which is not seen in the satellite distribution. Another bias that was not previously reported, e.g., by Notz (
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>), is the underestimation of the areal extent above 70°N (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>). This is due to the large variation in the area of first-year ice between 70°N and 80°N, which causes this latitudinal band to be characterized by the largest increase of seasonal sea-ice extent by the end of the century (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the ensemble means in 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> to construct representative pan-Arctic sea-ice seasons at 2° latitudinal resolution for both time slices in the form of continuous forcing functions (see Materials and Methods for details). The physical forcings were then used to drive the sea-ice biogeochemical model, simulating the permeability and biogeochemistry of the dynamic bottom permeable sea-ice layer and the development of environmental factors for sea-ice algal growth (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>). The biogeochemical model simulated the sympagic system, focusing on one class of sea-ice algae resembling Arctic pennate diatoms, which are the dominant community in bottom sea ice (
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>) and are characterized by efficient light acclimation while limited by nutrients found in the bottom permeable layer (see Materials and Methods for details). While the initial composition of the sympagic community can be highly heterogeneous [e.g., (
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>)], mirroring that of the ocean underneath, the blooming phase is usually dominated by pennate diatom species after natural selection of the most adapted taxa to survive and grow when suitable environmental conditions return [e.g., (
  <span class="italic">39</span>)].
