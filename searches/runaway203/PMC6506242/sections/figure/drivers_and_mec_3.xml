  <p>Simulation results at three representative latitudes (61°N, 71°N, and 81°N) for the historical period (1961–2005, left) and RCP8.5 scenario (2061–2100, right), showing sea-ice season length, sea-ice/snow thickness (black), downward solar radiation [from the ERA-Interim climatology (

The chlorophyll anomaly (green) is an indicator of algal bloom phenology (
