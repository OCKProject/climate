            of productive, wetland vegetation in drained lake basins leads to smaller changes
            in carbon fluxes (factor of −0.004 to +0.08). Our net carbon emission estimate is
            likely conservative because the 30-m resolution Landsat-based analysis did not account

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our reanalysis of 21st-century CLM and AThaw model results brings to light four critical
            findings. First, accounting for abrupt permafrost thaw beneath lakes, which peaks
            mid-century in response to RCP8.5 atmospheric temperature rise (Supplementary Figs 4
            and 5), increases late 21st century circumpolar permafrost carbon emissions up to
            118% (49–235%, 68% uncertainty range) (Fig. 
            <a>4b</a>; Supplementary Data 
            <a>1</a>). Corresponding CPCRE is increased by 130% (62–265%, 68% uncertainty) over that from
            gradual top-down thaw alone (Fig. 
            <a>4h</a>), which was the basis of previous PCF assessments

               <a>6</a>–
               <a>8</a></span>. We acknowledge that the extent to which AThaw emissions affect CPCRE depends on

            <span><a>6</a>–
               <a>10</a></span>, but in all cases would result in a significant increase. End-of-the-century weakening
            of the abrupt thaw lake contribution to CPCRE occurs because strong warming in RCP8.5
            ultimately leads to the loss of high CH

            thaw setting for RCP4.5, atmospheric carbon uptake by plants growing in active layer
            soils is stimulated more than decomposition of soil organic matter. However, the same
            degree of warming triggers an acceleration of abrupt thaw via thermokarst-lake formation
