         <p>Lake area change and carbon flux implications in the permafrost region of northwestern
            Alaska for 1999–2014 determined with Landsat satellite trend analysis. Gross lake
            area loss (
            <span>a</span>), gross lake area gain (
            <span>b</span>), net lake area change (
            <span>c</span>), and net change in carbon flux associated with expansion and drainage (
            <span>d</span>) have been aggregated in 7.5 km × 7.5 km grid cells (5625 ha per cell). Background
            map: CartoDB Positron layer accessed with QuickMapServices QGIS Plugin. Panels 
            <span>a</span>–
            <span>c</span> show the absolute percent water fraction change per grid cell. In 
            <span>d</span>, net change in carbon flux over the 15-year observation period. Despite a net lake
            area loss for the region, large permafrost-soil derived carbon emissions associated
            with gross lake area gain overwhelm smaller flux changes associated with gross lake
            area loss, leading to a net increase in regional carbon emissions (Supplementary Table
