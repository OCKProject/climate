         <p>Interior Alaska abrupt permafrost thaw. Time series (1949–2010) showing thermokarst-lake
            development based on historical aerial photograph (
            <span>a</span>–
            <span>c</span>) and 2.5-m SPOT (
            <span>d</span>) shoreline analysis. Dashed lines in 
            <span>d</span> delineate dark areas in 1949 images interpreted as shallow, vegetated wetlands that
            later developed into open-water lakes. In 
            <span>e</span>, thaw depth (solid line) and degraded permafrost (dashed line), interpreted from
            helicopter-borne electromagnetic data-derived 3D resistivity model (Supplementary
            Methods); extracted cross section is the white line in 
            <span>d</span>. Field work shows strong, 
            <span>14</span>C-depleted methane ebullition seeps [green dots in (
            <span>f</span>) Lake I, Oct. 2014 and (
            <span>g</span>) Lake II, Oct. 2016)] overlapping recent abrupt permafrost thaw areas (e.g., thaw
            since 1949–1967). Strong seeps are absent in lakes lacking recent abrupt thaw (Supplementary
