  <p>Circumpolar permafrost carbon emissions from gradual thaw (land) versus abrupt thaw (lakes) from 1950 to 2100. Permafrost soil carbon emissions, modeled according to representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, are distinguished for homogenous gradual thaw from CLM4.5BGC (brown) and heterogeneous abrupt thaw by AThaw thermokarst-lake formation (median values, blue). Cumulative emissions, including percent increase in emissions from old permafrost carbon by abrupt thaw (
