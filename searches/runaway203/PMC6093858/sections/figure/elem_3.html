         <p>Circumpolar permafrost carbon emissions from gradual thaw (land) versus abrupt thaw
            (lakes) from 1950 to 2100. Permafrost soil carbon emissions, modeled according to
            representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, are distinguished
            for homogenous gradual thaw from CLM4.5BGC (brown) and heterogeneous abrupt thaw by
            AThaw thermokarst-lake formation (median values, blue). Cumulative emissions, including
            percent increase in emissions from old permafrost carbon by abrupt thaw (

            to abrupt thaw lakes is shown only for years 2018–2100, when the AThaw modeled carbon
            release exceeds one standard deviation in simulated CLM permafrost carbon fluxes during
            the 1950– 2017 reference period
