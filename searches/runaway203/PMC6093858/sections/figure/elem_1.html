         <p>Comparison of gradual, top-down thaw in upland permafrost and abrupt thaw beneath
            lakes.

            <span><a>28</a></span>, Healy, Alaska (#3–5)
            <span><a>26</a></span>, western Alaska (#6–9), interior Alaska (#10,11,14–19) and northeast Siberia (#12,13);
            standard error bars.
