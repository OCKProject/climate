  <p>Lake area change and carbon flux implications in the permafrost region of northwestern Alaska for 1999–2014 determined with Landsat satellite trend analysis. Gross lake area loss (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), gross lake area gain (
   <span class="bold">b</span>), net lake area change (
   <span class="bold">c</span>), and net change in carbon flux associated with expansion and drainage (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) have been aggregated in 7.5 km × 7.5 km grid cells (5625 ha per cell). Background map: CartoDB Positron layer accessed with QuickMapServices QGIS Plugin. Panels 
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">c</span> show the absolute percent water fraction change per grid cell. In 
   <span class="bold">d</span>, net change in carbon flux over the 15-year observation period. Despite a net lake area loss for the region, large permafrost-soil derived carbon emissions associated with gross lake area gain overwhelm smaller flux changes associated with gross lake area loss, leading to a net increase in regional carbon emissions (Supplementary Table
