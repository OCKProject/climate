         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Permafrost-region 21st-century soil carbon emissions are compared between two model
            types using IPCC RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Both models represent basic sets of permafrost
            processes and have multiple soil organic carbon pools, but the models differ in their
            complexity of how individual processes are described. While CLM4.5BGC
            <span><a>7</a></span> simulates the full physical interactions between the atmosphere and the soil, including
            vegetation uptake of CO
            <sub>2</sub>, AThaw parameterizes soil thaw rates, depending on ground thermal properties, mean
            annual ground temperatures, active layer depth, and magnitude of the regional warming
            anomaly which drives permafrost degradation
            <span><a>23</a></span>. In its current model design, CLM4.5BGC simulates gradual thaw in terrestrial uplands.
            We utilized CLM4.5BGC emission data for years 1950–2100 partitioned according to non-permafrost
            carbon, originating from present-day active layer horizons, and permafrost carbon,
            which becomes thawed from the top down as active layer gradually deepens. In contrast,
            the more simplistic, but therefore more flexible model design in AThaw also allows
            for abrupt thaw under thermokarst lakes by tuning model parameters to simulated talik
            growth rates of a physically-based thermokarst-lake model
            <span><a>16</a></span>. Newly-formed thermokarst lakes and laterally-expanding lake margins are a large
            net source of atmospheric CH
            <sub>4</sub> and CO
            <sub>2</sub>, in contrast to mature thermokarst-lake stages, where fluxes are lower (Supplementary
            Tables 5 and 6). AThaw simulates only the carbon emissions from newly thawed sub-lake
            sediments comprising contributions from expansion of thaw lakes present since 1850,
            and from new lake initiation in response to warming after the year 1850. AThaw does
            not simulate fluxes for older lake areas already present on the landscape at year
            1850. Further, permafrost degradation in CLM4.5BGC is driven by spatially resolved
            climatic forcing fields, while AThaw focuses on large-scale latitudinal climatic gradients.
            In addition to differences in spatial resolution, CLM4.5BGC is more complete, simulating
            a large set of climate variables which all determine surface vegetation and soil conditions,
            while AThaw considers surface air temperatures only as the key driver for the net
            balance of lake expansion versus drainage.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AThaw is a conceptual model which projects carbon release from abrupt thaw by accounting
            for the full chain of processes from formation of new thermokarst lakes under global
            warming and talik deepening in sub-lake sediments to eventual carbon release to the
            atmosphere following anaerobic microbial degradation of organic matter and CH
            <sub>4</sub> oxidation. AThaw also accounts for lake drainage; although, carbon fluxes in drained
            lake basins are not modeled
            <span><a>24</a>,
               <a>63</a>–
               <a>65</a></span>. AThaw is incorporated into a multi-box permafrost-carbon release model which allocates
            soil organic matter into latitudinally and vertically gridded boxes of differing conditions
            regarding soil physics, carbon quantity and quality, and biogeochemistry
            <span><a>23</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Briefly, AThaw model resolution consists of (a) 20 latitudinal bands, ranging from
            45°N to 85°N with a 2° gridding, and of (b) 27 vertical soil layers corresponding
            to layer thicknesses of 25 cm for the upper 4 m, and of 1 m thickness for the depth
            range of 4–15 m. AThaw assumes typical soil organic matter residence times in permafrost
            soils, which are determined by partitioning into passive, slow, and fast cycling carbon
            pools with decomposition timescale parameters based on incubation experiments. Q
            <sub>10</sub> temperature sensitivity is accounted for as well as CH
            <sub>4</sub> oxidation [for details see Supplementary Table

         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AThaw assumes that increasing Arctic temperatures will drive expansion of existing
            lakes and new thermokarst-lake formation by melting of near-surface ground ice and
            subsequent ground subsidence. This assumption is in line with Community Land Model
            (CLM4.5) results from Lee et al.
            <span><a>66</a></span>, whereby surface excess ice in permafrost soils of many regions will largely melt
            by 2100 when subject to intense warming. AThaw assumes that comparatively small 19th
            and 20th-century warming rates have initiated some formation of new but rather shallow
            thermokarst lakes with likely winter-refreeze of lake bottom sediments. Start of abrupt
            thaw (i.e., formation of sub-lake taliks) is only assumed to occur for stronger warming
            starting in the 21st century and beyond. The evolution of newly-formed thermokarst
            lakes is parameterized in AThaw by an optimum function which non-linearly scales the
            latitudinal thermokarst lake area fraction by the surface air temperature anomaly
            <span><a>23</a></span> (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). The lake formation scheme models an increase of newly-formed
            thermokarst-lake areas with temperature until a maximum extent [F
            <span>TKLmax</span> (~8 to ~40% increase, depending on soil type)], is reached under a temperature optimum
            dT′
            <span>TKLmax</span>. The temperature optimum corresponds to high-latitude surface air temperatures 4–6 °C
            above pre-industrial; warming above this optimum shifts 21st century lake dynamics
            toward net drainage. Such responses of thermokarst lake formation to temperature increases
            are not unprecedented, given that the early Holocene Arctic temperature increase of
            1.6 °C
            <span><a>37</a></span> resulted in a 570% increase in thermokarst-lake formation rates
            <span><a>24</a></span>. AThaw-projected increases in lake area are lower for 2010–2100 compared to the early-Holocene
            observational record, because permafrost soils are now more protected from warming
            and thawing by thick organic soil surfaces
            <span><a>67</a></span> and less likely to form large lakes compared to the less dissected early Holocene
            periglacial landscape

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rather than simulating individual lake life cycles of formation, expansion, drainage,
            and re-initiation of later generation lakes (e.g., ref. 
            <span><a>43</a></span>), AThaw quantifies the net effect of new lake formation and drainage in modelled
            lake areas (F
            <span>TKL</span>). We capture a wide range of uncertainty in net lake formation and drainage trajectories
            by varying two key model parameters: The maximum net lake area, F
            <span>TKLmax</span>, and the optimum high latitude surface temperature increase, dT′
            <span>TKLmax</span> (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>5</a>). Model parameters for the maximum lake area extent (F
            <span>TKLmax</span>) were chosen individually for the four AThaw soil classes to capture expected differences
            in the potential for future lake development (see Methane and CO
            <sub>2</sub> in newly-formed thermokarst lakes). However, the parameter that most strongly controls
            the dynamics of thermokarst lake formation and drainage is the temperature optimum,
            dT′
            <span>TKLmax</span>, the temperature at which the maximum lake area occurs. We prescribed a mean estimate
            of 5 °C for dT′
            <span>TKLmax</span> (i.e., high latitude surface air warming above pre-industrial) and consider a full
            range of 4–6 °C in our model ensemble. This parameter choice is based on paleoenvironmental
            evidence of Early Holocene warming by a few degrees Celsius in Northern Hemisphere
            land areas

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This range of dT′
            <span>TKLmax</span> values was also chosen to capture the sensitivity of future surface ice-wedge melt
            to climate warming, since ice-wedge melt is a critical step in thermokarst lake formation
            and drainage. Increases in permafrost temperature, which typically mirror increases
            in air temperature, have been observed in many Arctic regions, with warming of up
            to 3 °C since the 1970’s in some of the coldest permafrost regions
            <span><a>3</a>,
               <a>38</a>,
               <a>71</a></span>. Permafrost warming is often accompanied by active layer deepening and increased
            ground-ice melt. Widespread surficial degradation of ice wedges and a significant
            increase in areas of water-filled polygonal troughs has been linked to climatic warming
            during the past few decades in northern Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and
            Siberia

            and RCP8.5
            <span><a>49</a></span>, is expected to intensify permafrost and surface ice wedge degradation
            <span><a>66</a></span>, enhancing thermokarst. For RCP4.5, permafrost warming slows beyond 2050
            <span><a>49</a></span>, supporting AThaw ensembles of lower net thermokarst lake formation during the latter
            part of the century (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). In contrast, extreme warming after
            2050 for RCP8.5 is expected to heavily degrade permafrost, such that near-surface
            permafrost disappears entirely from many arctic regions
            <span><a>49</a></span>. These conditions lend support to AThaw parameterization, which leads to net lake
            drainage in the later part of the century for RCP8.5.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In AThaw, warming above the temperature optimum in the 21st century is assumed to

            create drainage pathways
            <span><a>52</a></span>. Other mechanisms of lake drainage include bank overtopping, headward gully erosion
            towards a lake; and tapping of lakes by streams, rivers, or other water bodies
            <span><a>36</a></span>. Higher drainage potential in southern, discontinuous permafrost regions also encompasses

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the 4–6 °C dT′
            <span>TKLmax</span> range used in our modeling was prescribed based on paleoenvironmental evidence, historical
            observations, and modeling of future permafrost dynamics, we can consider the implications
            of using smaller or larger dT′
            <span>TKLmax</span> values. Smaller dT′
            <span>TKLmax</span> values would imply that the maximum area of thermokarst lake coverage would occur
            earlier in the century. This would result in a relatively larger AThaw increase to
            the PCF earlier in the 21st century and a lower AThaw contribution to PCF toward the
            end of the century due to more widespread drainage. If dT′
            <span>TKLmax</span> aligned more closely with the range of simulated high latitude warming inferred from
            higher concentration pathways (e.g., dT′
            <span>TKLmax</span> &gt; 6 °C), we would expect maximum thermokarst lake coverage (i.e., F
            <span>TKLmax</span>) to occur later in the century, less drainage of AThaw lakes during the 21st century,
            and a larger relative contribution of AThaw to end-of-the century PCF under stronger
            future warming.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is interesting to note that that while thermokarst-lake initiation and drainage
            rates are linked to climate, thermokarst-lake growth—the long process between initiation
            and drainage that results in most of the carbon release—has dynamics (e.g., talik
            growth, shore expansion) that once started become rather decoupled from climate due
            to strong linkage with local factors such as ground ice content and ice-layer thickness
            <span><a>72</a>–
               <a>75</a></span>. Hence, thermokarst lakes are found across the entire range of Arctic climatic zones
            and permafrost temperatures as long as there is sufficient ground ice
            <span><a>36</a>,
               <a>76</a>,
               <a>77</a></span>. A thermokarst lake on the New Siberian Islands has the same potential to release
            carbon as a thermokarst lake in Central Yakutia; the differences are largely not determined
            by climate (or RCP conditions) but by local conditions such as permafrost soil carbon
            and ground ice contents. Hence, either RCP scenario will result in more lakes (earlier
            or later) and both scenarios will have a similar emission magnitude linked to maximum
            lake areas, but relative to anthropogenic emissions, the thermokarst lake emissions
            from RCP4.5 will be more relevant.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Factors other than temperature that are not included in AThaw, but which can also
            affect thermokarst lake dynamics include natural and anthropogenic surface disturbance,
            precipitation changes, and local topography
            <span><a>43</a></span>. However, since CMIP5 models consistently predict a moistening trend in the Arctic
            (i.e., an increase in precipitation relative to evapotranspiration)
            <span><a>51</a></span>, an explicit accounting for predicted 21st-century precipitation and evaporation
            trends would reinforce rather than weaken the AThaw lake dynamics driven by temperature
            changes alone.

            carbon expands vertically by talik growth in sub-lake sediments and horizontally by
            increases in the extent to which thermokarst lakes cover the landscape. Here we discuss
            how these two processes, vertical and horizontal growth, are captured in AThaw and
            how they compare to other modeling studies and observational evidence.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, AThaw simulates vertical talik growth rates beneath lakes as a function of
            atmospheric temperature anomalies, which in turn determine lake bottom temperatures
            and ultimately drive sub-lake sediment warming. Thaw rates are assumed to depend on
            soil ice contents, mean ground temperature, depth of the thaw front, and are tuned
            to reproduce talik deepening simulated by Kessler et al.
            <span><a>16</a></span>. For instance, AThaw simulates typical talik depth beneath lakes of 11 m (7.8–13.4 m,
            68% uncertainty range; 20 m max) in warm permafrost environments (i.e., mean annual
            soil temperatures close to 0 °C) with mineral soils by the year 2050 under RCP8.5.
            Our helicopter-borne electromagnetic measurements of sites with comparable climatic
            and soil conditions (i.e., relatively warm permafrost temperatures between −3 and
            −1°C) (Supplementary Information) have inferred lake talik growth of 8–15 m in &lt; 50
            years (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>7</a>). It should be noted that advective heat transport by groundwater can accelerate
            vertical thaw; maximum reported thaw rates are up to a meter per year
            <span><a>78</a>,
               <a>79</a></span>. When accounting for the effect of ground subsidence in a modeling context, Westermann
            et al.
            <span><a>79</a></span> suggest that several meters of ground ice can be removed in less than a decade. The
            authors simulated a talik growth of 15 m by 2100 under RCP8.5 for a site characterized
            by yedoma ice complex in cold, continuous permafrost. In contrast, AThaw simulates
            6 m (4–8 m, 68% range) talik depth under comparable climatic conditions by end of
            the century. Therefore, given modeling and observational evidence, we consider that
            the thaw rates in sub-lake sediments simulated by AThaw are relatively conservative.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second key AThaw model assumption concerns simulated thermokarst-lake expansion
            in a warmer climate. Central to this aspect is the question to which extent newly-formed
            thermokarst lakes will cover degrading permafrost landscapes in a warmer climate.
            AThaw assumes that future thermokarst-lake formation will strongly depend on soil
            conditions (e.g., ice content) and landscape morphology. Therefore, the model assumes
            different maximum lake formation extents for four different ice-rich soil type distributions
            in the permafrost region of the Arctic: mineral soil (Orthels and Turbels), organic
            soils (Histels), undisturbed yedoma, and refrozen thermokarst deposits in the yedoma
            region (Supplementary Table

            <span><a>80</a></span>, this soil class contributes significantly to cumulative pan-arctic CH
            <sub>4TKL</sub> (at year 2100, 46% for RCP8.5, 28% for RCP4.5). Organic soils (120 Pg C, NCSCD)
            <span><a>80</a></span> are typically richer in ground ice than mineral soils and therefore AThaw assumes
            a factor two larger potential for the formation of new thermokarst lakes [F
            <span>TKLmax</span> of 14% (10–17%, 68% range; Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>4</a>)]. This soil type contributes 17% for RCP8.5 and 14% for RCP4.5 to cumulative pan-arctic
            CH
            <sub>4TKL</sub>. AThaw explicitly accounts for ice- and organic-rich soils in yedoma regions, separated
            into undisturbed yedoma landscapes (80 Pg C)
            <span><a>81</a></span> and drained lake basins in the yedoma region that subsequently formed permafrost
            following lake drainage (refrozen thermokarst; 240 Pg C)
            <span><a>24</a>,
               <a>81</a></span>. Given the high ice contents of these yedoma-region soils
            <span><a>81</a>–
               <a>83</a></span>, both soil classes are assigned a high potential for the formation of new thermokarst
            lakes once rising temperatures have resulted in ground subsidence. Given the high
            volumetric ice contents of refrozen drained thermokarst lake basins (&gt; 50%)
            <span><a>81</a>,
               <a>83</a></span> in conjunction with its basin-type geomorphology, which favors water ponding
            <span><a>16</a></span>, AThaw assumes a maximum F
            <span>TKLmax</span> of 21% (11–27%, 68% range; Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). Refrozen thermokarst basins in the yedoma region cover only about 4% of the permafrost
            domain of the Arctic, but they contribute 28% under RCP8.5 (38% under RCP4.5) to cumulative
            pan-arctic CH
            <sub>4TKL</sub> by 2100. The highest potential for new-lake formation is assumed for unaltered ice-rich
            yedoma soils, where volumetric segregated ice content is typically 47–53% and high
            wedge-ice volumes (~40%) further increase permafrost ice concentration
            <span><a>81</a></span>. Here AThaw assumes a F
            <span>TKLmax</span> of 33% (16–42%, 68% range; Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). Considering that thermokarst activity in ice-rich regions had degraded about 80%
            of the landscape in specific regions during the Holocene
            <span><a>24</a>,
               <a>81</a>,
               <a>84</a></span>, we consider a factor two reduced lake-forming potential plausible, especially under
            the assumption of strong future warming. While undisturbed yedoma landscapes constitute
            our carbon pool with the smallest areal extent (covering 0.41 million km
            <span>2</span>, 2% of the permafrost domain)
            <span><a>81</a></span>, they contribute 9% under RCP8.5 (20% under RCP4.5) to cumulated pan-arctic CH
            <sub>4TKL</sub> by 2100, revealing the importance of carbon release from deep deposits beneath abruptly-formed
            yedoma thermokarst lakes.

            since gross lake-area increases in some regions are higher (e.g., &gt; 50% in Quebec
            <span><a>85</a></span> and &gt; 23% in West Siberia

            growth is not the only mechanism of abrupt permafrost degradation making newly thawed
            permafrost carbon available for microbial decomposition. Further contribution comes
            from talik growth of present-day lakes which have not yet formed a deep talik and
            still store large amounts of labile carbon in sub-lake sediments. For instance, on
            the Alaska North Slope, Arp et al.
            <span><a>17</a></span> demonstrated that a rapid decrease in lake-ice thickness and duration has already
            led to many shallow lakes transitioning from bed-ice fast lakes underlain by permafrost
            to floating ice lakes that have started to develop taliks. This talik formation takes
            place about 70 years before talik formation is projected for the adjacent terrestrial
            environment by top-down permafrost models in this cold continuous permafrost zone,
            a feedback process also not accounted for in AThaw or other models of permafrost degradation.
            These and other non-lake modes of abrupt thaw

            lakes in AThaw, and to account only for the increase in emissions and CPCRE caused
            by abrupt thaw, we have subtracted from the AThaw emissions and CPCRE, in our total
            permafrost landscape calculations, the quantity of carbon emissions and associated
            radiative forcing already assumed to be emitted from those land surfaces from CLM4.5BGC.
            We used the AThaw thermokarst-lake area fraction at each time step for each of the
            four soil classes (Supplementary Fig.
