Methodology underlying our remote-sensing based quantification of abrupt thaw in Alaska and field-based estimates of carbon emissions from abruptly-formed thermokarst areas of lakes in Alaska and Siberia are also provided inÂ Supplementary Methods. Field and lab measurements include bubble-trap observations of ebullition fluxes, aerial and ground-based ebullition seep-mapping, and quantification of CH
  <sub>4</sub> and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations and radiocarbon dating.
