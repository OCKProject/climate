 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we re-analyzed model output from an earth system model, the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5BGC)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, to identify the carbon-emissions fraction originating from gradual permafrost thaw on land, and to quantify the increase to 21st-century circumpolar permafrost-carbon emissions by including warming-induced abrupt thaw beneath thermokarst lakes. Our abrupt thaw emissions are derived from a vertically- and latitudinally-resolved box model of permafrost carbon processes, including a novel component conceptually describing circum-Arctic thermokarst-lake dynamics and related carbon release
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>, which we refer to here as the Abrupt Thaw (AThaw) model (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CLM4.5BGC and AThaw differ in model complexity, forcing parameters, and resolution (Methods), but both include basic sets of permafrost processes and multiple soil organic carbon pools for projecting permafrost-carbon dynamics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. CLM4.5BGC focuses on gradual, homogenous thaw affecting only surface permafrost (&lt; 3 m) across the landscape. It also accounts for carbon cycling in the seasonal active layer and stimulation of plant growth by future elevated atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations and increased nitrogen mineralization with increasing soil organic matter decomposition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. In contrast, AThaw simulates the more heterogeneous process of abrupt, deeper (≤15 m) thaw beneath newly-formed and expanding thermokarst lakes. AThaw lacks the CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect since plant uptake of atmospheric carbon is negligible in lakes when permafrost-carbon emissions dominate the first century of lake formation

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>; however, processes of lake drainage and carbon fluxes associated with plants colonizing drained lake basins are considered (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Here we summed gradual- and abrupt-thaw carbon fluxes as two independent processes, after avoiding double counting on the ≤ 6% land surface area occupied by abrupt thaw lakes. Fluxes are presented in carbon dioxide equivalents (C-CO
  <sub>2</sub>e) to account for the ~28 times larger global warming potential of CH
  <sub>4</sub> at the century time scale (GWP
  <sub>100</sub>)

  </span> (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). We also calculated the circumpolar permafrost-carbon radiative effect (CPCRE), which is the radiative forcing due to atmospheric perturbations in CH
  <sub>4</sub> and CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration for these permafrost-soil-carbon flux trajectories. Model results for years 1950–2017 are comparable to observational records from recent decades. Model results also reveal a significant increase to 21st century circumpolar permafrost-carbon emissions and associated radiative forcing by including warming-induced abrupt thaw beneath thermokarst lakes. These findings demonstrate the need to incorporate abrupt thaw processes in earth system models for more comprehensive projection of PCF this century.
