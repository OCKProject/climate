         <span>2</span>) is outweighed by gross lake area loss (i.e., lake drainage, 330 km
         <span>2</span>) for the same study extent (12,798 km
         <span>2</span> total lake area; Fig.

         when field-measured fluxes are applied to increasing and decreasing lake-area changes
         (Supplementary Table 
         <a>3</a>, Supplementary Note 
         <a>2</a>). Despite the net lake area loss, landscape-scale carbon emission to the atmosphere
         remains positive because conversion of upland terrestrial ecosystems with relatively
         low carbon fluxes (Supplementary Table 
         <a>5</a>) to newly formed thermokarst-lake areas with high CH
         <sub>4</sub> emissions results in a 130- to 430-fold increase in emissions per square meter of
         land surface change (Supplementary Table 
         <a>6</a>). The contrasting drainage of lower-emitting older portions of lakes and the establishment
         of productive, wetland vegetation in drained lake basins leads to smaller changes
         in carbon fluxes (factor of −0.004 to +0.08). Our net carbon emission estimate is
         likely conservative because the 30-m resolution Landsat-based analysis did not account
         for the formation and growth of numerous smaller CH
         <sub>4</sub>-emitting lakes that are only detectable with finer-resolution imagery (Supplementary

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An increase in abrupt thaw lake permafrost carbon emissions requires an acceleration
         of gross thermokarst lake area growth rates. Such an acceleration was observed in
         the early Holocene when the frequency of thermokarst-lake basal dates peaked in association
