 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the cumulative land area subject to abrupt thaw lake formation is less than one tenth of permafrost land areas (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4e, f</a>), our modeling results (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), supported by field work (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>) and remote sensing (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), show that an increase in the volume of newly thawed sub-lake sediments through expansion of existing and formation of new thermokarst lakes is likely to yield disproportionately large releases of 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C-depleted permafrost carbon to the atmosphere this century. The 27 Tg yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (15–50 Tg yr

  <sub>4</sub> emissions from newly-formed lakes by mid-century for RCP8.5 (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>), is similar to a recent, independent process-based model estimate by 2100 (27–38 Tg yr

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The moderate climate mitigation strategy (RCP4.5) requires a &gt; 50% reduction in anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions (i.e., −20 Gt CO

  <span class="sup">

  <span class="sup">−1</span> by 2100 for RCP4.5 and 8.5, respectively). However, they are of similar magnitude to the second most important anthropogenic source after fossil fuels [Land Use Change emissions 3.5 ± 1.8 Gt CO

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to shallow, gradual thaw that may rapidly re-form permafrost upon climate cooling, deep, CH

  <sub>4</sub> and CO
  <sub>2</sub> is irreversible in the 21st century. This irreversible, abrupt thaw climate feedback is large enough to warrant continued efforts toward integrating mechanisms that speed up deep permafrost-carbon thaw and release into large-scale models used to predict the rate of Earth’s climate change.
