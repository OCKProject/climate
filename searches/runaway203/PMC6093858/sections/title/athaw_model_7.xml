 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AThaw is a conceptual model which projects carbon release from abrupt thaw by accounting for the full chain of processes from formation of new thermokarst lakes under global warming and talik deepening in sub-lake sediments to eventual carbon release to the atmosphere following anaerobic microbial degradation of organic matter and CH
  <sub>4</sub> oxidation. AThaw also accounts for lake drainage; although, carbon fluxes in drained lake basins are not modeled

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>. AThaw is incorporated into a multi-box permafrost-carbon release model which allocates soil organic matter into latitudinally and vertically gridded boxes of differing conditions regarding soil physics, carbon quantity and quality, and biogeochemistry

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Briefly, AThaw model resolution consists of (a) 20 latitudinal bands, ranging from 45°N to 85°N with a 2° gridding, and of (b) 27 vertical soil layers corresponding to layer thicknesses of 25 cm for the upper 4 m, and of 1 m thickness for the depth range of 4–15 m. AThaw assumes typical soil organic matter residence times in permafrost soils, which are determined by partitioning into passive, slow, and fast cycling carbon pools with decomposition timescale parameters based on incubation experiments. Q
  <sub>10</sub> temperature sensitivity is accounted for as well as CH

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AThaw assumes that increasing Arctic temperatures will drive expansion of existing lakes and new thermokarst-lake formation by melting of near-surface ground ice and subsequent ground subsidence. This assumption is in line with Community Land Model (CLM4.5) results from Lee et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
  </span>, whereby surface excess ice in permafrost soils of many regions will largely melt by 2100 when subject to intense warming. AThaw assumes that comparatively small 19th and 20th-century warming rates have initiated some formation of new but rather shallow thermokarst lakes with likely winter-refreeze of lake bottom sediments. Start of abrupt thaw (i.e., formation of sub-lake taliks) is only assumed to occur for stronger warming starting in the 21st century and beyond. The evolution of newly-formed thermokarst lakes is parameterized in AThaw by an optimum function which non-linearly scales the latitudinal thermokarst lake area fraction by the surface air temperature anomaly

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). The lake formation scheme models an increase of newly-formed thermokarst-lake areas with temperature until a maximum extent [F
  <span class="sup">TKLmax</span> (~8 to ~40% increase, depending on soil type)], is reached under a temperature optimum dT′
  <span class="sup">TKLmax</span>. The temperature optimum corresponds to high-latitude surface air temperatures 4–6 °C above pre-industrial; warming above this optimum shifts 21st century lake dynamics toward net drainage. Such responses of thermokarst lake formation to temperature increases are not unprecedented, given that the early Holocene Arctic temperature increase of 1.6 °C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span> resulted in a 570% increase in thermokarst-lake formation rates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. AThaw-projected increases in lake area are lower for 2010–2100 compared to the early-Holocene observational record, because permafrost soils are now more protected from warming and thawing by thick organic soil surfaces
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span> and less likely to form large lakes compared to the less dissected early Holocene periglacial landscape
