 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AThaw simulates pan-Arctic CH
  <sub>4</sub> (CH
  <sub>4TKL</sub>) and CO
  <sub>2</sub> (CO
  <sub>2TKL</sub>) release from thermokarst lakes proportional to the amount of newly-thawed carbon that becomes vulnerable to microbial decomposition. The volume of this newly-thawed carbon expands vertically by talik growth in sub-lake sediments and horizontally by increases in the extent to which thermokarst lakes cover the landscape. Here we discuss how these two processes, vertical and horizontal growth, are captured in AThaw and how they compare to other modeling studies and observational evidence.
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, AThaw simulates vertical talik growth rates beneath lakes as a function of atmospheric temperature anomalies, which in turn determine lake bottom temperatures and ultimately drive sub-lake sediment warming. Thaw rates are assumed to depend on soil ice contents, mean ground temperature, depth of the thaw front, and are tuned to reproduce talik deepening simulated by Kessler et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. For instance, AThaw simulates typical talik depth beneath lakes of 11 m (7.8–13.4 m, 68% uncertainty range; 20 m max) in warm permafrost environments (i.e., mean annual soil temperatures close to 0 °C) with mineral soils by the year 2050 under RCP8.5. Our helicopter-borne electromagnetic measurements of sites with comparable climatic and soil conditions (i.e., relatively warm permafrost temperatures between −3 and −1°C) (Supplementary Information) have inferred lake talik growth of 8–15 m in &lt; 50 years (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). It should be noted that advective heat transport by groundwater can accelerate vertical thaw; maximum reported thaw rates are up to a meter per year
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
  </span>. When accounting for the effect of ground subsidence in a modeling context, Westermann et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
  </span> suggest that several meters of ground ice can be removed in less than a decade. The authors simulated a talik growth of 15 m by 2100 under RCP8.5 for a site characterized by yedoma ice complex in cold, continuous permafrost. In contrast, AThaw simulates 6 m (4–8 m, 68% range) talik depth under comparable climatic conditions by end of the century. Therefore, given modeling and observational evidence, we consider that the thaw rates in sub-lake sediments simulated by AThaw are relatively conservative.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second key AThaw model assumption concerns simulated thermokarst-lake expansion in a warmer climate. Central to this aspect is the question to which extent newly-formed thermokarst lakes will cover degrading permafrost landscapes in a warmer climate. AThaw assumes that future thermokarst-lake formation will strongly depend on soil conditions (e.g., ice content) and landscape morphology. Therefore, the model assumes different maximum lake formation extents for four different ice-rich soil type distributions in the permafrost region of the Arctic: mineral soil (Orthels and Turbels), organic soils (Histels), undisturbed yedoma, and refrozen thermokarst deposits in the yedoma region (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). Orthels, Turbels and Histels follow the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>
  </span>, while undisturbed yedoma and refrozen thermokarst deposits in the Pleistocene-aged ice-rich yedoma soil region are distinguished according to Strauss et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>
  </span> and Walter Anthony et al.
  <span class="sup">

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For mineral soils, AThaw assumes that newly-formed lakes can degrade a maximum fraction F
  <span class="sup">TKLmax</span> of 7% (4–9%, 68% range; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>) of the landscape. Given the large-scale dominance of mineral soils in the permafrost region soil carbon inventory (540 Pg C, NCSCD)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>
  </span>, this soil class contributes significantly to cumulative pan-arctic CH
  <sub>4TKL</sub> (at year 2100, 46% for RCP8.5, 28% for RCP4.5). Organic soils (120 Pg C, NCSCD)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>
  </span> are typically richer in ground ice than mineral soils and therefore AThaw assumes a factor two larger potential for the formation of new thermokarst lakes [F
  <span class="sup">TKLmax</span> of 14% (10–17%, 68% range; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>)]. This soil type contributes 17% for RCP8.5 and 14% for RCP4.5 to cumulative pan-arctic CH
  <sub>4TKL</sub>. AThaw explicitly accounts for ice- and organic-rich soils in yedoma regions, separated into undisturbed yedoma landscapes (80 Pg C)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>
  </span> and drained lake basins in the yedoma region that subsequently formed permafrost following lake drainage (refrozen thermokarst; 240 Pg C)
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>
  </span>, both soil classes are assigned a high potential for the formation of new thermokarst lakes once rising temperatures have resulted in ground subsidence. Given the high volumetric ice contents of refrozen drained thermokarst lake basins (&gt; 50%)
  <span class="sup">

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>, AThaw assumes a maximum F
  <span class="sup">TKLmax</span> of 21% (11–27%, 68% range; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). Refrozen thermokarst basins in the yedoma region cover only about 4% of the permafrost domain of the Arctic, but they contribute 28% under RCP8.5 (38% under RCP4.5) to cumulative pan-arctic CH
  <sub>4TKL</sub> by 2100. The highest potential for new-lake formation is assumed for unaltered ice-rich yedoma soils, where volumetric segregated ice content is typically 47–53% and high wedge-ice volumes (~40%) further increase permafrost ice concentration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>

  </span>, we consider a factor two reduced lake-forming potential plausible, especially under the assumption of strong future warming. While undisturbed yedoma landscapes constitute our carbon pool with the smallest areal extent (covering 0.41 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, 2% of the permafrost domain)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>

  <sub>4TKL</sub> by 2100, revealing the importance of carbon release from deep deposits beneath abruptly-formed yedoma thermokarst lakes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We derived estimates of present-day abrupt-thaw emissions from AThaw and independently from upscaling observations. The estimated emission range from AThaw [20 (7–49) Tg C-CO
  <sub>2</sub>e yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>] represents the median and 68% uncertainty range for years 2011–2017 (Supplementary Data 
  <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">1</a>). The observation-based estimate (19–58 Tg C-CO
  <sub>2</sub>e yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was derived by upscaling observed lake carbon fluxes from abrupt-thaw features (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) to the extent of observed gross lake expansion areas (5–15%) among pan-arctic regions during the past 60 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. This range of gross lake expansion is comparable to our observation of gross lake-area increase in northern and western Alaska (i.e., 1999–2014, 1.1–1.7% gross lake area increase upscaled to 5–7% assuming similar expansion/formation rates over the past 60 years; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). We acknowledge that present-day emissions associated with abrupt thaw may be conservative since gross lake-area increases in some regions are higher (e.g., &gt; 50% in Quebec
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>
  </span> and &gt; 23% in West Siberia
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>
  </span>), potentially due to hydrological changes in addition to permafrost thaw.
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The formation/expansion of new thermokarst-lake areas and subsequent sub-lake talik growth is not the only mechanism of abrupt permafrost degradation making newly thawed permafrost carbon available for microbial decomposition. Further contribution comes from talik growth of present-day lakes which have not yet formed a deep talik and still store large amounts of labile carbon in sub-lake sediments. For instance, on the Alaska North Slope, Arp et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> demonstrated that a rapid decrease in lake-ice thickness and duration has already led to many shallow lakes transitioning from bed-ice fast lakes underlain by permafrost to floating ice lakes that have started to develop taliks. This talik formation takes place about 70 years before talik formation is projected for the adjacent terrestrial environment by top-down permafrost models in this cold continuous permafrost zone, a feedback process also not accounted for in AThaw or other models of permafrost degradation. These and other non-lake modes of abrupt thaw

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>, are not explicitly accounted for in the AThaw model description; hence, we consider our assumed F
