         gases carbon dioxide (CO
         <sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) estimates indicate 23–174 Pg of permafrost

         abrupt thaw.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thermokarst, the most widespread form of abrupt permafrost thaw
         <span><a>13</a></span>, occurs when soil warming melts ground ice, causing land surface collapse
         <span><a>14</a>,
            <a>15</a></span>. Water pooling in collapsed areas leads to formation of taliks (unfrozen thaw bulbs)
         beneath expanding lakes, accelerating permafrost thaw far faster and deeper than would
         be predicted from changes in air temperature alone
         <span><a>16</a>–

         collapse scars, are extensive across northern landscapes with ice-rich permafrost

                  by ebullition from thaw bulbs beneath thermokarst lakes are seasonally trapped in

                  Ebullition hotspots are indicative of abrupt thaw environments, where the rapid (decadal-scale)

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we re-analyzed model output from an earth system model, the Community Land Model
         version 4.5 (CLM4.5BGC)
         <span><a>7</a></span>, to identify the carbon-emissions fraction originating from gradual permafrost thaw
         on land, and to quantify the increase to 21st-century circumpolar permafrost-carbon
         emissions by including warming-induced abrupt thaw beneath thermokarst lakes. Our
         abrupt thaw emissions are derived from a vertically- and latitudinally-resolved box
         model of permafrost carbon processes, including a novel component conceptually describing
         circum-Arctic thermokarst-lake dynamics and related carbon release
         <span><a>23</a></span>, which we refer to here as the Abrupt Thaw (AThaw) model (Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CLM4.5BGC and AThaw differ in model complexity, forcing parameters, and resolution
         (Methods), but both include basic sets of permafrost processes and multiple soil organic
         carbon pools for projecting permafrost-carbon dynamics
         <span><a>7</a>,
            <a>23</a></span>. CLM4.5BGC focuses on gradual, homogenous thaw affecting only surface permafrost
         (&lt; 3 m) across the landscape. It also accounts for carbon cycling in the seasonal
         active layer and stimulation of plant growth by future elevated atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations and increased nitrogen mineralization with increasing soil organic
         matter decomposition
         <span><a>7</a></span>. In contrast, AThaw simulates the more heterogeneous process of abrupt, deeper (≤15 m)
         thaw beneath newly-formed and expanding thermokarst lakes. AThaw lacks the CO
         <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect since plant uptake of atmospheric carbon is negligible in lakes
         when permafrost-carbon emissions dominate the first century of lake formation
         <span><a>16</a>,
            <a>24</a></span>; however, processes of lake drainage and carbon fluxes associated with plants colonizing
         drained lake basins are considered (Supplementary Note 
         <a>1</a>). Here we summed gradual- and abrupt-thaw carbon fluxes as two independent processes,
         after avoiding double counting on the ≤ 6% land surface area occupied by abrupt thaw
         lakes. Fluxes are presented in carbon dioxide equivalents (C-CO
         <sub>2</sub>e) to account for the ~28 times larger global warming potential of CH
         <sub>4</sub> at the century time scale (GWP
         <sub>100</sub>)
         <span><a>12</a></span> (Supplementary Table 
         <a>2</a>). We also calculated the circumpolar permafrost-carbon radiative effect (CPCRE),
         which is the radiative forcing due to atmospheric perturbations in CH
         <sub>4</sub> and CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration for these permafrost-soil-carbon flux trajectories. Model results for
         years 1950–2017 are comparable to observational records from recent decades. Model
         results also reveal a significant increase to 21st century circumpolar permafrost-carbon
         emissions and associated radiative forcing by including warming-induced abrupt thaw
         beneath thermokarst lakes. These findings demonstrate the need to incorporate abrupt thaw
         processes in earth system models for more comprehensive projection of PCF this century.
