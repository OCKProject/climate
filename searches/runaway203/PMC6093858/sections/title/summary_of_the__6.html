      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Permafrost-region 21st-century soil carbon emissions are compared between two model
         types using IPCC RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Both models represent basic sets of permafrost
         processes and have multiple soil organic carbon pools, but the models differ in their
         complexity of how individual processes are described. While CLM4.5BGC
         <span><a>7</a></span> simulates the full physical interactions between the atmosphere and the soil, including
         vegetation uptake of CO
         <sub>2</sub>, AThaw parameterizes soil thaw rates, depending on ground thermal properties, mean
         annual ground temperatures, active layer depth, and magnitude of the regional warming
         anomaly which drives permafrost degradation
         <span><a>23</a></span>. In its current model design, CLM4.5BGC simulates gradual thaw in terrestrial uplands.
         We utilized CLM4.5BGC emission data for years 1950–2100 partitioned according to non-permafrost
         carbon, originating from present-day active layer horizons, and permafrost carbon,
         which becomes thawed from the top down as active layer gradually deepens. In contrast,
         the more simplistic, but therefore more flexible model design in AThaw also allows
         for abrupt thaw under thermokarst lakes by tuning model parameters to simulated talik
         growth rates of a physically-based thermokarst-lake model
         <span><a>16</a></span>. Newly-formed thermokarst lakes and laterally-expanding lake margins are a large
         net source of atmospheric CH
         <sub>4</sub> and CO
         <sub>2</sub>, in contrast to mature thermokarst-lake stages, where fluxes are lower (Supplementary
         Tables 5 and 6). AThaw simulates only the carbon emissions from newly thawed sub-lake
         sediments comprising contributions from expansion of thaw lakes present since 1850,
         and from new lake initiation in response to warming after the year 1850. AThaw does
         not simulate fluxes for older lake areas already present on the landscape at year
         1850. Further, permafrost degradation in CLM4.5BGC is driven by spatially resolved
         climatic forcing fields, while AThaw focuses on large-scale latitudinal climatic gradients.
         In addition to differences in spatial resolution, CLM4.5BGC is more complete, simulating
         a large set of climate variables which all determine surface vegetation and soil conditions,
         while AThaw considers surface air temperatures only as the key driver for the net
         balance of lake expansion versus drainage.
