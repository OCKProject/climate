      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the cumulative land area subject to abrupt thaw lake formation is less than
         one tenth of permafrost land areas (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>4e, f</a>), our modeling results (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>), supported by field work (Figs 
         <a>1</a> and 
         <a>5</a>) and remote sensing (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>), show that an increase in the volume of newly thawed sub-lake sediments through
         expansion of existing and formation of new thermokarst lakes is likely to yield disproportionately
         large releases of 
         <span>14</span>C-depleted permafrost carbon to the atmosphere this century. The 27 Tg yr
         <span>−1</span> (15–50 Tg yr
         <span>−1</span>, 68% range) increase in CH
         <sub>4</sub> emissions from newly-formed lakes by mid-century for RCP8.5 (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>6</a>), is similar to a recent, independent process-based model estimate by 2100 (27–38
         Tg yr
         <span>−1</span>)
         <span><a>44</a></span> and is nearly triple the 10 Tg yr
         <span>−1</span> rise in global human and natural sources of atmospheric CH
         <sub>4</sub> observed from 2003 to 2012
         <span><a>60</a></span>. Other non-lake mechanisms of abrupt thaw, such as thermoerosional gullies, thaw
         slumps, and peat-plateau collapse scars, will increase permafrost-carbon emissions
         further

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The moderate climate mitigation strategy (RCP4.5) requires a &gt; 50% reduction in anthropogenic
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions (i.e., −20 Gt CO
         <sub>2</sub> yr
         <span>−1</span>) by 2100 compared to the current level
         <span><a>61</a></span>. Our projected permafrost emissions are comparatively small (1.5–4.2 Gt CO
         <sub>2</sub>e yr
         <span>−1</span> by 2100 for RCP4.5 and 8.5, respectively). However, they are of similar magnitude
         to the second most important anthropogenic source after fossil fuels [Land Use Change
         emissions 3.5 ± 1.8 Gt CO
         <sub>2</sub> yr
         <span>−1</span>], which has been relatively constant during the last 60 years
         <span><a>62</a></span>, implying that our projected permafrost emissions will provide a headwind in the
         goal to aggressively mitigate CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to shallow, gradual thaw that may rapidly re-form permafrost upon climate
         cooling, deep, CH
         <sub>4</sub>-yielding abrupt thaw is irreversible this century. Once formed, lake taliks continue
         to deepen even under colder climates
         <span><a>17</a></span>, mobilizing carbon that was sequestered from the atmosphere over tens of thousands
         of years. The release of this carbon as CH
         <sub>4</sub> and CO
         <sub>2</sub> is irreversible in the 21st century. This irreversible, abrupt thaw climate feedback
         is large enough to warrant continued efforts toward integrating mechanisms that speed
         up deep permafrost-carbon thaw and release into large-scale models used to predict
         the rate of Earth’s climate change.
