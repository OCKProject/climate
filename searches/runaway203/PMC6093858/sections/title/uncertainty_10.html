      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Uncertainty in AThaw modeled carbon fluxes is based on independent sampling of a set
         of 18 key model parameters which are subject to either observational or to model description
         uncertainty
         <span><a>23</a></span> (Supplementary TableÂ 
         <a>1</a>). For each warming scenario (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), 500 ensemble runs were performed
         by applying a statistical Monte Carlo sampling and by assuming uniformity and independence
         in the distributions of model parameters and initial values. AThaw results are presented
         as the median and 68% uncertainty range. We acknowledge that our ability to accurately
         quantify uncertainties is limited given the use of this single model and its assumptions
         in a highly complex and large system.
