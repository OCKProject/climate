      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AThaw is a conceptual model which projects carbon release from abrupt thaw by accounting
         for the full chain of processes from formation of new thermokarst lakes under global
         warming and talik deepening in sub-lake sediments to eventual carbon release to the
         atmosphere following anaerobic microbial degradation of organic matter and CH
         <sub>4</sub> oxidation. AThaw also accounts for lake drainage; although, carbon fluxes in drained
         lake basins are not modeled
         <span><a>24</a>,
            <a>63</a>–
            <a>65</a></span>. AThaw is incorporated into a multi-box permafrost-carbon release model which allocates
         soil organic matter into latitudinally and vertically gridded boxes of differing conditions
         regarding soil physics, carbon quantity and quality, and biogeochemistry
         <span><a>23</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Briefly, AThaw model resolution consists of (a) 20 latitudinal bands, ranging from
         45°N to 85°N with a 2° gridding, and of (b) 27 vertical soil layers corresponding
         to layer thicknesses of 25 cm for the upper 4 m, and of 1 m thickness for the depth
         range of 4–15 m. AThaw assumes typical soil organic matter residence times in permafrost
         soils, which are determined by partitioning into passive, slow, and fast cycling carbon
         pools with decomposition timescale parameters based on incubation experiments. Q
         <sub>10</sub> temperature sensitivity is accounted for as well as CH
         <sub>4</sub> oxidation [for details see Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a> and Schneider von Deimling et al.
         <span><a>23</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AThaw assumes that increasing Arctic temperatures will drive expansion of existing
         lakes and new thermokarst-lake formation by melting of near-surface ground ice and
         subsequent ground subsidence. This assumption is in line with Community Land Model
         (CLM4.5) results from Lee et al.
         <span><a>66</a></span>, whereby surface excess ice in permafrost soils of many regions will largely melt
         by 2100 when subject to intense warming. AThaw assumes that comparatively small 19th
         and 20th-century warming rates have initiated some formation of new but rather shallow
         thermokarst lakes with likely winter-refreeze of lake bottom sediments. Start of abrupt
         thaw (i.e., formation of sub-lake taliks) is only assumed to occur for stronger warming
         starting in the 21st century and beyond. The evolution of newly-formed thermokarst
         lakes is parameterized in AThaw by an optimum function which non-linearly scales the
         latitudinal thermokarst lake area fraction by the surface air temperature anomaly
         <span><a>23</a></span> (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). The lake formation scheme models an increase of newly-formed
         thermokarst-lake areas with temperature until a maximum extent [F
         <span>TKLmax</span> (~8 to ~40% increase, depending on soil type)], is reached under a temperature optimum
         dT′
         <span>TKLmax</span>. The temperature optimum corresponds to high-latitude surface air temperatures 4–6 °C
         above pre-industrial; warming above this optimum shifts 21st century lake dynamics
         toward net drainage. Such responses of thermokarst lake formation to temperature increases
         are not unprecedented, given that the early Holocene Arctic temperature increase of
         1.6 °C
         <span><a>37</a></span> resulted in a 570% increase in thermokarst-lake formation rates
         <span><a>24</a></span>. AThaw-projected increases in lake area are lower for 2010–2100 compared to the early-Holocene
         observational record, because permafrost soils are now more protected from warming
         and thawing by thick organic soil surfaces
         <span><a>67</a></span> and less likely to form large lakes compared to the less dissected early Holocene
         periglacial landscape
         <span><a>52</a></span>.
