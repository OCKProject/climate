 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To avoid double counting CLM4.5BGC emissions from land areas that become thermokarst lakes in AThaw, and to account only for the increase in emissions and CPCRE caused by abrupt thaw, we have subtracted from the AThaw emissions and CPCRE, in our total permafrost landscape calculations, the quantity of carbon emissions and associated radiative forcing already assumed to be emitted from those land surfaces from CLM4.5BGC. We used the AThaw thermokarst-lake area fraction at each time step for each of the four soil classes (Supplementary Fig.Â 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>) and weighted those fractions by the areal extent of the soil classes according to Hugelius et al.

  </span> based on the implicit assumption of homogenous soil carbon distribution within each of the soil classes. Our calculations consider that this fraction of the land surface, subject to gradual thaw in CLM4.5BGC, undergoes abrupt thaw instead.
