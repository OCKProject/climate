      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rather than simulating individual lake life cycles of formation, expansion, drainage,
         and re-initiation of later generation lakes (e.g., ref. 
         <span><a>43</a></span>), AThaw quantifies the net effect of new lake formation and drainage in modelled
         lake areas (F
         <span>TKL</span>). We capture a wide range of uncertainty in net lake formation and drainage trajectories
         by varying two key model parameters: The maximum net lake area, F
         <span>TKLmax</span>, and the optimum high latitude surface temperature increase, dT′
         <span>TKLmax</span> (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). Model parameters for the maximum lake area extent (F
         <span>TKLmax</span>) were chosen individually for the four AThaw soil classes to capture expected differences
         in the potential for future lake development (see Methane and CO
         <sub>2</sub> in newly-formed thermokarst lakes). However, the parameter that most strongly controls
         the dynamics of thermokarst lake formation and drainage is the temperature optimum,
         dT′
         <span>TKLmax</span>, the temperature at which the maximum lake area occurs. We prescribed a mean estimate
         of 5 °C for dT′
         <span>TKLmax</span> (i.e., high latitude surface air warming above pre-industrial) and consider a full
         range of 4–6 °C in our model ensemble. This parameter choice is based on paleoenvironmental
         evidence of Early Holocene warming by a few degrees Celsius in Northern Hemisphere
         land areas
         <span><a>37</a>,
            <a>68</a>,
            <a>69</a></span> which resulted in rapid and intensive thermokarst activity
         <span><a>24</a>,
            <a>29</a>,
            <a>70</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This range of dT′
         <span>TKLmax</span> values was also chosen to capture the sensitivity of future surface ice-wedge melt
         to climate warming, since ice-wedge melt is a critical step in thermokarst lake formation
         and drainage. Increases in permafrost temperature, which typically mirror increases
         in air temperature, have been observed in many Arctic regions, with warming of up
         to 3 °C since the 1970’s in some of the coldest permafrost regions
         <span><a>3</a>,
            <a>38</a>,
            <a>71</a></span>. Permafrost warming is often accompanied by active layer deepening and increased
         ground-ice melt. Widespread surficial degradation of ice wedges and a significant
         increase in areas of water-filled polygonal troughs has been linked to climatic warming
         during the past few decades in northern Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and
         Siberia
         <span><a>14</a>,
            <a>15</a>,
            <a>41</a></span>. Additional permafrost warming on the order of 2–3 °C anticipated by 2050 for RCP4.5
         and RCP8.5
         <span><a>49</a></span>, is expected to intensify permafrost and surface ice wedge degradation
         <span><a>66</a></span>, enhancing thermokarst. For RCP4.5, permafrost warming slows beyond 2050
         <span><a>49</a></span>, supporting AThaw ensembles of lower net thermokarst lake formation during the latter
         part of the century (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). In contrast, extreme warming after
         2050 for RCP8.5 is expected to heavily degrade permafrost, such that near-surface
         permafrost disappears entirely from many arctic regions
         <span><a>49</a></span>. These conditions lend support to AThaw parameterization, which leads to net lake
         drainage in the later part of the century for RCP8.5.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In AThaw, warming above the temperature optimum in the 21st century is assumed to
         lead to a reduction in AThaw lake area due to increasing lake drainage
         <span><a>23</a>,
            <a>43</a>,
            <a>45</a></span>, until a prescribed minimum fraction F
         <span>TKLmin</span> remains. The minimum fraction of the landscape still covered by newly formed lakes,
         decreases from north to south
         <span><a>23</a></span>. In northern, continuous permafrost regions, lakes in AThaw are prescribed to drain
         laterally as melting of the ice-wedge network in the surface surrounding lakes can
         create drainage pathways
         <span><a>52</a></span>. Other mechanisms of lake drainage include bank overtopping, headward gully erosion
         towards a lake; and tapping of lakes by streams, rivers, or other water bodies
         <span><a>36</a></span>. Higher drainage potential in southern, discontinuous permafrost regions also encompasses
         internal drainage of lake water through open taliks that penetrate thin permafrost
         in groundwater recharge settings
         <span><a>54</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the 4–6 °C dT′
         <span>TKLmax</span> range used in our modeling was prescribed based on paleoenvironmental evidence, historical
         observations, and modeling of future permafrost dynamics, we can consider the implications
         of using smaller or larger dT′
         <span>TKLmax</span> values. Smaller dT′
         <span>TKLmax</span> values would imply that the maximum area of thermokarst lake coverage would occur
         earlier in the century. This would result in a relatively larger AThaw increase to
         the PCF earlier in the 21st century and a lower AThaw contribution to PCF toward the
         end of the century due to more widespread drainage. If dT′
         <span>TKLmax</span> aligned more closely with the range of simulated high latitude warming inferred from
         higher concentration pathways (e.g., dT′
         <span>TKLmax</span> &gt; 6 °C), we would expect maximum thermokarst lake coverage (i.e., F
         <span>TKLmax</span>) to occur later in the century, less drainage of AThaw lakes during the 21st century,
         and a larger relative contribution of AThaw to end-of-the century PCF under stronger
         future warming.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is interesting to note that that while thermokarst-lake initiation and drainage
         rates are linked to climate, thermokarst-lake growth—the long process between initiation
         and drainage that results in most of the carbon release—has dynamics (e.g., talik
         growth, shore expansion) that once started become rather decoupled from climate due
         to strong linkage with local factors such as ground ice content and ice-layer thickness
         <span><a>72</a>–
            <a>75</a></span>. Hence, thermokarst lakes are found across the entire range of Arctic climatic zones
         and permafrost temperatures as long as there is sufficient ground ice
         <span><a>36</a>,
            <a>76</a>,
            <a>77</a></span>. A thermokarst lake on the New Siberian Islands has the same potential to release
         carbon as a thermokarst lake in Central Yakutia; the differences are largely not determined
         by climate (or RCP conditions) but by local conditions such as permafrost soil carbon
         and ground ice contents. Hence, either RCP scenario will result in more lakes (earlier
         or later) and both scenarios will have a similar emission magnitude linked to maximum
         lake areas, but relative to anthropogenic emissions, the thermokarst lake emissions
         from RCP4.5 will be more relevant.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Factors other than temperature that are not included in AThaw, but which can also
         affect thermokarst lake dynamics include natural and anthropogenic surface disturbance,
         precipitation changes, and local topography
         <span><a>43</a></span>. However, since CMIP5 models consistently predict a moistening trend in the Arctic
         (i.e., an increase in precipitation relative to evapotranspiration)
         <span><a>51</a></span>, an explicit accounting for predicted 21st-century precipitation and evaporation
         trends would reinforce rather than weaken the AThaw lake dynamics driven by temperature
         changes alone.
