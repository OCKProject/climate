 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our observed 1999–2014 gross lake area gain (154 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) is outweighed by gross lake area loss (i.e., lake drainage, 330 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) for the same study extent (12,798 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> total lake area; Fig.

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>, Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Despite the net lake area loss, landscape-scale carbon emission to the atmosphere remains positive because conversion of upland terrestrial ecosystems with relatively low carbon fluxes (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>) to newly formed thermokarst-lake areas with high CH

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). The contrasting drainage of lower-emitting older portions of lakes and the establishment of productive, wetland vegetation in drained lake basins leads to smaller changes in carbon fluxes (factor of −0.004 to +0.08). Our net carbon emission estimate is likely conservative because the 30-m resolution Landsat-based analysis did not account for the formation and growth of numerous smaller CH

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An increase in abrupt thaw lake permafrost carbon emissions requires an acceleration of gross thermokarst lake area growth rates.
