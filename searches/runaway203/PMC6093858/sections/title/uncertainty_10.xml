  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). For each warming scenario (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), 500 ensemble runs were performed by applying a statistical Monte Carlo sampling and by assuming uniformity and independence in the distributions of model parameters and initial values. AThaw results are presented as the median and 68% uncertainty range. We acknowledge that our ability to accurately quantify uncertainties is limited given the use of this single model and its assumptions in a highly complex and large system.
