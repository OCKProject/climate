      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated the radiative forcing due to atmospheric perturbations in CH
         <sub>4</sub> and CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration for CLM and AThaw permafrost-soil-carbon flux trajectories following
         Frolking &amp; Roulet
         <span><a>87</a></span> (Supplementary Methods). Methodology underlying our remote-sensing based quantification
         of abrupt thaw in Alaska and field-based estimates of carbon emissions from abruptly-formed
         thermokarst areas of lakes in Alaska and Siberia are also provided inÂ Supplementary
         Methods. Field and lab measurements include bubble-trap observations of ebullition
         fluxes, aerial and ground-based ebullition seep-mapping, and quantification of CH
         <sub>4</sub> and CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations and radiocarbon dating.
