      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To avoid double counting CLM4.5BGC emissions from land areas that become thermokarst
         lakes in AThaw, and to account only for the increase in emissions and CPCRE caused
         by abrupt thaw, we have subtracted from the AThaw emissions and CPCRE, in our total
         permafrost landscape calculations, the quantity of carbon emissions and associated
         radiative forcing already assumed to be emitted from those land surfaces from CLM4.5BGC.
         We used the AThaw thermokarst-lake area fraction at each time step for each of the
         four soil classes (Supplementary Fig.Â 
         <a>4</a>) and weighted those fractions by the areal extent of the soil classes according to
         Hugelius et al.
         <span><a>80</a></span> and Strauss et al.
         <span><a>81</a></span> based on the implicit assumption of homogenous soil carbon distribution within each
         of the soil classes. Our calculations consider that this fraction of the land surface,
         subject to gradual thaw in CLM4.5BGC, undergoes abrupt thaw instead.
