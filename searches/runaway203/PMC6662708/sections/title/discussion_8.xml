 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been extensively documented that Antarctic marine species (metazoans) are highly stenothermal with extended periods of up to 8–9 months required for acclimation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. These previous evaluations were conducted in the laboratory and the experimental conditions could not capture natural variability, including complex abiotic and biotic interactions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. However, the sensitivities identified in the laboratory are re-enforced by this in situ experiment, with both expression profiling and acute UTL analyses showing a lack of acclimation in the spirorbids.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The composition and growth performance of Antarctic encrusting communities on heated settlement panels have previously been described
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. In the initial study, results demonstrated massive impacts of warming on the encrusting marine assemblages
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. The most surprising result was the near doubling of growth rates of the encrusting species, in particular the two main space colonisers the bryozoan 
  <span class="italic">Fenestrulina rugula</span> and the spirorbid 
  <span class="italic">Romanchella perrieri</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. The results were highly species-specific. On the +1 panels, colonies of 
  <span class="italic">F. rugula</span> were over double the size of those on control panels, while 
  <span class="italic">R. perrieri</span> increased in size by 70%. On the +2 panels, the colonies of 
  <span class="italic">F.rugula</span> were larger than those on control plates, but smaller than those on the +1 panels. In contrast 
  <span class="italic">R. perrieri</span> showed similar growth rates at both warming temperatures, while a second spirorbid 
  <span class="italic">P. stalagmia</span> increased in size by a further 20–30% compared with +1 animals. In terms of percentage cover and abundance, the presence of 
  <span class="italic">R. perrieri</span> was reduced with warming (7.5%, 2.0%, 1.26%: control, +1, +2 respectively), whereas that of 
  <span class="italic">P. stalagmia</span> was less so (4.5%, 3.25%, 3.5%). These elevated growth rates were maintained throughout the Austral summer (December–February). In March, when the ambient temperature started to fall and the phytoplankton bloom decayed (leading to a reduction in food for these filter feeders) growth rates changed, but again these varied according to species. The growth rates of 
  <span class="italic">F. rugula</span> on the heated panels declined faster than those on control panels; those of 
  <span class="italic">R. perrieri</span> showed little difference between treatments while growth rates of 
  <span class="italic">P. stalagmia</span> continued to increase
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. This experiment was terminated at the end of the Austral summer. This left open the question of whether these species had properly acclimated to chronic warming and built up sufficient energy reserves during the summer (which was also their period of most rapid growth) to survive the dearth of their food supply over the long Antarctic winter and maintain their elevated metabolic rates in subsequent years.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 2017 study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> purely focussed on survival, community composition and growth as area covered, which are not informative about the acclimation status of the animals. This is particularly true of the encrusting communities on the panels, which largely comprised bryozoans and spirorbids. These are small animals with highly calcareous exoskeletons, which are relatively robust and will persist long after the death of the animal
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Thus, expression profiling of a sub-set of individuals is a useful method for assaying animal health and physiological state at the cellular level
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. In this experiment, the responses of the spirorbid worms were used as models for the other spatially dominant filter feeding species on the panels. Expression profiling of the +1 animals revealed a highly active response to the warmer conditions with thousands of genes up-regulated compared to control animals. Relatively little differential expression would be expected between these two treatments, if acclimation had occurred, with the physiology of the +1 animals being re-set to that of the controls. Thus, the +1 animals were still unable to acclimate their physiologies to the warmer conditions, even after 18 months.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the higher temperature, analysis of the annotations associated with the up-regulated transcripts in the +2 animals revealed indications of cell stress and continued resistance to the warmer conditions. Almost one-third of the transcripts comprised ribosomal genes. Similarly, there was up-regulation of transcripts putatively involved in translation (e.g., translation elongation factors), protein degradation (e.g., ubiquitin and proteosome transcripts), cellular respiration (e.g., ATP synthase) and cell division (e.g., G2/mitotic-specific cyclin), indicating a substantial requirement for the enhanced generation of proteins, protein turnover and cell renewal in the warmer conditions (Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Critically a number of cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., actin, tubulin), proteins were also up-regulated. These proteins are increasingly being shown to play roles as stress sensors in marine invertebrates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> and there was also evidence of activation of the classical cellular stress response
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. This was represented by the presence of chaperone transcripts for the 70 and 90 kDa heat-shock proteins (HSP70s and HSP90s), T-complex proteins and antioxidants such as aldehyde dehydrogenase. This transcriptional profile indicates that the animals were exhibiting cellular stress, having serious difficulties with acclimating to the new conditions and potentially at, or close to, a tipping point in their abilities to survive
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. These expression profiles are incompatible with those expected of natural senescence, which would be typified by a general down-regulation and would not invoke the cellular stress response. Antarctic spirorbids can live 4–5 years (David K. A. Barnes, personal communication 2019), which is much longer than spirorbids in other regions of the planet. Spirorbids on control panels retrieved after 2.5 years were still alive and reactive (L. S. Peck, personal communication 2019). Thus, even with potentially accelerated ageing in the warm conditions, the timescale of these experiments was well within the natural life span of these animals. While the temperature tolerances of the spirorbids in the different treatments could be affected by body size, all of the animals tested were mature adults. Previous work indicates that there is likely to be a very small effect of body size in mature adults
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> and that this would not influence the results. The expression profiles indicate that while the spirorbids can grow rapidly under warming, they cannot sustain this rate indefinitely. This rapid growth may be a particular issue for filter feeders, where they have access to abundant food during the short Austral summer, but then have to maintain these enhanced metabolisms during the long winter, when phytoplankton are largely absent.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The molecular data were supported by the acute UTL trials, which were conducted on a closely related spirorbid species (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Unfortunately because of the limited numbers of 
  <span class="italic">P. stalagmia</span> individuals available, all the acclimation experiments could not be carried out on the same species. However, 
  <span class="italic">R. perrieri</span> is closely related to 
  <span class="italic">P. stalagmia</span> and fills the same ecological niche within this community. If the spirorbids had acclimated at the whole animal level, this would have been shown as an increase in their UTL
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. This did not occur and all animals on the warmer panels were in a permanent state of resistance and/or decline depending on the individual and temperature. The fact that this was still in process after 18 months exposure was probably a reflection of the low-energy lifestyle of these species and their very slowed metabolisms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. This highlights a potentially critical factor in understanding Antarctic marine species responses to climate change, that of extended decline. Such a process can only be evaluated using extremely long evaluations combined with molecular techniques, as persistence with decline may not be accompanied by outward morphological or even physiological signs in such long-lived, relatively inactive cold-adapted species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, even a +1–2 °C increase in the environment of these Antarctic encrusting species significantly impacts on cellular homoeostasis, a situation that is likely not sustainable long term, especially with regard to the ability of these animals to maintain enhanced growth rates and sufficient seasonal food stores to ensure longevity. This is in contrast to the previously longest exposure of 17 months to +2 °C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. In that study the sea urchin 
  <span class="italic">Sterechinus neumayeri</span> was exposed to the combined stresses of temperature and low pH in laboratory conditions and showed no significant physiological effects. In fact, reproductive capacity improved with time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. However, 
  <span class="italic">S. neumayeri</span> is a scavenger/detritivore and was fed constantly during the course of the experiment. That experiment further kept animals at constant temperatures, as do nearly all laboratory studies, and lacked the effects of winter seasonality. Our results suggest that the various feeding guilds may respond differently to climate change depending on access to food and/or that winter conditions and seasonality may have a role to play in species persistence.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the lack of acclimation in these animals, it was of interest to identify if there had been any differential survival of genotypes in relation to temperature. Bayenv2 was chosen as the analysis tool because it can identify associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables while accounting for sampling error in pooled data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Small but significant allele frequency differences were observed in a total of 91 genes (0.14% of the total number of transcripts obtained in this study) (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Blast searching and GO analysis of individual genes produced few annotations, but some transcripts had putative functions associated with translation, the cytoskeleton and serine/threonine kinases (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>), which linked directly with the major transcriptome results above. Overall, there was little evidence for differential survival of genotypes within the spirorbid population. These molecular and UTL results suggest a lack of physiological and genetic flexibility in the encrusting species to warming. The panels were clean when they were put into the water and then warmed up, during which colonisation took place. Hence, phenotypic plasticity could impact several stages, such as post-settlement development, early juvenile development and adult maturity. It is not possible under this experimental design to determine where phenotypic plasticity was constrained, but the overall result was a lack of physiological flexibility in the mature population.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To provide a contrast to the long-lived metazoan species, the bacterial biofilm communities (with very short generation times) were also evaluated on the heated panels. Biofilms are critical components of most marine systems and provide biochemical cues that can significantly impact overall community composition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Previous molecular analyses of biofilms cultured under different environmental conditions have shown dramatic alterations in community composition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. However, these experiments used short exposures of between 7 and 18 days and relatively high temperature increases (+3 and +5 and 6, 12 and 18 °C)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span> that have little relevance for climate change responses. Thus, they may not represent mature biofilm communities and the thermal responses tested were to conditions well in excess of IPCC medium-term scenarios
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. The data shown here represent more realistic predictions of the future responses of biofilms to climate change. Even though +1 and +2 °C above the ambient freezing temperatures of the Southern Ocean represented proportionally large increases in temperature, when compared with the same temperature increases applied to temperate or tropical systems, there were no significant changes in bacterial biofilm community composition with temperature as revealed by amplicon sequencing. This is in contrast to differences observed in the metazoan community assemblage at 9 months
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. This indicates a potentially large flexibility within bacterial physiologies to cope with changed conditions, but may also be due, at least in part, to their very short-generation times and therefore potential for adaptation and evolution in much shorter time periods.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the transcriptome analyses, there was limited annotation of the bacterial species. In this study, many of the oligotypes produced highest sequence similarities against uncultured marine bacteria (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) of the Gammaproteobacteria class, which was similar to the results obtained from benthic Antarctic marine biofilms around McMurdo station
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. However, improved sampling and annotation since the 2006 study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> did result in reassuringly high sequence similarities with two Antarctic and one Arctic metabarcoding study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. In the Antarctic, there is a lack of knowledge about most bacterial biofilms and their response to environment conditions. Of the few studies performed, results have indicated that Antarctic marine bacteria can thrive in wider temperature ranges when compared with the invertebrates. For example, a 
  <span class="italic">Pseudoalteromonas</span> species from the South Shetlands demonstrated growth over a temperature range of −2 to 18 °C, while a 
  <span class="italic">Cellulophaga</span> species from the same area survived up to 41 °C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>, which underpins the findings of bacterial thermal flexibility identified here. This finding also consolidates the hypothesis of greater resilience and adaptability of prokaryotic communities under future climate change compared with the high thermal sensitivity of the 
  <span class="italic">Metazoa</span>. Thus, ecosystem responses to future climate change are likely to be far more complex than previously anticipated.
