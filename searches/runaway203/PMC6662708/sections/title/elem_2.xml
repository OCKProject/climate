  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cellular responses to warming of the endemic biota on the heated panels were analysed via RNA-Seq expression profiling of the spirorbid (
   <span class="italic">P. stalagmia</span>). Assembly of the raw reads from all samples produced over five million contigs greater than 100 bp that contained over 4.28 Gb of data (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). A series of filtering steps (described in Transcriptome methods) provided a reference transcriptome containing 61,421 high-quality transcripts with the mean length of 486 bp and a total size of 29.92 Mb. Of these transcripts, 23.86% contained putative protein sequences, out of which 63.45% showed matches to known proteins from the Swiss-Prot database and 33.92% possessed functional information based on GO terms. While comprehensive searches were conducted using different sequence databases (e.g., Pfam, SignalP, TmHMM, eggnog, KEGG and GO), the most comprehensive annotations were provided by the Swiss-Prot database (BlastX and BlastP).

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differential expression analysis was then performed on the +1 and +2 samples, using the control samples as a baseline in both cases. In the +1 sample versus control analysis, a total of 14,631 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. The majority of these transcripts (13,034) were up-regulated in the +1 samples compared with the controls. Fewer transcripts were differentially expressed between the +2 samples and the controls (1020 in total) of which 1013 were up-regulated in the +2 samples and only 7 down-regulated. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the normalised and filtered expression data revealed there was significant separation between each set of samples (control, +1, and +2), with the first principle component explaining approximately 57% of the variance of the data (
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.004) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The PCA plot shows that while there is good separation between the +1 samples and both the other groups, one of the +2 samples clusters with the control samples, which may explain why fewer transcripts were differentially expressed in the +2 treatment compared to controls. GO enrichment analyses were performed to identify if specific metabolic pathways or functional groups were preferentially expressed in a particular treatment. These analyses showed significant enrichment below the threshold of the false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 for only the control versus +2 comparison, which meant that these processes were up-regulated and enriched in the +2 samples. There was a significant reduction in representation of GO categories involved in transcription (Molecular Function: rRNA binding and DNA directed 5′–3′ RNA polymerase activity) in the control samples compared with the +2 samples (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>).

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thousands of transcripts were up-regulated in the +1 treatment (14,631, or approximately 25% of the transcripts identified in this study), which indicated that even with +1 °C of warming, the animals had to significantly alter their cellular processes and cellular physiologies to accommodate to the new temperature. Given the lack of any GO enrichment for particular categories of gene functions and the large number of transcripts involved, more detailed analyses concentrated on the expression profiles of the +2 samples examining the annotation of the up-regulated transcripts. Of the 1013 transcripts up-regulated in the +2 animals (compared with controls), 312 were annotated via BlastX and BlastP searches (Supplementary Data 
   <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">1</a>). Most striking about this annotated gene set was the large-scale up-regulation of transcription and translation processes, comprising almost one-third of transcripts. The majority of these sequences were ribosomal genes, but elongation and translation factors were also present. These results corroborate the GO enrichment analyses described above (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Similarly there was up-regulation of transcripts putatively involved in cell division (e.g., G2/mitotic-specific cyclins, proliferation proteins), histones, which play major roles in chromatin organisation and regulation, transcripts for protein degradation (e.g., E3 ubiquitin ligases), and cellular respiration (e.g., cytochrome 
   <span class="italic">c</span> oxidases). A number of classical stress response transcripts were also up-regulated including numerous heat-shock proteins and other chaperone transcripts coding for T-complex proteins and peptidyl-prolyl 
   <span class="italic">cis</span>-
   <span class="italic">trans</span> isomerases (Supplementary Data 
   <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">1</a>). To identify critical biochemical pathways, the STRING programme was used to visualise protein–protein interactions and analyse enrichment. This uncovered statistically significant enrichment of certain functional groups of proteins (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 1.0e
   <span class="sup">−16</span>), with a major cluster of transcription and translation proteins and satellite clusters of proteins involved in post-translational modification, the cell cycle, cytoskeleton and energy production (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). PANTHER enrichment results, of the same dataset, were dominated by GO terms associated with RNA metabolism and cell division (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Overall, these data indicated the induction of the classical stress response to the warmer conditions and a lack of acclimation. The latter was further tested via acute UTL analysis.

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whole animal acclimation is traditionally tested using acute UTL analyses. Due to the limited representation of 
   <span class="italic">P. stalagmia</span> on the panels, a closely related spirorbid species (
   <span class="italic">R. perrieri</span>) was used to test UTLs associated with treatment, with animals taken from the same sets of panels, as were used as a source for the 
   <span class="italic">P. stalagmia</span> and the transcriptome experiments The UTL data supported the 
   <span class="italic">P. stalagmia</span> transcriptome analyses, with a lack of whole animal acclimation in 
   <span class="italic">R. perrieri</span> and a reduction in thermal resilience associated with increased panel temperature (Fig.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test for allele frequency differences among the treatments, a total of 13,843 SNPs were called from the RNA-Seq data according to strict criteria (see the Methods for details). Analysing each SNP individually resulted in no significant allele frequency differences among the groups after FDR correction (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). However, when the mean 
   <span class="italic">Z</span>-scores of SNPs across genes were assessed, 91 out of 521 genes (17.5%) showed a significant association with temperature after FDR correction (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). It should be noted that these 91 genes comprised only 0.14% of the total number of transcripts obtained in this study. GO annotations could only be recovered for 14 of these genes (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Blast matches were obtained against ribosomal sequences, cytoskeletal proteins and serine/threonine kinases (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The former are involved in translation, a result that corroborated the transcriptome and GO enrichment results. Cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and actin are structural proteins that are often involved in the cellular stress response, while serine/threonine kinases are proteins that play critical roles in signal transduction affecting cellular processes such as cell division, proliferation and apoptosis.

These rare oligotypes were similar in the presence and abundance across treatments. There were two exceptions that were slightly different across treatments in terms of percentage abundance. Rare oligotype 1 (GAGGTTAGTCTGATCTGGGACCCAACGT) was more abundant in the +2 samples (ranging from 17.7% to 25.6% of rare oligotypes) than in the +1 samples (5.9% to 7.7%) and absent in the control treatment.
