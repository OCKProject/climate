 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">UTLs were measured in 
  <span class="italic">R. perrieri</span> on heated panels from two sites to evaluate whole animal acclimation. The sites were North Cove and South Cove, described earlier. The animals were taken from the same panels in South Cove that were used as a source for 
  <span class="italic">P. stalagmia</span> for the transcriptome experiments. One heated settlement panel was used for each of the UTL experiments at each temperature, for each site (total of 6 panels), with 25 animals evaluated per panel (total of 150 animals in the experiment). Heated and non-heated panels (one each of control, +1, +2) from the South Cove/aquarium and North Cove sites colonised by 
  <span class="italic">R. perrieri</span> were transferred to a 60-L jacketed tank with aerated sea water at the same temperature as the ambient sea water (0 °C) and connected to a thermocirculator (Grant Instruments Ltd, Cambridge, UK). The temperature was raised at 1 °C h

UTL data were non-normal, even after transformations, so non-parametric statistical tests were used to analyse the data. A Mann–Whitney test verified that both the South Cove and North Cove data could be combined (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0896). A Kruskal–Wallis test was used to investigate if there was an effect of temperature on UTL compared with panel treatment and Mann–Whitney tests were subsequently used on these data to identify significance between panel treatments.
