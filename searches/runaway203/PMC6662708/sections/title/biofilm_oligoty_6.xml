 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, to compare the responses to warming in eukaryotes with prokaryotes, the panel biofilm communities from the different treatments (control, +1 and +2) were characterised using 16s amplicon sequencing. The results were subjected to Oligotyping analysis, which uses Shannon entropy

  </span> to identify positional variation in order to facilitate the identification of nucleotide positions of interest

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. This enables the detection and classification of distinct subpopulations within a genus or even within a single species as shown for

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. This technique does not rely on reference databases and clustering approaches to identify operational taxonomic units, which can often be problematical, as the complete reference genomes of known environmental organisms are often lacking in the databases

  </span>. Oligotyping results yielded 16 unique highly abundant oligotypes (&gt;1% relative abundance, comprising 90% of all reads from a total of 1,478,129 sequences) across all 14 samples. The abundance of each highly abundant oligotype varied across the treatments, although not significantly (PERMANOVA, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.16) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). The two most abundant oligotypes were TG (abundance of 12.8–19.9%) and AG (abundance of 5.8–11.5%) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), but these abundances were not significantly different between treatments (PERMANOVA, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> 
  <span class="italic">=</span> 0.2). Cluster analysis using Bray–Curtis similarity ratios obtained from normalised oligotype data revealed no biofilm community differences between the +1 and control treatments with both clustering together (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). The exception was one +1 sample which clustered with the +2 samples. The +2 community composition was more variable and different to the +1 and control treatment, with the exception of the single swab from the +1 community.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the oligotyping analysis, the minimum relative abundance threshold removed 350 rare oligotypes. However, given the lack of any association of the abundant oligotypes with temperature, further analyses were performed on these rare oligotypes to identify if they were more frequent with, or associated with, a particular treatment. These rare oligotypes were similar in the presence and abundance across treatments. There were two exceptions that were slightly different across treatments in terms of percentage abundance. Rare oligotype 1 (GAGGTTAGTCTGATCTGGGACCCAACGT) was more abundant in the +2 samples (ranging from 17.7% to 25.6% of rare oligotypes) than in the +1 samples (5.9% to 7.7%) and absent in the control treatment. The abundance of rare oligotype 2 (AGGTTGTTAACAGCTGAATCAACTG) was similar across treatments except in two of the +2 samples (17.2% and 25.6% of rare oligotypes) where it was more abundant than in any of the other samples and treatments (ranging from 0.2% in one control sample to 13.5% in other +2 samples).</p>
