 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test for allele frequency differences among the treatments, a total of 13,843 SNPs were called from the RNA-Seq data according to strict criteria (see the Methods for details). Analysing each SNP individually resulted in no significant allele frequency differences among the groups after FDR correction (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). However, when the mean 
  <span class="italic">Z</span>-scores of SNPs across genes were assessed, 91 out of 521 genes (17.5%) showed a significant association with temperature after FDR correction (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). It should be noted that these 91 genes comprised only 0.14% of the total number of transcripts obtained in this study. GO annotations could only be recovered for 14 of these genes (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Blast matches were obtained against ribosomal sequences, cytoskeletal proteins and serine/threonine kinases (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The former are involved in translation, a result that corroborated the transcriptome and GO enrichment results. Cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and actin are structural proteins that are often involved in the cellular stress response, while serine/threonine kinases are proteins that play critical roles in signal transduction affecting cellular processes such as cell division, proliferation and apoptosis.
