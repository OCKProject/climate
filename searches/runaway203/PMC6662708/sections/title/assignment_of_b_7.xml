 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This was carried out using BLAST sequence similarity searching. All of the sequence matches comprised uncultured marine bacteria and were often associated with biofilm studies. The majority of oligotypes were assigned to the phylum level, mainly representing Proteobacteria, with three (GA, AG, TG) matching members of the phylum Bacteriodetes and a single match to Verrucomicrobia. Only four oligotypes were assigned to the genus levels (TT, GC, TC, AG) of 
  <span class="italic">Granulosicoccus, Leucothrix, Shewanella</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Saprospira</span>, respectively. Antarctic studies are poorly represented in the databases and this was reflected in the fact that only two oligotypes (TT, CG) matched sequences from previous Antarctic studies, while an additional oligotype (TA) showed sequence similarity to data from an Arctic study (Supplementary TableÂ 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). Rare oligotype 1 revealed closest sequence similarity to 
  <span class="italic">Leucothrix</span> spp (accession number: HG934341), a gammaproteobacteria epiphyte isolated from a red algae in Chilean waters, while rare oligotype 2 most closely matched an uncultured marine bacteria of the gammaproteobacteria class (accession number: LC171298).
