 <p>The work was funded by NERC standard grant NE/J007501/1 awarded to L.S.P. which included a tied studentship awarded to L.V.N. and access to the Edinburgh facility (project references: 10742 and 11367). This work was also supported by a Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) grant to J.I.H. under project number HO 5122/7-1. The transcriptome Illumina sequencing and analyses were carried out by Edinburgh Genomics, The University of Edinburgh. Edinburgh Genomics is partly supported through core grants from NERC (R8/H10/56), MRC (MR/K001744/1) and BBSRC (BB/J004243/1). The biofilm amplicon sequencing was performed at the University of Cambridge, Department of Biochemistry Sequencing Facility. The authors would like to thank Mark Preston for his work on the development of the heated panels, the Rothera marine teams from 2013 to 2016 for help with maintenance and photography of the panels, especially Simon Morley and David Barnes and Ben Temperton at the University of Exeter for his advice on the biofilm analyses.</p>
