 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding why different species thrive or fail under changing environmental conditions is crucial for predicting future biodiversity. In terms of underlying mechanisms, acclimation and physiological flexibility have been proposed as the two main routes dictating the success or failure of species under future climate change scenarios, particularly for long-lived species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. This is based on the premise that genetic adaptation in species with long generation times and extended lifespans will not be rapid enough to enable animals to cope with the current rate of climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Thus, knowledge of the extent of phenotypic plasticity within populations and the capacity of genotypes to produce different phenotypes in response to environmental change is crucial in predicting how global biodiversity will be affected by future warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. However, obtaining knowledge of such mechanisms is particularly problematical in long-lived species, such as polar marine invertebrates. Their low metabolic rates and low-energy lifestyles mean that ecological observations of persistence in a warmer world do not necessarily correlate with fitness and population sustainability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Long-term experimental manipulations of these species is difficult due to the extended timescales (of years) needed for each chronic exposure experiment, as well as the difficulty in accurately reproducing the biotic and abiotic variables which occur in the natural environment over long periods.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Encrusting communities are ubiquitous and major contributors to benthic biodiversity and community dynamics globally
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Their ability to rapidly colonise hard substrata also has serious economic implications in terms of biofouling
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Hence, there is a major interest in how this community will perform under future climate change scenarios. However, such evaluations are now possible on encrusting (filter feeding) species due to the recent development of in situ heated settlement panels
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. This technology enables us to heat the thin surface layer of water (up to 5 mm) above the panels to +1 and +2 °C above ambient temperature, matching the 50 and 100 years predictions for warming in the Southern Ocean respectively
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. This system simulates oceanic warming predictions in the natural environment while maintaining natural cycles of temperature variation, light regime and food supply. The advantage of their use with polar species is that because these cold-adapted species grow very slowly (on average 5× slower than temperate species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>), even after two or more years, they do not outgrow the heated water layer. Hence, deployment of these panels in the polar regions provides an unparalleled opportunity to conduct ecologically relevant long-term studies and investigate the molecular mechanisms underpinning responses to chronic warming in threatened sub-zero marine ecosystems.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Antarctic Peninsula is a region of the globe that has experienced some of the most rapid rates of regional climate warming over the past 50 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Although there are indications that the atmospheric warming may have ceased, there is no evidence to suggest that this trend is reflected in oceanographic data, which reveal ongoing reductions in annual sea ice and glacier retreat
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. This has significant implications for the marine biota, especially the filter feeders
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. The reduction in sea ice alters water stratification and mixing, which directly affects the strength of the summer phytoplankton bloom
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. There is also evidence that warming is increasing the proportion of nanophytoplankton in the bloom and therefore changing food availability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. The Antarctic marine environment is highly seasonal and the long Antarctic winter results in a significant and prolonged reduction in phytoplankton
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Filter feeders need to ensure sufficient accumulation of food stores during the relatively short summer season to survive this famine through to the next bloom period
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Given the changing bloom conditions, filter feeders are more likely to be affected in the near future compared to non-filter feeding species (detritivores, carnivores etc) and are thus useful indicator species for the effects of climate change.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial 2017 heated settlement panel study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> demonstrated the massive impacts of warming on the encrusting marine assemblages, with a near doubling of growth rates of the encrusting species. This was a very surprising result, especially for such slow growing Antarctic species. Although the experiment was terminated at the end of the Austral summer, there were indications that animal growth rates were starting to slow alongside the decline in the phytoplankton bloom. This left open the questions of whether the encrusting species had acclimated to the new conditions in the long term and, in particular, if they had built up sufficient energy reserves to survive the dearth of their food supply over the long Antarctic winter and maintain their elevated metabolic rates in subsequent years.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, heated settlement panels were deployed for 18 months in Ryder Bay near Rothera Research Station, Antarctica. The prolonged timescale of the experiment enabled studies to encompass the critical winter period, described above. Multiple, complementary aspects of the responses of the settlement panel communities to warming were evaluated, with responses to warming assessed in both encrusting filter feeders and microbial biofilm communities. In this study, we specifically used the responses of spirorbids (calcified marine worms) as model species and proxies for the other encrusting community species on the panels. This was because they were not only present in sufficient numbers and of a sufficient size for the analyses undertaken, but they also showed the same response to warming as the other spatially dominant species on the panels in the original 2017 deployment
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Panels comprised controls (non-heated, experiencing ambient temperatures roughly between −2 and +1 °C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>) and two sets warmed to +1 and +2 °C above ambient sea water temperatures (referred to subsequently as +1 and +2). The health of the spirorbid species under warming was investigated using an RNA-Seq approach and expression profiling. Furthermore, acute Upper Thermal Limit (UTL) experiments were used to determine if physiological acclimation had occurred at the whole animal level. The RNA-Seq data were also interrogated for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate differential survival of genotypes between treatments using a population genetics approach. Microbial biofilms can significantly influence community composition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> and with their very short life cycles would be expected to show more variation in community composition with temperature. Therefore, to provide a contrast to the slow growing, slowly developing metazoan encrusting species, prokaryotic bacterial communities on the panels were also evaluated using amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we report the results of our 18-month study, which represents the longest acclimation trial on any Antarctic species to date. To our knowledge, it includes some of the longest in situ experimental manipulation of temperature anywhere in the oceans to date (9–18 months). Previous acclimation trials have revealed the very long timescales required for this process in Antarctic marine species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, but this study reveals the extraordinary sensitivity of the filter-feeding encrusting species to even +1 °C of warming. The small size and solid calcified exoskeletons of the spirorbids precludes the determination of animal health using visual observation, but molecular analyses using RNA-Seq show that they are unable to sustain cellular homoeostasis and are likely in a process of extended decline. Population genetic analyses also reveal little evidence for differential selection of genotypes with temperature. UTL analyses, furthermore, show no increase in UTL in the spirorbids on the warmer plates and therefore no acclimation at the whole animal level. There is no significant difference in the composition of bacterial biofilm communities with temperature and hence no impact of warming. This suggests that marine metazoan invertebrate and prokaryotic responses to warming are very different, which in turn implies that ecosystem responses to ongoing climate change are likely to be far more complex than previously anticipated.
