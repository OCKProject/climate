  <p>Latitudinal plots for predicted habitability from ecological niche modelling, using three binary thresholds: the 5th-, 10th- and 20th-percentiles of the lowest tail of habitat suitability values (5LPT, 10LPT and 20LPT). Plots indicate habitability for the LIG, modern, representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) and 8.5 (RCP8.5). In this instance, habitability is the sum of cells designated as habitable, within 5Â° latitudinal bins, by the mean prediction, trained on the (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) modern occurrence dataset, and (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) LIG occurrence dataset. Grey shaded area represents the extent of the tropics in the present day. Dashed lines indicate the Equator, the Northern Tropic and the Southern Tropic.
