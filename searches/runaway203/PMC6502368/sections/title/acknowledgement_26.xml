 <p>We are grateful for the efforts of all those who have collected modern-day and Pleistocene reef coral data, as well as those who have entered these data into the Ocean Biogeographic Information System and the Paleobiology Database (in particular Wolfgang Kiessling). We would also like to thank Getech Group Plc for supplying the digital elevation model used in this study. Helpful discussions with Neftal√≠ Sillero (University of Porto), Elena Couce (Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science) and Alessandro Chiarenza (Imperial College London) improved this work, as did comments from six anonymous reviewers. This is Paleobiology Database official publication number 340.</p>
