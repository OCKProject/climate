 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate variables for the modern (pre-industrial), LIG and two future (2100 AD) climate scenario simulations were derived from HadCM3M2.1N [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C36">36</a>], a version of UK Met Office HadCM3, a coupled atmosphere–ocean General Circulation Model (GCM). HadCM3 has been heavily used as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th and 5th assessment reports [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C37">37</a>] and successfully applied to studies of both present-day and LIG climate and biodiversity [

  <a rid="RSOS182111C42" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C42">42</a>]. Here, we use IPCC representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 for our future climate scenario simulations [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C43">43</a>]; a description of both is provided in electronic supplementary material, SM2. To further improve our ENMs, bathymetric data were extracted from Getech's present-day digital elevation model (DEM), which provides gridded representations of both the Earth's topography and bathymetry. A description of both the GCM and DEM used in this study is provided in electronic supplementary material, SM2, along with data preparation protocols.

  <a rid="RSOS182111C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C14">14</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS182111C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C34">34</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS182111C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C35">35</a>], and that can be viably determined for the fossil record from GCM outputs, were chosen to reflect abiotic niche characteristics (electronic supplementary material, SM2: table SM2). Initially, these variables were considered at several temporal levels: annual, seasonal and monthly. However, to reduce co-linearity between variables and prevent over-fitting, we retained the combinations of climate variables with a Pearson's pairwise correlation coefficient of less than 0.7 (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figures SM2–SM7). After enquiry, five environmental variables were used for final niche analysis: (i) mean annual SST; (ii) mean December–February irradiance; (iii) mean June–August irradiance; (iv) mean annual salinity; and (v) bathymetry. While we acknowledge that additional variables, in particular, aragonite saturation state, might be valuable for estimating reef coral distribution, not all variables can be viably approximated for the geological past. Despite this, several biophysical studies have shown that the fundamental niche of an organism can be reasonably approximated by a limited set of biologically important variables (e.g. [

  <a rid="RSOS182111C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C15">15</a>] demonstrated that high SST was the primary control on coral reef distribution, with high light availability, salinity, aragonite saturation state and low nutrient concentrations being of secondary significance. Nevertheless, we ran sensitivity analyses to compare modern projections from modern-trained models with and without aragonite saturation state to gauge the potential impact upon our results (provided in electronic supplementary material, SM2).
