 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to measure distribution dynamics, we first generated 24 binary maps from the ensemble models using two different training datasets (LIG reef corals and modern reef corals) and three different binary thresholds for the four climate scenarios (LIG, modern, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We selected three thresholds for binary conversion: the 5th-, 10th- and 20th-percentiles of the lowest tail of habitat suitability values (5LPT, 10LPT, 20LPT) associated with the occurrence data for each model to provide insight into habitability dynamics (see electronic supplementary material, SM2, for further details). As short-term observations are intrinsically biased and perhaps incomplete in both environmental and geographical space, we combined binary predictions generated from both LIG and modern training datasets. This was done for each time-slice/climate scenario to establish a multi-temporal approach, estimating the full geographical localities reef corals may occupy. We then assessed whether this approach improved the models' capability to predict the occurrence of both LIG and modern localities, which would have implications for forecasting under future climate scenarios. The latitudinal range and habitability of reef corals for past, present and future climatic scenarios were computed as a function of the sum of suitable cells, within 5° latitudinal bins, for each model class’ projections (LIG, modern and combined).</p>
