 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As previously noted, short-term observations of distribution dynamics can be inherently biased by a taxon not occupying its full geographical or environmental space. However, an additional fundamental question is whether environmental niches are conserved over evolutionary time scales [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C45" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C45">45</a>]. To evaluate this, we used the R-package ECOSPAT [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C46" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C46">46</a>] to quantify measures of niche margin dynamics (unfilling, expansion and stability). We also performed niche overlap analyses, testing for niche equivalency and similarity of the reef coral niches occupied across two temporal windows (LIG and modern). The ECOSPAT niche overlap analysis applies kernel smoothers to the densities of species occurrences in gridded environmental space, using a randomization test framework to compare observed equivalency and similarity to that anticipated under a null hypothesis [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C46" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C46">46</a>]. Both niche equivalency and similarity are quantified in terms of Schoener's

  <a rid="RSOS182111C47" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C47">47</a>], with values ranging from 0 (least equivalent or similar) to 1 (most equivalent or similar). We compared the subsampled occupied niches of LIG and modern reef corals using a principal component analysis (PCA-env), testing the null hypothesis by randomly sampling 5000 replicates of both LIG and modern niches. The PCA-env was calibrated with all five environmental variables implemented in the construction of our ENMs, and allowed us to assess differences in the occupied niche of reef corals from the LIG and modern (see [
