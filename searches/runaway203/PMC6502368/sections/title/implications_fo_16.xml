 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implications for the evolution of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attempts to reconstruct latitudinal biodiversity gradients in geological time have historically been achieved using direct reading of occurrence records [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C65">65</a>], potentially leading to circumscribed results [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C66">66</a>]. Although subsampling approaches have been applied in more recent studies, and provide more useful insights than uncorrected ‘raw’ diversity data [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C13">13</a>], they ultimately cannot predict which data we might be missing, i.e. fossils and/or palaeoenvironments that we have not sampled, or that never entered the fossil record [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C67" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C67">67</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS182111C68" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C68">68</a>]. Our model results suggest that the LIG reef coral record is geographically biased through the amount of predicted habitable area within latitudinal bins, herein referred to as the latitudinal habitability gradient. Thus, we predict that, given suitable preservational conditions, we should expect to find additional LIG reef coral occurrence data from equatorial latitudes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Modern-type’ latitudinal biodiversity gradients, with tropical peaks in diversity, have been suggested to form under cold icehouse climate regimes, whereas flattened gradients or temperate peaks are restricted to warmer greenhouse regimes [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C66">66</a>]. Additionally, it has been proposed that non-modern-type latitudinal biodiversity gradients might also form during interglacials [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C66">66</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS182111C69" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C69">69</a>]. However, based on modelled habitability, our findings imply a contrarian result for the LIG, and suggest that interglacials might not be warm enough to produce latitudinal biodiversity gradients similar to those we observe in greenhouse climate regimes.
