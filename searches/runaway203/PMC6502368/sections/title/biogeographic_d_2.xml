 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When implementing ENM, most studies have focused on analyses of individual species [

  <a rid="RSOS182111C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C30">30</a>–
  <a rid="RSOS182111C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C33">33</a>]. However, due to the relative rarity of fossil occurrence data at global scale, we use occurrence data at ecotype level (i.e. a group which shares specific environmental preferences). The responses of modern coral reefs to environmental variables are broadly similar at a global level, recognized as being limited to warm, clear and shallow water habitats [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modern coral occurrences were downloaded on 5 July 2017 from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS; 
  <span xlink:href="www.iobis.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.iobis.org</span>) using the search criteria ‘Scleractinia’, yielding 589 817 occurrences. Fossil coral occurrence data were accessed on 19 July 2017 through the Paleobiology Database (PBDB; 
  <span xlink:href="www.paleobiodb.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.paleobiodb.org</span>). The PBDB returned 8021 occurrences for Pleistocene Scleractinia. These datasets were then filtered to exclude data not identified to species level, as well as further quality control checks (e.g. synonymizations). We based our analyses on zooxanthellate corals, herein referred to as reef corals, which host unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae in their tissue, forming a photosymbiotic relationship [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C35">35</a>]. Assignment to zooxanthellate class focused on the principle of uniformitarianism for fossil coral taxa. Azooxanthellate (those without a photosymbiotic relationship) and apozooxanthellate (those which may or may not sustain a photosymbiotic relationship) corals were excluded from both databases. Further, quality control was performed on the OBIS dataset, whereby occurrences found to occur on land or at depths greater than 100 m were removed under the assumption that there were errors in their geographical coordinates, species identification or are in fact fossil occurrences. In addition, we omitted data collected from rapid ecological assessments to improve the credibility of species-level identification, as well as those from coral transplant studies. The PBDB data were filtered to exclude occurrences which cannot be reliably assigned to the LIG. Duplicate occurrence records of the same species from exactly the same coordinates were also removed from both datasets.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The resultant modern occurrence dataset contains 700 zooxanthellate species, comprising 48 577 occurrences with 3553 unique coordinates, while the LIG dataset contains 190 zooxanthellate species, comprising 1337 occurrences (from 301 collections) with 166 unique coordinates (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS182111F1" href="#RSOS182111F1">figure 1</a>; electronic supplementary material, SM1). In preparation of modelling, we clipped all occurrences by environmental layers to correspond with the environmental data. To account for species that have become extinct since the LIG, or that lack modern occurrence records in the OBIS, we excluded species which do not occur in both the clipped fossil and modern datasets. The final modern and fossil datasets comprise 157 shared species, composed of 22 726 modern reef coral occurrences and 1022 LIG reef coral fossil occurrences. Finally, point occurrences were spatially subsampled at a raster resolution of 1.25° × 1.25° to account for sampling bias. Subsampling resulted in the retention of 295 presence sites for modern reef corals and 56 for LIG reef corals (note that this does not affect the overall distribution, but prevents multiple records being excessively weighted during model training) (
