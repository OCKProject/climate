 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that LIG reef corals might have expanded their poleward ranges during the LIG, but that they did not experience an equatorial decline. Instead, the apparent equatorial decline appears to reflect an aspect of bias (i.e. absence of reported fossil collections/occurrences) that cannot currently be ameliorated by existing subsampling approaches. Our findings are in agreement with the results from multiple modelling and palaeoclimatic studies, which suggest that annual mean SST and seasonal ranges at equatorial latitudes in the LIG were comparable to today [

  <a rid="RSOS182111C70" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C70">70</a>]. Under the future (2100 AD) climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, our results suggest a relatively large decrease in habitat suitability at equatorial latitudes, and an increase at higher latitudes, particularly within the Northern Hemisphere. However, our conclusions are likely somewhat optimistic in the face of anthropogenic climate change as they do not account for ocean acidification, destructive fishing practices or other anthropogenic environmental impacts, and yet they make alarming predictions. Finally, the fossil record provides additional insights into the niche hypervolume of reef corals, and improves predictive performance. Consequently, the fossil record might improve biodiversity risk assessments under future climate change and it should therefore play an important role in focusing conservation efforts.
