 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To map the potential distribution of reef corals in the modern, LIG and under future climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), we implemented three ENM methods: BIOCLIM [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C49">49</a>], randomForest [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C50" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C50">50</a>] and MaxEnt v. 3.4.1 [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C51" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C51">51</a>]. In particular, MaxEnt has been shown to perform well in previous studies on coral reefs, as well as those using the fossil record for other taxonomic groups [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C14">14</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS182111C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C16">16</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS182111C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C30">30</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS182111C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C32">32</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS182111C52" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C52">52</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS182111C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C53">53</a>]. ENMs were generated using the R-package ‘biomod2’ v. 3.3-7 [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C54">54</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS182111C55" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C55">55</a>], running 100 subsample replicates with 75% of occurrences for model training, while 25% were reserved (randomly seeded) for model testing. We generated two model classes, training the ENM with both the LIG and modern occurrences, offering insights into the occupied niche and distribution under two diverse climate states. Using the three ENM methods, we produced an ensemble model based on mean projections from all modelling algorithms for each climate scenario, and for each model class (LIG- and modern-trained). As reef corals reside at the upper thermal limit of the oceans, we also built clamping masks for model projections to identify geographical areas which indicate environmental variable values outside of the training range.
