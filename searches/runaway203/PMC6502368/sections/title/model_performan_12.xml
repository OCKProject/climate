 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of the mean AUC scores (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figure SM11), the MaxEnt models performed best for both modern-trained (MaxEnt: 0.974, randomForest: 0.963, BIOCLIM: 0.843) and LIG-trained (MaxEnt: 0.976, randomForest: 0.950, BIOCLIM: 0.807) models, across individual projections. Conferring to AUC evaluation criteria [
  <a rid="RSOS182111C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C58">58</a>], all models performed excellently with the exception of the BIOCLIM models, which can still be considered as very good (see electronic supplementary material, SM2: figures SM12 and SM13 for ROC plots). TSS scores reflect similar results in terms of model performance for modern-trained (MaxEnt: 0.899, RandomForest: 0.866, BIOCLIM: 0.685) and LIG-trained ENMs (MaxEnt: 0.924, RandomForest: 0.832, BIOCLIM: 0.615), with all models performing excellently, except BIOCLIM (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figure SM11). The modern-trained ensemble model had AUC scores of 0.979, 0.975 and 0.961 (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figure SM14) for the full occurrence dataset, test dataset and evaluation dataset, respectively. The LIG-trained model had AUC scores of 0.985, 0.984 and 0.965 (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figure SM14). In addition, combined modern binary projections were able to predict 95, 91 and 83% of modern occurrences for 5LPT, 10LPT and 20LPT, respectively, while LIG-trained-only projections were able to predict 62, 59 and 51%. Similarly, combined LIG binary projections were able to predict 98, 95 and 88% of LIG fossil occurrences for 5LPT, 10LPT and 20LPT, whereas modern-trained-only projections were able to predict 93, 79 and 54%.
