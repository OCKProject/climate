 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Niche margin analysis (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figure SM9) indicates considerable niche stability (91%) between LIG and modern reef corals, with minimal expansion (8%) and unfilling (5%). Observed niche overlap values for niche equivalency tests (Schoener's 
  <span class="italic">D</span>) fall within the null distribution of the environment available to reef corals (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05), and thus we cannot reject the null hypothesis of niche equivalency. However, the observed overlap value for the niche similarity tests is greater than 95% (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) of the simulated values, indicating modern reef corals occupy environments similar to those of the LIG.
