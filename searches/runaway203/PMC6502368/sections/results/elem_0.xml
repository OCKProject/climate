   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of the mean AUC scores (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figure SM11), the MaxEnt models performed best for both modern-trained (MaxEnt: 0.974, randomForest: 0.963, BIOCLIM: 0.843) and LIG-trained (MaxEnt: 0.976, randomForest: 0.950, BIOCLIM: 0.807) models, across individual projections. Conferring to AUC evaluation criteria [
    <a rid="RSOS182111C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS182111C58">58</a>], all models performed excellently with the exception of the BIOCLIM models, which can still be considered as very good (see electronic supplementary material, SM2: figures SM12 and SM13 for ROC plots). TSS scores reflect similar results in terms of model performance for modern-trained (MaxEnt: 0.899, RandomForest: 0.866, BIOCLIM: 0.685) and LIG-trained ENMs (MaxEnt: 0.924, RandomForest: 0.832, BIOCLIM: 0.615), with all models performing excellently, except BIOCLIM (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figure SM11). The modern-trained ensemble model had AUC scores of 0.979, 0.975 and 0.961 (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figure SM14) for the full occurrence dataset, test dataset and evaluation dataset, respectively. The LIG-trained model had AUC scores of 0.985, 0.984 and 0.965 (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figure SM14). In addition, combined modern binary projections were able to predict 95, 91 and 83% of modern occurrences for 5LPT, 10LPT and 20LPT, respectively, while LIG-trained-only projections were able to predict 62, 59 and 51%. Similarly, combined LIG binary projections were able to predict 98, 95 and 88% of LIG fossil occurrences for 5LPT, 10LPT and 20LPT, whereas modern-trained-only projections were able to predict 93, 79 and 54%.

Models trained on the LIG occurrence dataset consistently calculate a smaller sum of habitable cells within the tropics than the modern-trained ENM. Combining model outputs (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figures SM23 and SM24) for both modern-trained and LIG-trained ENMs shows no distinctive increase in habitable cells at varying latitudes for all climate scenarios under the binary thresholds 5LPT and 10LPT. However, under the binary conversion threshold 20LPT (

    <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS182111F2" href="#RSOS182111F2">figure 2</a>). When applying binary threshold 5LPT, global habitability seems to increase under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. However, under 20LPT, there is a substantial reduction in habitability relative to the modern and LIG. These results suggest that under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, there will be an increase in marginal habitats for reef corals, and a prominent decrease in those more favourable.

For latitudinal bin 0–5°, the LIG-trained ENM predicts 52, 51 and 45 presence cells for 5LPT, 10LPT and 20LPT, respectively, whereas the modern-trained ENM predicts 116, 86 and 63 cells (electronic supplementary material, SM3). Based on the results from the combined, modern-trained and LIG-trained projections, for all binary thresholds, habitability was generally greater within the tropics (−25° to 25°) during the LIG than in the modern (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS182111F2" href="#RSOS182111F2">figure 2</a>; electronic supplementary material, figures SM23 and SM25 and SM3). More specifically, results from the combined projections indicate that LIG equatorial regions (−5° to 5°) were more habitable than during the modern, with 34 (5LPT), 19 (10LPT) and 40 (20LPT) additional habitable cells predicted. In addition, habitability is generally greater at higher latitudes in both hemispheres for the LIG than in the modern, for all binary thresholds, suggesting that reef coral range size was likely larger during this time. To provide an example, for 5LPT, only three cells were predicted for latitudinal bin 40–45° in the modern Northern Hemisphere, yet 14 cells were predicted for the LIG (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the models predict a considerable decrease in habitability (for all binary thresholds) within the tropics with a 5% (5LPT), 20% (10LPT) and 59% (20LPT) loss in habitable cells for RCP8.5 relative to the modern (SM3), notably in the centre of the hyper-diverse Coral Triangle (Indo-Pacific Ocean) (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS182111F3" href="#RSOS182111F3">figure 3</a>). By contrast, habitability increases significantly at higher latitudes (25–45°) in the Northern Hemisphere (

South of the Equator, there is a similar gain at higher latitudes (25° to 45°), with a 30% (5LPT), 40% (10LPT) and 46% (20LPT) increase in habitable cells (SM3). However, the clamping masks, particularly for RCP8.5, highlight some uncertainty for equatorial tropical latitudes due to one environmental variable being outside the range used for model calibration (electronic supplementary material, SM2: figures SM21 and SM22). This finding highlights the need to incorporate fossil data from various climatic regimes to reduce uncertainty when projecting to future climate scenarios, which represent climate conditions outside modern experience [
