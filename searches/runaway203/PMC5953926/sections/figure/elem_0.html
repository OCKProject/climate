         <p>A schematic of some important radiative and non-radiative feedbacks in polar regions
            involving the atmosphere, the ocean, sea ice and ice sheets. TOA refers to the top
            of the atmosphere. Solar radiation (in yellow) and Infrared Radiation (in red) represent
            the shortwave (solar) and longwave (infrared) radiation exchanges. A red plus sign
            means that the feedback is positive, a negative blue sign corresponds to a negative
            feedback. Both signs are present for cloud feedbacks as both positive and negative
            feedbacks are occurring simultaneously and the net effect is not known. The gray line
            on the right represents a simplified temperature profile in polar regions for the
            atmosphere and the ocean, the dashed line corresponding to a strong surface inversion.
            Oceanic and atmospheric heat transport are mentioned but without signs as the processes
            involved are not restricted to polar regions and it is not clear if they could be
            formally expressed using a closed feedback loop
