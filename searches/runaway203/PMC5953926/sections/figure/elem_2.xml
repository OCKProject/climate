  <p>Contributions of each feedback and atmospheric forcing to polar amplification.

   <sub>2</sub> quadrupling in climate models involved in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The feedbacks shown are the lapse rate (LR), surface albedo (A), water vapor (WV), cloud (C), and latitudinal variation in the Planck response (P’, local difference from its global-mean value

   <sub>2</sub> forcing (CO
   <sub>2</sub>), atmospheric heat transport convergence (ΔAHT) and ocean heat uptake (ΔOHU) (see method section). The feedbacks are expressed as warming contributions to the total temperature change
