 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At low and mid-latitudes, a drying of the soils in response to an initial temperature rise can amplify the warming as the evapotranspiration that normally cools the surface is reduced

  </span>. This positive soil moisture–temperature feedback is less active at high latitudes but, despite the low temperatures, evapotranspiration strongly contributes to moderate the summer warming over land

  </span>. They also give rise to a number of specific feedback mechanisms. Three important ones are discussed here. Compared to the feedbacks mainly involving the atmosphere and sea ice, ice sheets generally, but not exclusively, play a role on longer time scales. In the positive surface mass balance–elevation feedback, increased air temperature leads to ice melting, which lowers the surface elevation of the ice sheet, exposing the ice to warmer air temperatures and thus further melting

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. This positive feedback is mostly relevant for the Greenland ice sheet where surface melting is substantial, while currently the Antarctic ice sheet hardly experiences it due to very low surface temperature.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The marine ice sheet instability has the potential to destabilize large ice sheet regions
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>. The stability of a marine ice sheet such as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is determined by the position of the grounding line, i.e., the boundary between the grounded ice sheet and the floating ice shelf. If it is located on a bedrock sloping downward toward the interior of the ice sheet, an initial retreat of the grounding line, for instance due to basal ice melting, leads to an increase in ice discharge, which results in a further retreat of the grounding line inland until a new stable position is reached. Rapid changes in ice sheets may also be linked to the acceleration of the ice transport due to basal lubrication caused by meltwater penetration at the bed or to breakup of the ice shelves because of a weakening of the ice due to surface melting

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another feedback mainly acting in the Southern Ocean is related to the interactions between floating ice shelves, sea ice and the surrounding ocean. A subsurface Southern Ocean warming leads to increased basal ice shelf melting, and the upper ocean layers get fresher due to the resulting cold freshwater input. This results in lower heat flux from the ocean interior to the surface, sea ice expansion and reduced ocean surface warming, providing a negative ice shelf melting sea ice feedback
