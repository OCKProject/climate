         that must be represented in order to consider a model realistic enough for mechanistic
         studies and projections. More generally, simple comparisons between model results
         and observations do not allow estimating the origin of model biases or their impact.
         Process-based model evaluation offers the possibility of exploring the causes of discrepancies
         more deeply, identifying the links between various variables and ultimately suggesting
         model improvements

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate this point, we compare the ice production–entrainment feedback in three
         existing simulations for all the sectors of the Southern Ocean with estimates derived
         from observations and a reanalysis (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). A clear link is found between the value of the feedback factor and the amplitude
         of the seasonal cycle of ice volume: since the ice production–entrainment feedback
         is negative, it tends to damp the seasonal cycle; i.e., a stronger feedback corresponds
         to a weaker seasonal cycle. The spread across simulations and Antarctic sea ice regions
         in Fig. 
         <a>4</a> stresses the large sensitivity of the feedback to the ocean properties. As many climate
         models suffer from large biases in their representation of the vertical structure
         of the Southern Ocean, they are unlikely to predict this feedback accurately. For
         instance, the overestimation of the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of sea ice volume
         in the model CCSM4 is likely related to a too weak negative feedback and improvements
         in the representation of ocean properties, in particular of temperature and salinity
         below the surface layer, would reduce this bias.

               <p>Amplitude of the sea ice volume seasonal cycle versus the ice production-entrainment

                  to an increase of 10 cm of sea ice. For both observational and model datasets, the
                  evaluation of 
                  <span>γ</span><sub><span>θ</span></sub> is performed on the basis of temperature and salinity profiles in the Southern Ocean,
                  averaged over January–February for the period 1990–2005. Values are represented by
                  five crosses corresponding to five sectors of the Southern Ocean
