         <span><a>50</a></span>. For this negative feedback, (1) the perturbation is a given amount of ice production,
         (2) the reference variable is ice thickness, (3) the full system is the sea ice plus
         ocean column with the entrainment process, and (4) the reference system is the sea
         ice plus ocean column but without entrainment. The intensity of this feedback can

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite a different form, this expression is strictly equivalent to the original formulation
         proposed in ref. 
         <span><a>50</a></span> and used for Fig.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the mixed layer deepens, it entrains water with increasing temperature (since temperature
         increases with depth) and the heat input grows. Consequently, the absolute value of
         the feedback factor 
         <span>γ</span><sub><span>θ</span></sub> increases with ice formation (meaning that its value decreases, since it is a negative
         feedback) until the end of winter (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). This non-linear behavior can be illustrated using a simple analytical model as
         shown in Supplementary Note 
         <a>3 and Supplementary Fig. 3</a>.

               <p>Evolution of the ice production-entrainment feedback factor as a function of ice production.
                  For each value of ice production, the entrainment is computed from the January–February
                  1990–2005 mean temperature and salinity profiles
                  <span><a>115</a></span> assuming a mixed layer deepening restoring the static stability of the water column
                  after the brine release. It is shown here for a Weddell Sea location typically covered
                  by ice in winter (near 30°W, 65°S). The strength of the pycnocline is thus evaluated
                  in summer but it must be measured below the layer close to the surface that is warmed
                  above freezing point temperature if sea ice completely melts, as the heat in this
                  layer is removed quickly in fall when the temperature drops and is not involved in
                  the ice production-ocean entrainment feedback

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In practice, it is usually not possible to completely quantify all the dependencies
         of a non-linear, spatially variable feedback factor. This is why it has been suggested
         to select a prescribed perturbation representative of the condition of interest, similarly
         to the classical analysis of radiative forcing in terms of doublings of atmospheric
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). For the ice production-ocean entrainment feedback, we propose to evaluate 
         <span>γ</span><sub><span>θ</span></sub> by considering the response to a standardized perturbation corresponding to an increase
         in sea ice thickness of 10 cm (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). The number of observed profiles being much higher in summer, the feedback parameter
         is evaluated from data collected during this season. It is clear that the corresponding
         values of the feedback factors are not universally valid but they provide a standard
         benchmark for comparisons and analyses.
