      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The traditional radiative feedback framework has been extended to additional processes
         that influence the energy balance of the Earth, offering an effective way to evaluate
         and compare the strength of the different feedbacks
         <span><a>55</a>, 
            <a>76</a>, 
            <a>89</a></span>. This approach has also been successful for some biogeochemical and biogeophysical
         feedbacks
         <span><a>66</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the evaluation of key non-radiative polar feedbacks is generally inconsistent
         among the different feedbacks and even among different studies of the same feedback.
         For the ice growth–thickness feedback, in analogy with the radiative feedback framework,
         the thickness sensitivity parameter is defined as the ratio of the sea ice thickness
         change to the perturbative forcing
         <span><a>49</a></span>, but this definition has not been widely used so far. The effectiveness of the ice
         production-entrainment feedback can be measured
         <span><a>50</a>, 
            <a>51</a></span> as the ratio between the melting immediately caused by the entrainment of warmer
         water in the surface layer to the initial ice growth. The ice production-ocean heat
         storage feedback has been estimated by the ratio between the heat losses associated
         with sea-ice volume changes to the heat storage below the surface level
         <span><a>52</a>, 
            <a>53</a></span>. Both quantities can be evaluated directly from observations or model results. (Supplementary
         Note 
         <a>1</a>). Those definitions appear justified taken alone but the diversity of definitions
         and methods to quantify those feedbacks complicates their systematic evaluation and
         the comparison of the role of the different processes in observed changes. A common
         framework would thus be very helpful.
