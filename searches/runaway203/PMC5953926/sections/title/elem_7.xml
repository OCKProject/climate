  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feedback parameters provide classical measures of the magnitude of the radiative feedbacks (Box 
   <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">1</a>). They are defined as the change in radiative fluxes due to the impact of a change in surface temperature upon the variable of interest (e.g., surface albedo, water vapor amount, cloud cover also referred to as climate variable) and are quantified in W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> K
   <span class="sup">−1</span>. The net climate feedback parameter 
   <span class="italic">λ,</span> which is equal to the sum of all the parameters for the individual feedbacks, can be estimated by measuring all the terms of the equation describing the global mean radiative balance (Eq. (
   <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">1</a>) in Box 
   <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">1</a>) or by regressing the change in radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) against the global mean surface temperature change
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>
   </span>. It is somewhat more complex to evaluate specific feedback parameters 
   <span class="italic">λ</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>, as this requires isolating the impact of each feedback variable on the Earth’s energy balance

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since TOA fluxes determine the total energy budget of the Earth’s climate system, they are a natural reference point for computing climate feedbacks at a global scale. They are also closely connected to surface temperature change in the Tropics, where deep convection leads to a vertically well-mixed atmosphere. In the Arctic, where deep vertical mixing is suppressed by strong static stability in the troposphere, computing feedback parameters based on surface fluxes can lead to important additional insights
   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>
   </span>. For example, a change in clouds that raises atmospheric emissivity in the Arctic inversion layer can lead to increases in both upwelling and downwelling longwave radiation, and thus lead to energy loss and a negative cloud feedback at TOA but energy gain and a positive cloud feedback at the surface

   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual feedback parameters defined at the surface or TOA can be diagnosed using several different methods, including partial radiative perturbations
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span>, the less computationally expensive approximate partial radiative perturbations
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>
   </span>, and the even more idealized radiative kernel technique
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>, 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>
   </span>. Using this now widely used method, changes in TOA radiative fluxes due to a uniform, idealized perturbation in the feedback variable are first computed using a radiative transfer model to obtain the so-called kernel. The kernel thus only depends on the radiative transfer algorithm and the mean state of the system. 
   <span class="italic">λ</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub> can then be derived by multiplying the kernel by the response of the feedback variable to changes in global mean surface temperature.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In parallel to feedback parameters, other expressions can sometimes be easier to interpret or be more convenient. One option is to diagnose the temperature change that can be attributed to each feedback explicitly, known as a warming contribution (see the methods). It is also instructive to compare the temperature changes due to a particular feedback to changes of a reference system in which the feedbacks of interest are inactive. In the radiative feedback framework, the reference system is traditionally chosen as the Planck response. The feedback factor 
   <span class="italic">γ</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub> is then defined as the ratio of each feedback parameter to (minus) the Planck feedback 
   <span class="italic">λ</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">0</span>
   </sub>: 
   <span class="italic">γ</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>

   <span class="italic">λ</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub>/−
   <span class="italic">λ</span>
   <sub>0</sub>. An advantage of this approach is that the feedback factor 
   <span class="italic">γ</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </sub> is dimensionless because it is expressed relative to the reference system. It can then be used to compare the impact of very different processes, bearing in mind that its specific value depends on the reference system chosen

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
   </span>(for more details see the methods).
  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the approaches focused on the top of the atmosphere or the surface, it is possible to analyze the origin of three-dimensional temperature changes such as in the climate feedback response analysis method
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>
   </span> (CFRAM). It has also been proposed to decompose the feedbacks in ways that differ
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>, 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>
   </span> from the traditional one described in Box 
   <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">1</a>. Each methodology is adapted to a special purpose but also has its own limitations. For instance, a three-dimensional analysis can highlight the processes that are at the origin of the changes at various level in the atmosphere, but it may require model outputs that are not routinely saved by climate modeling centers. Finally, applying different methods leads to different definitions of feedbacks and ultimately differing quantitative assessment of feedback strengths.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations of the linear approach</div>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The standard radiative feedback framework assumes that the response of the system can be expressed as a linear function of the surface temperature. It is a very useful approximation but some processes cannot be expressed in terms of functions of single variables and the radiative feedback framework has to be adjusted to capture changes in the system not directly related to surface temperature
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>, 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
   </span>. Moreover, assuming linearity in feedbacks fails in many cases, as can be expected for a system as complex as the Earth’s climate. For example, the magnitude of the climate feedback parameter 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> generally decreases with time in climate models after a rise in atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration, corresponding to increasing climate sensitivity as equilibrium is approached

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
   </span>. 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> may also depend on the magnitude of the perturbation

   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The non-linearity of the feedbacks can be described in different ways. A simple definition will be used here: the feedback is non-linear if the feedback factor 
   <span class="italic">γ</span> is not constant. Non-linearities can be caused by several processes. The strength of the feedback can be a function of the state of the system. This state dependence can often be expressed as a time dependence when the state changes with time. Furthermore, the different processes controlling the response to a perturbation may have different time scales. Their relative contribution to local and global scale feedbacks may thus evolve leading to spatially or temporally non-constant feedback factors

   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In polar regions, the presence of different phases of water implies that many feedback parameters display a particularly strong dependence on the state of the system near the freezing point and are thus highly non-linear. For instance, phase changes play an important role in polar clouds leading to non-linearities in the cloud feedback

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
   </span>. Furthermore, feedbacks related to the cryosphere generally depend on the surface area covered by snow or ice. As temperatures rise, this area decreases and the feedback strength is reduced. This is illustrated
   <span class="sup">

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> for the surface albedo feedback in response to three consecutive doublings of CO
   <sub>2</sub> in the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3). At many latitudes, the value of the feedback factor is smaller for the third doubling (8 × CO
   <sub>2</sub>–4 × CO
   <sub>2</sub>) than it is for the first (2 × CO
   <sub>2</sub>–CNTL). Between 50°S and 60°S the feedback approaches zero for the third doubling, since the Southern Ocean is already ice-free at these latitudes in the 4xCO
   <sub>2</sub> climate, and no further melting can occur. On the other hand, the value of the feedback factor increases at northern high latitudes (75°N–90°N), as the sea ice edge retreats within the central Arctic at high warming.

A common framework would thus be very helpful.
