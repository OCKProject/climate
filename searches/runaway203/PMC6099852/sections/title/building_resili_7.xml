 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if a Stabilized Earth pathway is achieved, humanity will face a turbulent road of rapid and profound changes and uncertainties on route to it—politically, socially, and environmentally—that challenge the resilience of human societies (

  <a href="#r80">*</a>
  <a href="#r81">*</a>–
  <a rid="r82" ref-type="bibr" href="#r82">82</a>). Stabilized Earth will likely be warmer than any other time over the last 800,000 years at least (
  <a rid="r83" ref-type="bibr" href="#r83">83</a>) (that is, warmer than at any other time in which fully modern humans have existed).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the Stabilized Earth trajectory will almost surely be characterized by the activation of some tipping elements (

   <span class="italic">Tipping Cascades</span>
  </a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>) and by nonlinear dynamics and abrupt shifts at the level of critical biomes that support humanity (

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S4
  </span>). Current rates of change of important features of the Earth System already match or exceed those of abrupt geophysical events in the past (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1810141115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>
  </span>). With these trends likely to continue for the next several decades at least, the contemporary way of guiding development founded on theories, tools, and beliefs of gradual or incremental change, with a focus on economy efficiency, will likely not be adequate to cope with this trajectory. Thus, in addition to adaptation, increasing resilience will become a key strategy for navigating the future.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generic resilience-building strategies include developing insurance, buffers, redundancy, diversity, and other features of resilience that are critical for transforming human systems in the face of warming and possible surprise associated with tipping points (
  <a rid="r84" ref-type="bibr" href="#r84">84</a>). Features of such a strategy include (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) maintenance of diversity, modularity, and redundancy; (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) management of connectivity, openness, slow variables, and feedbacks; (
  <span class="italic">iii</span>) understanding social–ecological systems as complex adaptive systems, especially at the level of the Earth System as a whole (
  <a rid="r85" ref-type="bibr" href="#r85">85</a>); (
  <span class="italic">iv</span>) encouraging learning and experimentation; and (
  <span class="italic">v</span>) broadening of participation and building of trust to promote polycentric governance systems (
  <a rid="r86" ref-type="bibr" href="#r86">86</a>,
