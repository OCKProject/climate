 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The target dataset for each of the six dune sites was represented by a probability density function (PDF) of stacked luminescence (optically stimulated luminescence â€“ OSL) ages that depict episodes of sediment deposition in the dune profile. The target dataset represents a likelihood of identifying an OSL age, it does not necessarily capture every sediment reactivation event that has occurred for two reasons. First, historical events may have been eroded from the sedimentary record, and whilst a multicore strategy has been used to increase the overall representation of reactivation events, due to the fragmented nature of aeolian sedimentary profiles some events may be eroded from the record. Second, the event may not have been captured in the OSL dating due to sampling strategy. Considering these caveats, whilst a peak in the PDF dataset represents a depositional event, a trough does not equally represent a period of stability. A positive peak is a true result, but a negative absence only suggests that we did not find evidence of an event. As such, it is essential to pre-process the target dataset to avoid falsely training the ANN to interpret certain conditions as conducive to stability. Where long gaps between peaks (regions of contiguous values at zero) were found in the luminescence record, target values were removed, preventing the model from associating periods which might be due to erosional loss of sediment to specific environmental conditions, thereby learning a false relationship (for the present purposes).</p>
