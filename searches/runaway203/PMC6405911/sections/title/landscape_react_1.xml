 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With increases in population pressure and land use, and climate models predicting increasing precipitation variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>, there is a greater need to understand the sensitivity of dryland landscapes to future disturbances. In particular, there is a specific concern about how 
  <span class="italic">individual</span> forcing factors interact with the environment to induce instability and land degradation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Current methods of analysis often rely on simple visual comparisons between historic records and the correlation of individual forcing parameters against periods of reactivation in the record

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Univariate analyses focus on individual drivers (see review
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>) but fail to identify the feedbacks between the range of climatic and anthropogenic forcing factors. At the Quaternary timescale sand dune reactivation studies, for example, have long been used as a proxy for palaeoaridity

  </span>, few have quantified the relationship between forcing factor and environmental response using traditional analytical methods.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying the role of individual parameters and identifying the complex relationship between the forces and geomorphological response is therefore essential to predicting the likelihood of future disturbance-driven reactivations. Ideally, a process-based model would be used to simulate hypothetical geomorphic responses to future climatic and anthropogenic forces. However, these mechanistic models do not yet exist in the form necessary for dryland aeolian environments.</p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we apply a ‘data-led’ empirical approach, rather than trying to construct a mechanistic model (that comes with the problems of structural and parameter uncertainty). We explore the potential for novel applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve our understanding of the relationship between climatic and anthropogenic disturbances and resultant geomorphic response in dryland environments. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide a hitherto underutilized method to simultaneously examine multiple forcing factors and uncover their complex relationships

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. A supervised learning algorithm takes a known set of paired input-target data and trains a model which can be used to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new unseen data. As such, ANNs have been applied to a range of research problems from predicting stock markets
