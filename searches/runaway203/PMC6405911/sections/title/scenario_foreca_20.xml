 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trained ANN2 was used to model the predicted tree ring growth indices associated with two hypothetical climate scenarios and used as the new inputs alongside combinations of grazing pressure and wildfire occurrence in ANN1. Future climate data (2015–2100 AD) was produced using an autoregressive model to identify the normal levels of ‘noise’ identified in the measured historical precipitation and temperature datasets, before being added to two different future trends (Table

    <p>Two combinations of future growing season precipitation, average maximum temperatures and average minimum temperatures have been used to produce different climatic conditions. Scenarios used do not demonstrate predicted future conditions but are used as proof on concept to demonstrate the capacity of the model under a range of forcing combinations. Climate 2 temperature settings are based on projections of the Central Great Plains region under a low emissions scenario

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the training dataset (1908–1997 AD) to define ANN2, the model was ran for 8,000 repeats with the simulated outputs associated with each network repeat stored by the model. Multiple cycles of the network ensured that the simulated target dataset was not driven by random extreme values. Repeats that produced more than seven tree ring indices &gt;5,000 (i.e. extreme values) were excluded from the final dataset. The mean and standard error for each year was calculated for the two climatic scenarios and used as the new tree ring growth index for simulating future sediment deposition events in ANN1.</p>
