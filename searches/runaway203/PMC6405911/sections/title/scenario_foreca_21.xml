 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulated tree ring indices were modelled against three levels of grazing pressure: low, moderate and heavy. Further analysis to sensitivity test the role of wildfires and additional periods of grazing pressure when applied against a background level were completed to produce six different combinations of future disturbance conditions (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>).

 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the known datasets (1590–1997 AD) to define ANN1, 5,000 repeats were completed using the six training sites. The training dataset was partitioned with a relatively low training portion (50%) and high validation and testing partition (5% + 45%) (based on a short time series) to prevent over-fitting and improve the robustness of the future scenario outputs. With each repeat, the model simulated the predicted future likelihood of identifying depositional episodes in the sediment, classified as a deposition event score, according to the six future disturbance scenarios.</p>
