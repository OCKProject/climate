 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The goal of this study is to identify how changes in drivers of vegetation disturbance induce changes in sediment mobilisation. The main drivers of vegetation disturbance and subsequent sediment reactivation are: climate-induced drought, grazing/land use pressure and wildfire disturbance; both currently and expected in the future. In this study, two ANNs were established to predict the likelihood for identifying episodes of sediment deposition in near-surface sand dune profiles given a set of forcing factors (i.e. climate, grazing pressure and wildfire occurrence). Luminescence-dated sediments from near-surface dune sands provide a historical chronology of deposition events which are used to represent episodes of sediment mobility within the system over the past 400 years (see Methods). Ideally, continuous time series of relevant climate data would be used as an input to train the first ANN (ANN1), and this is indeed possible over more recent time periods. However, such records are not long enough to cover the time period represented by the sediment deposition dates (c. the last 400 yrs). After searching for longer-term records of relevant data, and proxies for climate conditions, we found tree ring growth indices to provide the best available data. Rather than train the ANNs against climate data directly, we therefore trained them against tree ring data as a proxy for climate

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using empirical data, we first identify the relationship between driving forces and sediment deposition events from the historical record before varying the disturbance factors under a set of future scenarios (alternate climatic, grazing and fire frequency futures) to deduce the environmental response and sensitivity to individual parameters. As the ANN was trained using historical tree ring data, future climate scenarios must then also be expressed in this way. A second ANN predicted hypothetical tree ring growth under two different future climatic regimes (ANN2; see Methods). We used two hypothetical climate futures combined with varying wildfire regimes and grazing pressures to sensitivity test the likelihood of deposition events when forcing factors were modelled under a range of conditions.
