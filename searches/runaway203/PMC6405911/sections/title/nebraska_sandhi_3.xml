 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the experimental design defined, this approach was applied to empirical data collected from the Niobrara Valley Preserve in northern Nebraska, US. Empirical data from a detailed analysis of historical (10
  <span class="sup">1</span>–10
  <span class="sup">3</span> years) land degradation in the Nebraska Sandhills (Buckland 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. submitted 16/08/18), a region synonymous with the 20th century US Dust Bowl and with the potential to experience serious disturbance in future decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>, provides input to this analysis. For our modelling experiments, we chose chronologies of depositional events from six different geomorphological features in the northern Nebraska Sandhills to provide a measure of environmental response to disturbance events over the last 400 years (see Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Six separate profiles, from a range of geomorphological features within the local area, are used for inter-site comparison (see Methods and Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Input datasets taken from a tree ring growth index (a proxy for climate), a simplified measure of historical grazing/land use pressure, and tree scar records (a proxy for wildfire history) provide the inputs for the model, representing natural and human disturbance forces (see Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>).

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ANN1 defines the relationship between climatic and human disturbance forces and the resultant episodes of near-surface sediment deposition. Luminescence-dated periods of deposition are presented as a continuous estimate of probability based on multiple discrete dates spanning the period of interest. ANN2 identifies the historical relationship between climatic inputs (annual growing season precipitation, average max and min temperatures) and tree ring growth

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model validation and testing were achieved through two methods: (i) partitioning of the original dataset, and (ii) cross-validation between the dune sites. Datasets were randomly partitioned for training, validating and testing purposes during the training of the network. ANN1 consists of an input layer, four hidden layers (comprising 3:30:30:3 fully connected neurons) and an output layer, whilst ANN2 has an input layer, one hidden layer (9 neurons) and an output layer. ANN1 is a time-delay network, incorporating a delay line of up to 8 years between datasets for input (forcings) and output (sediment age probability) (see Methods).</p>
