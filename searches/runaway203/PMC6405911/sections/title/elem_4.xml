Additional simulated peaks in the record (centred on 1730 and 1870 AD) suggest episodes of sediment deposition that we would expect to find if deeper sediment samples were extracted at sites A, C and E.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having effectively trained the model, in this section we assess how example combinations of the key drivers (climate, grazing pressure and wildfire) are expected to induce changes in sediment mobility, given the relationships learnt from historical data. First, using ANN2, after successfully predicting historical tree ring growth from historical growing season precipitation totals and average max and min daily temperatures (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) (see Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>), two new tree ring growth futures were simulated based on two hypothetical climates (climate 1 &amp; 2) (see Methods and Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Climate 1 growing season precipitation totals and max/min temperatures follow the trend set by long-term averages (1908–2015 AD). For comparison, climate 2 growing season temperatures increase by 4.5 °F by the end of the century based on future regional projections across a suite of climate models under a low emission scenario

  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tree ring growth outputs across both climatic profiles produced results in line with theoretical expectations. After 8,000 model repeats, datasets which produced multiple extreme values outside of the bounds of the training set were excluded (see Methods); the mean and standard error were calculated with the remaining repeat datasets (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Climate 1 shows a noisy signal with low-level sensitivity to precipitation and temperature changes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>) while the greater climatic stresses of climate 2 force a reduction in tree ring growth with time (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, using the trained ANN1 and three levels of grazing pressure, simulated tree ring growth indices produced six future likelihoods for identifying deposition events in the near-surface sediments. Across both climate futures, an antiphase relationship between tree ring growth and the likelihood for sediment deposition (deposition event score) suggests sediment movement is largely driven by climatic conditions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, see Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). Under historical average climatic conditions (climate 1) a noisy signal is seen across all three combinations of grazing conditions with the output profile in general mirroring the signal found in the tree ring growth index (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a,c,e</a>). Increased aridity (in climate 2), reduced the tree ring growth index with time, and similarly increased the likelihood of identifying a period of deposition in the sediment (i.e. higher deposition event score) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b,d,f</a>). This relationship is particularly visible under low grazing conditions but is less well-defined with noisy shallow peaks under higher levels of grazing pressure.

Blue output refers to simulated tree ring growth index based on climate 1 and 2 hypothetical scenarios.

Dotted lines depict mean values calculated after repeat runs were screened for optimum model performance, shaded area corresponds with standard error. Repeat runs were screened according to ability to predict the correct location of deposition events in the training dataset (see Methods).</p>

   </div>
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, to explore the added impact of increased grazing pressure (above background levels) and wildfire frequency, additional grazing pressure was added to low and moderate grazing regimes for a 10-year period (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> brown bars) and wildfires were added when average max temperatures &gt;80 °F (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> red bars). Temperature is considered a strong determinant of fire frequency in the Great Plains
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>
   </span>. Under low grazing conditions, an increase in pressure results in a lagged-system response with a notable increase in the likelihood to identify episodes of sediment deposition (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>). By contrast, when background grazing conditions are already at moderate levels, or when climates are tending towards more arid conditions, an increase in grazing pressure does not alter the model projections (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c,e,g</a>); the signal is driven by climatic disturbances as demonstrated in the tree ring growth index. Additional grazing pressure was not added to the already heavily grazed scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5i–l</a>).

  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A complex relationship with wildfire occurrence shows a marginal increase in the deposition event score following a wildfire event. Typically, wildfire occurrence results in an amplified likelihood of sediment deposition 1–2 years after the event and tends to follow the general trend of the output profile defined by the climatic conditions. An increased amplification of the sediment deposition likelihood associated with wildfire is particularly apparent under low grazing conditions with consecutive wildfires (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b,d</a>). Under heavily grazed conditions, wildfire events do not cause a statistical increase in the likelihood of identifying sediment mobility in the record, except for following a series of three wildfire events (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5j</a>: 2021–2024 AD) under average climatic conditions (climate 1).
