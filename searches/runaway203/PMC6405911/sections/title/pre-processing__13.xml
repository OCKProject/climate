 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three primary contributors to vegetation cover, and thus surface stability, were selected for inclusion in the model: grazing pressure, wildfire occurrence, and climatic conditions. Instrumental measurements (capturing the last 100 years of climatic data) were not used due to the relatively short time series measured. A longer dendrochronological record of tree ring growth from the Niobrara Valley Preserve (NVP)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span> provided an integrated record of precipitation and temperature change over the past 400 years. Annual tree ring growth data was extracted and smoothed by a factor of 0.2 RLOESS function, to allow a signal to be identified by the model amongst the environmental noise. Grazing pressure for the six dune sites was based on the levels identified in the index defined in Buckland 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (submitted – 16/08/2018) and smoothed by a moving average factor of 0.1 to represent progressive changes in management strategy. Wildfire occurrence was included as a binary input (i.e. ‘1’ – fire, ‘0’ – no fire) based on the fire scar records from NVP
