 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Final model structure used ‘timedelaynet’ function to allow for an adjustable lag to be incorporated into the network architecture. A lag of up to 8 years for the input variables was selected following a series of trials of different time lags. Given the complex nature of the relationship between the input variables and the resultant likelihood of sediment movement, four hidden layers were used with a structure of [3 30 30 3] neurons in the layers (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). The Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm was used to train the network (minimizing distance between model outputs and target data) and the mean square error (MSE) of each model run was used as the performance indicator for each iteration. Training datasets were randomly partitioned for training (90%), validation (5%) and testing (5%) purposes during cross-validation experiments, but to reduce over-fitting in the future scenario simulations this split was altered to increase the test portion of the datasets (50% training, 5% validation, 45% testing) and improve the robustness of the model outputs.
