 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results highlight the dominance of climatic disturbance in driving vegetation growth (as shown in the tree ring growth index) which in turn explains the majority of the variability found in the deposition event score (ANN1 output profile). When additional grazing (or land use pressure) is added to a previously low pressure grazed environment, a significant increase in identifying periods of sediment deposition is found. Yet, in environments under already stressed conditions (i.e. moderate/heavy grazing or drier climates), an increase in pressure bares no additional impact on the likelihood of identifying sediment movement in the geomorphic system. These results agree with previous studies

  </span> that have commented on the non-linear nature of dryland geomorphic systems, whereby a threshold of disturbance is required to initiate sediment reactivation. Our results show that the force exerted by external disturbances is not linearly related to the likelihood for periods of sediment deposition to be identified in the record; the geomorphic response is binary not continuous. Additional grazing pressure does not increase the likelihood for reactivation in a system that is already experiencing sediment mobilisation, but it might contribute to pockets of localised heterogeneity in the record and, in particular, the formation of blowouts

  </span> that has suggested that wildfires may damage surface vegetation and increase the likelihood for sediment remobilisation (e.g. Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>: 2083–88 AD period) and during periods of low climatic stress (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). Under low and moderate grazing regimes, model outputs predict a marginal increase in the deposition event score following the 2012 wildfire. In 2012, a large wildfire (76,000 acres) stripped the study region of trees, shrubs and grass species. Yet, despite the extensive nature of the fire, anecdotally ranchers and preserve managers commented on the lack of evidence for sediment remobilisation following this event – likely caused by extensive root networks

  </span>, and wildfire management practices
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>
  </span>. Changes in grazing strategy and landscape management following wildfires have been instrumental in determining the subsequent likelihood for sediment remobilisation. The model used in this example has been trained on the land management practices during the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span>-century and is unable to predict how future human decision-making will change. As such, whilst the model predicted a sediment response post-2012 fire, the lack of physical evidence to support this simulation is likely caused by non-analogous behaviour to the training dataset.
