 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have shown the capacity to use ANN models coupled with empirical datasets to improve our understanding of aeolian geomorphological systems and future sensitivity to climatic and human disturbance. Our results demonstrate how ANNs can identify relationships between paired historical input-target datasets, as well as the potential for trained models to make predictions about the likelihood of future reactivations. When known forcings are included in the simulations, we can identify peaks in reactivation driven largely by perturbations in climatic conditions, but also grazing pressure and fire frequency when aridity stresses are low. Results from this study suggest that fire can increase the capacity for near-surface reactivation and could be used to explain heterogeneity in local sediment profiles under low-stress climatic conditions. Likewise, the resilience of grasslands to grazing pressures is largely related to the ambient climate

Through ANN simulations, we demonstrate the dynamic relationships between disturbances and response, exploring the idea of thresholds and a lagged-response to external perturbations.

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The black box nature of ANNs prevent a defined weighting of each disturbance parameter being produced, but sensitivity testing has demonstrated the non-linear response of the system to different combinations of disturbance conditions. These findings corroborate with existing research that synergies between forcing parameters are the key to near-surface reactivations in semi-arid grasslands

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using cross-validation tests, we have demonstrated the bounds within which these models most optimally perform. Without all potential outcomes represented in the original training dataset, the ability to predict accurate outcomes is limited. If future models are to accurately predict future sediment reactivation events, non-linear multivariate tools are needed to fully-integrate the variety of parameters influencing near-surface activation. ANNs represent an opportunity within drylands, and wider landscape dynamics, to define environmental relationships and thresholds in systems where process-based mechanistic models are absent. The potential for future models, however, to accurately simulate hypothetical futures is constrained by the capacity to identify suitable training datasets that capture analogues for forthcoming conditions.</p>
