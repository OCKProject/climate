 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ANN2 is an artificial neural network used to identify the relationship between individual climatic parameters (growing season precipitation, average max and min daily temperatures) and tree ring growth index

A tree ring growth index produced using ponderosa pine tree rings within the NVP was used as the target dataset
