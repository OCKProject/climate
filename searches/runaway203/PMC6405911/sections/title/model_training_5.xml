 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each of the six study sites, when all sites were included in the training dataset (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>: 
  <span class="italic">upper</span>, 
  <span class="italic">‘in-sample’ prediction</span>), the timings of predicted deposition events (red) align well with the known dataset reconstructed from historical sediments (blue). Additional simulated peaks in the record (centred on 1730 and 1870 AD) suggest episodes of sediment deposition that we would expect to find if deeper sediment samples were extracted at sites A, C and E.

Blue lines refer to the known target datasets taken from empirical measurements of periods of deposition, and red lines are the predicted model outputs for each respective site.

  <span class="italic">out-of-sample</span>’ prediction) demonstrate the capacity to accurately predict the six known depositional profiles when the respective site has been excluded from the network training stage (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>:
