  <p>Two combinations of future growing season precipitation, average maximum temperatures and average minimum temperatures have been used to produce different climatic conditions. Scenarios used do not demonstrate predicted future conditions but are used as proof on concept to demonstrate the capacity of the model under a range of forcing combinations. Climate 2 temperature settings are based on projections of the Central Great Plains region under a low emissions scenario
