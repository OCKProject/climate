  <p>Simulated tree ring growth indices based on two different climate scenarios: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Climate 1 (long-term averages), (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Climate 2 (low emission conditions with gradually increasing temperatures (see Methods). Mean (black) and standard errors (grey dashed) were calculated using 102 repeats. Multiple repeats ensured that the simulated dataset was not driven by random extreme values.
