  <p>Output results when new scenarios of climatic conditions, grazing pressure and wildfire occurrence are combined over a 100-year period. Deposition event scores are presented as mean ± standard error following 5,000 repeats. Repeat runs were screened according to ability to predict the correct location of deposition events in the training dataset (see Methods). Six different disturbance scenarios (see Methods) are plotted across the 4 columns for each of the 3 different grazing pressure levels (Low grazing: 
   <span class="bold">a–d</span>, Moderate grazing: 
   <span class="bold">e–h</span>, Heavy grazing: 
   <span class="bold">i–l</span>). Column 1: compares scenarios 1 and 2. Column 2: compares scenarios 1 and 3. Column 3: compares scenarios 4 and 5. Column 4: compares scenarios 4 and 6. Blue output: simulated tree ring growth index based on either climate 1or 2. Grey output: ANN1 OSL output based on climate-only scenarios. Green output: includes added grazing pressure scenarios. Brown bar depicts period of increased grazing pressure. Red output: includes wildfire. Red bars represent years with wildfire occurrence.
