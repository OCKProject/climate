  <p>ANN1 and ANN2 simulated output results based on two future climate scenarios and three different grazing pressures. Blue output refers to simulated tree ring growth index based on climate 1 and 2 hypothetical scenarios. Grey output demonstrates ANN1 likelihood of identifying a depositional event (ANN1 output is plotted as ‘deposition event score’ where relative high points correspond with an increased likelihood of identifying an episode of deposition in the sediment). Dotted lines depict mean values calculated after repeat runs were screened for optimum model performance, shaded area corresponds with standard error. Repeat runs were screened according to ability to predict the correct location of deposition events in the training dataset (see Methods).</p>
