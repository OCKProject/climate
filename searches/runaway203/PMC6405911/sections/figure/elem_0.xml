  <p>Results from both in-sample (

   <span class="italic">lower</span>) testing across the six sites in ANN1. Blue lines refer to the known target datasets taken from empirical measurements of periods of deposition, and red lines are the predicted model outputs for each respective site.

   </span>, periods with no evidence of depositional events have been removed from the training dataset to prevent the model identifying these conditions as conducive to stability (i.e. sites A, C and E).
