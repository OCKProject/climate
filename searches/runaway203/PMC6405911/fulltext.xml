Given the potential for currently stabilised dune systems to reactivate under climate change and increased anthropogenic pressures, identifying the role of external disturbances in driving geomorphic response is vitally important. We developed a novel approach, using artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to time series of historical reactivation-deposition events from the Nebraska Sandhills, to determine the relationship between historic periods of sand deposition in semi-arid grasslands and external climatic conditions, land use pressures and wildfire occurrence. We show that both vegetation growth and sediment re-deposition episodes can be accurately estimated. Sensitivity testing of individual factors shows that localised forcings (overgrazing and wildfire) have a statistically significant impact when the climate is held at present-day conditions. However, the dominant effect is climate-induced drought. Our approach has great potential for estimating future landscape sensitivity to climate and land use scenarios across a wide range of potentially fragile dryland environments.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>RCUK | Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/L002612/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buckland</surname><given-names>C.

Disturbance-driven degradation can lead to the reactivation of dryland geomorphological features, such as sand dunes, resulting in the formation of localised blowouts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> or even large-scale dune remobilisation in some of the world&#x02019;s most vulnerable regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In turn, the creation of blowouts acts as an initial source of sediment that can lead to further reactivation and new dune formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">With increases in population pressure and land use, and climate models predicting increasing precipitation variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, there is a greater need to understand the sensitivity of dryland landscapes to future disturbances. In particular, there is a specific concern about how <italic>individual</italic> forcing factors interact with the environment to induce instability and land degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Current methods of analysis often rely on simple visual comparisons between historic records and the correlation of individual forcing parameters against periods of reactivation in the record<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, or short-lived individual event analyses in the study of aeolian system surface change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Univariate analyses focus on individual drivers (see review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>) but fail to identify the feedbacks between the range of climatic and anthropogenic forcing factors. At the Quaternary timescale sand dune reactivation studies, for example, have long been used as a proxy for palaeoaridity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, with luminescence-derived chronologies used to infer periods of historic drought<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Whilst a focus on climatic factors may be suitable on millennial timescales, more recent localised reactivations are driven by a combination of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Aside from a climatic focus, many studies have commented on the role of wildfire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> or grazing pressures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, which in themselves demonstrate key biogenic relationships, but might mask the synergies within the wider system. Whilst some studies have suggested the combined role of multiple forcing factors in contributing towards vegetation removal and landscape destabilisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, few have quantified the relationship between forcing factor and environmental response using traditional analytical methods.</p><p id="Par4">Quantifying the role of individual parameters and identifying the complex relationship between the forces and geomorphological response is therefore essential to predicting the likelihood of future disturbance-driven reactivations. Ideally, a process-based model would be used to simulate hypothetical geomorphic responses to future climatic and anthropogenic forces. However, these mechanistic models do not yet exist in the form necessary for dryland aeolian environments.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we apply a &#x02018;data-led&#x02019; empirical approach, rather than trying to construct a mechanistic model (that comes with the problems of structural and parameter uncertainty). We explore the potential for novel applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve our understanding of the relationship between climatic and anthropogenic disturbances and resultant geomorphic response in dryland environments. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide a hitherto underutilized method to simultaneously examine multiple forcing factors and uncover their complex relationships<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. A supervised learning algorithm takes a known set of paired input-target data and trains a model which can be used to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new unseen data.

The main drivers of vegetation disturbance and subsequent sediment reactivation are: climate-induced drought, grazing/land use pressure and wildfire disturbance; both currently and expected in the future. In this study, two ANNs were established to predict the likelihood for identifying episodes of sediment deposition in near-surface sand dune profiles given a set of forcing factors (i.e. climate, grazing pressure and wildfire occurrence). Luminescence-dated sediments from near-surface dune sands provide a historical chronology of deposition events which are used to represent episodes of sediment mobility within the system over the past 400 years (see Methods). Ideally, continuous time series of relevant climate data would be used as an input to train the first ANN (ANN1), and this is indeed possible over more recent time periods. However, such records are not long enough to cover the time period represented by the sediment deposition dates (c. the last 400&#x02009;yrs). After searching for longer-term records of relevant data, and proxies for climate conditions, we found tree ring growth indices to provide the best available data. Rather than train the ANNs against climate data directly, we therefore trained them against tree ring data as a proxy for climate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.

As the ANN was trained using historical tree ring data, future climate scenarios must then also be expressed in this way. A second ANN predicted hypothetical tree ring growth under two different future climatic regimes (ANN2; see Methods). We used two hypothetical climate futures combined with varying wildfire regimes and grazing pressures to sensitivity test the likelihood of deposition events when forcing factors were modelled under a range of conditions.

Empirical data from a detailed analysis of historical (10<sup>1</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>3</sup> years) land degradation in the Nebraska Sandhills (Buckland <italic>et al</italic>. submitted 16/08/18), a region synonymous with the 20th century US Dust Bowl and with the potential to experience serious disturbance in future decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, provides input to this analysis. For our modelling experiments, we chose chronologies of depositional events from six different geomorphological features in the northern Nebraska Sandhills to provide a measure of environmental response to disturbance events over the last 400 years (see Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Six separate profiles, from a range of geomorphological features within the local area, are used for inter-site comparison (see Methods and Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Input datasets taken from a tree ring growth index (a proxy for climate), a simplified measure of historical grazing/land use pressure, and tree scar records (a proxy for wildfire history) provide the inputs for the model, representing natural and human disturbance forces (see Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">ANN1 defines the relationship between climatic and human disturbance forces and the resultant episodes of near-surface sediment deposition.

First, using ANN2, after successfully predicting historical tree ring growth from historical growing season precipitation totals and average max and min daily temperatures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) (see Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), two new tree ring growth futures were simulated based on two hypothetical climates (climate 1 &#x00026; 2) (see Methods and Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Climate 1 growing season precipitation totals and max/min temperatures follow the trend set by long-term averages (1908&#x02013;2015 AD).

After 8,000 model repeats, datasets which produced multiple extreme values outside of the bounds of the training set were excluded (see Methods); the mean and standard error were calculated with the remaining repeat datasets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Climate 1 shows a noisy signal with low-level sensitivity to precipitation and temperature changes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) while the greater climatic stresses of climate 2 force a reduction in tree ring growth with time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Second, using the trained ANN1 and three levels of grazing pressure, simulated tree ring growth indices produced six future likelihoods for identifying deposition events in the near-surface sediments. Across both climate futures, an antiphase relationship between tree ring growth and the likelihood for sediment deposition (deposition event score) suggests sediment movement is largely driven by climatic conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, see Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Under historical average climatic conditions (climate 1) a noisy signal is seen across all three combinations of grazing conditions with the output profile in general mirroring the signal found in the tree ring growth index (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,c,e</xref>). Increased aridity (in climate 2), reduced the tree ring growth index with time, and similarly increased the likelihood of identifying a period of deposition in the sediment (i.e. higher deposition event score) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b,d,f</xref>). This relationship is particularly visible under low grazing conditions but is less well-defined with noisy shallow peaks under higher levels of grazing pressure.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>ANN1 and ANN2 simulated output results based on two future climate scenarios and three different grazing pressures.

Temperature is considered a strong determinant of fire frequency in the Great Plains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Under low grazing conditions, an increase in pressure results in a lagged-system response with a notable increase in the likelihood to identify episodes of sediment deposition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). By contrast, when background grazing conditions are already at moderate levels, or when climates are tending towards more arid conditions, an increase in grazing pressure does not alter the model projections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c,e,g</xref>); the signal is driven by climatic disturbances as demonstrated in the tree ring growth index. Additional grazing pressure was not added to the already heavily grazed scenarios (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i&#x02013;l</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Output results when new scenarios of climatic conditions, grazing pressure and wildfire occurrence are combined over a 100-year period.

Typically, wildfire occurrence results in an amplified likelihood of sediment deposition 1&#x02013;2 years after the event and tends to follow the general trend of the output profile defined by the climatic conditions. An increased amplification of the sediment deposition likelihood associated with wildfire is particularly apparent under low grazing conditions with consecutive wildfires (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b,d</xref>). Under heavily grazed conditions, wildfire events do not cause a statistical increase in the likelihood of identifying sediment mobility in the record, except for following a series of three wildfire events (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>: 2021&#x02013;2024 AD) under average climatic conditions (climate 1).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Drivers of future deposition events</title><p id="Par18">Results highlight the dominance of climatic disturbance in driving vegetation growth (as shown in the tree ring growth index) which in turn explains the majority of the variability found in the deposition event score (ANN1 output profile).

Yet, in environments under already stressed conditions (i.e. moderate/heavy grazing or drier climates), an increase in pressure bares no additional impact on the likelihood of identifying sediment movement in the geomorphic system. These results agree with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> that have commented on the non-linear nature of dryland geomorphic systems, whereby a threshold of disturbance is required to initiate sediment reactivation. Our results show that the force exerted by external disturbances is not linearly related to the likelihood for periods of sediment deposition to be identified in the record; the geomorphic response is binary not continuous. Additional grazing pressure does not increase the likelihood for reactivation in a system that is already experiencing sediment mobilisation, but it might contribute to pockets of localised heterogeneity in the record and, in particular, the formation of blowouts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">Whilst some studies have suggested that fire may not contribute to the likelihood of sediment reactivation in semi-arid grassland environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, our findings support existing research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> that has suggested that wildfires may damage surface vegetation and increase the likelihood for sediment remobilisation (e.g. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>: 2083&#x02013;88 AD period) and during periods of low climatic stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Under low and moderate grazing regimes, model outputs predict a marginal increase in the deposition event score following the 2012 wildfire. In 2012, a large wildfire (76,000&#x02009;acres) stripped the study region of trees, shrubs and grass species. Yet, despite the extensive nature of the fire, anecdotally ranchers and preserve managers commented on the lack of evidence for sediment remobilisation following this event &#x02013; likely caused by extensive root networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, sediment crusting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>, and wildfire management practices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Changes in grazing strategy and landscape management following wildfires have been instrumental in determining the subsequent likelihood for sediment remobilisation. The model used in this example has been trained on the land management practices during the 20<sup>th</sup>-century and is unable to predict how future human decision-making will change. As such, whilst the model predicted a sediment response post-2012 fire, the lack of physical evidence to support this simulation is likely caused by non-analogous behaviour to the training dataset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Limitations of the approach</title><p id="Par20">Whilst our results have demonstrated the potential application of ANNs for estimating future landscape sensitivity, it is essential to equally understand the limitations of the method used. Out-of-sample predicting is the main limitation for the approach outlined here; this is the likely inability to provide accurate forecasts when models are trained on a limited or non-analogous dataset. The unique set of input conditions found at site B is not replicated at any of the other 5 sites, and without another set of comparable data to train from, the predicted output is beyond the limited conditions represented in the training dataset (e.g. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> site B). In this study, we have attempted to reduce such errors in expanding the dataset by training across multiple study sites. As in all inferential methods, a larger dataset that encompasses more drought cycles would improve the training (and therefore the predictable capabilities) further. An inherent weakness of data-informed models in this context is that under future climate change, if forcing conditions (or combinations of conditions) stray significantly far from past experience (significantly &#x02018;non-analogous&#x02019;), supervised models may no longer be able to accurately predict future landscape responses.</p><p id="Par21">Another difficulty using this method is associated with identifying what the relative peaks and troughs in the simulated outputs represent. As mentioned earlier, the network has been trained on a luminescence-dated target dataset which provides a continuous estimate of the probability of identifying a luminescence age (i.e. episode of deposition) in the sedimentary record. However, ascertaining what peaks in the simulation output correspond with a deposition &#x02018;event&#x02019; in the profile is dependent on where the relative baseline associated with stability is positioned (i.e. are all periods with scores &#x0003e;0 indicative of sediment mobilisation episodes?). In this study, the network has been trained on definitively identified episodes of sediment deposition, not periods of known stability (see Methods). A series of erosional filters gradually remove evidence of historic reactivation events from the sedimentary system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. As such, our target dataset does not provide evidence for all deposition events, but more importantly, it does not provide definitive evidence of periods of stability. There is a distinct difference between an absence of evidence and an evidence of absence, but this is not resolved in the depositional record. A baseline at zero therefore, to represent no likelihood of identifying a deposition event in the forecasted plots, is incorrect and thus events are inferred as the most prominent relative peaks in the deposition event profile as opposed to those that are identified above a set threshold, or those that are representative of extreme model runs (see Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">The relatively large error margins associated with dated episodes of deposition (see Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) further compound the difficulty in identifying specific deposition events and associated conditions. This is problematic for the network training as input conditions over large windows are considered to be inducing a short-lived sediment reactivation event that is characterised by large uncertainties (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Conditions that are therefore reflective of landscape stability may falsely be associated with identified periods of deposition. Since the model has trained against a dataset that has already undergone a series of natural filters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, the simulated outcome does not necessarily depict every deposition event. Additional known point-in-time observations taken from historical aerial imagery, oral records, agricultural reports would improve the resolution of the training.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Schematic figure demonstrating how the wide training window of activity as defined by the target dataset (solid line) forces the model to train the equivalent period of input datasets (dashed line) to that target &#x02013; even if the true &#x02018;disturbance&#x02019; was only a short-lived event.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_40429_Fig6_HTML" id="d29e771"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Wider significance</title><p id="Par23">We have shown the capacity to use ANN models coupled with empirical datasets to improve our understanding of aeolian geomorphological systems and future sensitivity to climatic and human disturbance. Our results demonstrate how ANNs can identify relationships between paired historical input-target datasets, as well as the potential for trained models to make predictions about the likelihood of future reactivations. When known forcings are included in the simulations, we can identify peaks in reactivation driven largely by perturbations in climatic conditions, but also grazing pressure and fire frequency when aridity stresses are low. Results from this study suggest that fire can increase the capacity for near-surface reactivation and could be used to explain heterogeneity in local sediment profiles under low-stress climatic conditions. Likewise, the resilience of grasslands to grazing pressures is largely related to the ambient climate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. As expected, the dynamic nature of dryland environments means that the likelihood for sediment reactivation is not linearly related to individual forcings. Through ANN simulations, we demonstrate the dynamic relationships between disturbances and response, exploring the idea of thresholds and a lagged-response to external perturbations.</p><p id="Par24">The black box nature of ANNs prevent a defined weighting of each disturbance parameter being produced, but sensitivity testing has demonstrated the non-linear response of the system to different combinations of disturbance conditions.

Without all potential outcomes represented in the original training dataset, the ability to predict accurate outcomes is limited. If future models are to accurately predict future sediment reactivation events, non-linear multivariate tools are needed to fully-integrate the variety of parameters influencing near-surface activation. ANNs represent an opportunity within drylands, and wider landscape dynamics, to define environmental relationships and thresholds in systems where process-based mechanistic models are absent. The potential for future models, however, to accurately simulate hypothetical futures is constrained by the capacity to identify suitable training datasets that capture analogues for forthcoming conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par26">All neural networks have been developed in Matlab R2017b using the Neural Network toolbox and code written by the authors (CEB &#x00026; RMB).</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>ANN1</title><p id="Par27">ANN1 is an artificial neural network used to identify the relationship between climatic and anthropogenic disturbances and the likelihood of a luminescence age, indicating sediment deposition, to be found in the sedimentary record.

The target dataset represents a likelihood of identifying an OSL age, it does not necessarily capture every sediment reactivation event that has occurred for two reasons. First, historical events may have been eroded from the sedimentary record, and whilst a multicore strategy has been used to increase the overall representation of reactivation events, due to the fragmented nature of aeolian sedimentary profiles some events may be eroded from the record. Second, the event may not have been captured in the OSL dating due to sampling strategy. Considering these caveats, whilst a peak in the PDF dataset represents a depositional event, a trough does not equally represent a period of stability. A positive peak is a true result, but a negative absence only suggests that we did not find evidence of an event. As such, it is essential to pre-process the target dataset to avoid falsely training the ANN to interpret certain conditions as conducive to stability. Where long gaps between peaks (regions of contiguous values at zero) were found in the luminescence record, target values were removed, preventing the model from associating periods which might be due to erosional loss of sediment to specific environmental conditions, thereby learning a false relationship (for the present purposes).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Model structure and architecture</title><p id="Par30">Final model structure used &#x02018;timedelaynet&#x02019; function to allow for an adjustable lag to be incorporated into the network architecture.
