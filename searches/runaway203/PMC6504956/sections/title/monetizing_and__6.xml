 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results above assume that one life-year gained equals 2 years of per capita consumption in dollar terms. Two years of per capita consumption corresponds to the approach to monetizing health impacts used in key studies that form the basis of the RICE climate damage function
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>, and is similar to survey-based life-year assessments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. However, this approach yields much lower monetary benefits than using the value of a statistical life (VSL), which is also widely adopted in the literature. If we assume that each adult death attributable to PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> results in approximately 10 years of life lost
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, we would use roughly 8–16 years of per capita consumption per life-year gained, instead of two; thus, in what follows we use 8–16 years of per capita consumption as one possible approximation of a VSL, in addition to a more direct VSL-based approach described below.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sensitivity of our results to alternative life-year monetizations is reported in Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>. The monetized global health benefits in our main results discussed above would be roughly 4–11 times higher if we used VSL-like monetizations in the optimization, and the associated optimal level of decarbonization would likely be consistent with keeping the maximum global temperature rise to 2 °C. Two degrees is a target specified in the Paris Agreement and widely considered as necessary to avoid dangerous climate change, but one that has generally not been warranted according to previous cost-benefit assessments (using similar discounting parameters) that omit health co-benefits
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Combining the low (0.1%) rate of time preference with a VSL-based approach may justify a target as low as 1.8 °C.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> reports the sensitivity of the results to differences in how life-years are monetized in dollar terms. In RICE’s cost-benefit approach, an important second step occurs when the monetized health benefits are valued in well-being terms via the objective function (see Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>) in the Methods section), which gives the model the aim of maximizing the (discounted) sum of global well-being through time, as is standard in optimal policy modeling. A key feature of the objective function is diminishing marginal utility of consumption, which captures the core concept that an additional dollar generates more well-being when given to a poorer person than to a richer person. The result is that while life-years are assigned a lower dollar amount in poorer countries in absolute terms, they are actually assigned greater value in well-being/utility terms. We discuss this issue in more detail in Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and show in Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> that the strong effect of adding health co-benefits persists whether life years are valued more highly in poorer regions, less highly, or exactly the same as in wealthier regions; however, the magnitude of the effect changes.
