 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First (Test 1), we explore different air pollutant co-reduction levels (
  <span class="italic">κ</span>), with the range representing the high and low values after applying alternative estimates from the other four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Note that the SSPs are not ordered in terms of their co-reduction potentials, but instead reflect different possible futures across multiple socioeconomic dimensions. In the second test (Test 2), we substitute the TM5-FAst Scenario Screening Tool (TM5-FASST) source-receptor matrix (SRM) for the SRM based on simulations of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program atmospheric chemistry and transport model. We confined this sensitivity to Asia because it was the only region analyzed as part of a recent project at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis. However, the four Asian regions account for ~85% of all life-years gained globally over the next century in the main analyses (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), and therefore largely drive the findings. In Test 3 and Test 4 we assume that the relative risk for all-cause mortality (
  <span class="italic">β</span>) was the lower and upper bound, respectively, of the confidence interval in Forestiere et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> rather than the central estimate. Test 5 lowers the PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> threshold below which there are no adverse health effects (
  <span class="italic">τ</span>) to 1 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span> instead of 5.8 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>. In Test 6 we assume there is no benefit from reducing air pollution at levels above 50 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>. We include this counterfactual boundary case for two reasons. The first is to investigate the maximum possible concavity in risk functions at high levels of exposure; in reality however, recent empirical studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> indicate that the marginal effect of air pollution remains positive at levels well above 50 μg/m
  <span class="sup">3</span>. The second reason is to provide additional emphasis on the importance of India and China, as this test effectively eliminates the impact of both of those nations (as well as the Middle East/North Africa region) over the next several decades and thus explores the model’s sensitivity to their exclusion. Test 7 assumes that climate damages are twice the standard values in RICE, while the final test (Test 8) uses the Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FAIR) climate model (version 1.0)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> as an alternative to RICE’s native climate model (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a> describes how we integrate the FAIR model).
