  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We summarize the results of the new model (hereafter referred to as RICE + AIR, for RICE + Aerosol Impacts and Responses) in terms of the optimal fraction of business-as-usual CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions that should be reduced over time. We refer to this quantitative reduction in CO
   <sub>2</sub> as the optimal decarbonization fraction and express it as a percentage. (What we call the decarbonization fraction is often referred to as the control rate.). The blue line in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> shows the optimal decarbonization pathway if the cost-benefit analysis only considers the climate impacts of CO
   <sub>2</sub> and associated aerosol co-reductions. Health impacts are not included. In this reference case, the optimal decarbonization fraction is 24% of business-as-usual emissions in 2030, rising to 35% in 2050 and ultimately reaching full decarbonization by 2130. It is similar to the optimal trajectory of the standard RICE model, which features exogenous aerosol forcing and excludes health co-benefits (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>).

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the blue line, which considers only the climate impacts of CO
   <sub>2</sub> and aerosols, the red line also includes the health co-benefits of the aerosol reductions that result from decarbonization. This leads to increased optimal CO
   <sub>2</sub> mitigation. The difference between the red line and the blue line demonstrates the importance of the health benefits; roughly 45–60% more decarbonization is optimal over the next five decades (and 10–40% thereafter) compared to the reference case that only considers climate consequences. Full mitigation also occurs earlier in time. The additional emission reductions that result from the inclusion of the health co-benefits cumulatively amounts to ~270 GtC (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Importantly, all of these results account for the damages from lost cooling attributable to the aerosol co-reductions.

China’s benefits decline by mid-century due to relatively rapid economic development and a stabilizing population—which both act to constrain emissions—whereas those in India persist and are the major driver of increased decarbonization relative to the reference case (see below for a sensitivity test which corroborates India’s importance). Towards the end of the century, sub-Saharan Africa replaces China as the second-largest beneficiary, as air pollution remains problematic due to lagging economic development accompanied by the world’s largest population. Other regions also stand to benefit, including less populous regions that show important benefits per capita and/or per Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Fig.

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the results presented above, the averted premature mortality from aerosol co-reductions produces annual monetized benefits in the hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few decades, rising to several trillion annually at the end of the century (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). To derive these numbers, we multiply, for each region-time pair, the total life-years gained by 2 years of per capita consumption. This approach produces different life-year monetizations for each region, which leads to the slight change in composition of monetized benefits (compare Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a, c</a>). However, this does not imply that we assign life-years in poorer regions less value in the objective function, because the optimization accounts for the diminishing marginal utility of consumption through a concave relationship between wealth and well-being, as described below and in the Methods section (Eq. (
   <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>)). Below we also show the sensitivity of our results to alternative valuations of health benefits.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Independent air quality control</div>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All results presented above assume the level of air quality control that occurs independently of climate policy will proceed approximately as projected in the coming decades, based on current and planned policies. We systematically test the importance of this assumption by implementing an environmental Kuznets-type approach where emission intensities decrease with increasing per capita income (described in detail in the Methods section, and in particular Eqs. (
   <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">2</a>)–(
   <a rid="Equ4" ref-type="" href="#Equ4">4</a>) and associated discussion). Figure 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> reports results when we slow down and speed up this Kuznets-relevant income, allowing it to range between roughly 50% (
   <span class="italic">χ</span> = 0.5) and 150% (
   <span class="italic">χ</span> = 1.5) of the true (modeled) income; lower values imply less stringent air quality control and vice versa. In these model runs the true income is used in all other parts of the model.

   </div>
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results demonstrate that although assumptions about air quality control do influence optimal mitigation levels, more decarbonization remains optimal compared to the reference case under all of these scenarios. However, the mechanisms driving the additional decarbonization vary. If the (pre-mitigation) air is dirtier than projected (
   <span class="italic">χ</span> &lt; 1), extra mitigation occurs primarily to reap the health co-benefits. If stringent air quality control occurs in the future (
   <span class="italic">χ</span> &gt; 1), more decarbonization is also optimal compared to the reference case. In part this is to capture remaining health co-benefits, but also for two other reasons. First, the potential damages associated with the substantial loss of the aerosol cooling effect requires additional CO
   <sub>2</sub> reductions as a counterbalance. And second, when the air is cleaner, each marginal reduction in CO
   <sub>2</sub> has a greater net benefit because it is not coupled to as much cooling aerosol.
  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another way of understanding the role of independent air quality measures on optimal climate policy is by comparing not only the different RICE + AIR cases, as in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, but also the difference between the RICE + AIR cases and their corresponding reference cases, as reported in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. The results confirm that as autonomous emission controls get stronger (represented by higher 
   <span class="italic">χ</span> values), the less health co-benefits matter for climate policy.

  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the scenarios displayed in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> is the fully co-optimal case that selects the ideal combination of both air quality and climate policies by introducing an additional policy lever that can act directly on individual air pollutant emissions through end-of-pipe measures, rather than via CO
   <sub>2</sub> (described in Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). When this lever is added, large reductions in air pollutant emissions occur when and where associated abatement costs are low, the reductions lead to relatively large decreases in exposure, and/or they produce few climate damages. This first-best policy where climate and air pollution policies are co-optimized leads to rapid air quality improvements but still increased decarbonization relative to the reference case, albeit by a lower margin than in the standard 
   <span class="italic">χ</span> = 1 case that underlies our main results. Note that we selected 
   <span class="italic">χ</span> = 1 as the basis for the main result in order to explore the effect health co-benefits have when regions act consistently with their current and planned air pollution policies (which are suboptimal). As this section demonstrates, the magnitude of the co-benefit effect is importantly influenced by the assumed level of independent air quality control.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Discounting</div>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RICE model has a discounted utilitarian objective, meaning that for optimal policy calculations, the objective of the model is to maximize the sum of discounted well-being (see Eq. (
   <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>) of the Methods and associated discussion). The discount rate for consumption is determined via the Ramsey rule, which adds the rate of pure time preference to the product of the elasticity of marginal utility and the economic growth rate. The rate of pure time preference is the rate at which the weight given to future well-being declines over time. The elasticity of marginal utility represents the lesser importance of each additional dollar to well-being as one gets richer. Unless otherwise noted, we assume an elasticity of marginal utility of 1.5, the default in RICE.
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all the results presented so far we have used a rate of pure time preference of 1.5% per year, which is the default value RICE, but close to the upper end of the range highlighted by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>. This choice puts more weight on near-term impacts compared to those occurring further in the future. As a result, aerosol impacts, which occur more immediately than the climate impacts from CO
   <sub>2</sub>, have a relatively outsized importance. Nevertheless, when we implement a much lower rate that corresponds to a near-zero (0.1%) preference for the present over the future, optimal decarbonization remains substantially higher in RICE + AIR compared to the analogous reference case (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). (Near-zero time preference is often used in the climate economics literature

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conversely, if we increase time preference to 3.5%, which implies a discount rate for consumption of 7%, the difference between RICE and RICE + AIR becomes even more stark. (To calculate the 7% discount rate via the Ramsey rule, we used the economic growth rate in the initial time period. We note that the exact discount rate may change over time due to the effect of climate damages on economic growth; the impact however, is negligible.). We chose the 7% value because it is the highest of the primary discount rates generally used in US federal cost-benefit analyses. (Although most experts consider lower rates to be more appropriate in an intergenerational context such as in the case of climate change-related analyses

   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> reports the sensitivity of the results to differences in how life-years are monetized in dollar terms. In RICE’s cost-benefit approach, an important second step occurs when the monetized health benefits are valued in well-being terms via the objective function (see Eq. (
   <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>) in the Methods section), which gives the model the aim of maximizing the (discounted) sum of global well-being through time, as is standard in optimal policy modeling. A key feature of the objective function is diminishing marginal utility of consumption, which captures the core concept that an additional dollar generates more well-being when given to a poorer person than to a richer person. The result is that while life-years are assigned a lower dollar amount in poorer countries in absolute terms, they are actually assigned greater value in well-being/utility terms. We discuss this issue in more detail in Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and show in Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> that the strong effect of adding health co-benefits persists whether life years are valued more highly in poorer regions, less highly, or exactly the same as in wealthier regions; however, the magnitude of the effect changes.

  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First (Test 1), we explore different air pollutant co-reduction levels (
   <span class="italic">κ</span>), with the range representing the high and low values after applying alternative estimates from the other four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Note that the SSPs are not ordered in terms of their co-reduction potentials, but instead reflect different possible futures across multiple socioeconomic dimensions. In the second test (Test 2), we substitute the TM5-FAst Scenario Screening Tool (TM5-FASST) source-receptor matrix (SRM) for the SRM based on simulations of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program atmospheric chemistry and transport model. We confined this sensitivity to Asia because it was the only region analyzed as part of a recent project at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis. However, the four Asian regions account for ~85% of all life-years gained globally over the next century in the main analyses (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), and therefore largely drive the findings. In Test 3 and Test 4 we assume that the relative risk for all-cause mortality (
   <span class="italic">β</span>) was the lower and upper bound, respectively, of the confidence interval in Forestiere et al.
   <span class="sup">

   <span class="sup">3</span> instead of 5.8 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>. In Test 6 we assume there is no benefit from reducing air pollution at levels above 50 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>. We include this counterfactual boundary case for two reasons. The first is to investigate the maximum possible concavity in risk functions at high levels of exposure; in reality however, recent empirical studies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
   </span> indicate that the marginal effect of air pollution remains positive at levels well above 50 μg/m
   <span class="sup">3</span>. The second reason is to provide additional emphasis on the importance of India and China, as this test effectively eliminates the impact of both of those nations (as well as the Middle East/North Africa region) over the next several decades and thus explores the model’s sensitivity to their exclusion. Test 7 assumes that climate damages are twice the standard values in RICE, while the final test (Test 8) uses the Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FAIR) climate model (version 1.0)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
