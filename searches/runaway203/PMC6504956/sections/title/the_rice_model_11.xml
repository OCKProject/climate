 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RICE model was first developed in 1996 to analyze the tradeoffs between investing in climate mitigation, which incurs a cost relatively soon, and climate damages, which incur costs in the more distant future

  </span>. RICE is the regionalized counterpart to the DICE model, which is one of three leading cost-benefit climate economy models used by researchers and governments for regulatory analysis, including to estimate the social cost of carbon
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Here we describe the key aspects of the standard RICE2010 model; for a more extensive description of this open-access model, see ref.

 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Briefly, RICE is a regionalized global optimization model that includes an economic component and a geophysical component that are linked. RICE divides the world into 12 regions, some of which are single countries, while others are groups of countries. Each region has a distinct endowment of economic inputs, including capital, labor, and technology, which together produce that region’s gross output via a Cobb–Douglas production function. Pre-mitigation carbon emissions are a function of gross output and an exogenously determined, region-specific carbon intensity pathway. These carbon emissions can be reduced (mitigated) at a cost to gross output through control policies, set to equalize the marginal abatement cost in all regions. Local mitigation cost is borne by each region, and there are no inter-regional transfers. Any remaining (post-mitigation) carbon emissions are incorporated into the climate module where they influence global temperature and, ultimately, the future economy through climate-related damages. Future climate change affects regions differently, with poorer regions generally more vulnerable to climate damages. Damage estimates increase quadratically with a change in the global surface temperature and, like mitigation costs, are incurred directly as the loss of a proportion of gross output. Gross output minus the loss of mitigation costs and climate damages is what we refer to hereafter as GDP.</p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model’s optimization balances mitigation costs, which lower consumption at the time of mitigation, against climate damages which lower consumption in the future. (Regional consumption is the fraction of GDP that is not saved; mitigation cost and climate damage affect consumption only via their effect on GDP). The optimal tradeoff maximizes the sum of discounted well-being, 
  <span class="italic">W</span>, which is a concave function of consumption as follows:

  <span class="italic">L</span> is population, 
  <span class="italic">c</span> per capita consumption, 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span> the rate of pure time preference, and 
  <span class="italic">η</span> the consumption elasticity of marginal utility (inequality aversion). The subscripts 
  <span class="italic">i</span> and 
  <span class="italic">t</span> are the region and time indices, respectively. The model is solved by maximizing this global objective function. As a result, any factor affecting consumption, such as health impacts or climate damages, can be included in the model’s optimization framework. Unless otherwise specified, we maintain RICE’s default parameter values for time preference and inequality aversion of 1.5% and 1.5, respectively.

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this study, all simulations were run using the Mimi model development package in the Julia programming language. This Mimi/Julia version of RICE is fully faithful to the standard Excel version, but has more flexibility
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. We make four changes to this standard version of RICE, in addition to those directly related to the AIR module, which are described below. First, we update the population projections to those of the UN2017 medium variant
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. This is a newer source of projections and also enables us to use internally consistent projections of deaths and life-years, as described further below. The impact of changing population has been comprehensively explored elsewhere
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Second, we update the exogenous radiative forcing terms to the values used in RCP6.0
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>, which is in line with the latest versions of DICE
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>, which is the global (single-region) variant of RICE. These estimates are newer than those found in RICE2010 and are available in disaggregated form, thus allowing us to remove and endogenize the individual aerosol term for use in the AIR module, while maintaining the other non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcings (also described in more detail below). Third, we allow CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations and the global temperature to be endogenous in the second time-step (2015–2025)—it is fixed in standard RICE2010—as the now-endogenized aerosols will produce effects immediately after mitigation. And fourth, we use a modified objective function that avoids Negishi weights, which distort time preferences
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> and the inter-regional tradeoff in ways that are opaque and difficult to justify descriptively and normatively
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. We have explained this latter change in more detail in a previous publication
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span> and also in a sensitivity presented in Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the standard RICE2010 model, anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> is the only endogenous climate forcer. All other sources of radiative forcing, including land-use change, non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> gases, and aerosols are represented through a single exogenous forcing term that aggregates the individual trajectories of each source. This simplifying assumption is problematic when it comes to aerosols. Mitigation actions affecting CO
  <sub>2</sub> have the potential to strongly influence emissions of the air pollutants that produce aerosols, as the two types of emissions share many sources
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Therefore, if carbon emissions are reduced, aerosols will tend to decrease simultaneously. A change in aerosols implies a change in radiative forcing as well as a change in ambient particulate air pollution
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Climate change and air pollution both affect well-being, and capturing the impact of these pathways was the motivation for developing the AIR module, which we now explain.
