  <sub>2</sub> may also reduce air pollutant emissions—and the aerosols they produce—as the two share emission sources. Prior studies on the topic have quantified the associated health co-benefits of pre-defined greenhouse gas reduction scenarios

  </span>, or estimated the economic impacts from reducing specific pollutants
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, but these types of impacts have not been fully incorporated into cost-benefit modeling that estimates how much the world should optimally mitigate. We move this literature forward by developing a comprehensive cost-benefit integrated assessment model based on William Nordhaus’ Regionalized Integrated Climate Economy (RICE) model, where the new developments allow the model to weigh both the health co-benefits and the climate co-harms of aerosol co-reductions (co-harms exist because aerosols produce net cooling overall
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>); the latter in particular has been a largely neglected aspect of the co-benefits discussion. (We use the term co-harm to refer to the net climate harm of aerosol reductions, recognizing that reducing some species of emissions individually may produce different effects than the net of all species together; for example, although reducing black carbon produces a climate benefit, that effect may be outweighed by the climate harm of reductions in other species.).
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These modeling developments, which account for the key air pollutant emissions and their individual properties, provide new capability to investigate fundamental policy questions that have not been answered by existing studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. This includes determining: (1) the optimal climate policy across time and how it is affected by independent air quality control, (2) whether climate policy produces immediate net benefits, or if there are intergenerational tradeoffs, and (3) if specified climate targets are justifiable on cost-benefit grounds.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To answer these questions, we modify the RICE optimization model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> to include an empirically calibrated, regionally differentiated feedback mechanism whereby reducing CO
  <sub>2</sub> also reduces regional air pollutant emissions from co-emitting sources. We then quantify and monetize the impact on both health and radiative forcing throughout the world and compute the resulting optimal climate policy. We thus modify the standard tradeoff between CO
  <sub>2</sub> mitigation costs and climate damages with a more complete analysis that simultaneously weighs mitigation costs, climate damages from CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and the health and climate consequences of changes in air pollutant co-emissions. The resulting model estimates optimal climate policy after jointly considering all these factors. As a robustness check, we also modify the widely used FUND (Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution) model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> to include the same mechanisms.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that when both co-benefits and co-harms are taken fully into account, optimal climate policy results in immediate net benefits globally, which overturns previous findings from cost-benefit models that omit these effects. The global health benefits from climate policy could reach trillions of dollars annually, but their magnitude will importantly depend on the air quality policies that nations adopt independently of climate change. Depending on how society values better health, we show that economically optimal levels of mitigation may be consistent with a target of 2 °C or lower.</p>
