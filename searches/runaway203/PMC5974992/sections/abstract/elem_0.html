      <p>Land use and management activities have a substantial impact on carbon stocks and
         associated greenhouse gas emissions and removals. However, it is challenging to discriminate
         between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic sources and sinks from land. To address
         this problem, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change developed a managed land
         proxy to determine which lands are contributing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions
         and removals. Governments report all emissions and removals from managed land to the
         United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change based on this proxy, and policy
         interventions to reduce emissions from land use are expected to focus on managed lands.
         Our objective was to review the use of the managed land proxy, and summarize the criteria
         that governments have applied to classify land as managed and unmanaged. We found
         that the large majority of governments are not reporting on their application of the
         managed land proxy. Among the governments that do provide information, most have assigned
         all area in specific land uses as managed, while designating all remaining lands as
         unmanaged. This designation as managed land is intuitive for croplands and settlements,
         which would not exist without management interventions, but a portion of forest land,
         grassland, and wetlands may not be managed in a country. Consequently, Brazil, Canada
         and the United States have taken the concept further and delineated managed and unmanaged
         forest land, grassland and wetlands, using additional criteria such as functional
         use of the land and accessibility of the land to anthropogenic activity. The managed
         land proxy is imperfect because reported emissions from any area can include non-anthropogenic
         sources, such as natural disturbances. However, the managed land proxy does make reporting
         of GHG emissions and removals from land use more tractable and comparable by excluding
         fluxes from areas that are not directly influenced by anthropogenic activity. Moreover,
         application of the managed land proxy can be improved by incorporating additional
         criteria that allow for further discrimination between managed and unmanaged land.
