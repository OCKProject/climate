      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proportion of the area of managed forests varies among the ten provinces and three
         territories in Canada. Some provinces, including British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick,
         Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island consider all forest land as managed due to ongoing
         timber harvest, fire protection and conservation activities. In contrast, Saskatchewan,
         Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec delineate a northern border of managed forests based
         on the northern boundary of fire suppression. In these provinces, areas to the north
         of this boundary are considered unmanaged. The Province of Newfoundland and Labrador
         includes all forests on the island of Newfoundland as managed but limits managed forests
         in Labrador to those that are subject to ongoing or planned future timber harvest.
         Yukon and the Northwest Territories delineate managed forest as areas designated for
         timber harvesting and areas under fire protection surrounding communities. Nunavut
         does not contain any managed forest. The initial delineation of managed forests was
         based on GIS boundaries of forest management units used for timber supply planning,
         parks and fire protection zones.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Managed forest areas can occasionally change over time if management activities expand
         into areas currently considered unmanaged forests. Managed forest lands can only leave
         this category through land-use conversion. Once forests are considered managed, they
         remain in that reporting category. Unmanaged forests can become managed forests if
         forest road construction and timber extraction commence, or if they meet other managed
         forest criteria. Unmanaged forests are monitored through Canada’s comprehensive deforestation
         monitoring program to ensure that resource extraction (mining), road construction
         and reservoir flooding events, which cause conversion of forest to non-forest land
         uses, are identified and the resulting emissions reported in the National GHG Inventory
         [
         <a>12</a>, 
         <a>21</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The location and extent of cropland and grassland within a reporting unit is derived
         from remote sensing data [
         <a>22</a>]. Grassland is classified as managed within reporting units that have soil and climate
         conditions suitable for natural grassland and in which the Census of Agriculture identifies
         that agricultural activity is present [
         <a>23</a>]. All other mapped grassland is considered unmanaged.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Atlas of Canada is used to determine the spatial extent of wetlands based on an
         inventory of wetlands, including those covered by forest at a national scale [
         <a>24</a>]. The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has provided a map showing the principal
         peat harvesting areas [
         <a>25</a>] and an estimate of the wetland area managed for peat extraction in 2004 [
         <a>19</a>]. Estimates of the area under peat extraction for previous and subsequent years are
         made by adjusting the 2004 value on the basis of peat production. Flooded lands are
         delineated based on (1) forest conversion mapping [
         <a>21</a>], (2) the Canadian Reservoir Database [
         <a>26</a>], and (3) hydroelectric industry consultations [
         <a>19</a>]. Emissions from reservoirs are reported only for the 10 years following impoundment,
         and all flooding events that have occurred since 1980 are considered managed wetlands.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Settlements are identified through remote sensing data and population density mapping
         using Census data. A combination of the two approaches is applied because remote sensing
         data may lead to misclassification of large areas of trees or grass within an urban
         boundary, while population density mapping may miss isolated areas of manufacturing,
         transportation or resource extraction. Delineation of the settlement area is accomplished
         using the boundaries of Statistics Canada’s ‘Populated Centers’ [
         <a>27</a>] with populations over 30,000, which captures all major Canadian cities and represents
         76% of Canada’s population. The total urban area for years prior to digital boundary
         availability was estimated using boundaries adjusted by manual editing of appropriate
         remote sensing data.
