 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation criteria are specific rules that are used to delineate managed land. For most of the countries, the implementation criteria are based solely on the land use maps developed to support the national GHG inventory. Governments are typically considering a land-use category as completely managed or not managed based on these criteria. Brazil, Canada and the United States provide examples for delineating managed land that includes additional criteria, subdividing individual land uses into both managed and unmanaged areas. The sections below provide further detail on the criteria and implementation methods for each country.</p>

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proportion of the area of managed forests varies among the ten provinces and three territories in Canada. Some provinces, including British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island consider all forest land as managed due to ongoing timber harvest, fire protection and conservation activities. In contrast, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec delineate a northern border of managed forests based on the northern boundary of fire suppression. In these provinces, areas to the north of this boundary are considered unmanaged. The Province of Newfoundland and Labrador includes all forests on the island of Newfoundland as managed but limits managed forests in Labrador to those that are subject to ongoing or planned future timber harvest. Yukon and the Northwest Territories delineate managed forest as areas designated for timber harvesting and areas under fire protection surrounding communities. Nunavut does not contain any managed forest. The initial delineation of managed forests was based on GIS boundaries of forest management units used for timber supply planning, parks and fire protection zones.</p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Managed forest areas can occasionally change over time if management activities expand into areas currently considered unmanaged forests. Managed forest lands can only leave this category through land-use conversion. Once forests are considered managed, they remain in that reporting category. Unmanaged forests can become managed forests if forest road construction and timber extraction commence, or if they meet other managed forest criteria. Unmanaged forests are monitored through Canada’s comprehensive deforestation monitoring program to ensure that resource extraction (mining), road construction and reservoir flooding events, which cause conversion of forest to non-forest land uses, are identified and the resulting emissions reported in the National GHG Inventory [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The location and extent of cropland and grassland within a reporting unit is derived from remote sensing data [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. Grassland is classified as managed within reporting units that have soil and climate conditions suitable for natural grassland and in which the Census of Agriculture identifies that agricultural activity is present [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. All other mapped grassland is considered unmanaged.
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Atlas of Canada is used to determine the spatial extent of wetlands based on an inventory of wetlands, including those covered by forest at a national scale [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has provided a map showing the principal peat harvesting areas [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>] and an estimate of the wetland area managed for peat extraction in 2004 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Estimates of the area under peat extraction for previous and subsequent years are made by adjusting the 2004 value on the basis of peat production. Flooded lands are delineated based on (1) forest conversion mapping [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>], (2) the Canadian Reservoir Database [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>], and (3) hydroelectric industry consultations [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Emissions from reservoirs are reported only for the 10 years following impoundment, and all flooding events that have occurred since 1980 are considered managed wetlands.
  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Settlements are identified through remote sensing data and population density mapping using Census data. A combination of the two approaches is applied because remote sensing data may lead to misclassification of large areas of trees or grass within an urban boundary, while population density mapping may miss isolated areas of manufacturing, transportation or resource extraction. Delineation of the settlement area is accomplished using the boundaries of Statistics Canada’s ‘Populated Centers’ [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>] with populations over 30,000, which captures all major Canadian cities and represents 76% of Canada’s population. The total urban area for years prior to digital boundary availability was estimated using boundaries adjusted by manual editing of appropriate remote sensing data.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brazil</div>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brazil applies IPCC approach 3 methods for land representation, meaning that classification is spatially explicit (i.e., all land area is explicitly classified). The Brazilian government utilizes several criteria (i.e., information plans/layers) and datasets to determine the managed land base, including biome maps, municipal boundaries, native vegetation maps (phytophysiognomy), soil types and land use/cover maps from visual interpretation of Landsat-type satellite imagery. The integration of all these georeferenced layers generates uniquely defined polygons in a Geographic Information System (GIS) that cover the entire national territory. Specifically, each polygon belongs to a single biome, municipality, vegetation type, soil type, and land use/cover. The native forest land and native grassland that fall over legally created Conservation Units and/or demarcated Indigenous Land are included as part of the managed land database. From one inventory year to another, changes in land use/cover are identified, and a polygon in one inventory year may be split into several sub-polygons in the next inventory year, if the entire polygon does not remain in the same land use/cover category. All the native forest land and grassland that is part of the managed land base and is subject to land clearing during the period of inventory is re-classified as another land use category in the same period, even in the case that the land could be temporarily unstocked with trees in the case of forest land.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">United States</div>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United States has incorporated spatial data on specific anthropogenic functions to delineate the managed land base for the national GHG inventory [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. These functions are based on the following criteria. All forest lands with active fire protection and timber harvesting are considered managed. Other anthropogenic activities occur on forest lands, but are within areas already managed for timber harvest or fire protection, or are converted to another land use based on the activity or change in land cover. All grasslands are considered managed at a county scale if there are livestock in the county. Other grassland and forest land areas are considered managed if accessible based on the proximity to roads and other transportation corridors, and/or infrastructure. Wetlands are considered managed if the water level is artificially changed, or the wetlands are created by human activity. Protected lands maintained for recreational and conservation purposes are considered managed (managed by public and private organizations). Lands with active and/or past resource extraction are considered managed.
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the implementation criteria provide a link between the definition and the specific data that are needed to delineate the managed land base. Criteria are implemented using remote sensing imagery that has been classified into land uses. Lands that are used for crop production or settlements are all assigned as managed using the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) for the United States [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. Active fire management is determined from maps of federal and state management plans from the National Atlas [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>] and Alaska Interagency Fire Management Council [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. Forest lands managed for timber harvests are informed by county level estimates of timber products reported in the U.S. Forest Service Timber Products Output Reports database [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Lands maintained for recreational purposes are determined from analysis of the United States Protected Areas Database [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] in which lands are classified as managed if there is suppression of natural disturbances or that are used for extractive or recreational purposes. Multiple data sources are used to delineate areas with active resource extraction, including the Alaska Oil and Gas Information System [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>], Alaska Resource Data File [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>], Active Mines and Mineral Processing Plants [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>], and Coal Production and Preparation Report [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. A buffer of 3300 and 4000 m is applied around petroleum extraction and mine locations, respectively, to account for the footprint of operations and impacts of activities on the surrounding landscape. Accessibility is a criterion unique to the United States among these three countries, and is a key determinant of managed area in remote areas of Alaska. Accessibility is determined using a 10 km buffer surrounding road and train transportation networks with the ESRI Data and Maps product [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>], and a 10 km buffer surrounding settlements using the NLCD.
