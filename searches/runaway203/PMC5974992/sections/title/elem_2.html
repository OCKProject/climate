         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While most governments report net emissions from land use based on their national
            communications to the UNFCCC [
            <a>16</a>], only 19 countries have delineated managed and unmanaged land areas for their territory
            based on a review of the latest communications submitted by governments through 2015
            and Common Reporting Format (CRF) tables submitted in 2018 (note: CRF tables are only
            submitted by Annex I parties to the convention) (Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). There are several reasons that may explain this situation. Approximately 85 out
            of the 195 member governments are developing economies and still use the Revised 1996
            IPCC guidelines for reporting their emissions [
            <a>17</a>], which is in accordance with UNFCCC reporting requirements for developing countries.
            The revised 1996 IPCC guidelines pre-date the development of the managed land concept
            as a proxy to anthropogenic emissions and removals that was introduced in the 2003
            IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) [
            <a>18</a>], and incorporated into the 2006 IPCC Guidelines [
            <a>9</a>]. The latter documents require full representation of land use in the country, with
            all land being subdivided into one of the following land-use categories: forest land,
            cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements and other land. In addition, forest land,
            wetlands and grassland must be divided into managed and unmanaged sub-categories,
            and although there are no GHG reporting requirements for unmanaged lands, countries
            are encouraged to report their areas. As more developing countries adopt the 2006
            IPCC guidelines or even start using the 2003 LULUCF guidance, a complete representation
            of land use will need to be developed, and countries will have to determine which
            portions of their territory meet their definition of managed land.
            
            <div><span>Fig. 1</span><div>
                  <p>Proportion of governments that use approach I, II or III methods for land representation,
                     or have not included this information in their national communications (IPCC 2003,
                     2006) (
                     <span>a</span>). The subset of governments reporting their approach for land representation that
                     have delineated managed and unmanaged areas in their territories compared to the governments
                     that consider all land as managed (
                     <span>b</span>). Data extracted from the latest national communication to the UNFCCC as of 2015
                     and common reporting format tables submitted in 2018 (

            <a>9</a>, 
            <a>18</a>] that include a complete representation of land use, but have not provided information
            about their managed land base. It is not possible to determine the specific reasons
            for these decisions. Governments are not required to mention this concept in their
            national communication to the UNFCCC unless they have delineated a portion of the
            country as unmanaged, although application of the managed land proxy should be discussed
            based on IPCC Guidance [
            <a>9</a>, 
            <a>18</a>]. Regardless, all governments using the later guidance from the IPCC are implicitly
            using the managed land proxy, and many of these governments may consider their entire
            territory as managed land.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Defining managed land</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the governments providing information about application of the managed land
            proxy to subdivide forest land, grassland and wetlands into managed and unmanaged
            land, several have classified managed land simply by considering some land uses as
            managed and others as unmanaged. For example, Australia and Belarus consider all forest
            land, grasslands and wetlands as managed, while land in the ‘other land’ category
            (e.g., rock outcrops, glaciers, barren areas) is considered unmanaged. New Zealand
            considers all grassland and forest land as managed, while wetlands are considered
            unmanaged. The Russian Federation, Ukraine and Peru use the same criteria as New Zealand,
            except that they have designated some forest land in reserves or natural forests as
            unmanaged.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some governments apply the managed land proxy with additional criteria, such as Canada,
            Brazil and the United States. Canada has subdivided grassland, forest land and wetlands
            into managed and unmanaged areas. Grassland is considered managed if used for grazing
            domestic livestock, designated as a national park or is used for an expressed purpose,
            such as a military base [
            <a>19</a>]. Canada considers wetlands in which human intervention has directly altered the
            water table level as managed, and there are two types: peatlands drained for peat
            extraction and flooded land associated with the creation of reservoirs. For reporting
            GHG emissions and removals, managed forests include all forest land that is subject
            to management for timber and non-timber resources as well as other ecological services.
            Therefore, managed land includes the timber harvest land base and other areas, including
            parks and reserved areas. Moreover, because fire suppression efforts in Canada also
            affect GHG emissions and removals, areas that are under intensive protection against
            natural disturbances, mostly fire, are considered managed forests even if there is
            no timber extraction or other non-timber forest use (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brazil defines all secondary forests and grasslands, planted forests, and forests
            subject to selective logging as managed land. Natural grasslands and natural forest
            land are considered unmanaged except in the following cases: [
            <a>1</a>] legally created Conservation Unit areas in Federal and State Conservation Units
            (Except the Private Reserves of National Preservation, due to the lack of consistent
            information regarding management interventions), in accordance with the Ministry of
            the Environment and the National System of Nature Conservation Units; and [
            <a>2</a>] legally demarcated Indigenous Lands, as per information from the National Indian
            Foundation (FUNAI). Managed wetlands include all reservoirs, which are created through
            human activity, while rivers and lakes are considered unmanaged. Other land is classified
            as unmanaged.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United States has taken yet another approach by focusing on direct intervention
            [
            <a>20</a>]. The definition states “managed land occurs mostly in areas accessible to human
            activity and includes altering or maintaining the condition of the land to produce
            commercial or non-commercial products or services; to serve as transportation corridors
            or locations for buildings, landfills, or other developed areas for commercial or
            non-commercial purposes; to extract resources or facilitate acquisition of resources;
            or to provide social functions for personal, community or societal objectives where
            these areas are readily accessible to society” [
            <a>20</a>]. The United States government has incorporated accessibility of the land as a criterion,
            and included specific functions in the definition.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation criteria are specific rules that are used to delineate managed land.
            For most of the countries, the implementation criteria are based solely on the land
            use maps developed to support the national GHG inventory. Governments are typically
            considering a land-use category as completely managed or not managed based on these
            criteria. Brazil, Canada and the United States provide examples for delineating managed
            land that includes additional criteria, subdividing individual land uses into both
            managed and unmanaged areas. The sections below provide further detail on the criteria
            and implementation methods for each country.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proportion of the area of managed forests varies among the ten provinces and three
               territories in Canada. Some provinces, including British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick,
               Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island consider all forest land as managed due to ongoing
               timber harvest, fire protection and conservation activities. In contrast, Saskatchewan,
               Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec delineate a northern border of managed forests based
               on the northern boundary of fire suppression. In these provinces, areas to the north
               of this boundary are considered unmanaged. The Province of Newfoundland and Labrador
               includes all forests on the island of Newfoundland as managed but limits managed forests
               in Labrador to those that are subject to ongoing or planned future timber harvest.
               Yukon and the Northwest Territories delineate managed forest as areas designated for
               timber harvesting and areas under fire protection surrounding communities. Nunavut
               does not contain any managed forest. The initial delineation of managed forests was
               based on GIS boundaries of forest management units used for timber supply planning,
               parks and fire protection zones.
            </p>
            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Managed forest areas can occasionally change over time if management activities expand
               into areas currently considered unmanaged forests. Managed forest lands can only leave
               this category through land-use conversion. Once forests are considered managed, they
               remain in that reporting category. Unmanaged forests can become managed forests if
               forest road construction and timber extraction commence, or if they meet other managed
               forest criteria. Unmanaged forests are monitored through Canada’s comprehensive deforestation
               monitoring program to ensure that resource extraction (mining), road construction
               and reservoir flooding events, which cause conversion of forest to non-forest land
               uses, are identified and the resulting emissions reported in the National GHG Inventory
               [

               that agricultural activity is present [

               peat harvesting areas [

               made by adjusting the 2004 value on the basis of peat production. Flooded lands are
               delineated based on (1) forest conversion mapping [

               boundary, while population density mapping may miss isolated areas of manufacturing,
               transportation or resource extraction. Delineation of the settlement area is accomplished
               using the boundaries of Statistics Canada’s ‘Populated Centers’ [

               is spatially explicit (i.e., all land area is explicitly classified). The Brazilian
               government utilizes several criteria (i.e., information plans/layers) and datasets
               to determine the managed land base, including biome maps, municipal boundaries, native
               vegetation maps (phytophysiognomy), soil types and land use/cover maps from visual
               interpretation of Landsat-type satellite imagery. The integration of all these georeferenced
               layers generates uniquely defined polygons in a Geographic Information System (GIS)
               that cover the entire national territory. Specifically, each polygon belongs to a
               single biome, municipality, vegetation type, soil type, and land use/cover. The native
               forest land and native grassland that fall over legally created Conservation Units
               and/or demarcated Indigenous Land are included as part of the managed land database.
               From one inventory year to another, changes in land use/cover are identified, and
               a polygon in one inventory year may be split into several sub-polygons in the next
               inventory year, if the entire polygon does not remain in the same land use/cover category.
               All the native forest land and grassland that is part of the managed land base and
               is subject to land clearing during the period of inventory is re-classified as another
               land use category in the same period, even in the case that the land could be temporarily

               to delineate the managed land base for the national GHG inventory [
               <a>20</a>]. These functions are based on the following criteria. All forest lands with active
               fire protection and timber harvesting are considered managed. Other anthropogenic
               activities occur on forest lands, but are within areas already managed for timber
               harvest or fire protection, or are converted to another land use based on the activity
               or change in land cover. All grasslands are considered managed at a county scale if
               there are livestock in the county. Other grassland and forest land areas are considered
               managed if accessible based on the proximity to roads and other transportation corridors,
               and/or infrastructure. Wetlands are considered managed if the water level is artificially
               changed, or the wetlands are created by human activity. Protected lands maintained
               for recreational and conservation purposes are considered managed (managed by public

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the implementation criteria provide a link between the definition and the
               specific data that are needed to delineate the managed land base. Criteria are implemented
               using remote sensing imagery that has been classified into land uses. Lands that are
               used for crop production or settlements are all assigned as managed using the National
               Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) for the United States [
               <a>28</a>–

               <a>31</a>] and Alaska Interagency Fire Management Council [
               <a>32</a>]. Forest lands managed for timber harvests are informed by county level estimates

               database [
               <a>33</a>]. Lands maintained for recreational purposes are determined from analysis of the
               United States Protected Areas Database [
               <a>34</a>] in which lands are classified as managed if there is suppression of natural disturbances
               or that are used for extractive or recreational purposes. Multiple data sources are
               used to delineate areas with active resource extraction, including the Alaska Oil

               respectively, to account for the footprint of operations and impacts of activities
               on the surrounding landscape. Accessibility is a criterion unique to the United States
               among these three countries, and is a key determinant of managed area in remote areas
               of Alaska. Accessibility is determined using a 10 km buffer surrounding road and train
               transportation networks with the ESRI Data and Maps product [

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brazil has approximately 500 million hectares of managed land and 316 million hectares
            of unmanaged land based on an analysis for 2010 (Table 
            <a>1</a>) [
            <a>42</a>]. Brazil reports the net emissions for each one of its six biomes (Amazonia—AM; Cerrado—CE;
            Caatinga—CA; Mata Atlantica—MA; Pampa—PA; Pantanal—PT), with percent coverage of approximately
            49, 24, 10, 13, 2 and 2% of the national territory (852, 187, 545 ha) respectively.
            In 2010, unmanaged native forest land corresponded to approximately 31% in AM; 30%
            in CE; 48% in CA; 16% in MA, 12% in PA and 54% in PT. Unmanaged native grassland corresponds
            to approximately 1, 13, 1, 2, 16 and 21% of the total territorial area of AM, CE,
            CA, MA, PA and PT, respectively. The percent coverage of other land (classified as
            unmanaged) in the total biome territorial area is near zero in all biomes except for
            PA, where it is approximately 1%.

            and Hawaii, where much of the land is actively managed for crop production, grazing
            livestock, timber production, or occurs within settlement areas. Moreover, the majority
            of the land in these regions is within a 10 km buffer of the road network, railroad
            corridors or settlements. There are large blocks of land in Alaska that are classified
            as unmanaged, which are grassland, forest land or wetland. These areas are largely
            inaccessible, which means that they are outside the 10 km buffer of road networks
            or other transportation corridors, and have no direct human management or function
            in which anthropogenic activities are influencing GHG emissions.
