      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The managed forest land in Canada in 2015 includes 225.9 Mha (Table 
         <a>1</a>) and represents 81% of the total managed land base of the country [
         <a>40</a>]. The total area of unmanaged forest in Canada is 118 Mha and all of this area is
         in northern regions of the country with limited or no access (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). Canada also reported 45.1 Mha of cropland (16.1% of total managed land area) across
         10 provinces and 6.6 Mha of managed grassland (2.4%) in Saskatchewan, Alberta and
         British Columbia. Settlements accounted for 0.9 Mha (0.3%) of the managed land base,
         and managed wetlands accounted for 0.5 Mha (0.02%). There are 512.4 Mha of unmanaged
         land in grasslands, wetlands and other lands, predominantly in northern Canada [

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brazil has approximately 500 million hectares of managed land and 316 million hectares
         of unmanaged land based on an analysis for 2010 (Table 
         <a>1</a>) [
         <a>42</a>]. Brazil reports the net emissions for each one of its six biomes (Amazonia—AM; Cerrado—CE;
         Caatinga—CA; Mata Atlantica—MA; Pampa—PA; Pantanal—PT), with percent coverage of approximately
         49, 24, 10, 13, 2 and 2% of the national territory (852, 187, 545 ha) respectively.
         In 2010, unmanaged native forest land corresponded to approximately 31% in AM; 30%
         in CE; 48% in CA; 16% in MA, 12% in PA and 54% in PT. Unmanaged native grassland corresponds
         to approximately 1, 13, 1, 2, 16 and 21% of the total territorial area of AM, CE,
         CA, MA, PA and PT, respectively. The percent coverage of other land (classified as
         unmanaged) in the total biome territorial area is near zero in all biomes except for

         livestock, timber production, or occurs within settlement areas. Moreover, the majority
         of the land in these regions is within a 10 km buffer of the road network, railroad
         corridors or settlements. There are large blocks of land in Alaska that are classified
         as unmanaged, which are grassland, forest land or wetland. These areas are largely
         inaccessible, which means that they are outside the 10 km buffer of road networks
         or other transportation corridors, and have no direct human management or function
         in which anthropogenic activities are influencing GHG emissions.
