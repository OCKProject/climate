      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Use of managed land proxy</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While most governments report net emissions from land use based on their national
         communications to the UNFCCC [
         <a>16</a>], only 19 countries have delineated managed and unmanaged land areas for their territory
         based on a review of the latest communications submitted by governments through 2015
         and Common Reporting Format (CRF) tables submitted in 2018 (note: CRF tables are only
         submitted by Annex I parties to the convention) (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). There are several reasons that may explain this situation. Approximately 85 out
         of the 195 member governments are developing economies and still use the Revised 1996
         IPCC guidelines for reporting their emissions [
         <a>17</a>], which is in accordance with UNFCCC reporting requirements for developing countries.
         The revised 1996 IPCC guidelines pre-date the development of the managed land concept
         as a proxy to anthropogenic emissions and removals that was introduced in the 2003
         IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) [
         <a>18</a>], and incorporated into the 2006 IPCC Guidelines [
         <a>9</a>]. The latter documents require full representation of land use in the country, with
         all land being subdivided into one of the following land-use categories: forest land,
         cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements and other land. In addition, forest land,
         wetlands and grassland must be divided into managed and unmanaged sub-categories,
         and although there are no GHG reporting requirements for unmanaged lands, countries
         are encouraged to report their areas. As more developing countries adopt the 2006
         IPCC guidelines or even start using the 2003 LULUCF guidance, a complete representation
         of land use will need to be developed, and countries will have to determine which
         portions of their territory meet their definition of managed land.

               <p>Proportion of governments that use approach I, II or III methods for land representation,
                  or have not included this information in their national communications (IPCC 2003,
                  2006) (
                  <span>a</span>). The subset of governments reporting their approach for land representation that
                  have delineated managed and unmanaged areas in their territories compared to the governments
                  that consider all land as managed (
                  <span>b</span>). Data extracted from the latest national communication to the UNFCCC as of 2015
                  and common reporting format tables submitted in 2018 (
                  <span>http://www.unfccc.int</span>)

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another 97 countries have adopted the later guidance from the IPCC [
         <a>9</a>, 
         <a>18</a>] that include a complete representation of land use, but have not provided information
         about their managed land base. It is not possible to determine the specific reasons
         for these decisions. Governments are not required to mention this concept in their
         national communication to the UNFCCC unless they have delineated a portion of the
         country as unmanaged, although application of the managed land proxy should be discussed
         based on IPCC Guidance [
         <a>9</a>, 
         <a>18</a>]. Regardless, all governments using the later guidance from the IPCC are implicitly
         using the managed land proxy, and many of these governments may consider their entire
         territory as managed land.
