      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United States has incorporated spatial data on specific anthropogenic functions
         to delineate the managed land base for the national GHG inventory [
         <a>20</a>]. These functions are based on the following criteria. All forest lands with active
         fire protection and timber harvesting are considered managed. Other anthropogenic
         activities occur on forest lands, but are within areas already managed for timber
         harvest or fire protection, or are converted to another land use based on the activity
         or change in land cover. All grasslands are considered managed at a county scale if
         there are livestock in the county. Other grassland and forest land areas are considered
         managed if accessible based on the proximity to roads and other transportation corridors,
         and/or infrastructure. Wetlands are considered managed if the water level is artificially
         changed, or the wetlands are created by human activity. Protected lands maintained
         for recreational and conservation purposes are considered managed (managed by public
         and private organizations). Lands with active and/or past resource extraction are
         considered managed.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the implementation criteria provide a link between the definition and the
         specific data that are needed to delineate the managed land base. Criteria are implemented
         using remote sensing imagery that has been classified into land uses. Lands that are
         used for crop production or settlements are all assigned as managed using the National
         Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) for the United States [
         <a>28</a>–
         <a>30</a>]. Active fire management is determined from maps of federal and state management
         plans from the National Atlas [
         <a>31</a>] and Alaska Interagency Fire Management Council [
         <a>32</a>]. Forest lands managed for timber harvests are informed by county level estimates
         of timber products reported in the U.S. Forest Service Timber Products Output Reports
         database [
         <a>33</a>]. Lands maintained for recreational purposes are determined from analysis of the
         United States Protected Areas Database [
         <a>34</a>] in which lands are classified as managed if there is suppression of natural disturbances
         or that are used for extractive or recreational purposes. Multiple data sources are
         used to delineate areas with active resource extraction, including the Alaska Oil
         and Gas Information System [
         <a>35</a>], Alaska Resource Data File [
         <a>36</a>], Active Mines and Mineral Processing Plants [
         <a>37</a>], and Coal Production and Preparation Report [
         <a>38</a>]. A buffer of 3300 and 4000 m is applied around petroleum extraction and mine locations,
         respectively, to account for the footprint of operations and impacts of activities
         on the surrounding landscape. Accessibility is a criterion unique to the United States
         among these three countries, and is a key determinant of managed area in remote areas
         of Alaska. Accessibility is determined using a 10 km buffer surrounding road and train
         transportation networks with the ESRI Data and Maps product [
         <a>39</a>], and a 10 km buffer surrounding settlements using the NLCD.
