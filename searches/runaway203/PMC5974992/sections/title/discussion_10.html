      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two general approaches have been used to classify land as managed by countries reporting
         GHG emissions and C stock changes to the UNFCCC. The first approach is based on subdividing
         managed and unmanaged land according to the land-use classification with specific
         land uses designated as unmanaged. The second approach requires data on accessibility,
         vegetation structure and/or functional activities, such as grazing, mining, timber
         harvest, fire protection, crop production, conservation and social functions. Both
         approaches are in compliance with the reporting requirements established in the IPCC
         guidance [
         <a>9</a>–
         <a>11</a>], but arguably the second approach may allow national compilers to better discriminate
         between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic emissions and removals.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples of the first approach include New Zealand that considers all wetlands as
         unmanaged, in addition to Australia and Belarus that consider land classified as “other
         lands” as unmanaged. Identifying some land uses as managed and others as unmanaged
         is a relatively simple and transparent approach. Lands are classified into land uses
         based on land cover maps derived from remote sensing imagery and other information.
         The land uses are expected to reflect specific functional activities, and therefore
         align reasonably well with areas that are managed and unmanaged in some countries.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second approach incorporates additional data on specific functional activities,
         such as the approaches applied in Brazil, Canada and the United States. This approach
         is likely to be advantageous if land cover data do not align with functional activity.
         For example, forest land may not be managed in some parts of a country due to remoteness,
         lack of access, low human population density, or limited development in the region.
         Including these areas in the inventory would lead to unnecessary use of resources
         to compile information that is needed to estimate C stocks and associated changes,
         rather than focusing the time and effort in areas that are directly influenced by
         human activity. Furthermore, governments could over- or under-estimate anthropogenic
         emissions by conducting inventories for areas that are not managed.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brazil, Canada, and United States have used the second approach to delineate their
         managed land areas, but even with these applications, each country is using elements
         of the first approach. Specifically each country classifies all cropland and settlements
         as managed, which is intuitive given that these areas would not even exist without
         direct human intervention. Forest lands, grasslands and wetlands incorporate functional
         or locational criteria to varying degrees to determine the managed and unmanaged land
         areas. For example, Canada and the United States determine the area of managed forest
         land based on timber harvest and extraction of other resources, active fire suppression
         and areas used for specific conservation and ecological functions. The government
         of Brazil uses similar criteria and includes in the managed land base, natural forest
         land and natural grassland in Conservation Units and/or Indigenous Lands, secondary
         vegetation (both in forest land and grassland), planted forests, and forests subject
         to selective logging. The United States also introduces a criterion of accessibility
         that leads to some remote areas, particularly in Alaska, being classified as unmanaged.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grasslands are one of the more difficult areas to classify as managed or unmanaged
         because human intervention, particularly livestock grazing, can be difficult to ascertain
         from satellite remote sensing data. For example, even with clear implementation criteria,
         the identification of managed grassland in Canada is problematic with relatively low
         classification accuracy of 55, 58 and 69%, while in contrast, Canadian cropland has
         been mapped at 71, 82 and 93% accuracy for 1990, 2000 and 2010, respectively [
         <a>22</a>]. The relatively low accuracy of imagery classification is due to the similarity
         in reflectance between ‘native’ grassland that is used for livestock grazing and permanent
         pasture. Permanent pasture is land that has been improved by land clearing, stone
         removal, fertilization, breaking and seeding or fencing, but the level of improvement
         often declines over time to the point where the vegetation is similar to native grassland.
         With similar grazing practices, the distinction between the two is difficult, even
         with on-site visits.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United States has attempted to circumvent some of these problems by classifying
         all grassland as managed in counties (smallest political unit in which Census data
         are available) that are known to have active livestock grazing based on Census data.
         However, this approach may lead to an over-estimation of managed grasslands, particularly
         in the western United States where there are large areas of native grasslands that
         may not be actively managed. Furthermore, even if livestock are active on these native
         grasslands, the impact on the structure of the vegetation may be limited compared
         to unmanaged grasslands, and so there may be little or no anthropogenic impact on
         C stocks and GHG emissions. Brazil uses a similar criterion to classify Protected
         Areas (or Conservation Units) and/or Indigenous Lands as managed, with the rationale
         that creating specific legislation is leading to a direct anthropogenic action. Similar
         to grasslands in the western United States, this policy may not have much impact on
         areas designated as Protected Areas and Indigenous Lands of Brazil. Implementing an
         additional criterion related to impacts on vegetation structure may save resources
         and time in conducting GHG inventories, by further focusing the estimation on those
         areas subject to anthropogenic emissions and removals.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Non-anthropogenic emissions can occur on managed land, and can be problematic for
         reporting anthropogenic emissions to the UNFCCC. For example, Brazil reports the area
         and associated CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions from natural forest land previously classified as unmanaged when it becomes
         part of the managed land base. From 2002 to 2010, there were 59 million ha of new
         managed land, mostly in the Amazonia region, and these areas sequestered 190 Tg CO
         <sub>2</sub>. Indirect human-induced effects, such as CO
         <sub>2</sub> fertilization and/or N deposition, are most likely driving the net uptake of CO
         <sub>2</sub> in these areas, and consequently the sinks are not under the direct control of anthropogenic
         management activity. It may be possible to determine the non-anthropogenic emissions
         from the managed land base although this is not trivial as noted previously [
         <a>15</a>, 
         <a>43</a>]. These methods could help national inventory compilers to disaggregate the reporting
         into those emissions and removals that are clearly the result of human activities,
         and those that are the results of indirect anthropogenic activity or other emissions
         drivers, such as natural disturbances resulting from insect outbreaks and wildfires.
         For example, in their 2017 National GHG Inventory, Canada reported separately the
         emissions and removals from forest lands that have been subjected to natural disturbance
         and all emissions and removals on managed forest lands [
         <a>40</a>]. Indirect effects of anthropogenic activity, such as increased wildfires or pest
         and disease outbreaks that lead to increased flux of CO
         <sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere, or CO
         <sub>2</sub> fertilization that increases net primary production and removals, in principle should
         not be included in the reported estimates because they are not directly under the
         control of land managers. However, aside from the attempts to disaggregate emissions
         and removals from natural disturbances by Canada and Australia, factoring-out has
         not been attempted in any other National GHG Inventory, and more evaluation is needed
         to determine the effectiveness of these approaches.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The exclusion of unmanaged lands may lead to scientifically incomplete understanding
         of the greenhouse gas fluxes between the land surface and atmosphere. For example,
         much of the unmanaged land areas in Canada and Alaska contain deep organic layers
         and permafrost that are susceptible to a range of climate change impacts from thawing,
         water table changes if ice melt allows water to drain, and wildfires [
         <a>12</a>, 
         <a>44</a>]. The response of these lands to climate change and the associated emissions could
         have significant impacts on the global C cycle (both CO
         <sub>2</sub> and CH
         <sub>4</sub>). While it would not be appropriate to report these as anthropogenic emissions, the
         fluxes can have important implications for global policies aimed at achieving GHG
         reduction targets or atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration targets. If emissions from unmanaged forests, peatland or permafrost
         C (positive feedback) use up some of the remaining “allowance” for C emissions to
         the atmosphere [
         <a>45</a>], then mitigation efforts in all other sectors have to increase to meet the global
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> reduction targets. While currently there are no UNFCCC requirements for monitoring
         and reporting of GHG emissions from these areas by governments because they are designated
         as unmanaged, including these areas could contribute more certainty to the outcomes
         of policy programs intended to limit the impact of anthropogenic GHG emissions on
         the climate system.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the IPCC, it is good practice to be transparent about the methods that
         are used for estimating and reporting GHG emissions [
         <a>9</a>]. Based on our review, governments could be more transparent about their application
         of the managed land proxy in national communications. Many communications do not explicitly
         mention managed land even though the concept is implicitly applied by the 97 government
         that are using the later guidance from the IPCC [
         <a>9</a>, 
         <a>18</a>] based on our review. Specifically, governments could provide a definition for managed
         land and implementation criteria. If some of the land is not managed, then it would
         also be useful to provide a map with the spatial distribution of managed and unmanaged
         land. In addition, changes in the managed land base over time should be reported,
         and the effect of those changes on emission and removals.
