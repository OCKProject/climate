      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land use are a substantial contributor to global
         emissions, particularly carbon (C) stock changes from land-use conversion [
         <a>1</a>–
         <a>3</a>]. For example, deforestation, i.e., converting forests to non-forest uses (e.g.,
         settlements) leads to oxidation of organic matter in the tree biomass, litter and
         dead wood pools both onsite and offsite, and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO
         <sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere, as well as emissions of other non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> GHGs where burning occurs. Afforestation and reforestation have the potential to
         reverse this process resulting in a net uptake of CO
         <sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. Such a dynamic was exhibited in the United States during the
         twentieth century as former croplands were abandoned and reverted to forest in many
         cases [
         <a>4</a>]. Land-use conversion also influences soil C pools. For example, cultivation of land
         leads to a release of soil C ranging from 30 to 60% of the original stock in the topsoil
         [
         <a>5</a>, 
         <a>6</a>]. Adopting conservation tillage, particularly no-till, can increase soil C stocks
         due to physical protection of organic matter in aggregates [
         <a>7</a>, 
         <a>8</a>]. Changing crop production practices, such as planting improved varieties or changing
         fertilization and irrigation practices can also have an impact on soil C stocks [
         <a>9</a>]. Land use can have a profound effect on trajectories of terrestrial C sinks and
         sources, as well as other GHG fluxes, and consequently, quantifying the impacts of
         land use and land-use change is a fundamental component of national GHG inventories.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed guidelines for
         estimating anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals [
         <a>9</a>–
         <a>11</a>] that are used to compile national GHG inventories for reporting to the United Nations
         Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). National greenhouse gas inventories
         focus on anthropogenic sources of emissions because policy interventions directly
         influence human activities contributing to emissions. Other, non-anthropogenic sources
         of emissions, such as permafrost melting in the arctic and associated CO
         <sub>2</sub> fluxes, are important for understanding the global C cycle, but are less likely to
         be impacted by direct management actions. In the case of permafrost, indirect effects
         are possible by reducing direct emissions from anthropogenic sources, such as fossil
         fuel combustion, fertilization management for croplands, waste management, but direct
         management of permafrost seems unlikely. Therefore, as part of the IPCC guidelines,
         GHG emissions and associated C stock changes from land use and management activities
         are to be estimated for all managed land in the country.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The IPCC defines managed land as “… land where human interventions and practices have
         been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions” [
         <a>9</a>]. However, the use of “managed land” as a proxy for anthropogenically-driven GHG
         fluxes does not always require active management such as in cropland, settlements
         or commercial forest land. It may also incorporate management decisions that are more
         nuanced, such as protecting lands from wildfires, using wilderness for recreation
         or designating areas for conservation. The IPCC guidance provides latitude for governments
         to refine the definition of managed land to meet their national circumstances, but
         the definition should be applied consistently over time and across the territory in
         the country. Reporting should also be transparent and include descriptions of the
         methods and definitions used to determine areas of managed and unmanaged lands. Determining
         the managed land base will have implications for C stock changes and associated GHG
         emissions that are reported to the UNFCCC and addressed by policy actions to mitigate
         GHG emissions.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emissions and removals of GHGs from the land surface occur even without anthropogenic
         interventions through land management. For example, forests accumulate and lose C
         through production and decomposition processes, and these trajectories can change
         with natural disturbances [
         <a>12</a>]. In addition, there is a limit to how much a land manager can influence GHG emissions
         on managed land because the processes driving C stock changes and other GHG fluxes
         are not fully controlled by the manager. This has been recognized in the agreements
         for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and participating countries
         have the option to exclude emissions and subsequent removals from natural disturbances
         on managed lands with fulfillment of the defined rules [
         <a>11</a>, 
         <a>13</a>]. Complete separation of anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic emissions on managed
         land is not trivial [
         <a>14</a>, 
         <a>15</a>], and may not even be feasible. Regardless, the managed land proxy allows inventory
         compilers to focus on areas in a country directly impacted by management activity,
         and is considered by the IPCC as the most universally applicable approach for separating
         anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic emissions associated with land use [
         <a>14</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the disparity in the use of the managed land proxy among UNFCCC member governments,
         there is a need to understand the concept and associated application by governments.
         Therefore, our objective is to review steps for delineating a managed land base as
         a foundation for reporting GHG emissions associated with land use and land-use change.
         The managed land definition and implementation methods for Brazil, Canada and the
         United States are examined in more detail. Developing a managed land base involves
         three general steps, (a) defining managed land taking into consideration national
         circumstances, (b) developing implementation criteria compatible with the definition,
         and (c) implementing the analysis to produce the managed land base for GHG reporting.
