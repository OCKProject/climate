      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implementation criteria are specific rules that are used to delineate managed land.
         For most of the countries, the implementation criteria are based solely on the land
         use maps developed to support the national GHG inventory. Governments are typically
         considering a land-use category as completely managed or not managed based on these
         criteria. Brazil, Canada and the United States provide examples for delineating managed
         land that includes additional criteria, subdividing individual land uses into both
         managed and unmanaged areas. The sections below provide further detail on the criteria
         and implementation methods for each country.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proportion of the area of managed forests varies among the ten provinces and three
            territories in Canada. Some provinces, including British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick,
            Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island consider all forest land as managed due to ongoing
            timber harvest, fire protection and conservation activities. In contrast, Saskatchewan,
            Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec delineate a northern border of managed forests based
            on the northern boundary of fire suppression. In these provinces, areas to the north
            of this boundary are considered unmanaged. The Province of Newfoundland and Labrador
            includes all forests on the island of Newfoundland as managed but limits managed forests
            in Labrador to those that are subject to ongoing or planned future timber harvest.
            Yukon and the Northwest Territories delineate managed forest as areas designated for
            timber harvesting and areas under fire protection surrounding communities. Nunavut
            does not contain any managed forest. The initial delineation of managed forests was
            based on GIS boundaries of forest management units used for timber supply planning,
            parks and fire protection zones.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Managed forest areas can occasionally change over time if management activities expand
            into areas currently considered unmanaged forests. Managed forest lands can only leave
            this category through land-use conversion. Once forests are considered managed, they
            remain in that reporting category. Unmanaged forests can become managed forests if
            forest road construction and timber extraction commence, or if they meet other managed
            forest criteria. Unmanaged forests are monitored through Canada’s comprehensive deforestation
            monitoring program to ensure that resource extraction (mining), road construction
            and reservoir flooding events, which cause conversion of forest to non-forest land
            uses, are identified and the resulting emissions reported in the National GHG Inventory
            [
            <a>12</a>, 
            <a>21</a>].
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The location and extent of cropland and grassland within a reporting unit is derived
            from remote sensing data [
            <a>22</a>]. Grassland is classified as managed within reporting units that have soil and climate
            conditions suitable for natural grassland and in which the Census of Agriculture identifies
            that agricultural activity is present [
            <a>23</a>]. All other mapped grassland is considered unmanaged.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Atlas of Canada is used to determine the spatial extent of wetlands based on an
            inventory of wetlands, including those covered by forest at a national scale [
            <a>24</a>]. The Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association has provided a map showing the principal
            peat harvesting areas [
            <a>25</a>] and an estimate of the wetland area managed for peat extraction in 2004 [
            <a>19</a>]. Estimates of the area under peat extraction for previous and subsequent years are
            made by adjusting the 2004 value on the basis of peat production. Flooded lands are
            delineated based on (1) forest conversion mapping [
            <a>21</a>], (2) the Canadian Reservoir Database [
            <a>26</a>], and (3) hydroelectric industry consultations [
            <a>19</a>]. Emissions from reservoirs are reported only for the 10 years following impoundment,
            and all flooding events that have occurred since 1980 are considered managed wetlands.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Settlements are identified through remote sensing data and population density mapping
            using Census data. A combination of the two approaches is applied because remote sensing
            data may lead to misclassification of large areas of trees or grass within an urban
            boundary, while population density mapping may miss isolated areas of manufacturing,
            transportation or resource extraction. Delineation of the settlement area is accomplished
            using the boundaries of Statistics Canada’s ‘Populated Centers’ [
            <a>27</a>] with populations over 30,000, which captures all major Canadian cities and represents
            76% of Canada’s population. The total urban area for years prior to digital boundary
            availability was estimated using boundaries adjusted by manual editing of appropriate
            remote sensing data.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brazil applies IPCC approach 3 methods for land representation, meaning that classification
            is spatially explicit (i.e., all land area is explicitly classified). The Brazilian
            government utilizes several criteria (i.e., information plans/layers) and datasets
            to determine the managed land base, including biome maps, municipal boundaries, native
            vegetation maps (phytophysiognomy), soil types and land use/cover maps from visual
            interpretation of Landsat-type satellite imagery. The integration of all these georeferenced
            layers generates uniquely defined polygons in a Geographic Information System (GIS)
            that cover the entire national territory. Specifically, each polygon belongs to a
            single biome, municipality, vegetation type, soil type, and land use/cover. The native
            forest land and native grassland that fall over legally created Conservation Units
            and/or demarcated Indigenous Land are included as part of the managed land database.
            From one inventory year to another, changes in land use/cover are identified, and
            a polygon in one inventory year may be split into several sub-polygons in the next
            inventory year, if the entire polygon does not remain in the same land use/cover category.
            All the native forest land and grassland that is part of the managed land base and
            is subject to land clearing during the period of inventory is re-classified as another
            land use category in the same period, even in the case that the land could be temporarily
            unstocked with trees in the case of forest land.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United States has incorporated spatial data on specific anthropogenic functions
            to delineate the managed land base for the national GHG inventory [
            <a>20</a>]. These functions are based on the following criteria. All forest lands with active
            fire protection and timber harvesting are considered managed. Other anthropogenic
            activities occur on forest lands, but are within areas already managed for timber
            harvest or fire protection, or are converted to another land use based on the activity
            or change in land cover. All grasslands are considered managed at a county scale if
            there are livestock in the county. Other grassland and forest land areas are considered
            managed if accessible based on the proximity to roads and other transportation corridors,
            and/or infrastructure. Wetlands are considered managed if the water level is artificially
            changed, or the wetlands are created by human activity. Protected lands maintained
            for recreational and conservation purposes are considered managed (managed by public
            and private organizations). Lands with active and/or past resource extraction are
            considered managed.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the implementation criteria provide a link between the definition and the
            specific data that are needed to delineate the managed land base. Criteria are implemented
            using remote sensing imagery that has been classified into land uses. Lands that are
            used for crop production or settlements are all assigned as managed using the National
            Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) for the United States [
            <a>28</a>–
            <a>30</a>]. Active fire management is determined from maps of federal and state management
            plans from the National Atlas [
            <a>31</a>] and Alaska Interagency Fire Management Council [
            <a>32</a>]. Forest lands managed for timber harvests are informed by county level estimates
            of timber products reported in the U.S. Forest Service Timber Products Output Reports
            database [
            <a>33</a>]. Lands maintained for recreational purposes are determined from analysis of the
            United States Protected Areas Database [
            <a>34</a>] in which lands are classified as managed if there is suppression of natural disturbances
            or that are used for extractive or recreational purposes. Multiple data sources are
            used to delineate areas with active resource extraction, including the Alaska Oil
            and Gas Information System [
            <a>35</a>], Alaska Resource Data File [
            <a>36</a>], Active Mines and Mineral Processing Plants [
            <a>37</a>], and Coal Production and Preparation Report [
            <a>38</a>]. A buffer of 3300 and 4000 m is applied around petroleum extraction and mine locations,
            respectively, to account for the footprint of operations and impacts of activities
            on the surrounding landscape. Accessibility is a criterion unique to the United States
            among these three countries, and is a key determinant of managed area in remote areas
            of Alaska. Accessibility is determined using a 10 km buffer surrounding road and train
            transportation networks with the ESRI Data and Maps product [
            <a>39</a>], and a 10 km buffer surrounding settlements using the NLCD.
