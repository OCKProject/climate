 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the data before 2000 and the approaches for calculating future AHF data in this study, we projected the AHF data in 2005, 2010, and 2015 for test. Based on these test data, the average AHF of the 100 largest cities in the world in 2005 was calculated to be about 11.44 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, which is slightly larger than the corresponding measurement based on the PF-AHF data (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). However, the test data in 2010 and 2015 were smaller than the corresponding measurements overall. These differences between the two abovementioned data were mainly caused by the use of the different energy consumption data. While the measured data were calculated using the energy consumption records, the test data were calculated using the energy consumption projections based on the average annual growth rate of the energy demand during 2000–2030. This growth rate was higher than the reality in the early period but lower than the reality in the late period. Moreover, while RMSE between the test data and the measured data increased from 2.80 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> in 2005 to 5.12 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> in 2015, their R
  <span class="sup">2</span> decreased from 0.97 in 2005 to 0.88 in 2015. These imply that the differences of AHF between the projections and the actual situation would increase with time. However, there were significant correlations between the test data and the measured data in 2005, 2010, and 2015, implying certain reliability of the projected AHF data based on the approaches used in this study.

  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a> shows that RMSE between the measured data and the test data gradually increased with the decrease in spatial resolution of the test data. Contrarily, R
  <span class="sup">2</span> between the two abovementioned data gradually decreased with the decrease in spatial resolution of the test data. Moreover, the least RMSE between the measured data and the test data was found when the spatial resolution of the test data was 14 arc-minute. The largest R
  <span class="sup">2</span> between the two data was found when the spatial resolution of the test data was 4 arc-minute. Overall, the biases between the measured data and the test data were relatively small and their correlations were relatively strong when the spatial resolution of the test data was in the ranges of 4~5 arc-minute and 8~11 arc-minute. These implies that the spatial resolutions of 4~5 arc-minute and 8~11 arc-minute may be more appropriate for the future time series of the PF-AHF dataset.
