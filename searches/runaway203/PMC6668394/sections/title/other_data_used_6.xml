The values of NSL data ranging from 0–63 indicate the night-time light intensities. In general, developed areas with a high gross domestic product (GDP) consume more energy than do developing areas with low GDP. It has been demonstrated that night-time light intensity is positively correlated with GDP, population size, and energy consumption

The values of pixels in the GMIS data ranging from 0 to 100% show the percentage of impervious surface. Examples of impervious surface include roads, parking lots, buildings, driveways, sidewalks, and other manmade surfaces
