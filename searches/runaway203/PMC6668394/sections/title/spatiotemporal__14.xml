  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). While Asia experienced the greatest increase of AHF in the period of 1970–2015, some regions of Europe and US showed a decrease in AHF (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>). In the future, grids with a substantial change in AHF are predicted to mostly be located in the developed and developing regions of the planet (Fig.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the AHFs induced by energy consumption were larger in the Northern Hemisphere (especially in 20–60°N) than the Southern Hemisphere in the past few decades. This could be one of the reasons for the warming occurring over mid- and high latitudes in Northern Hemisphere
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Additionally, the spatial distribution of AHF was consistent with the night-time light intensity at a global scale (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). At a provincial scale, the correlation between averaged AHF and night-time light intensity was significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), which is consistent with the report of Chen 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. All of these results imply that the annual mean AHF data are consistent with the distribution, intensity, and magnitude of human activities; that is, a large number of cities located in the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere consume a great deal of energy
