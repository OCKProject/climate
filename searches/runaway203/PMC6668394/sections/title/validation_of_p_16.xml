 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For comparison, we selected some cities where other researchers have analysed the anthropogenic heat release in recent years. Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> shows that AHFs have been estimated at 10–90 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> for most cities based on the PF-AHF data, findings that are comparable with previous findings. However, some differences in the estimates between the present and previous studies exist. With three specific cities located in Eastern China for example, the AHFs of the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Taiyuan were estimated to be 8.4, 15.5, and 13.5 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively, based on the PF-AHF database. The above three estimates differ from the corresponding previous results listed in Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> to some extent. Lu 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span> reported that the AHFs in Eastern China were mostly between 0.5 and 20 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, indicating that the estimates based on the PF-AHF database are in a reasonable range. The difference between the current estimates based on PF-AHF database and previous results may be related to the differences in the spatial ranges used to delineate the cities as well as differences in data sources and methodologies.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, we found that our estimates for the cities of Houston, TX, USA, Phoenix, AZ, USA, and Montreal, QC, Canada were smaller than corresponding results reported in previous studies. This occurred because the estimated AHFs of Houston, Phoenix, and Montreal in previous studies focused on summer and winter, which are generally larger than in spring and autumn
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Allen 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span> demonstrated that the AHF peaked from December to February in the Northern Hemisphere, while the AHFs in July and August were also high. Regional climates greatly affect the intensity of heat releases
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. During winter in the Northern Hemisphere, apart from the energy consumption for normal production, the cold climate causes a very large increase in energy consumed for residential heating
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. The relatively high AHF during summer in the Northern Hemisphere is mainly caused by the use of cooling systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. For this reason, most previous studies of anthropogenic heat release have focused on summer and winter. However, monthly energy consumption data are difficult to obtain covering large-scale regions. Flanner
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> adopted several latitudinally dependent equations to explore seasonal AHF cycles, and provided a selection for research results on projected future intra-annual variations of global AHF.
