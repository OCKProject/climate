 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the future energy demands reported by the GEP, the annual growth rates of the energy demand during 2015–2030 and 2030–2050 were estimated for different regions of the world (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). According to the level of energy consumption for 2015 reported by BP and the growth rates of energy demand mentioned above, we further estimated the energy consumption of 65 countries and five other regions in 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050. The GEP represents McKinsey’s latest consensus on how the energy transition will unfold, which takes into account both macro- and micro-economic developments (e.g., shifts in electricity demand curves, population, and GDP). It is based on a bottom-up energy demand model, showing energy demand projections for 145 countries, 28 sectors, and 55 fuel types. For each sector and country, a detailed methodology defines how fundamental drivers such as economic growth and population expansion, and key developments such as efficiency improvements and fuel shifts drive the evolution of energy demand. For example, McKinsey adopted a road transport model to calculate fuel demand for vehicles in each country, which covers five vehicle segments (cars, vans and pickups, trucks, buses, and 2- and 3-wheelers) and four distinct elements (vehicle sales, type of powertrain, fuel consumption, and expected annual distance travelled). More details about the GEP model can be accessible online (https://gep.mckinseyenergyinsights.com/the-model/).
