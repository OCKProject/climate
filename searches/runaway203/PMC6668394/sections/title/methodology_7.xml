  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. First, we aggregated the total population data of 195 countries from the Wittgenstein Centre to the 70 countries and regions listed in the BP Review. Next, the distribution of future population density (i.e., 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050) was estimated based on the 2015 population density data from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center and ratio of future population size to that in 2015. Second, we calculated the annual growth rates in future energy demand for the eight global sub-regions classified by McKinsey, and then disaggregated them to the above-mentioned 70 countries and regions to estimate future energy consumption for each country and region. Third, based on the global gridded population density data and the population sizes of the 70 countries and regions, the global AHF at 30 arc-seconds was estimated for each target year through redistributing the total energy consumption at the country level. Finally, spatial resolution of the calculated global gridded AHF data was decreased from 30 arc-second to 2.5 arc-minute by resampling in ArcGIS software (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).
