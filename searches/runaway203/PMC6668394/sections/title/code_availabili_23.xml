 <p>We did not use any custom coding in the process of producing the PF-AHF dataset. In this study, Microsoft Excel and ArcGIS software were employed to process all the data such as the future population density data and the gridded AHF intensity. ArcGIS software was also used to resample the PF-AHF data and draw the figures.</p>
