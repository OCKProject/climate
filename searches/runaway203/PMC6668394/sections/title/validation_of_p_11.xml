 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluating AHF data with real measurements spatially has proved difficult because of the difficulties involved in measuring this type of heat flux

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Therefore, the PF-AHF data were verified by correlation and comparison analyses with the help of other datasets. First, we analysed the spatial distribution of AHF based on the new gridded database, and compared it with the DMSP/OLS night-time light image data at a global scale. Correlation analysis between averaged AHFs and averaged night-time light intensities was conducted for the 32 administrative regions of China by SPSS 19.0 software (the Macao and Hong Kong Special Administrative Regions were excluded because of the small area they include). Night-time light intensity has been frequently used as a proxy for anthropogenic heat release

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>, indicating that the correlation between AHFs and night-time light intensities can be indirectly used to evaluate the accuracy of PF-AHF data. Second, using a same spatial resolution (2.5 × 2.5 arc-minute), we analysed the difference in annual mean AHF over the entire planet between the PF-AHF data and a previous AHF dataset produced by Flanner

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. The averaged AHFs of the 100 largest cities in the world ranked by population size in 2010 were estimated based on both the PF-AHF and Flanner’s
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> datasets, independently. Then, correlation analysis between the PF-AHF and Flanner’s dataset was conducted for these 100 largest cities. Third, we compared the averaged AHF of some cities of the world reported in previous studies with the AHF calculated using the PF-AHF data. Urban areas of a given city were determined based on the impervious surfaces extracted from GMIS data.

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, a cross-validation method was used to evaluate uncertainties of our approaches for calculating future AHF data. First, we assumed this year is year 2000. Next, based on the population density data in 2000 and the population size projections in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, we recalculated the distribution of ‘future’ population density (i.e., 2005, 2010, and 2015) using Eq. (

Second, based on the BP energy consumption data in 2000 and the GEP energy demands in 2030, we recalculated the annual growth rate of the energy demand during 2000–2030 and estimated the ‘future’ energy consumption data (i.e., 2005, 2010, and 2015). Third, based on these recalculated ‘future’ data and the Eqs (
  <a rid="Equ3" ref-type="" href="#Equ3">3</a>) and (
  <a rid="Equ4" ref-type="" href="#Equ4">4</a>), global gridded AHF data in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were projected for test (i.e., test data). Finally, based on the root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, the relationship between the measured data (i.e., PF-AHF data) and the test data was analysed for the selected 100 largest cities in the world. Additionally, we resampled the test data in 2010 to varied spatial resolutions (i.e., 30 arc-second, 1 arc-minute, 2 arc-minute, 3 arc-minute, …, 30 arc-minute). Then, the mean AHFs in 2010 for the selected 32 administrative regions of China were estimated based on both the measured data with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-second and the test data with different spatial resolutions, independently. Based on the RMSE and R
  <span class="sup">2</span> between the two kinds of estimations of the 32 administrative regions in 2010, we assessed the uncertainties caused by different spatial resolutions for our PF-AHF data in future years.
