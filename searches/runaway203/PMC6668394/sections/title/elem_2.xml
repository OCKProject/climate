    <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bp.com/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.bp.com/</span>). Primary energy sources comprise coal, hydroelectricity, nuclear energy, natural gas, oil, and modern renewables used to generate electricity. The BP Review classified the entire earth into six sub-regions, which include 65 countries and five other regions (Table 
    <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Based on the BP energy consumption data in 2015, the total energy consumption of the above-mentioned 65 countries counted about 95.8% of the global amount, indicating that these 65 countries are the most significant places for energy consumption and anthropogenic heat release. The energy statistics reported by BP with relatively high reliability have been used in many previous studies

The future population sizes during 2020–2050 used in this study were generated according to the medium level scenario of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios.

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. First, we aggregated the total population data of 195 countries from the Wittgenstein Centre to the 70 countries and regions listed in the BP Review. Next, the distribution of future population density (i.e., 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050) was estimated based on the 2015 population density data from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center and ratio of future population size to that in 2015. Second, we calculated the annual growth rates in future energy demand for the eight global sub-regions classified by McKinsey, and then disaggregated them to the above-mentioned 70 countries and regions to estimate future energy consumption for each country and region. Third, based on the global gridded population density data and the population sizes of the 70 countries and regions, the global AHF at 30 arc-seconds was estimated for each target year through redistributing the total energy consumption at the country level. Finally, spatial resolution of the calculated global gridded AHF data was decreased from 30 arc-second to 2.5 arc-minute by resampling in ArcGIS software (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the future energy demands reported by the GEP, the annual growth rates of the energy demand during 2015–2030 and 2030–2050 were estimated for different regions of the world (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). According to the level of energy consumption for 2015 reported by BP and the growth rates of energy demand mentioned above, we further estimated the energy consumption of 65 countries and five other regions in 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050. The GEP represents McKinsey’s latest consensus on how the energy transition will unfold, which takes into account both macro- and micro-economic developments (e.g., shifts in electricity demand curves, population, and GDP). It is based on a bottom-up energy demand model, showing energy demand projections for 145 countries, 28 sectors, and 55 fuel types. For each sector and country, a detailed methodology defines how fundamental drivers such as economic growth and population expansion, and key developments such as efficiency improvements and fuel shifts drive the evolution of energy demand. For example, McKinsey adopted a road transport model to calculate fuel demand for vehicles in each country, which covers five vehicle segments (cars, vans and pickups, trucks, buses, and 2- and 3-wheelers) and four distinct elements (vehicle sales, type of powertrain, fuel consumption, and expected annual distance travelled). More details about the GEP model can be accessible online (https://gep.mckinseyenergyinsights.com/the-model/).

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this process, we adopted population data to redistribute the total energy consumption into each grid in a country or region. Because of the lack of detailed information related to energy consumption (e.g., industrial distribution, energy-use type, and per-capita energy consumption in different areas and periods), we had to assume that each person consumes the same amount of energy in a given country. This assumption may lead to some uncertainties at a local scale because it fails to consider specific socio-economic factors. In this study, we analysed the relationship between energy consumption and population size based on the statistics from 30 provinces and autonomous regions/cities (hereinafter, administrative regions) of China (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stats.gov.cn" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.stats.gov.cn</span>). The Macao Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Tibet and Taiwan were not considered because of the limitation of statistical data. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows that a significantly positive correlation exists between energy consumption and population size (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.67, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). The result indicates that our method and the assumptions used for redistributing total energy consumption at the country level are somewhat reasonable, and can reflect the variations in energy consumption at least at the provincial scale.

First, we analysed the spatial distribution of AHF based on the new gridded database, and compared it with the DMSP/OLS night-time light image data at a global scale. Correlation analysis between averaged AHFs and averaged night-time light intensities was conducted for the 32 administrative regions of China by SPSS 19.0 software (the Macao and Hong Kong Special Administrative Regions were excluded because of the small area they include).

Third, we compared the averaged AHF of some cities of the world reported in previous studies with the AHF calculated using the PF-AHF data. Urban areas of a given city were determined based on the impervious surfaces extracted from GMIS data.

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, a cross-validation method was used to evaluate uncertainties of our approaches for calculating future AHF data. First, we assumed this year is year 2000. Next, based on the population density data in 2000 and the population size projections in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, we recalculated the distribution of ‘future’ population density (i.e., 2005, 2010, and 2015) using Eq. (

Second, based on the BP energy consumption data in 2000 and the GEP energy demands in 2030, we recalculated the annual growth rate of the energy demand during 2000–2030 and estimated the ‘future’ energy consumption data (i.e., 2005, 2010, and 2015). Third, based on these recalculated ‘future’ data and the Eqs (

   <a rid="Equ4" ref-type="" href="#Equ4">4</a>), global gridded AHF data in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were projected for test (i.e., test data). Finally, based on the root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R

   </span>, the relationship between the measured data (i.e., PF-AHF data) and the test data was analysed for the selected 100 largest cities in the world. Additionally, we resampled the test data in 2010 to varied spatial resolutions (i.e., 30 arc-second, 1 arc-minute, 2 arc-minute, 3 arc-minute, …, 30 arc-minute). Then, the mean AHFs in 2010 for the selected 32 administrative regions of China were estimated based on both the measured data with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-second and the test data with different spatial resolutions, independently. Based on the RMSE and R
   <span class="sup">2</span> between the two kinds of estimations of the 32 administrative regions in 2010, we assessed the uncertainties caused by different spatial resolutions for our PF-AHF data in future years.
