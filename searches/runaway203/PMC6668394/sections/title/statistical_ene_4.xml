 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Annual primary energy consumption data from 1965 to 2016 were obtained from the British Petroleum (BP) Statistical Review of World Energy (hereinafter, BP Review) (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bp.com/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.bp.com/</span>). Primary energy sources comprise coal, hydroelectricity, nuclear energy, natural gas, oil, and modern renewables used to generate electricity. The BP Review classified the entire earth into six sub-regions, which include 65 countries and five other regions (TableÂ 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Based on the BP energy consumption data in 2015, the total energy consumption of the above-mentioned 65 countries counted about 95.8% of the global amount, indicating that these 65 countries are the most significant places for energy consumption and anthropogenic heat release. The energy statistics reported by BP with relatively high reliability have been used in many previous studies
