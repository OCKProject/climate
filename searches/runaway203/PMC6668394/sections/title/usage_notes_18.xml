 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed that the radiative forcing of CO
  <sub>2</sub> has increased by 0.27 (0.24–0.30) W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> in the past decade
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. This implies that the average radiative forcing of annual released CO
  <sub>2</sub> was approximately 0.027 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> during this period, which is comparable to the current global annual mean AHF (i.e., 0.03 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Anthropogenic heat release has influenced changes in climates globally, especially for the Northern Hemisphere

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. In densely populated areas, AHFs have been much larger than the global average level, and this forcing is expected to continue to grow in developing regions

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PF-AHF data predict a weakening of AHF at some regions in the coming decades that is closely related to the projected consumption of energy reported by McKinsey in the present study. The changes in the quantity of energy consumed can be induced by economic development, shifting economic structure, changes in energy consumption type, and improved energy use efficiency
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>, which have been considered by McKinsey (https://gep.mckinseyenergyinsights.com/). However, the single existing global gridded dataset associated with future AHF, Flanner’s data, was built on an early energy-use projection of EIA during 2006–2040 (high economic growth case) and a simple assumption that the growth rate of energy consumption after 2040 will be 2% per year for all countries
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Evidently, Flanner’s data from 2006 to 2015 have been out of date, and his data after 2015 may contain large uncertainties
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Correlation analysis showed that the correlation between the two datasets in 2015 and 2030 was weaker than that in 2005, implying the necessity of updating global AHF data based on new statistics and predictions of energy consumption. When compared with Flanner’s data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>, our data are more objective in describing the global distribution of future AHFs. The accuracy of our PF-AHF data in future period was also confirmed by the cross-validation method. Additionally, the history time series of the PF-AHF database is longer than that of all previous datasets
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, providing an advantage in simulating long-term climatic effects using the dataset developed in this study.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the PF-AHF database may still include some uncertainties. For example, we assumed that all consumed energy was eventually converted into heat, and the delay between energy use and its conversion to heat was ignored. Since some energy that is consumed will be stored by buildings and converted to other forms of energy
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>, this assumption is somewhat unreasonable. As a result, the present study may overestimate the amount of anthropogenic heat produced. This uncertainty also existed in previous studies because of the difficulties in observing and estimating the conversion efficiency from fuel to heat
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Another uncertainty is induced by the assumption that each person consumes the same amount of energy in a given country when redistributing total energy consumption in each country. As we know, energy consumption rates may be different between different regions in a large country because of unbalanced regional economic development (e.g., China). However, specific information about energy consumption such as industrial distribution, energy-use type, and per-capita energy consumption in different areas and periods is difficult to obtain for each country of the world. In order to produce a global gridded AHF dataset with long-term time series, we have to use the country-level statistics to conduct this work. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> indicates that our method and assumption for redistributing the total energy consumption at a country level are somewhat reasonable. Validation results imply that the PF-AHF data can well reflect the spatiotemporal variation of AHF globally. However, it still should be noted that the above-mentioned uncertainties may be prominent in describing local distribution of AHF, which may lead to a certain biases in simulated results based on climate models, and need to be improved in the future. Thus, selecting appropriate spatial resolution of the AHF datasets for researches at different scales is necessary. This study found that the spatial resolution at the ranges of 4~5 arc-minute and 8~11 arc-minute may be better for the provincial-scale researches using the future time series of the PF-AHF dataset.
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, the use of different energy consumption datasets may lead to some divergence in the estimation of AHF. For instance, we noted that total energy consumption in Singapore was reported at about 81.0 million toe in 2015 in the BP Review (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bp.com/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.bp.com/</span>), while it was 17.1 million toe in the 2017 US Energy Information Administration Global Energy Dataset (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.eia.gov/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.eia.gov/</span>). Although these two datasets are frequently used in studies associated with energy consumption and show a high level of correlation, the differences in small areas may lead to strikingly different AHFs in the same grid. These differences in AHF may further lead to different results when simulating the climatic effects of those AHFs

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, multiple validations revealed that the PF-AHF data were consistent with the night-time light data and the levels of AHF reported in previous studies. The relatively long time series and fine spatial resolution of this new global gridded AHF dataset could provide needed support for the simulation of climate change induced by anthropogenic heat release.</p>
