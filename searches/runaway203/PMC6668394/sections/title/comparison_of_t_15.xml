 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, the global AHF dataset calculated by Flanner
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> with a resolution of 2.5 × 2.5 arc-minutes that was based on population density data was compared with our PF-AHF data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Flanner’s data had been developed based on historical energy consumption records for 2005, the EIA energy-use projections during 2006–2040 (high economic growth case), and the assumed growth rate of energy-use during 2040–2100 (i.e., 2%). First, we analysed the difference in annual mean AHF between the PF-AHF data and Flanner’s data in 2005 to validate the accuracy of the PF-AHF data. Second, we compared the PF-AHF data with Flanner’s data in 2015 and 2030 to evaluate the uncertainties resulted from the use of different projections of energy consumption.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of mean annual AHF from the PF-AHF data for 2005 agreed well with Flanner’s data (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a,b</a>). Differences in measured AHF between the two datasets were mostly between −0.1 and 0.1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, which is very small at a global scale (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c</a>). Pixels with an extremely slight difference between the two datasets (−0.01 to 0.01 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) were mainly distributed in regions known to consume little energy. In contrast, pixels with relatively large differences (&gt;2 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> or &lt; −2 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) were mainly distributed in urban areas known to consume a great deal of energy. The spatial patterns of the differences in AHF between the PF-AHF data and Flanner’s data in 2015 and 2030 were consistent with that in 2005 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c–e</a>). However, the regional differences in AHF between the two datasets in 2015 and 2030 were larger than those in 2005. For example, in India, more pixels with a difference ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> were observed in 2015 than those observed in 2005; in China, more pixels with a difference ranging from −1.0 to −0.1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> were observed in 2030 than those observed in 2005. Descriptive statistic shows that means of the difference in pixel value between the two datasets were 0.013, 0.011, and −0.014 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> in 2005, 2015, and 2030, respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). This indicates that the historic AHF data may have been underestimated by Flanner
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> relative to this study, while he may have overestimated the AHF data for future period. Moreover, standard deviations of the differences in pixel values between the two datasets indicate that the difference between the two datasets in 2030 has larger spatial variability than that in 2005 and 2015.

  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows that a significantly positive correlation exists between the PF-AHF and Flanner’s datasets based on the annual mean AHF of the 100 largest cities in the world (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, based on the annual mean AHF of the 100 cities, correlation coefficients between the PF-AHF data and Flanner’s data were 0.96, 0.89, and 0.87 in 2005, 2015, and 2030, respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). This indicates that the agreement between the PF-AHF and Flanner’s datasets in 2005 was closer than that in 2015 and 2030. The correlation between the PF-AHF and Flanner’s datasets in 2030 was the lowest, which is consistent with the result based on Fig.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences between the two datasets were largely attributed to differences in energy consumption data and variations in the population density data used in this study and in Flanner
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. For example, energy data used in Flanner’s study did not include renewable energy, which features an increasing percentage over time in recent years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. This may be one reason why the mean of the PF-AHF data was larger than the mean of Flanner’s data in 2005 and 2015. Moreover, the energy-use projections of EIA used in Flanner’s study were based on a high economic growth case
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>, which differs from the energy demands of GEP used in the present study. This may be the main reason why the mean of the PF-AHF data was smaller than the mean of Flanner’s data in 2030. Decreasing the pixel resolution of our data for comparison may also lead to a certain amount of bias in those areas that lie close to large water bodies
