  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the AHFs induced by energy consumption were larger in the Northern Hemisphere (especially in 20–60°N) than the Southern Hemisphere in the past few decades. This could be one of the reasons for the warming occurring over mid- and high latitudes in Northern Hemisphere
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>

   <span class="sup">2</span> AHF data

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, the global AHF dataset calculated by Flanner
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span> with a resolution of 2.5 × 2.5 arc-minutes that was based on population density data was compared with our PF-AHF data
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span>. Flanner’s data had been developed based on historical energy consumption records for 2005, the EIA energy-use projections during 2006–2040 (high economic growth case), and the assumed growth rate of energy-use during 2040–2100 (i.e., 2%). First, we analysed the difference in annual mean AHF between the PF-AHF data and Flanner’s data in 2005 to validate the accuracy of the PF-AHF data. Second, we compared the PF-AHF data with Flanner’s data in 2015 and 2030 to evaluate the uncertainties resulted from the use of different projections of energy consumption.
  </p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of mean annual AHF from the PF-AHF data for 2005 agreed well with Flanner’s data (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a,b</a>). Differences in measured AHF between the two datasets were mostly between −0.1 and 0.1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>, which is very small at a global scale (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c</a>). Pixels with an extremely slight difference between the two datasets (−0.01 to 0.01 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) were mainly distributed in regions known to consume little energy. In contrast, pixels with relatively large differences (&gt;2 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> or &lt; −2 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) were mainly distributed in urban areas known to consume a great deal of energy. The spatial patterns of the differences in AHF between the PF-AHF data and Flanner’s data in 2015 and 2030 were consistent with that in 2005 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c–e</a>). However, the regional differences in AHF between the two datasets in 2015 and 2030 were larger than those in 2005. For example, in India, more pixels with a difference ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> were observed in 2015 than those observed in 2005; in China, more pixels with a difference ranging from −1.0 to −0.1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> were observed in 2030 than those observed in 2005. Descriptive statistic shows that means of the difference in pixel value between the two datasets were 0.013, 0.011, and −0.014 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> in 2005, 2015, and 2030, respectively (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). This indicates that the historic AHF data may have been underestimated by Flanner
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span> relative to this study, while he may have overestimated the AHF data for future period. Moreover, standard deviations of the differences in pixel values between the two datasets indicate that the difference between the two datasets in 2030 has larger spatial variability than that in 2005 and 2015.

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences between the two datasets were largely attributed to differences in energy consumption data and variations in the population density data used in this study and in Flanner
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span>. For example, energy data used in Flanner’s study did not include renewable energy, which features an increasing percentage over time in recent years
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span>. This may be one reason why the mean of the PF-AHF data was larger than the mean of Flanner’s data in 2005 and 2015. Moreover, the energy-use projections of EIA used in Flanner’s study were based on a high economic growth case
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span>, which differs from the energy demands of GEP used in the present study. This may be the main reason why the mean of the PF-AHF data was smaller than the mean of Flanner’s data in 2030.

This occurred because the estimated AHFs of Houston, Phoenix, and Montreal in previous studies focused on summer and winter, which are generally larger than in spring and autumn

   </span>. For this reason, most previous studies of anthropogenic heat release have focused on summer and winter. However, monthly energy consumption data are difficult to obtain covering large-scale regions. Flanner

  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the data before 2000 and the approaches for calculating future AHF data in this study, we projected the AHF data in 2005, 2010, and 2015 for test. Based on these test data, the average AHF of the 100 largest cities in the world in 2005 was calculated to be about 11.44 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>, which is slightly larger than the corresponding measurement based on the PF-AHF data (Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). However, the test data in 2010 and 2015 were smaller than the corresponding measurements overall. These differences between the two abovementioned data were mainly caused by the use of the different energy consumption data. While the measured data were calculated using the energy consumption records, the test data were calculated using the energy consumption projections based on the average annual growth rate of the energy demand during 2000–2030. This growth rate was higher than the reality in the early period but lower than the reality in the late period. Moreover, while RMSE between the test data and the measured data increased from 2.80 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> in 2005 to 5.12 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> in 2015, their R
   <span class="sup">2</span> decreased from 0.97 in 2005 to 0.88 in 2015. These imply that the differences of AHF between the projections and the actual situation would increase with time. However, there were significant correlations between the test data and the measured data in 2005, 2010, and 2015, implying certain reliability of the projected AHF data based on the approaches used in this study.

Moreover, the least RMSE between the measured data and the test data was found when the spatial resolution of the test data was 14 arc-minute. The largest R
   <span class="sup">2</span> between the two data was found when the spatial resolution of the test data was 4 arc-minute. Overall, the biases between the measured data and the test data were relatively small and their correlations were relatively strong when the spatial resolution of the test data was in the ranges of 4~5 arc-minute and 8~11 arc-minute. These implies that the spatial resolutions of 4~5 arc-minute and 8~11 arc-minute may be more appropriate for the future time series of the PF-AHF dataset.
