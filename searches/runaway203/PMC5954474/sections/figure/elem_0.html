         <p>Monitoring sea ice and iceberg activity in West Antarctica. (
            <span>a</span>) Monitoring sites, using automated cameras (black circles) and manual observations
            (white circle), of sea-ice extent in time and space. Monitoring sites of both sea-ice
            extent and annual iceberg scouring (red circles) at Rothera (bottom red circle) and
            Carlini (top red circle) [

            <span>b</span>) Relationship between duration of fast-ice cover each year and ice scouring on the
            seabed at Rothera and Carlini (inner bay in orange, outer bay in red) stations. The
            
            <span>y</span>-axis shows the proportion of the monitored seabed from a 5–25 m depth hit by icebergs.
