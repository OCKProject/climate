            Sites 11, 12 and 13 are benthic image and trawl samples. The island in the image (left)
            is South Georgia and iceberg size is 75 × 41 km. (

            southern Adelaide Island, West Antarctic Peninsula (from data in Barnes [
            <a>6</a>,
            <a>9</a>] ). Zones are zoobenthic carbon; significant increase with increased fast-ice duration
            (A), no significant change (B,D), significant decrease with increased fast-ice duration
            (C) and depth zone where there is too little known for meaningful analysis (zone of
            ignorance).
