         <p>Giant icebergs in the Southern Ocean. (
            <span>a</span>) Distribution of calved (circles) and calving (squares) giant icebergs (greater than
            30â€‰km
            <span>2</span>) around Antarctica, in which the symbols are giant icebergs. The calved icebergs
            are further categorized as grounded (red), roaming free on the continental shelf (black)
            or in deep water (blue), or stuck in fast ice (dark purple). (
            <span>b</span>) Is the UK's Halley VI research station set to become the first giant-iceberg-based
            research station?
