      <p>We thank Laura Gerrish for construction of 
         <a>figure 1</a>. We are also grateful for the support of Chris Readinger at the US National Ice Center,
         who provided access to historical iceberg tracking data. Finally, we are especially
         grateful for the detailed and constructive comments of two anonymous referees, which
         helped us improve our manuscript. This work was carried out as part of the Antarctic
         Seabed Carbon Capture Change project (
         <span>www.asccc.co.uk</span>). All data underpinning figures are available on request to the Polar Data Centre,
         NERC.
