      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Southern Ocean sea surface features striking contrasts in albedo between open
         water and sea ice, and as such remote sensing is an ideal tool to detect trends in
         sea-ice spatial and temporal extent [
         <a>2</a>]. Satellite data can be enhanced (when cloud obscures satellite image capture) and
         ground-truthed by 
         <span>in situ</span> manually operated or remote image capture. Around Antarctica these have proved to
         be complex, in terms of extent, geography and drivers of change. Overall, there have
         been marginal increases in Southern Ocean sea ice to date, but there have also been
         considerable losses around West Antarctic continental shelves and even larger gains,
         mainly over deeper water, in the Weddell and Ross Seas [
         <a>1</a>]. The consequences of sea-ice losses and gains remain poorly understood but strongly
         influence local physical characteristics such as heat and gas exchange, biological
         activity such as phytoplankton bloom timing, duration and composition [
         <a>20</a>,
         <a>21</a>], and iceberg scouring rates [
         <a>9</a>,
         <a>22</a>]. Research has identified diverse and far-reaching secondary consequences to fauna
         such as habitat and food provision, impacting breeding of higher predators to feeding
         and composition of zooplankton [
         <a>23</a>,
         <a>24</a>]. Near-coast sea-ice losses and responses of benthic organisms to such sea-ice losses
         are hard to monitor as station-based direct observation is crucial [
         <a>6</a>,
         <a>9</a>,
         <a>25</a>]. Such work is both time- and labour-intensive and only yields small spatial coverage
         (rarely more than square kilometres), so collaborative efforts are needed to increase
         coverage and analyse resulting data [
         <a>26</a>]. To date few locations maintain ‘long-term’ observations of sea-ice status (
         <a>figure 1</a><span>a</span>) to ground-truth coastal remote-sensed data, and even fewer are monitoring benthos
         responses (red circles, 
         <a>figure 1</a><span>a</span>). Circumpolar satellite-derived data have revealed that the WAP particularly is a
         hotspot for sea-ice losses. Iceberg scour can be very frequent in the shallows if
         the area above it is free of fast ice (because there is less obstruction to wind-driven
         travel) [
         <a>9</a>,
         <a>22</a>]. New data from seabed-ice scour monitoring adjacent to Carlini station [
         <a>25</a>] (
         <a>figure 1</a><span>b</span>) shows even higher rates than at Rothera. As at Rothera, the site (at Carlini) closest
         to a glacier terminus showed some very high scouring rates, suggesting that local
         iceberg production as well as fast ice are important factors for seabed disturbance.
         We suggest that climate forcing has made the WAP a hotspot for coastal iceberg scouring.
         Results from the longest running (2003 onwards) iceberg scour-monitoring experiment
         near Rothera research station [
         <a>9</a>] showed that ice scouring can reduce by half the carbon held by shallow benthos in
         a single year. Scaled up to the area of the WAP shallows, this may annually recycle
         an estimated 8 × 10
         <span>4</span> tonnes of carbon per year [
         <a>9</a>] that otherwise could have been buried—and represents a major source of previously
         unaccounted variability in carbon capture and storage. That study showed that blue
         carbon standing stock recovery took 4–6 years in the shallows. This is hard to test
         at typical shelf depths but we reanalysed 36 samples of benthic images with matched
         trawl specimens from Barnes &amp; Sands [
         <a>26</a>] collected in 2011 from site 12 (at which Polarview showed an iceberg was grounded
         in 2004, 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>a</span>), and sites 11 and 13 (which showed no evidence of having been scoured in the remote-sensing
         era). We found no significant difference between scoured and unscoured samples with
         respect to blue carbon stock mass (ANOVA, df1, 
         <span>F</span> = 1.69, 
         <span>p</span> = 0.2), suggesting recovery is at least possible within approximately 7 years even
         at a 200 m depth on the South Georgia shelf. Part of the problem and complexity of
         analyses of iceberg blue carbon impact, at least coastally, is the confounding effects
         of sea ice and phytoplankton blooms. In shallow coastal waters, sea-ice losses drive
         both blue carbon decreases by increased scour probability, and increases through longer
         phytoplankton blooms sustaining benthic growth. To examine the relationship between
         sea ice and benthic biomass, we reanalysed data presented in Barnes [
         <a>6</a>,
         <a>9</a>] from Marguerite Bay (1997–2016) and examined the relationship between benthic biomass
         (blue carbon storage) and fast-ice duration, and how this changes with depth from
         the shallows down to 1000 m (data from 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>b</span>). We found that, in the top approximately 10 m, there was a positive correlation
         between blue carbon and sea-ice duration (zone A, 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>b</span>). We interpret this as longer sea-ice durations reduce ice scour chances, which outweighs
         slower growth from the shorter phytoplankton blooms. There was no relationship between
         benthic blue carbon and sea-ice duration from 10–40 m depth (zone B, 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>b</span>), which is probably explained by the reduction in ice scour chances due to longer
         sea-ice durations approximately balancing slower growth from the shorter phytoplankton
         blooms. At typical continental shelf depths (200–500 m), there were negative correlations
         between blue carbon and sea-ice duration (zone C, 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>b</span>). Ice scour chances are so rare in deep water (because few icebergs are big enough
         to have keels hundreds of metres deep) that longer sea-ice durations have little impact
         on this, so the main effect is slower growth from shorter phytoplankton blooms. Between
         40 and 200 m is a zone of very little benthic sampling, perhaps often too shallow
         or geographically close to shallows for safe ship operation but too deep for self-contained
         underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA)—a data-poor zone that we need to address (
         <a>figure 2</a><span>b</span>).
