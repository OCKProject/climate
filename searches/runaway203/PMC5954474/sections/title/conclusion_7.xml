 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is clear that sea ice and icebergs have complex influences on benthos and their blue carbon ecosystem services—and thus on the power of feedbacks on climate change. Pooling literature data sources [

Unsurprisingly, we found no data for even the majority of continental shelves around Antarctica, but we highlight likely blue carbon losses (blue cells,

  <a rid="RSTA20170176C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C19">19</a>] have shown large blue carbon gains (albeit reported as colonization and growth of sponge increases) around collapsing ice shelves (dark red, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170176F5" href="#RSTA20170176F5">figure 5</a>). Thus, the recent declaration that such areas attain Marine Protected Area status is good news for conservation of strong blue carbon ecosystem services, especially as evidence suggests these will strengthen if climate forces sea-ice losses [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C6">6</a>]. Benthic blue carbon storage has increased at varying levels (yellow–red, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170176F5" href="#RSTA20170176F5">figure 5</a>) around West Antarctic shelves, including parts of the Weddell and Ross Seas [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C5">5</a>]. The recent international Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) enabled various samples to be taken at key locations (white cells with ‘?’, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170176F5" href="#RSTA20170176F5">figure 5</a>), which should reveal blue carbon trends following analysis. Finally, there are areas for which there are some samples but for which no trend is apparent (green, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170176F5" href="#RSTA20170176F5">figure 5</a>), though this may be from paucity of samples, analyses or unclear identification.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our calculations suggest that giant icebergs alone contribute a net gain of 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> tonnes of C
  <span class="sup">immobilized</span> per year (around the Antarctic Peninsula), which matches similarly sized gains in the same region driven by sea-ice losses [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C9">9</a>]. The considerable interest and concern about icebergs, particularly giants, focuses on potential natural environment ‘damage’. However, our work supports recent studies (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C19">19</a>]), which show that iceberg effects are more complex and can aid ecosystem development and identification of negative feedbacks on climate change.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the scale of terrestrial forests and oceanic water absorption, Antarctic benthos carbon cycling is small, at just 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> tonnes for increases from ice shelf losses (by our calculations) in addition to 10
  <span class="sup">7</span> tonnes for increases driven by sea-ice losses [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C7">7</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C9">9</a>]. Recently, Ashton 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C37">37</a>] demonstrated that in Antarctic coastal waters warming of just one degree increases growth by more than expected amounts. This gives reason to hypothesize that benthos on the warmer and vast Arctic and sub-Antarctic shelves (e.g. 2.2 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of Kerguelen Plateau) may also be increasing blue carbon storage—and when quantified could prove the single largest negative feedback (on climate change). All three (Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and Arctic) of these sinks are expected to increase in response to climate change, in contrast to shrinking forests (and in the sea mangroves, seagrass beds and saltmarsh areas) and become progressively less efficient at ocean sponging [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C38">38</a>]. Sub-Arctic forests do represent a negative feedback [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C39">39</a>] but of smaller magnitude than polar and subpolar continental shelves. Cold water benthic blue carbon responses to (Arctic and West Antarctic) losses of sea ice, ice shelves and warming probably represent the three largest negative feedbacks yet among those which are most poorly characterized and understood. The current work at least attempts to evaluate the iceberg component of these.
