 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How important are the positive blue carbon effects of giant iceberg formation?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Away from the shallows, much larger icebergs (by area) are easier to track from genesis to eventual exit from the Southern Ocean, yet much less is known of the subsurface impacts of these giants on blue carbon, although recent studies have highlighted their importance in their pelagic fertilization roles. Here, we discuss and quantitatively estimate the importance of blue carbon impacts of Southern Ocean icebergs.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Giant icebergs mainly originate from ice shelf disintegration and can remain fasted in sea ice for years in deep coastal water, roam on or off the continental shelf or run aground (

  <span class="italic">a</span>). Giant icebergs leave a trail of trace nutrient enrichment, enhancing phytoplankton blooms in their path [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C14">14</a>]. This phytoplankton bloom fertilization was found to increase bloom intensity by an order of magnitude [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C14">14</a>], and increase the potential blue carbon capture, but whether this increases any storage or sequestration by benthic organisms depends on where and when this occurs. Giant icebergs could travel over hundreds of kilometres of productive continental shelf seabed. For example, Brunt ice shelf-originating giant icebergs could drift southwest and then north with prevailing winds and currents across the huge shelf area of the Southern Weddell Sea [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C27">27</a>]. Beyond the continental shelf, icebergs travel over much more sparsely populated abyssal fauna, where bloom fertilization is less likely to have significant impact on (benthic) storage or sequestration. However, if giant icebergs are calved during the summer and intercept phytoplankton blooms, increased intensity of those blooms is unlikely to greatly increase blue carbon capture or storage, as there is no evidence that planktotrophic shelf benthos are food-limited during summer bloom periods [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C6">6</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C9">9</a>]. Significant lasting impact of giant iceberg bloom fertilization (in terms of enhanced blue carbon storage—as opposed to carbon cycling) is likely to be most associated with icebergs calved in spring or autumn (because phytoplankton abundance in summer exceeds animal capacity to eat) and those with some distance to travel before reaching the continental shelf break. Although carbon cycling increases driven by giant iceberg formation have been estimated [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C14">14</a>], contributions to benthic blue carbon storage are not straightforward, despite probable importance—and would need to be calculated on an ‘iceberg by iceberg’ basis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Giant icebergs have another very important and different impact on enhancing blue carbon storage—their calving involves break-off from an ice shelf. As in current time all ice shelves occur over continental shelf, their break-up to form giant icebergs creates new areas of open water above potentially highly productive seabed. In the last few decades more than 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of ice shelf have collapsed, to open up continental shelf waters to primary production and secondary benthic carbon capture and storage [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C18">18</a>]. New benthic production in such an area was estimated to be nearly 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> tonnes of carbon per year (of which nearly half could be stored (immobilized) within the skeletal matrix of the benthos) [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C6">6</a>]. If the Peck 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C18">18</a>] estimates are approximately correct, the new open water left by calving the new 5000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> iceberg from Larsen C could generate 7 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> tonnes of C
  <span class="sup">immobilized</span> per year (even without consideration of additional fertilization effects). However, four years after the Larsen A and B ice shelf collapses, Fillinger 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C19">19</a>] reported ‘two- to threefold increases' in benthic sponge density and biomass (and that sponges were the dominant component of the fauna). This suggests that the Peck 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C18">18</a>] estimates based on steady-state increases may be conservative. Even if only for the first few years of new colonization and productivity, newly exposed shelf areas clearly capture and store carbon more rapidly than ‘normal’ annual incremental growth. Thus, a new 5000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> iceberg creation may actually generate more than 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> tonnes of C
  <span class="sup">immobilized</span> per year (calculation is Peck 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C18">18</a>] estimate × Fillinger 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C19">19</a>] growth rate = 7 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> × 2.5 = 2 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span>). Such productivity could be increased because of (a) additional climate-forced sea-ice losses in some regions (e.g. Antarctic Peninsula) [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C5">5</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C6">6</a>], and (b) giant iceberg phytoplankton bloom fertilization along its track over continental shelf [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C14">14</a>]. The magnitude of such (a,b) increases could be ×2 for sea-ice losses [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C5">5</a>] and ×5–10 for giant iceberg fertilization [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C14">14</a>]. Thus we estimate that the 2 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> tonnes of C
  <span class="sup">immobilized</span> per year estimate is more likely to be approximately 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> tonnes of C
  <span class="sup">immobilized</span> per year (calculation is Peck 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
