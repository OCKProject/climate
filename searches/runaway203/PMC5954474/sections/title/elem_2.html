         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Away from the shallows, much larger icebergs (by area) are easier to track from genesis
            to eventual exit from the Southern Ocean, yet much less is known of the subsurface
            impacts of these giants on blue carbon, although recent studies have highlighted their
            importance in their pelagic fertilization roles. Here, we discuss and quantitatively
            estimate the importance of blue carbon impacts of Southern Ocean icebergs.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Giant icebergs mainly originate from ice shelf disintegration and can remain fasted
            in sea ice for years in deep coastal water, roam on or off the continental shelf or
            run aground (
            <a>figure 3</a><span>a</span>). Giant icebergs leave a trail of trace nutrient enrichment, enhancing phytoplankton
            blooms in their path [
            <a>14</a>]. This phytoplankton bloom fertilization was found to increase bloom intensity by
            an order of magnitude [
            <a>14</a>], and increase the potential blue carbon capture, but whether this increases any
            storage or sequestration by benthic organisms depends on where and when this occurs.
            Giant icebergs could travel over hundreds of kilometres of productive continental
            shelf seabed. For example, Brunt ice shelf-originating giant icebergs could drift
            southwest and then north with prevailing winds and currents across the huge shelf
            area of the Southern Weddell Sea [
            <a>27</a>]. Beyond the continental shelf, icebergs travel over much more sparsely populated
            abyssal fauna, where bloom fertilization is less likely to have significant impact
            on (benthic) storage or sequestration. However, if giant icebergs are calved during
            the summer and intercept phytoplankton blooms, increased intensity of those blooms
            is unlikely to greatly increase blue carbon capture or storage, as there is no evidence
            that planktotrophic shelf benthos are food-limited during summer bloom periods [
            <a>6</a>,
            <a>9</a>]. Significant lasting impact of giant iceberg bloom fertilization (in terms of enhanced
            blue carbon storage—as opposed to carbon cycling) is likely to be most associated
            with icebergs calved in spring or autumn (because phytoplankton abundance in summer
            exceeds animal capacity to eat) and those with some distance to travel before reaching
            the continental shelf break. Although carbon cycling increases driven by giant iceberg
            formation have been estimated [
            <a>14</a>], contributions to benthic blue carbon storage are not straightforward, despite probable
            importance—and would need to be calculated on an ‘iceberg by iceberg’ basis.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Giant icebergs have another very important and different impact on enhancing blue
            carbon storage—their calving involves break-off from an ice shelf. As in current time
            all ice shelves occur over continental shelf, their break-up to form giant icebergs
            creates new areas of open water above potentially highly productive seabed. In the
            last few decades more than 10
            <span>4</span> km
            <span>2</span> of ice shelf have collapsed, to open up continental shelf waters to primary production
            and secondary benthic carbon capture and storage [
            <a>18</a>]. New benthic production in such an area was estimated to be nearly 10
            <span>6</span> tonnes of carbon per year (of which nearly half could be stored (immobilized) within
            the skeletal matrix of the benthos) [
            <a>6</a>]. If the Peck 
            <span>et al</span>. [
            <a>18</a>] estimates are approximately correct, the new open water left by calving the new
            5000 km
            <span>2</span> iceberg from Larsen C could generate 7 × 10
            <span>4</span> tonnes of C
            <span>immobilized</span> per year (even without consideration of additional fertilization effects). However,
            four years after the Larsen A and B ice shelf collapses, Fillinger 
            <span>et al</span>. [
            <a>19</a>] reported ‘two- to threefold increases' in benthic sponge density and biomass (and
            that sponges were the dominant component of the fauna). This suggests that the Peck
            
            <span>et al</span>. [
            <a>18</a>] estimates based on steady-state increases may be conservative. Even if only for
            the first few years of new colonization and productivity, newly exposed shelf areas
            clearly capture and store carbon more rapidly than ‘normal’ annual incremental growth.
            Thus, a new 5000 km
            <span>2</span> iceberg creation may actually generate more than 10
            <span>5</span> tonnes of C
            <span>immobilized</span> per year (calculation is Peck 
            <span>et al</span>. [

            <span>4</span> × 2.5 = 2 × 10
            <span>5</span>). Such productivity could be increased because of (a) additional climate-forced sea-ice
            losses in some regions (e.g. Antarctic Peninsula) [
            <a>5</a>,
            <a>6</a>], and (b) giant iceberg phytoplankton bloom fertilization along its track over continental
            shelf [
            <a>14</a>]. The magnitude of such (a,b) increases could be ×2 for sea-ice losses [
            <a>5</a>] and ×5–10 for giant iceberg fertilization [
            <a>14</a>]. Thus we estimate that the 2 × 10
            <span>5</span> tonnes of C

      <div class="sec" title="sec"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(b)</span><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What are the offset negative blue carbon effects of giant iceberg formation?</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small icebergs can halve incremental growth of benthic communities and thus the potential
            for carbon storage, as happened between 2007 and 2009 in Ryder Bay near Rothera research
            station (WAP) due to ice scour [
            <a>9</a>]. The creation of giant icebergs has many other effects besides those which can be
            considered negative feedbacks on climate change, not least including threats to installations
            (
            <a>figure 3</a><span>b</span>). When ice shelves collapse to form giant icebergs, the buttressing of land-based
            ice sheets is reduced [
            <a>28</a>,
            <a>29</a>]. Thus calving typically results in acceleration of land-based ice towards the sea,
            driving sea-level increases from any newly marine-based ice. This does not have an
            obvious direct positive or negative consequence on blue carbon storage but can accelerate
            deglaciation. New open water areas result in a strong albedo (reflectivity) change—from
            white to blue. This is a positive feedback on climate change because of the resulting
            extra heat absorbed. Depending on the extent of warming, this could have minor effects
            on benthos blue carbon capture: an increase in growth due to increasing meal processing
            rate [
            <a>6</a>,
            <a>9</a>] or a reduction of growth when temperatures proceed beyond organisms’ thermal tolerance
            envelopes [
            <a>30</a>]. More open water also has increased potential for gas exchange and thus CO
            <sub>2</sub> absorption, which could reduce benthic carbon immobilization and sequestration through
            ocean acidification [
            <a>31</a>]. This occurs not only because of increases in the physiological ‘cost’ of synthesizing
            and maintaining carbonate skeletal material but also because of the greater chance
            of it dissolving (after death) before burial.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major negative impact of giant icebergs on benthic blue carbon is if they collide
            with the seabed and scour. Giant icebergs would only ground and scour in deeper water,
            which may on average only occur once every few hundred years at any one location [
            <a>7</a>]. However, the residence time of some, e.g. A23 and B12, can be years to decades,
            which makes scour highly probable for the largest icebergs. For example, two of the
            largest three icebergs currently around Antarctica (A23A (1760 km
            <span>2</span>) and B22A (1056 km
            <span>2</span>)) were grounded in 2016/2017 in the shelf seabed. Such grounding can be a prolonged
            occurrence; for example, A23A has been grounded for more than three decades, since
            1986. The chances and location of any particular iceberg scouring depend not only
            on size (most 2016/2017 giants were 100–500 km
            <span>2</span> in area) but also on shape, calving location and current and wind direction and strength,
            as well as stochastic factors such as which eddies entrain it. Larger icebergs can
            be tracked such that their motion and fate can be followed; for example, in early
            2017 there were four icebergs (8.5%) larger than 30 km
            <span>2</span> in area grounded, and thus scouring blue carbon. The extent of this could be ground-truthed
            using ship-based multibeam, swath bathymetry data collection. Benthic imaging and
            sampling could then quantify blue carbon losses and, as such scours can be many kilometres
            long, they are likely to crush and recycle hundreds–thousands of tonnes of blue carbon
            standing stock. For example, benthos in the vicinity of the grounded scouring giant
            icebergs A23A and B22A hold 8–16 tonnes of standing stock of carbon per square kilometre
            [
            <a>5</a>,
            <a>32</a>]. Imagery and sampling in new deep water scours show near-complete destruction of
            fauna [
            <a>7</a>,
            <a>10</a>]. Many such scours occur in iceberg hotspots, which reduces blue carbon losses (repeat
            scouring by an iceberg of a site in an early recovery stage recycles less carbon than
            scouring of a rarely hit area of climax benthic fauna). Scouring climax benthic communities
            might recycle 16 tonnes of carbon per square kilometre (the maximum standing stocks
            of benthos from [
            <a>5</a>,
            <a>32</a>]). We found that there were clear hot- and coldspots of iceberg scouring in deep
            waters around Antarctica (
            <a>figure 4</a><span>a</span>). The Lazarev, Cosmonauts, Davis and East Amundsen Seas were hotspots of deep shelf
            grounding, whereas there was little deep-water scouring in the Bellingshausen and
            Ross Seas. The paths of giant icebergs (from US National Ice Center satellite data)
            also showed distinct patterns, firstly following the anticlockwise coastal current,
            then leaving the shelf from the Eastern Weddell and Ross Seas and being dispersed
            by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (
            <a>figure 4</a><span>b</span>).

            To date, such losses have not been quantified in absolute frequencies at depths relevant

            potential to bury benthos in sediment berms, resuspend food material (enhancing growth

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interglacial phases have probably seen major fluctuations in continental shelf capture
            and stores of blue carbon by zoobenthos in the polar regions with ice shelf collapses
            and the impact of the resulting giant icebergs [
            <a>34</a>]. Overall, this drives a net gain of blue carbon, and importantly this extends to
            a net gain on the seabed where long-term storage chances and sequestration are maximal.
            However, for any one particular iceberg, the blue carbon gain may be small or even
            a net loss if it scours shelf benthos, depending on the size of the scoured area.
            Even then, the net gain should be positive over decades, unless the scoured area is
            bigger than the area of the iceberg. Scour size and scouring probability by giant
            icebergs, both of which are unknown, are important values. Two new giant icebergs
            of 5000 km
            <span>2</span> would typically be expected to generate 2 × 10
            <span>6</span> tonnes of C
            <span>immobilized</span> per year in total (estimate from §3a (×2 for two icebergs)) and ‘cost’ up to 16 tonnes
            for each km
            <span>2</span> scoured (estimate from §3b) [
            <a>5</a>,
            <a>32</a>] at a Weddell Sea locality (where 33% of giant icebergs were in 2016/2017). In the
            Amundsen Sea generation of such icebergs would be expected to generate less than half
            this blue carbon but similarly ‘cost’ half as much through scouring. The part of the
            equation missing from estimating a net carbon effect of giant icebergs is how much
            area they scour. This is unknown, but based on US National Ice Center tracking, the
            estimate used here is that eight giant icebergs ground per year. Observations in Ryder
            Bay (WAP) of grounded icebergs suggest that up to a quarter of the area of each grounded
            iceberg scours. So ‘costs’ are 0.25 (maximum proportion of iceberg grounded)×total
            estimated area of grounded giant icebergs (10 000) × 16 tonnes (stored carbon in benthos
            covering each km
            <span>2</span> which becomes recycled) = up to 4 × 10
            <span>4</span> tonnes of C
            <span>immobilized</span>. This cost is likely to be highly overstated because (a) the largest giants can be
            grounded in the same location for many years (but only recycle benthic carbon initially)
            and (b) it assumes icebergs become grounded at random locations on the continental
            shelf. It is more likely that there will be hotspots of scour on rises or sills, such
            as the continental shelf break, which will be hit more often and have less time to
            recover (and thus less stored carbon is recycled). We calculate that the net carbon
            gain of giant icebergs is at least 2 × 10
            <span>6</span> − 4 × 10
            <span>4</span> = 1.9 × 10
            <span>6</span> tonnes of C
            <span>immobilized</span> per year. This is equivalent of the carbon exhaust output of 400 000 cars per year,
            or nearly four million cars in terms of total zoobenthic carbon (compared with the
            smaller proportion of carbon which is immobilized [
            <a>5</a>]). This is equivalent to or more than all the car outputs in any one of up to two-thirds
            of the world's countries.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, there is a strong argument that giant iceberg formation has a net positive climate
            benefit by growing important negative feedbacks [
            <a>14</a>,
            <a>18</a>]. Of course cost–benefit analysis of giant icebergs concerns much more than blue
            carbon, and recovery to previous climax biodiversity may take many decades to hundreds
            of years [
            <a>7</a>,
            <a>10</a>]. Weighing up potential blue carbon gains versus buttressing of ice sheet losses,
            sea level, gas exchange and heat absorption changes would be a complex calculation,
            involving some stochastic and chaotic elements. Such a calculation, if meaningfully
            possible, might not support the positive viewpoint of ice shelf disintegration, especially
            if there was a very high-profile and expensive research station on one of them.

            <a>6</a>], through to approximately 5 g C m
            <span>−2</span> yr
            <span>−1</span> at 100–300 m and approximately 1.5 g C m
            <span>−2</span> yr
            <span>−1</span> below 300 m depth [
            <a>32</a>,
            <a>35</a>]. Production in the upper 100 m is little studied and complicated by ice scour, but
            at least along the WAP has been estimated as equalling the total (continental shelf)
            below it [
            <a>6</a>,
            <a>9</a>]. Most data occur for 100 m and below, so an estimate of Antarctic zoobenthic production
            was made from this [
            <a>32</a>,
            <a>35</a>]. If an approximate mean of organic carbon of 3 g C m
            <span>−2</span> yr
            <span>−1</span> is used, scaled up to 3 t C km
            <span>−2</span> yr
            <span>−1</span> and the same amount of carbonate (which varies enormously and of which only 12% is
            carbon), this gives a total of approximately 3.4 t C km
            <span>−2</span> yr
            <span>−1</span>. If the shallows below 100 m are of similar value, then 3.4 × 2 = 6.8 t C km
            <span>−2</span> yr
            <span>−1</span>. Multiplied by the area of Antarctica's continental shelf (4.4 × 10
            <span>6</span> km
            <span>2</span>), it is approximately 30 Mt C yr
            <span>−1</span>. This figure is considerably less than 1% of annual anthropogenic emission; however,
            production has doubled (at least in some biota) since the 1990s around many Antarctic
            shelves due to sea-ice changes [
            <a>5</a>,
            <a>6</a>], so this estimate may now be closer to 60 Mt C yr
            <span>−1</span>. This has to be further increased to account for ice shelf losses opening up large
            new areas of benthic production, estimated to generate as much as 10 Mt C yr
            <span>−1</span> [
            <a>18</a>]. Yet such newly ice shelf-free areas have been found to be two to three times more
            productive [
            <a>19</a>] than originally thought [
            <a>18</a>]. The current work estimates that we need to add a million tonnes for each 5000 km
            <span>2</span> iceberg calved. Each of these increases to the initial estimate adds considerable
            uncertainty, but may be approximately 80 Mt C yr
            <span>−1</span> (initial estimate at 30 Mt C yr
            <span>−1 </span>× 2 for increases due to sea-ice losses [
            <a>5</a>,
            <a>6</a>] (+10 Mt C yr
            <span>−1</span> for new production with ice shelf losses [
            <a>18</a>] × 2 for new estimates of growth rates in new ice shelf loss areas [
            <a>19</a>])). This approximate 80 Mt C does not take into account that there is as much continental
            shelf at sub-Antarctic latitudes and that many of Antarctica's outlying islands [
            <a>5</a>] and sub-Antarctic islands can be much more productive [
            <a>36</a>] than those further south (with exceptions [
            <a>26</a>]). Doubling our estimate to approximately 160 Mt C yr
            <span>−1</span> to account for sub-Antarctic continental shelf areas, while appearing large, is only
            marginally more than 1% of global anthropogenic carbon output. We would argue that
            it is more important than its empiric value suggests because benthos is at the principal
            sites of burial, with genuine sequestration potential. This is unlike more considerable
            but more uncertain values dissolved in the ocean (due to temporal or spatial outgassing)
            or held in pelagic or forest biomass, which has much more time and space to be broken
            down on death and recycled in the microbial loop. Increases in sea temperature could
            yet increase zoobenthic carbon storage further [
            <a>37</a>], but this may be more than counteracted by ocean acidification, adding yet more
            uncertainty to estimated totals. The current work aimed to estimate the iceberg component
            of biological carbon sequestration in the southern polar region. Thus, our contextual
            calculations of total southern polar region zoobenthic carbon storage is only approximate,
            with considerable error, but it does suggest that icebergs have an important role
            (10–20%) within this biological component, as recently suggested [
            <a>14</a>].
