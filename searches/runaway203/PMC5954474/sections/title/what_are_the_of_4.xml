 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What are the offset negative blue carbon effects of giant iceberg formation?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small icebergs can halve incremental growth of benthic communities and thus the potential for carbon storage, as happened between 2007 and 2009 in Ryder Bay near Rothera research station (WAP) due to ice scour [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C9">9</a>]. The creation of giant icebergs has many other effects besides those which can be considered negative feedbacks on climate change, not least including threats to installations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170176F3" href="#RSTA20170176F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>). When ice shelves collapse to form giant icebergs, the buttressing of land-based ice sheets is reduced [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C28">28</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C29">29</a>]. Thus calving typically results in acceleration of land-based ice towards the sea, driving sea-level increases from any newly marine-based ice. This does not have an obvious direct positive or negative consequence on blue carbon storage but can accelerate deglaciation. New open water areas result in a strong albedo (reflectivity) change—from white to blue. This is a positive feedback on climate change because of the resulting extra heat absorbed. Depending on the extent of warming, this could have minor effects on benthos blue carbon capture: an increase in growth due to increasing meal processing rate [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C6">6</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C9">9</a>] or a reduction of growth when temperatures proceed beyond organisms’ thermal tolerance envelopes [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C30">30</a>]. More open water also has increased potential for gas exchange and thus CO
  <sub>2</sub> absorption, which could reduce benthic carbon immobilization and sequestration through ocean acidification [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C31">31</a>]. This occurs not only because of increases in the physiological ‘cost’ of synthesizing and maintaining carbonate skeletal material but also because of the greater chance of it dissolving (after death) before burial.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major negative impact of giant icebergs on benthic blue carbon is if they collide with the seabed and scour. Giant icebergs would only ground and scour in deeper water, which may on average only occur once every few hundred years at any one location [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C7">7</a>]. However, the residence time of some, e.g. A23 and B12, can be years to decades, which makes scour highly probable for the largest icebergs. For example, two of the largest three icebergs currently around Antarctica (A23A (1760 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and B22A (1056 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>)) were grounded in 2016/2017 in the shelf seabed. Such grounding can be a prolonged occurrence; for example, A23A has been grounded for more than three decades, since 1986. The chances and location of any particular iceberg scouring depend not only on size (most 2016/2017 giants were 100–500 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in area) but also on shape, calving location and current and wind direction and strength, as well as stochastic factors such as which eddies entrain it. Larger icebergs can be tracked such that their motion and fate can be followed; for example, in early 2017 there were four icebergs (8.5%) larger than 30 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in area grounded, and thus scouring blue carbon. The extent of this could be ground-truthed using ship-based multibeam, swath bathymetry data collection. Benthic imaging and sampling could then quantify blue carbon losses and, as such scours can be many kilometres long, they are likely to crush and recycle hundreds–thousands of tonnes of blue carbon standing stock. For example, benthos in the vicinity of the grounded scouring giant icebergs A23A and B22A hold 8–16 tonnes of standing stock of carbon per square kilometre [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C5">5</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C32">32</a>]. Imagery and sampling in new deep water scours show near-complete destruction of fauna [

  <a rid="RSTA20170176C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C10">10</a>]. Many such scours occur in iceberg hotspots, which reduces blue carbon losses (repeat scouring by an iceberg of a site in an early recovery stage recycles less carbon than scouring of a rarely hit area of climax benthic fauna). Scouring climax benthic communities might recycle 16 tonnes of carbon per square kilometre (the maximum standing stocks of benthos from [

  <a rid="RSTA20170176C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C32">32</a>]). We found that there were clear hot- and coldspots of iceberg scouring in deep waters around Antarctica (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170176F4" href="#RSTA20170176F4">figure 4</a>
  <span class="italic">a</span>). The Lazarev, Cosmonauts, Davis and East Amundsen Seas were hotspots of deep shelf grounding, whereas there was little deep-water scouring in the Bellingshausen and Ross Seas. The paths of giant icebergs (from US National Ice Center satellite data) also showed distinct patterns, firstly following the anticlockwise coastal current, then leaving the shelf from the Eastern Weddell and Ross Seas and being dispersed by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (

To date, such losses have not been quantified in absolute frequencies at depths relevant to giant icebergs. Even scouring has some positive blue carbon aspects in terms of potential to bury benthos in sediment berms, resuspend food material (enhancing growth in nearby benthos) and open up space for faster-growing benthic pioneer species [
