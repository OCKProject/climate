 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interglacial phases have probably seen major fluctuations in continental shelf capture and stores of blue carbon by zoobenthos in the polar regions with ice shelf collapses and the impact of the resulting giant icebergs [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C34">34</a>]. Overall, this drives a net gain of blue carbon, and importantly this extends to a net gain on the seabed where long-term storage chances and sequestration are maximal. However, for any one particular iceberg, the blue carbon gain may be small or even a net loss if it scours shelf benthos, depending on the size of the scoured area. Even then, the net gain should be positive over decades, unless the scoured area is bigger than the area of the iceberg. Scour size and scouring probability by giant icebergs, both of which are unknown, are important values. Two new giant icebergs of 5000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> would typically be expected to generate 2 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> tonnes of C
  <span class="sup">immobilized</span> per year in total (estimate from §3a (×2 for two icebergs)) and ‘cost’ up to 16 tonnes for each km
  <span class="sup">2</span> scoured (estimate from §3b) [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C5">5</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C32">32</a>] at a Weddell Sea locality (where 33% of giant icebergs were in 2016/2017). In the Amundsen Sea generation of such icebergs would be expected to generate less than half this blue carbon but similarly ‘cost’ half as much through scouring. The part of the equation missing from estimating a net carbon effect of giant icebergs is how much area they scour. This is unknown, but based on US National Ice Center tracking, the estimate used here is that eight giant icebergs ground per year. Observations in Ryder Bay (WAP) of grounded icebergs suggest that up to a quarter of the area of each grounded iceberg scours. So ‘costs’ are 0.25 (maximum proportion of iceberg grounded)×total estimated area of grounded giant icebergs (10 000) × 16 tonnes (stored carbon in benthos covering each km
  <span class="sup">2</span> which becomes recycled) = up to 4 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> tonnes of C
  <span class="sup">immobilized</span>. This cost is likely to be highly overstated because (a) the largest giants can be grounded in the same location for many years (but only recycle benthic carbon initially) and (b) it assumes icebergs become grounded at random locations on the continental shelf. It is more likely that there will be hotspots of scour on rises or sills, such as the continental shelf break, which will be hit more often and have less time to recover (and thus less stored carbon is recycled). We calculate that the net carbon gain of giant icebergs is at least 2 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> − 4 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> = 1.9 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> tonnes of C
  <span class="sup">immobilized</span> per year. This is equivalent of the carbon exhaust output of 400 000 cars per year, or nearly four million cars in terms of total zoobenthic carbon (compared with the smaller proportion of carbon which is immobilized [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C5">5</a>]). This is equivalent to or more than all the car outputs in any one of up to two-thirds of the world's countries.

  <a rid="RSTA20170176C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C18">18</a>]. Of course cost–benefit analysis of giant icebergs concerns much more than blue carbon, and recovery to previous climax biodiversity may take many decades to hundreds of years [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C7">7</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C10">10</a>]. Weighing up potential blue carbon gains versus buttressing of ice sheet losses, sea level, gas exchange and heat absorption changes would be a complex calculation, involving some stochastic and chaotic elements. Such a calculation, if meaningfully possible, might not support the positive viewpoint of ice shelf disintegration, especially if there was a very high-profile and expensive research station on one of them.
