 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are potentially additional considerations that should be noted with respect to the estimated emission intensities and annual emissions particularly when compared to traditional bottom–up approaches. Such bottom–up approaches rely upon accurate and detailed knowledge of: the technology in use, emission factors, fuel mixture data, operating conditions, quality of maintenance, control technologies in use, carbon content data, and the lower or higher heating values (LHV vs HHV) of the process. These items can have a degree of uncertainty associated with them and do not include the potential for unintentional errors or omissions of sources (among the very many bottom–up sources that exist). While aircraft measurements of CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations and associated top–down methodologies are also subject to a range of quantifiable uncertainties, the approach provides a useful and complimentary dataset to bottom–up methods, which can identify when further investigation into emissions is required, particularly when discrepancies exist. While it is not possible to unequivocally determine the root causes of the observed discrepancies here, it is speculated that that they may arise from a combination of factors, including outdated emission factors and activity data, unknown/poorly updated fuel carbon content data, poorly quantified area sources, and human error. Such difficulties are expected to be faced by various O&amp;G and other industries, suggesting the potential for universal differences between top–down and bottom–up emission estimation methods.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some additional uncertainties for the top–down methodology (those not already stated in methods) are also possible. For example, the aircraft measurements were performed over the course of a month and appropriately scaled, taking into account monthly production to derive emission intensity. A seasonal change in emission intensity during non-sampled months is possible, although we expect that this should be minimal (&lt;15%) as noted previously
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>, particularly since seasonal emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub> from fugitive sources such as tailing ponds are small contributors to overall CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Since much of the CO
  <sub>2</sub> is a result of combustion, it expected that increased energy/heat would be required during the winter, potentially resulting in increased emission intensities compared to the summer. In addition, changes in the fuel mixture used within facilities over the year can influence the derived emission intensities. For example, increased use of pet coke as fuel (which is known to emit more CO
  <sub>2</sub>) during the month of this study could bias the derived emission intensities high compared to other months. The underlying assumption in this regard is that the relative proportion of fuel types used during the aircraft flights was similar to other months. This is supported by OS plant statistics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, which show that the fraction of pet coke used varied by &lt;10% month to month in 2013 for SML. Regardless, the carbon content of pet coke is only 10–15% higher than that of natural gas and process gas used for fuel and would only apply to 60–70% of total facility emissions (i.e., not from the mining process).

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other end products arising from OS operation (i.e., not SCO) are also possible, which could introduce some uncertainty into the emission intensity estimates that use SCO production in the denominator of the equation for

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> support the assumption of a constant product mixture as it varies by &lt;10% month to month. Finally, the possibility of unforeseen facility maintenance, open burning of overburden, or increased flaring resulting in increased CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions cannot be ruled out. However, there was no evidence of maintenance or burning occurring during this study, and flaring is expected to account for a very small fraction of the overall CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. Regardless, such events are unlikely to have occurred systematically across the exact days of study during the months of August and September.
