  </span>, this issue may not be unique to the OS or to CO
  <sub>2</sub>. Indeed, the Tier 3 approach (and other provincial reporting regulations) used for the OS is considered to utilize the best possible data, and yet top–down and bottom–up results here remain significantly different. This may suggest that other GHG sources or industries in other regions, which use less accurate bottom–up methods (i.e., Tier 1) could exhibit similar discrepancies between top–down and bottom–up estimates. The results here further suggest that top–down emission estimates can be used to inform the development of federal and provincial emission regulations and highlights the value of atmospheric measurements in tracking and/or monitoring progress in terms of emission reduction targets. Equally important is that the underlying data used in reporting to the GHGRP are also used in formulating OS GHG emission estimates in Canada’s NIR to the UNFCCC

  </span> reported as approximately ±6%, ±3%, and ±&lt; 10%, respectively. However, the top–down measurement results here indicate that the total inventory GHG estimates for the OS sector may need to be revised upward by at least 30%. Most importantly, the results imply that complex emission factors and activity data used in NIRs should be periodically re-assessed and highlights the potential need for new IPCC guidelines for atmospheric measurement-based validation of emissions. Such guidelines are particularly important since atmospheric measurements are now recognized for their ability to systematically monitor GHG emissions in support of the Paris Agreement
