 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thirteen aircraft flights around the OS surface mining facilities in Alberta (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) were conducted in the summer of 2013, with virtual polygon flight boxes surrounding a given facility that encompassed all CO
  <sub>2</sub> emission sources, including mining, processing, upgrading, and tailings release
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1a–c</a>). Approximately 5–12 different altitudes were flown for each box, depending upon the facility. Background subtracted CO
  <sub>2</sub> data from these flights were used as inputs into a Top–down Emissions Rate Retrieval Algorithm (TERRA)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> (see Methods), from which hourly CO
  <sub>2</sub> emission rates were derived. For the OS surface mining facilities, an example virtual box is shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> for the Suncor (SUN) facility and the resultant hourly CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions for all facilities in the inset table. The downwind side of the virtual box of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> demonstrates the complexity of CO
  <sub>2</sub> plumes from this facility including emissions from both ground sources and elevated stacks, which can be quantified separately. Based on these flights, the largest hourly CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions are associated with Syncrude Mildred Lake (SML; 1650 ± 134 t h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and SUN (1220 ± 138 t h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) facilities, followed by Canadian National Resources Ltd Horizon (CNRL; 538 ± 68 t h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and Shell Albian and Jackpine (SAJ, now part of CNRL, 423 ± 55 t h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), all of which are dominant compared to CO
  <sub>2</sub> from local transportation within the virtual box (see Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Propagated uncertainties (see Methods) associated with hourly emission rates for single flights were small (≈8–26%; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), with emission rates consistent between flights (relative standard error (RSE) ≈ 8–13%; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) despite being conducted on various days spanning approximately 1 month.
