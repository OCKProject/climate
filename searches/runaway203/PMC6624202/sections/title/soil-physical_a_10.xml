 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Test pits excavated at each site. Thermal properties (KD2 Pro instrument from Decagon devices, INC., Pullman, WA, USA) were measured vertically at 5–20 cm increments in the test pits. Volume specific soil samples (100 cm
  <span class="sup">3</span>), as well as larger bulk samples were taken from distinct layers and were kept frozen during transport to Denmark. The volume specific samples were used to determine the loss on ignition (460 °C/16 hours), water content, soil porosity and soil bulk density.
