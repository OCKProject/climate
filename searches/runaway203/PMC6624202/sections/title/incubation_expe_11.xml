 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The collected soil bulk samples were homogenized manually (stones, larger bones, and wooden fragments were first removed) and triplicates were extracted and used for measurements of O
  <sub>2</sub> consumption. The triplicates were placed in vials, which were sealed using a disc of transparent plastic commercial oxygen barrier film (EscalTM), a silicone gasket and a screw cap with an aperture. Oxygen sensor foil (SF-PSt5-1223-01, PreSens) was glued to the inside of the oxygen barrier film, and the OxoDish® readers were placed on top of the vials. The decrease of headspace O
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations with time (7–19 days) was measured for each sample using SDR SensorDish® readers (PreSens Precision Sensing GmbH, Regensburg, Germany). Measurements were first made at 1 °C and then at 5, 10 and 15 °C. Between each run the vials were flushed with atmospheric air. Samples were incubated for 45 days in total. The measured oxygen consumption rates (mg O
  <sub>2</sub> g dry soil
