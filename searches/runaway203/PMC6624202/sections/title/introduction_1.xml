 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Archaeological sites in the Arctic contain extraordinarily well-preserved organic deposits that provide unique evidence of past humans

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span> and the ecosystems in which they lived
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Recent advances in analytical techniques including ancient DNA and isotope analysis have provided important new insight into population migrations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span> and diet economy
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span> and thereby revealed the great potential of these rich archaeological deposits. This potential, however, is quickly disappearing due to climate change which increasingly damages archaeological sites and deposits
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. Microbial degradation is considered one of the largest threats to the continued preservation of organic archaeological deposits
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Because the degradation rate is directly controlled by the soil temperature and moisture content
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, rising air temperatures and changes in precipitation during the frost-free season may lead to a loss of organic key elements such as archaeological wood, bone and ancient DNA. Furthermore, the microbial degradation of organic deposits is accompanied by a significant heat production that may act as a potential positive-feedback mechanism that further increases soil temperatures and accelerates loss of organic carbon (OC)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. To date, quantitative estimates of current and future loss of OC in archaeological deposits have only been made for one site in the Arctic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> and little is therefore known about how, where and when sites are affected. Compared to other threats, such as coastal erosion, microbial degradation is more difficult to detect and monitor and, as a result, the loss of archaeological remains may progress unnoticed. With more than 180,000 archaeological sites registered in the Arctic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span> it is impossible to visit and monitor all sites on a regular basis. Consequently, new methods to detect the most vulnerable sites are needed. Computer models have been used widely to assess the response of permafrost soils to climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> and to relate quantitatively the effect of changes in soil temperature and water content to the degradation of organic carbon (OC)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. However, because the physical and chemical compositions of archaeological deposits are markedly different from those of natural soils
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>, their long-term vulnerability cannot be assessed using such projections.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we investigate the physical and chemical properties of seven different organic archaeological deposits in the Nuuk region in Southwest Greenland and use the results to develop a model setup that can be used to predict current and future soil temperatures, water content and loss of OC. Based on results from previous degradation studies of organic archaeological materials
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, we focus on the oxic degradation of organic deposits that contain important residues of human subsistence and in which various types of artefacts are embedded.
