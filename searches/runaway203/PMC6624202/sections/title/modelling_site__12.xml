 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CoupModel model was first calibrated to match 2.5 years (1
  <span class="sup">st</span> January 2015–31
  <span class="sup">st</span> August 2017) of measured soil temperatures and water contents at four different depths at the site of Kangeq (Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>). Subsequently, the model was tested based on measured soil temperatures and soil water contents (1
  <span class="sup">st</span> June –31
  <span class="sup">st</span> July 2017) from the four remaining key sites (Supplementary Figs 8–10 This was done after adjusting only the meteorological input data and calibrating the thermal conductivity to site-specific conditions.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To avoid any initial instability in soil temperatures and soil water contents, all simulations were initiated 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> January 2010. Mean daily air temperatures and precipitation were used as meteorological input in the model. Air temperature equivalents were derived from the MODIS-based land surface temperature product MOD11A1 V6, in agreement with previous data

  <span class="sup">st</span> July 2017 (Supplementary Fig.

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The surface temperature was calculated using an equation suggested by Brunt
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> based on the air temperature. When the ground was covered by snow, the surface temperature was adjusted by a weighting factor based on thermal conductivities of the upper soil layer and the snow density in addition to the thickness of both layers. Snow was modelled by assuming that precipitation consisted only of snow when air temperatures were below 0.5 °C. The duration of the snow cover season was adjusted based on images captured daily by automatic cameras installed at three of the sites. As no snow depth measurements were made at the study sites, we tested the snow model using data from the Nuuk Basis research station

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S13</a>). To account for local variations at the sites such as snow drift by wind, winter precipitation rates were adjusted based on discrepancies between simulated and observed surface temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S14</a>).

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model regime consisted of a 5.0 m deep profile divided into 64 layers. The upper 1.0 m (21 layers) were described by site-specific and depth-specific observations; mean values were applied across the five sites. The soil below 1.0 m was considered similar to the entisol/cryosols normally found in this area of Greenland

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. Water uptake by plants and soil evaporation was treated as a common flow from the uppermost soil layers. The relative distribution of water uptake from soil layers was based on measured depth specific root distribution, default values of potential transpiration rates (4 mm day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and a growing season of 140 days based on observation from the Nuuk Basic research station

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water retention capacities and hydraulic conductivities were estimated from the measured porosity and organic content (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>) using the Mualem and Brooks &amp; Corey equations. The heat capacity (
  <span class="italic">hc</span>) and thermal conductivity (
  <span class="italic">kh</span>) were calculated as functions of soil solids and soil moisture. For unfrozen conditions this function was based on measured values

  <span class="italic">kh</span>. (Supplementary Fig.
