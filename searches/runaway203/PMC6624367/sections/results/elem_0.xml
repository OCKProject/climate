  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different modelling methods are similar to the reanalysis in their representation of broad-scale features for the CH climatology (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a–d</a>), with higher values (above 6) in northwest and central regions and lower values (below 4) closer to the coast and in southern and eastern regions. Results for the 95

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1e–h</a>) show similar spatial variations to the results for mean values, but with higher magnitudes ranging from about 8 to 12 in most regions. Some variation between modelling approaches is apparent. In particular, the GCM and WRF results are relatively low as compared to both the ERA-Interim reanalysis and CCAM results in a northwest region of inland Australia (centred on about 125°E and 25°S), noting that this northwest region is characterised by desert regions and sparse vegetation not conducive to extreme fire behaviour associated with pyroconvection (e.g., a catalogue of over 30 pyroCb events listed for Australia has none in the northwest of Australia

For ERA-Interim reanalysis, some northwest and central regions have CH &gt;6 more than 200 days a year, and CH &gt;10 more than 100 days a year, with somewhat lower values in coastal regions and in southern and eastern Australia. These features are reproduced well by the GCM ensemble as well as the CCAM and WRF downscaling ensembles. There is some variation between modelling methods, including as noted previously from Fig.

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are clear spatial variations in the projected changes in CH for later this century (for the period 2060–2079 as compared to 1990–2009), with increases for many southern and western regions of Australia as well as decreases for some northeast regions. This is the case for the results based on CH &gt;6 (Fig.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
   </span>, with no events described in the literature to date for the more northwest and central regions of Australia. For the projected increases in northwest and central Australia, it is noted that this region is sparsely vegetated in general with a low risk of dangerous pyroconvection events occurring, in contrast to southern Australia which is generally more densely vegetated and heavily populated (e.g., there are no large cities in that northwest region, with the majority of Australia population living around the capital city locations shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>). For the projected decreases in the northeast, this region is characterised by wet tropical forest and is not a region where extreme pyroconvection events have been observed to date, also noting that this area of decrease is somewhat larger for the downscaling methods (CCAM and WRF) than the GCMs which may plausibly relate to their better representation of regional details (e.g., the Great Dividing Range near the east coast of Australia and the relatively narrow eastern seaboard can have distinct climate characteristics to regions further inland).
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projected increases in southern Australia are largely due to increases in the humidity component (CB) of the CH rather than the stability component (CA), with this being the case for all three modelling methods (as detailed further in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). This indicates a projected change towards drier conditions in the lower troposphere (i.e., increased dew point depression largely driven by increased 850 hPa temperature) as the dominant influence over changes in the temperature lapse rate (from 850–700 hPa for CA), noting that this lapse rate shows either little change or a relatively small increase in some parts of southern Australia as well as a small decrease in some other locations (such as some near-coastal southern locations and the island of Tasmania).

For each of the three different modelling methods, results are only shown for locations where at least two thirds of the ensemble members agree on the sign of the projected change. The different modelling approaches are consistent with each other in projecting a future increase in the severity of near-surface fire weather conditions as represented by the FFDI for almost all regions throughout Australia.
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projections indicate more days in the future with FFDI &gt;25, noting that this threshold value represents conditions classed as “Very High” for operational fire management applications in Australia, as well as more days exceeding the historical 95

There are some regions where less than two thirds of the models agree on the projected direction of change, particularly near the east coast for the two dynamically downscaled approaches (CCAM and WRF).
