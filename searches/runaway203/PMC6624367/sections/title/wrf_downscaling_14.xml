 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The WRF downscaling data used here were produced by the NSW and ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project which was designed to create regional-scale climate projections over south-eastern Australia for use in climate change impacts and adaptation studies

  </span>. Three RCMs were used to downscale four GCMs for three 20-year time slices: 1990–2009, 2020–2039 and 2060–2079. For future projections, the Special Report on Emissions Scenario (SRES) A2 emission scenario was used, representing a high emission pathway based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) set of GCM experiments. The GCMs chosen were MIROC3.2, ECHAM5, CCCMA3.1 and CSIRO-MK3.0 and the RCMs were different configurations of the WRF model
