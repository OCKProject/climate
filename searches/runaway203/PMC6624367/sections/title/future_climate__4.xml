  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows projected future changes in the number of days per year with CH greater than its 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile, with the 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentiles defined for the historical period 1990–2009. The 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentiles are calculated individually at each grid-cell location for each model, providing an indication of CH values that are large relative to local conditions, also noting that the 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentiles are very high in most regions (i.e., CH is about 6 or higher from Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, with a value of 6 representing the original upper limit of the HI

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>). The use of this percentile-based threshold provides a common baseline value for the historical period, of around 18 days per year on average for all modelling methods, as a consistent reference point for examining future projected changes. The modelling methods are based on a high emissions scenario with increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations over the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century (as detailed in the Methods section).

    <p>Temporal changes in pyroconvection risk for four different climatic regions. Time series showing regional trends from 1970–2100 in the average number of days with CH greater than its 95
     <span class="sup">th</span> percentile at a given location. Results are presented for four regions: (
     <span class="bold">a</span>) Eastern Australia; (
     <span class="bold">b</span>) Southern Australia; (
     <span class="bold">c</span>) Rangelands; and (
     <span class="bold">d</span>) Northern Australia. (
     <span class="bold">e</span>) A map showing the four regions is provided, together with locations of capital cities of Australia. Results based on reanalysis cover the period 1979–2016 (shown in black) and ensemble mean values for GCMs cover the period 1970–2100 (shown in yellow), with ensemble mean values for CCAM (blue) and WRF (red) covering the periods 1990–2009, 2030–2049 and 2060–2079. A 20-year running mean (i.e., box-car average) is applied to highlight the climatological signal, with results for individual years also shown for the reanalysis and GCMs.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>, including Eastern Australia (EA: a subtropical climate with maritime influences, with vegetation including large forested regions), Southern Australia (SA: a mid-latitude temperate climate, including the island of Tasmania south of the Australian continent, with vegetation including large forested regions), Rangelands (RL: a dry arid climate characterised by desert regions, with vegetation including sparsely covered grassland regions) and Northern Australia (NA: a monsoonal tropical climate, with vegetation including savanna regions with woodland and dense grassland regions). Results based on ERA-Interim reanalysis cover the period 1979–2016, with GCM results for 1970–2100. The CCAM and WRF results are shown for 1990–2009, 2030–2049 and 2060–2079 representing the common periods available for these dynamical downscaling methods. A 20-year moving average is used to highlight the climatological signal, with individual years also shown for ERA-Interim reanalysis and GCM results.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These regionally averaged projections provide some indication of a long-term climatological trend towards increased values in most cases. The largest changes later this century (for 2060–2079 as compared to 1990–2009) are for the RL region with increases ranging from 3.5–5.7 days per year for the different modelling methods, as well as for the SA region with increases ranging from 1.3–3.4 days per year. The ERA-Interim reanalysis results also indicate increasing CH values for the historical period in some cases, noting that the interannual variability is larger for the reanalysis than the GCMs given that the GCM results are based on an 18-member ensemble. There is only one example of a decrease later this century with a reduction of -1.4 days per year on average in the EA region for the CCAM results (with further details on values for individual modelling methods provided in Supplementary Table
