This allows extreme values to be examined based on two complementary measures: a fixed-magnitude threshold as well as a percentile-based threshold indicating values that are high relative to local conditions. For each of the three different modelling methods, results are only shown for locations where at least two thirds of the ensemble members agree on the sign of the projected change.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are clear spatial variations in the projected changes in CH for later this century (for the period 2060–2079 as compared to 1990–2009), with increases for many southern and western regions of Australia as well as decreases for some northeast regions. This is the case for the results based on CH &gt;6 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a–c</a>) as well as CH &gt;95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentiles (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d–f</a>) for each of the three different modelling methods.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projected increases in mid-latitude regions of southern Australia (south of about 30°S) include locations where extreme pyroconvection events have occurred, including pyroCb events near large population centres in southeast Australia (e.g., Black Saturday fires near Melbourne
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>) and southwest Australia (e.g., Waroona fires near Perth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>). PyroCb events have been observed in the southern and eastern regions of Australia, such as listed in a catalogue of more than 30 occurrences identified by satellite data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, with no events described in the literature to date for the more northwest and central regions of Australia. For the projected increases in northwest and central Australia, it is noted that this region is sparsely vegetated in general with a low risk of dangerous pyroconvection events occurring, in contrast to southern Australia which is generally more densely vegetated and heavily populated (e.g., there are no large cities in that northwest region, with the majority of Australia population living around the capital city locations shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>). For the projected decreases in the northeast, this region is characterised by wet tropical forest and is not a region where extreme pyroconvection events have been observed to date, also noting that this area of decrease is somewhat larger for the downscaling methods (CCAM and WRF) than the GCMs which may plausibly relate to their better representation of regional details (e.g., the Great Dividing Range near the east coast of Australia and the relatively narrow eastern seaboard can have distinct climate characteristics to regions further inland).
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projected increases in southern Australia are largely due to increases in the humidity component (CB) of the CH rather than the stability component (CA), with this being the case for all three modelling methods (as detailed further in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). This indicates a projected change towards drier conditions in the lower troposphere (i.e., increased dew point depression largely driven by increased 850 hPa temperature) as the dominant influence over changes in the temperature lapse rate (from 850–700 hPa for CA), noting that this lapse rate shows either little change or a relatively small increase in some parts of southern Australia as well as a small decrease in some other locations (such as some near-coastal southern locations and the island of Tasmania).
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> shows projected changes in the number of days with FFDI greater than 25, as well as with FFDI greater than its historical 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile. For each of the three different modelling methods, results are only shown for locations where at least two thirds of the ensemble members agree on the sign of the projected change. The different modelling approaches are consistent with each other in projecting a future increase in the severity of near-surface fire weather conditions as represented by the FFDI for almost all regions throughout Australia.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projections indicate more days in the future with FFDI &gt;25, noting that this threshold value represents conditions classed as “Very High” for operational fire management applications in Australia, as well as more days exceeding the historical 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile. There are some regions where less than two thirds of the models agree on the projected direction of change, particularly near the east coast for the two dynamically downscaled approaches (CCAM and WRF). Previous studies have also reported a projected future increase in near-surface fire weather conditions for different regions throughout Australia, including based on the FFDI calculated from CMIP5 GCMs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>, while noting that this is the first time that a multi-method approach has been used (i.e., based on combining ensembles from different modelling approaches).
