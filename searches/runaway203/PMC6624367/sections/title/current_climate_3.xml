 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different modelling methods are similar to the reanalysis in their representation of broad-scale features for the CH climatology (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a–d</a>), with higher values (above 6) in northwest and central regions and lower values (below 4) closer to the coast and in southern and eastern regions. Results for the 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1e–h</a>) show similar spatial variations to the results for mean values, but with higher magnitudes ranging from about 8 to 12 in most regions. Some variation between modelling approaches is apparent. In particular, the GCM and WRF results are relatively low as compared to both the ERA-Interim reanalysis and CCAM results in a northwest region of inland Australia (centred on about 125°E and 25°S), noting that this northwest region is characterised by desert regions and sparse vegetation not conducive to extreme fire behaviour associated with pyroconvection (e.g., a catalogue of over 30 pyroCb events listed for Australia has none in the northwest of Australia
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>).

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extreme measures of CH are presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>. For ERA-Interim reanalysis, some northwest and central regions have CH &gt;6 more than 200 days a year, and CH &gt;10 more than 100 days a year, with somewhat lower values in coastal regions and in southern and eastern Australia. These features are reproduced well by the GCM ensemble as well as the CCAM and WRF downscaling ensembles. There is some variation between modelling methods, including as noted previously from Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> with relatively low values in the northwest for GCM and WRF results as compared to CCAM. The degree of consistency between data sets, including in different regions throughout Australia based on the different measures presented in Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, helps provide confidence in the ability of the models to simulate different aspects of the CH climatology.
