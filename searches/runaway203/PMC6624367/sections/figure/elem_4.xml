  <p>Spatial changes in pyroconvection risk for three different modelling methods. Changes are shown for the number of days per year that the CH index exceeds a threshold value, based on changes from the period 1990–2009 to the period 2060–2079. Results are presented for the number of days per year that CH is above 6 for different data sets: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) GCMs; (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) CCAM; and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) WRF. Results are also presented for the number of days per year that CH is above its historical period 95
   <span class="sup">th</span> percentile for different data sets: (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) GCMs; (
   <span class="bold">e</span>) CCAM; and (
   <span class="bold">f</span>) WRF. Coloured regions represent locations where at least two thirds of the ensemble members for each modelling method agree of the sign of the change.
