 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated the impact of environmental variables known to influence global soil bacterial communities. Overall, pH explained the most variation (18.7%) in bacterial community structure and diversity while TOC, moisture and conductivity explained between 2 and 5% of the variance, respectively. The identification of pH as a key factor influencing Arctic soil bacterial community composition is in line with previous Arctic studies over both, small and large scales (Männistö, Tiirola and Häggblom

  <a rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib55">2015</a>). However, this study is the first to quantify the magnitude of influence, highlighting the large variation in bacterial community remaining unexplained. While pH has been identified globally as a major factor influencing microbial diversity and community structure (Fierer and Jackson

  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">2018</a>), the underlying processes and mechanisms by which it does remain unclear. Studies have demonstrated that the soil pH is correlated with other elements of the geochemistry and has a strong impact on nutrient and water availability as well as solubility and adsorption (Gray 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib26">2014</a>). For instance, acidic pH increases aluminum, hydrogen and manganese solubility, retarding plant root growth due to high toxicity (Clark and Baligar 
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">2000</a>; Singh 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib60">2017</a>). Acidic soils have not only nutrient deficiencies such as calcium magnesium and potassium but also decreased phosphorus and molybdenum solubilities (Clark and Baligar 
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">2000</a>; Gray 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib26">2014</a>). Alkaline soils are generally the result of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration, leading to low water availability and in common with acidic soils, nutrient deficiencies are found with decreased phosphorus, iron, copper or zinc for instance (Clark and Baligar 
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">2000</a>). In similar ways, acidic and alkaline soils are generally considered harsh environments requiring a wide range of adaptations from microorganisms while acidoneutral soils are considered the optimum environment for microbial life (Fierer and Jackson 
  <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">2006</a>; Rousk 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib53">2010</a>); such differences in soil composition are likely driving the observed differences in microbial community composition by pH range.
