 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study investigated patterns in soil bacterial diversity across the Arctic and demonstrated that bacterial communities differed across the region. However, the dispersal range was limited to âˆ¼20 m and the variation in communities across the Arctic was primarily driven by environmental rather than spatial factors. The key edaphic property influencing communities we identified was pH, in accordance with that seen elsewhere. However, 63% of the variation remained unexplained, calling for more in-depth investigations of the drivers of bacterial community structure in the region. We identified unique and indicator taxa closely associated to the soil pH. Finally, a core microbiome composed of only 13 ubiquitously distributed taxa was identified, highlighting the potential for endemism in the region. While this study brings a deeper understanding of Arctic bacterial community assemblages, this is also a baseline for future functional studies in the region, which will be critical to forecast the ecological consequences of environmental change.</p>
