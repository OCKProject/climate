 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil DNA was extracted for each sample using the PowerSoil kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), for a total of 400 DNA extracts. Each sample was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the universal primers 515F-806R, as per the Schloss lab standard operating procedure (Kozich

  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib64">2017</a>), under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min then 30 cycles of 20 s denaturation at 95°C; primer annealing at 55°C for 15 s; elongation at 72°C for 5 min and then a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min. Negative controls, DNA extraction kit controls and ZymoBIOMICS mock communities (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) were included alongside the soil DNA and sequenced. PCR amplicons were cleaned and normalized using SequalPrep Plate Normalization Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and combined into four pools. The fragment size in each pool was assessed using the BioAnalyzer hsDNA assay (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the concentration was measured using the Qubit hsDNA kit (Invitrogen). The library was supplemented with 5% PhiX and loaded on an Illumina MiSeq V2 500 cycles cartridge (Illumina, San Diego, Ca, USA).
