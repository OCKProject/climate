 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The coverage of this study allowed the identification of a core microbiome, present in over 95% of the samples analyzed and composed of only 13 OTUs. The most abundant of these taxa belonged to the Bradyrhizobiaceae family. This is one of the most common families worldwide, as identified by Delgado-Baquerizo 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">2018</a>). However, whether this is the same taxa remains unclear and highlights the need for global studies incorporating extreme environments. The identification of a core Arctic soil microbiome is novel and this low number of cosmopolitan OTUs illustrates the potential for endemism. For the rest of the bacterial community, spatial and edaphic factors influenced distribution across the region.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distance–decay curve (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">2A</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">B</a>) illustrated the influence of geography on bacterial communities. The spatial autocorrelation is a proxy for dispersal limitation, which was restricted to ∼20 m (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">2B</a>). However, the lack of small-scale data is problematic in estimating the real autocorrelation range. The variation partitioning analysis quantified the importance of both, selection (deterministic) and dispersal (stochastic), on the bacterial community structure. Environmental variables explained 30% of the total variation (selection), of which 15% was spatially structured, corresponding to the induced spatial dependence, as described in Borcard, Gillet and Legendre (
   <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">2018</a>). Spatial components (trend + MEMs) alone explained 9% of the variation, illustrating the spatial autocorrelation (Borcard, Gillet and Legendre 
   <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">2018</a>), or dispersal.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we focused on environmental variables previously identified as influencing bacterial communities elsewhere and included pH, conductivity, moisture and organic carbon. However, 63% of the variation remained unexplained by either environmental or spatial factors in the variation partitioning analysis. This unexplained variance could be the result of unmeasured biotic or abiotic factors, directly or indirectly influencing bacterial communities. Examples of unmeasured edaphic properties could include total nitrogen, zinc, calcium oxide or nickel, all shown to have an influence on bacterial community structure in the Arctic (Wojcik 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib67">2018</a>). Other ecosystem properties such as ice presence, active layer depth or soil texture are likely to have some influence. Climatic and topographic variables such as temperature, precipitation (Yergeau and Kowalchuk 
   <a rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib69">2008</a>; Castro 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib68">2014</a>) are also known to influence bacterial assemblage and were not included in this study. Vegetation cover is a known driver of bacterial community assemblage in the Arctic region (as reviewed by Malard and Pearce (
   <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2018</a>)) which was not included in this analysis. Biotic interactions may also be a major part of the unexplained variance observed and could include competition and predation within bacterial communities or with other members of the soil biota (Wardle 
   <a rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib65">2006</a>; Singh 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib59">2009</a>). Other processes influencing bacterial communities include diversification and drift, both likely to account for some of the unexplained variance (Martiny 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of pH</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We evaluated the impact of environmental variables known to influence global soil bacterial communities. Overall, pH explained the most variation (18.7%) in bacterial community structure and diversity while TOC, moisture and conductivity explained between 2 and 5% of the variance, respectively. The identification of pH as a key factor influencing Arctic soil bacterial community composition is in line with previous Arctic studies over both, small and large scales (Männistö, Tiirola and Häggblom 
   <a rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib40">2006</a>; Chu 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib55">2015</a>). However, this study is the first to quantify the magnitude of influence, highlighting the large variation in bacterial community remaining unexplained. While pH has been identified globally as a major factor influencing microbial diversity and community structure (Fierer and Jackson 
   <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">2006</a>; Lauber 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">2018</a>), the underlying processes and mechanisms by which it does remain unclear. Studies have demonstrated that the soil pH is correlated with other elements of the geochemistry and has a strong impact on nutrient and water availability as well as solubility and adsorption (Gray 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib26">2014</a>). For instance, acidic pH increases aluminum, hydrogen and manganese solubility, retarding plant root growth due to high toxicity (Clark and Baligar 
   <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">2000</a>; Singh 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib60">2017</a>). Acidic soils have not only nutrient deficiencies such as calcium magnesium and potassium but also decreased phosphorus and molybdenum solubilities (Clark and Baligar 
   <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">2000</a>; Gray 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib26">2014</a>). Alkaline soils are generally the result of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration, leading to low water availability and in common with acidic soils, nutrient deficiencies are found with decreased phosphorus, iron, copper or zinc for instance (Clark and Baligar 
   <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">2000</a>). In similar ways, acidic and alkaline soils are generally considered harsh environments requiring a wide range of adaptations from microorganisms while acidoneutral soils are considered the optimum environment for microbial life (Fierer and Jackson 
   <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">2006</a>; Rousk 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib53">2010</a>); such differences in soil composition are likely driving the observed differences in microbial community composition by pH range.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Distribution of generalist and specialist taxa</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microbial communities are assembled by deterministic (selection) and stochastic (dispersal) processes. It has been hypothesized that communities primarily structured by deterministic processes will host more specialist taxa, highly adapted to the ecosystem, while communities influenced by dispersal will harbor primarily generalist taxa, more resilient to change (Pandit, Kolasa and Cottenie 
   <a rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib48">2009</a>; Graham and Stegen 
   <a rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib25">2017</a>; Sriswasdi, Yang and Iwasaki 
   <a rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib61">2017</a>). While specialist taxa are restricted to certain niches, they can be locally abundant; shared taxa, or generalists, are distributed across many niches (Barberán 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib2">2012</a>). In most cases, specialist will be more abundant because generalists rapidly become specialists to adapt to their ecosystems, despite generalists having evolutionary advantages (Sriswasdi, Yang and Iwasaki 
   <a rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib61">2017</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, bacterial communities were specialist-dominated in acidic soils, generalist-dominated in acidoneutral soils and a mixed community in alkaline samples. The higher abundance of specialists in acidic soils (considered the harshest systems) could illustrate the need for environmental adaptations to survive in these ecosystems and suggests that deterministic processes likely structure microbial communities. Geographically, the first cluster identified by the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">4B</a>) grouped all acidic samples from northern Norway, western Greenland and Alaska, illustrating the similarities of their bacterial communities despite the large distances separating these locations, further suggesting the strong influence of selection over dispersal. The dominance of generalists in acidoneutral soils illustrates the lower environmental pressure to have specific survival adaptations and infers the dominance of stochastic processes in community structuring. Eastern Greenland, Svalbard and Iceland were grouped together by the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix. Geographically, these locations connected through the Greenland sea, a possible route of dispersal through aerosolization and long-distance aeolian transport (Šantl-Temkiv 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
   <a rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib54">2018</a>). Finally, alkaline soils hosted a mixed community of specialists and generalists, suggesting the combination of both, selection and dispersal, in community structuring. The abundance of generalist taxa in alkaline soils, generally considered a harsh system in many ways similar to acidic soils, highlights the adaptability of generalists to a wide range of environmental conditions. Interestingly, the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix clustered the Canadian (alkaline) and Russian (acidoneutral) samples together. The Russian samples were on the higher end of the acidoneutral pH scale and the grouping of these samples illustrates the blurred boundary between acidoneutral and alkaline pH categories. While environmental selection may be driven by many variables, dispersal likely occurs via long-distance aeolian dispersal (Šantl-Temkiv 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of indicator taxa</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indicator species analysis determined OTU-pH range associations identifying different classes of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, primarily, characteristic of each pH range. The identification of abundant indicator species with strong habitat associations opens the possibility of predicting the presence and abundance of these taxa across the Arctic region. This is especially important for taxa such as Ca. Methylacidiphilum, a known methanotroph unlike others as it belongs to the Verrucomicrobia phylum instead of the Proteobacteria (Dunfield 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

   <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">2010</a>). While natural CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions come primarily from wetlands, the identification of these phylotypes in acidic soils suggests wetland may not be the only major source of northern methane emissions. Understanding the distribution and abundance of such indicator taxa, combined with field gas measurements, may allow large-scale estimates of climate-active gases release rates in the region, from soils and wetlands (Wartiainen
