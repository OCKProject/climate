 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted the indicator species analysis on the abundant taxa only as they may be more useful for monitoring purposes. We identified 17 unique taxa-habitat associations. In acidic soils, 10 indicator species, mainly Acidobacteria group 1 and 2 and Ca. Methylacidiphilum were identified. The six OTUs associated with Acidoneutral soils were mainly Acidobacteria group 4 (Blastocatellia) and Spartobacteria (Verrucomicrobia). Finally, only one OTU was identified as an indicator species for alkaline soils and belonged to the Holophagae (Acidobacteria). We also conducted the indicator species analysis of abundant taxa to combine pH ranges and identified 84 OTUs. 21 were identified as indicator species of acidic and acidoneutral soils combined, and mainly belonged to the Verrucomicrobia. Only two OTUs were associated with acidic and alkaline soils, Acidothermus (Actinobacteria) and Candidatus Xiphinematobacter (Verrucomicrobia), further illustrating the low overlap of taxa between these ecosystems and inferring the large ecosystem differences. Finally, 61 OTUs were associated with acidoneutral and alkaline soils, mainly belonging to the Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Table S3</a>, Supporting Information for the detailed list). The phylogenetic tree (Figure S3, Supporting Information) illustrates the classification of the identified abundant indicator taxa with the pH range associated. Although displaying diversity, they were mainly classified as Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, with the vast majority of taxa associated with acidoneutral and alkaline soils.
