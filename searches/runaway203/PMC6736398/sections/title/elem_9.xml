  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified 48 147 bacterial taxa, mainly classified as Proteobacteria (20%) and Planctomycetes (15%). Acidobacteria represented 13% while Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Verrucomicrobia each accounted for 4–6% of the community. Of these 48 147 OTUs, only 135 had overall abundances over 0.1% across all 386 samples and were defined as abundant taxa. They accounted for 32% of all the reads, illustrating the dominance of a few taxa over the rest of the community. Within these abundant taxa, Acidobacteria dominated the subcommunity at ∼32% with Blastocatellia (12.8%) and Acidobacteria subgroup 6 (7.2%) as abundant classes. Alphaproteobacteria (10.6%) and Betaproteobacteria (6.6%) were the most commonly identified Proteobacteria (21% overall) and Verrucomicrobia was largely represented by Spartobacteria (17.2%). Actinobacteria (10.7%), Chloroflexi (7%) and Bacteroidetes (3.5%) were also among the abundant phyla classified.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify the influence of edaphic properties and spatial factors, we conducted variation partitioning on the bacterial community. We built spatial vectors using distance-based Moran's Eigenvector Maps (dbMEM) on 
   <span class="italic">x</span>,
   <span class="italic">y</span> geographic coordinates. Three vectors (MEMs) were produced; after forward selection, two significant MEMs were identified for the total community and used in further analyses. The variation partitioning analysis differentiated the effect of environmental factors, linear trend and spatial vectors on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">3</a>). Results indicated that the environmental factors (X1 = [a]+[d]+[g]+[f]) explained 30.7% of the variance in the community. These results are equivalent to the finding of the adonis test (Table 
   <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">1</a>), confirming the success of the variation partitioning analysis. Nonspatially structured environmental variables (fraction [a]) explained 15% of the variation while spatial factors only (fractions [b], [e] and [c]) explained ∼10% of the variation. Of the fraction X1 (environmental factors), 15% represented spatially structured environmental variables, also called induced spatial dependence, where the spatial structure of these environmental variables induced a similar spatial structure in the response data (detailed results in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Table S1</a>, Supporting Information). In total, 63.3% of the total bacterial community dissimilarity could not be explained by environmental and spatial factors after

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">pH as a key environmental factor</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the environmental variables we measured, we identified pH as the primary factor structuring Arctic soil bacterial communities. The Pearson correlations indicated that pH did not have strong collinearity (coefficient over |0.8|) with any other variable measured (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Table S2</a>, Supporting Information). The clustering of samples by pH range was clearly observed on the PCoA of bacterial communities (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">4A</a>). The envfit analysis confirmed that pH was the key measured factor driving the ordination, although TOC, conductivity and moisture all had some influence. Using ordisurf, we visualized the PCoA ordination of the bacterial community in relation to the pH gradient (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Figure S1</a>, Supporting Information). The Bray–Curtis dissimilarity heatmap and dendrogram (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">4B</a>) identified three main clusters illustrating community differences. The first cluster was composed of acidic samples in a pH gradient from Norwegian soils at pH = 4.07 (±0.35) to samples from Alaska (pH = 4.64 ± 0.41) and West Greenland (pH = 4.90 ± 0.85). The second cluster included the lower acidoneutral range of samples from East Greenland (pH = 5.96 ± 0.69), Svalbard (pH = 5.65 ± 0.53) and Iceland (pH = 5.84 ± 0.46). Finally, the last cluster included the higher range of acidoneutral and alkaline soils from Russia (pH = 6.19 ± 0.22) and Canada (pH = 7.94 ± 0.67). The full spectrum of soil pH was covered from pH = 3.5 to pH = 9.0 and geographical locations often had samples from more than one pH category (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Figure S2</a>, Supporting Information). As pH was the primary factor we identified influencing bacterial community structure, we defined three pH categories to focus on: acidic, acidoneutral and alkaline.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generalist vs specialist taxa</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differentiation of specialist from generalist taxa associated with pH range was conducted by considering all taxa identified in this study and present in a minimum 95% of all samples from each pH category (Fig. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" href="#fig7">7</a>). 125 acidic specialist OTUs were identified, unique to acidic soil samples. Of these 125 unique OTUs, most belonged to the Acidobacteria (27%), Verrucomicrobia (20%), Actinobacteria (14%), Planctomycetes (14%) and Proteobacteria (14%). At the class level, Acidobacteria group 1 dominated at 14%, while the rest of the identified classes had balanced relative abundances oscillating between 5 and 8%. Shared OTUs, or generalists were present in low numbers in acidic soils. 12 OTUs were shared with acidoneutral soils only, which were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (65%), mainly Rhizobiales, while 3 OTUs were shared with alkaline only, belonging to the Spartobacteria (Verrucomicrobia), Phycisphaerae (Planctomycetes) and Chitinophagia (Bacteroidetes) classes. In comparison, acidoneutral soils had 76 shared taxa with alkaline soils, against 12 shared OTUs with acidic. Taxa shared with alkaline soils were mainly classified as Blastocatellia (Acidobacteria), Spartobacteria and Acidobacteria subgroup 6. Taxa exclusively found in acidoneutral soils belonged mainly to Actinobacteria (20%), Verrucomicrobia (20%) and Acidobacteria (19%). At the class level, unique taxa living in acidoneutral soils were dominated by Spartobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Holophagae. Alkaline soils presented a combination of both, a high number of shared (79 OTUs in total) and 125 exclusive taxa. Alkaline unique taxa were mostly composed of Acidobacteria (36%) and Proteobacteria (22%). From these unique taxa, the Acidobacteria subgroup 6 (20%), Blastocatellia (12%) and Alphaproteobacteria (12%) dominated the community.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted the indicator species analysis on the abundant taxa only as they may be more useful for monitoring purposes. We identified 17 unique taxa-habitat associations. In acidic soils, 10 indicator species, mainly Acidobacteria group 1 and 2 and Ca. Methylacidiphilum were identified. The six OTUs associated with Acidoneutral soils were mainly Acidobacteria group 4 (Blastocatellia) and Spartobacteria (Verrucomicrobia). Finally, only one OTU was identified as an indicator species for alkaline soils and belonged to the Holophagae (Acidobacteria). We also conducted the indicator species analysis of abundant taxa to combine pH ranges and identified 84 OTUs. 21 were identified as indicator species of acidic and acidoneutral soils combined, and mainly belonged to the Verrucomicrobia. Only two OTUs were associated with acidic and alkaline soils, Acidothermus (Actinobacteria) and Candidatus Xiphinematobacter (Verrucomicrobia), further illustrating the low overlap of taxa between these ecosystems and inferring the large ecosystem differences. Finally, 61 OTUs were associated with acidoneutral and alkaline soils, mainly belonging to the Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Table S3</a>, Supporting Information for the detailed list). The phylogenetic tree (Figure S3, Supporting Information) illustrates the classification of the identified abundant indicator taxa with the pH range associated. Although displaying diversity, they were mainly classified as Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, with the vast majority of taxa associated with acidoneutral and alkaline soils.

The core microbiome represented 0.026% of bacterial communities and accounted for 2.7% of all reads. It was composed of 13 OTUs, mainly Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria, notably belonging to the Rhizobiales and Acidobacteria subgroup 6. The Alphaproteobacteria, especially the Bradyrhizobiaceae family, was most abundant in acidic soils and decreased with increasing pH. The Betaproteobacteria, especially the Comamonadaceae family, decreased with decreasing pH. The Acidobacteria were highest in the acidoneutral soils. Although relative abundances differed by pH range, these 13 OTUs were present in all categories.
