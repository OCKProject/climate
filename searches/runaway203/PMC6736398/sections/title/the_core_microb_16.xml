 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While some taxa displayed biogeographical patterns with nonrandom distribution across space and environmental gradients, others were cosmopolitan and identified in over 95% of all samples. The core microbiome represented 0.026% of bacterial communities and accounted for 2.7% of all reads. It was composed of 13 OTUs, mainly Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria, notably belonging to the Rhizobiales and Acidobacteria subgroup 6. The Alphaproteobacteria, especially the Bradyrhizobiaceae family, was most abundant in acidic soils and decreased with increasing pH. The Betaproteobacteria, especially the Comamonadaceae family, decreased with decreasing pH. The Acidobacteria were highest in the acidoneutral soils. Although relative abundances differed by pH range, these 13 OTUs were present in all categories.
