 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We focused our investigation on environmental variables previously identified as influencing bacterial communities and included pH, conductivity, moisture and organic carbon. Moisture content was measured gravimetrically for each soil sample after drying at 150°C for 24 h and total organic carbon (TOC) was measured gravimetrically by heating previously dried soils to 550°C for 4 h. pH and conductivity were measured in the laboratory in a 1:5 freshly thawed soil to water ratio, using a Mettler-Toledo FE20 pH meter (Mettler-Toledo Instruments Co., Shanghai, China) and a CMD500 conductivity meter (WPA, Cambridge, UK).</p>
