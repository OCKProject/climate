 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microbial communities are assembled by deterministic (selection) and stochastic (dispersal) processes. It has been hypothesized that communities primarily structured by deterministic processes will host more specialist taxa, highly adapted to the ecosystem, while communities influenced by dispersal will harbor primarily generalist taxa, more resilient to change (Pandit, Kolasa and Cottenie 
  <a rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib48">2009</a>; Graham and Stegen 
  <a rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib25">2017</a>; Sriswasdi, Yang and Iwasaki 
  <a rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib61">2017</a>). While specialist taxa are restricted to certain niches, they can be locally abundant; shared taxa, or generalists, are distributed across many niches (Barberán 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib2">2012</a>). In most cases, specialist will be more abundant because generalists rapidly become specialists to adapt to their ecosystems, despite generalists having evolutionary advantages (Sriswasdi, Yang and Iwasaki 
  <a rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib61">2017</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, bacterial communities were specialist-dominated in acidic soils, generalist-dominated in acidoneutral soils and a mixed community in alkaline samples. The higher abundance of specialists in acidic soils (considered the harshest systems) could illustrate the need for environmental adaptations to survive in these ecosystems and suggests that deterministic processes likely structure microbial communities. Geographically, the first cluster identified by the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">4B</a>) grouped all acidic samples from northern Norway, western Greenland and Alaska, illustrating the similarities of their bacterial communities despite the large distances separating these locations, further suggesting the strong influence of selection over dispersal. The dominance of generalists in acidoneutral soils illustrates the lower environmental pressure to have specific survival adaptations and infers the dominance of stochastic processes in community structuring. Eastern Greenland, Svalbard and Iceland were grouped together by the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix. Geographically, these locations connected through the Greenland sea, a possible route of dispersal through aerosolization and long-distance aeolian transport (Šantl-Temkiv 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib54">2018</a>). Finally, alkaline soils hosted a mixed community of specialists and generalists, suggesting the combination of both, selection and dispersal, in community structuring. The abundance of generalist taxa in alkaline soils, generally considered a harsh system in many ways similar to acidic soils, highlights the adaptability of generalists to a wide range of environmental conditions. Interestingly, the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix clustered the Canadian (alkaline) and Russian (acidoneutral) samples together. The Russian samples were on the higher end of the acidoneutral pH scale and the grouping of these samples illustrates the blurred boundary between acidoneutral and alkaline pH categories. While environmental selection may be driven by many variables, dispersal likely occurs via long-distance aeolian dispersal (Šantl-Temkiv 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
