 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distance–decay curve (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">2A</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">B</a>) illustrated the influence of geography on bacterial communities. The spatial autocorrelation is a proxy for dispersal limitation, which was restricted to ∼20 m (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">2B</a>). However, the lack of small-scale data is problematic in estimating the real autocorrelation range. The variation partitioning analysis quantified the importance of both, selection (deterministic) and dispersal (stochastic), on the bacterial community structure. Environmental variables explained 30% of the total variation (selection), of which 15% was spatially structured, corresponding to the induced spatial dependence, as described in Borcard, Gillet and Legendre (
  <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">2018</a>). Spatial components (trend + MEMs) alone explained 9% of the variation, illustrating the spatial autocorrelation (Borcard, Gillet and Legendre 
  <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">2018</a>), or dispersal.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we focused on environmental variables previously identified as influencing bacterial communities elsewhere and included pH, conductivity, moisture and organic carbon. However, 63% of the variation remained unexplained by either environmental or spatial factors in the variation partitioning analysis. This unexplained variance could be the result of unmeasured biotic or abiotic factors, directly or indirectly influencing bacterial communities. Examples of unmeasured edaphic properties could include total nitrogen, zinc, calcium oxide or nickel, all shown to have an influence on bacterial community structure in the Arctic (Wojcik

  <a rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib67">2018</a>). Other ecosystem properties such as ice presence, active layer depth or soil texture are likely to have some influence. Climatic and topographic variables such as temperature, precipitation (Yergeau and Kowalchuk 
  <a rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib69">2008</a>; Castro 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib10">2010</a>; Nielsen and Ball 
  <a rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib46">2015</a>) and altitude (Shen 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">2013</a>; Xu 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib68">2014</a>) are also known to influence bacterial assemblage and were not included in this study. Vegetation cover is a known driver of bacterial community assemblage in the Arctic region (as reviewed by Malard and Pearce (
  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2018</a>)) which was not included in this analysis. Biotic interactions may also be a major part of the unexplained variance observed and could include competition and predation within bacterial communities or with other members of the soil biota (Wardle 
  <a rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib65">2006</a>; Singh 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib59">2009</a>). Other processes influencing bacterial communities include diversification and drift, both likely to account for some of the unexplained variance (Martiny 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
