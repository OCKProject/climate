 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the environmental variables we measured, we identified pH as the primary factor structuring Arctic soil bacterial communities. The Pearson correlations indicated that pH did not have strong collinearity (coefficient over |0.8|) with any other variable measured (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Table S2</a>, Supporting Information). The clustering of samples by pH range was clearly observed on the PCoA of bacterial communities (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">4A</a>). The envfit analysis confirmed that pH was the key measured factor driving the ordination, although TOC, conductivity and moisture all had some influence. Using ordisurf, we visualized the PCoA ordination of the bacterial community in relation to the pH gradient (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Figure S1</a>, Supporting Information). The Bray–Curtis dissimilarity heatmap and dendrogram (Fig. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">4B</a>) identified three main clusters illustrating community differences. The first cluster was composed of acidic samples in a pH gradient from Norwegian soils at pH = 4.07 (±0.35) to samples from Alaska (pH = 4.64 ± 0.41) and West Greenland (pH = 4.90 ± 0.85). The second cluster included the lower acidoneutral range of samples from East Greenland (pH = 5.96 ± 0.69), Svalbard (pH = 5.65 ± 0.53) and Iceland (pH = 5.84 ± 0.46). Finally, the last cluster included the higher range of acidoneutral and alkaline soils from Russia (pH = 6.19 ± 0.22) and Canada (pH = 7.94 ± 0.67). The full spectrum of soil pH was covered from pH = 3.5 to pH = 9.0 and geographical locations often had samples from more than one pH category (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">Figure S2</a>, Supporting Information). As pH was the primary factor we identified influencing bacterial community structure, we defined three pH categories to focus on: acidic, acidoneutral and alkaline.
