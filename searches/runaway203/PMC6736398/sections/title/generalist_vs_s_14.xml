 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differentiation of specialist from generalist taxa associated with pH range was conducted by considering all taxa identified in this study and present in a minimum 95% of all samples from each pH category (Fig.Â 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" href="#fig7">7</a>). 125 acidic specialist OTUs were identified, unique to acidic soil samples. Of these 125 unique OTUs, most belonged to the Acidobacteria (27%), Verrucomicrobia (20%), Actinobacteria (14%), Planctomycetes (14%) and Proteobacteria (14%). At the class level, Acidobacteria group 1 dominated at 14%, while the rest of the identified classes had balanced relative abundances oscillating between 5 and 8%. Shared OTUs, or generalists were present in low numbers in acidic soils. 12 OTUs were shared with acidoneutral soils only, which were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (65%), mainly Rhizobiales, while 3 OTUs were shared with alkaline only, belonging to the Spartobacteria (Verrucomicrobia), Phycisphaerae (Planctomycetes) and Chitinophagia (Bacteroidetes) classes. In comparison, acidoneutral soils had 76 shared taxa with alkaline soils, against 12 shared OTUs with acidic. Taxa shared with alkaline soils were mainly classified as Blastocatellia (Acidobacteria), Spartobacteria and Acidobacteria subgroup 6. Taxa exclusively found in acidoneutral soils belonged mainly to Actinobacteria (20%), Verrucomicrobia (20%) and Acidobacteria (19%). At the class level, unique taxa living in acidoneutral soils were dominated by Spartobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Holophagae. Alkaline soils presented a combination of both, a high number of shared (79 OTUs in total) and 125 exclusive taxa. Alkaline unique taxa were mostly composed of Acidobacteria (36%) and Proteobacteria (22%). From these unique taxa, the Acidobacteria subgroup 6 (20%), Blastocatellia (12%) and Alphaproteobacteria (12%) dominated the community.
