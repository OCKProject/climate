 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frozen soils in the Arctic region store over 1500 Pg of carbon (Koven

  <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">2011</a>) and as Arctic warming is exacerbated and permafrost thaw accelerates, the depth of the active layer is increasing. As previously frozen carbon becomes available, it is expected that microbial activity will increase, which may lead to increased atmospheric release rates of climate active gases such as carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>), methane (CH
  <sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N
  <sub>2</sub>O) (Ma 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib36">2007</a>; Mackelprang 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">2011</a>). Carbon-climate feedback studies of permafrost affected regions use temperature, soil moisture and precipitation as the main drivers of decomposition rates (Koven 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib31">2011</a>; Schuur 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib56">2015</a>). While models are useful to gain a global understanding of the impact of climate change on permafrost thaw and greenhouse gas release, the accuracy of results obtained is highly variable when compared with data collected in the field or laboratory (Schuur 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib56">2015</a>) due to empirical and modelling uncertainties which still need to be addressed (Bradford 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib5">2016</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As microorganisms drive biogeochemical cycling and participate in the uptake and release of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, CH
  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O, microbial data should be incorporated in climate models. Current models use soil properties to model changes in fluxes, without considering microbial communities and the changes in community composition induced by climate change (Bardgett, Freeman and Ostle 
  <a rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib3">2008</a>; Nazaries 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2013</a>). Adding microbial information into models will improve their predictions; however, detailed microbial data is still required, with a focus on the microbial community, diversity, function, stability and long-term changes in these communities (Graham 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">2012</a>; Nazaries 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2013</a>). While global surveys of microbial diversity have already been conducted (Tedersoo 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib63">2014</a>; Delgado-Baquerizo 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">2018</a>), the number of Arctic samples is restricted (Malard and Pearce 
  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2018</a>) and therefore, microbial data is still lacking for most permafrost-affected regions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To accurately model spatial distribution patterns of microbes and incorporate microbial data from permafrost-affected regions in climate models in the near future, the first step is to produce a baseline database of microbial diversity with respect to biogeographical distribution. Biogeography is the study of biodiversity across space and time; it gives insights into ecological mechanisms such as speciation, extinction, dispersal and species interactions (Martiny 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib42">2006</a>; Fierer 
  <a rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib19">2008</a>), improving our understanding of community assembly. Theoretically, distant and isolated habitats are expected to present high endemicity as a consequence of intrinsic dispersal limitations and environmental filtering (Mittelbach and Schemske 
  <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">2015</a>; Kleinteich 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib30">2017</a>; Bahram 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib1">2018</a>). Thus, isolated, pristine ecosystems with limited human presence, such as the Arctic region, should harbor endemic communities. However, microbial communities may be less constrained by geographical barriers and thus, have long been considered ubiquitous (Finlay 
  <a rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib21">2002</a>; O'Malley 
  <a rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib47">2007</a>). Yet, recent studies have uncovered patterns of microbial biogeography on global scales (Fierer and Jackson 
  <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">2006</a>; Lauber 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">2009</a>; Tedersoo 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib63">2014</a>; Henschel, Anwar and Manohar 
  <a rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib27">2015</a>; Bahram 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib1">2018</a>; Delgado-Baquerizo 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">2018</a>). They demonstrated that microbial distribution is nonrandom, generally influenced by biotic and abiotic factors such as plant cover, soil pH, C/N ratio or precipitation, and that communities vary from one region to another. However, whether these patterns apply to Arctic microbial communities is still subject to debate as these studies tend to have a low number of Arctic samples and Arctic studies have generally focused on small-scale patterns in restricted areas, as shown by Metcalfe 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="bib1_217_1567079012999" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib1_217_1567079012999">2018</a>) highlighting the focuses on Abisko, Sweden and Toolik lake, Alaska. Large-scale studies are therefore required to improve our understanding not only of the spatial distribution of microorganisms but also on the processes of community assembly. Producing a baseline database of diversity in the region will enable the accurate modelling of spatial distribution, linking with patterns of functional processes to evaluate the potential consequences of environmental change on ecosystem properties.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we conducted a Pan-Arctic survey of bacterial communities in Arctic soils to provide a baseline of Arctic bacterial diversity. We addressed the following questions: (i) Are bacterial taxa ubiquitously distributed or are there biogeographical patterns? (ii) What are the key factors influencing bacterial community structure? (iii) Are there taxa closely associated with the key edaphic properties and what can we learn from them? (iv) If bacterial taxa are not ubiquitous, is there a core microbiome?</p>
