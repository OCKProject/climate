 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified 48 147 bacterial taxa, mainly classified as Proteobacteria (20%) and Planctomycetes (15%). Acidobacteria represented 13% while Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Verrucomicrobia each accounted for 4–6% of the community. Of these 48 147 OTUs, only 135 had overall abundances over 0.1% across all 386 samples and were defined as abundant taxa. They accounted for 32% of all the reads, illustrating the dominance of a few taxa over the rest of the community. Within these abundant taxa, Acidobacteria dominated the subcommunity at ∼32% with Blastocatellia (12.8%) and Acidobacteria subgroup 6 (7.2%) as abundant classes. Alphaproteobacteria (10.6%) and Betaproteobacteria (6.6%) were the most commonly identified Proteobacteria (21% overall) and Verrucomicrobia was largely represented by Spartobacteria (17.2%). Actinobacteria (10.7%), Chloroflexi (7%) and Bacteroidetes (3.5%) were also among the abundant phyla classified.</p>
