 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indicator species analysis determined OTU-pH range associations identifying different classes of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, primarily, characteristic of each pH range. The identification of abundant indicator species with strong habitat associations opens the possibility of predicting the presence and abundance of these taxa across the Arctic region. This is especially important for taxa such as Ca. Methylacidiphilum, a known methanotroph unlike others as it belongs to the Verrucomicrobia phylum instead of the Proteobacteria (Dunfield

  <sub>4</sub> emissions come primarily from wetlands, the identification of these phylotypes in acidic soils suggests wetland may not be the only major source of northern methane emissions. Understanding the distribution and abundance of such indicator taxa, combined with field gas measurements, may allow large-scale estimates of climate-active gases release rates in the region, from soils and wetlands (Wartiainen
