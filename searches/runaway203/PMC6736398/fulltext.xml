In the broadest study of Arctic soil bacterial communities to date, we used high-throughput DNA sequencing to investigate the bacterial diversity from 200 independent Arctic soil samples from 43 sites. We quantified the impact of spatial and environmental factors on bacterial community structure using variation partitioning analysis, illustrating a nonrandom distribution across the region. pH was confirmed as the key environmental driver structuring Arctic soil bacterial communities, while total organic carbon (TOC), moisture and conductivity were shown to have little effect. Specialist taxa were more abundant in acidic and alkaline soils while generalist taxa were more abundant in acidoneutral soils. Of the 48 147 bacterial taxa, a core microbiome composed of only 13 taxa that were ubiquitously distributed and present within 95% of samples was identified, illustrating the high potential for endemism in the region. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of spatial and edaphic factors on the structure of Arctic soil bacterial communities.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>Arctic soil bacterial communities are influenced by spatial and edaphic factors and exhibit biogeographical distribution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="keywords"><kwd>16S rRNA</kwd><kwd>Arctic soil</kwd><kwd>microbial diversity</kwd><kwd>indicator species</kwd><kwd>core microbiome</kwd><kwd>biogeography</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">European Commission's Marie Sklowdowska Curie</named-content></funding-source><award-id>675546</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Frozen soils in the Arctic region store over 1500 Pg of carbon (Koven <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Mackelprang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and as Arctic warming is exacerbated and permafrost thaw accelerates, the depth of the active layer is increasing. As previously frozen carbon becomes available, it is expected that microbial activity will increase, which may lead to increased atmospheric release rates of climate active gases such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) (Ma <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Mackelprang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Carbon-climate feedback studies of permafrost affected regions use temperature, soil moisture and precipitation as the main drivers of decomposition rates (Koven <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Schuur <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). While models are useful to gain a global understanding of the impact of climate change on permafrost thaw and greenhouse gas release, the accuracy of results obtained is highly variable when compared with data collected in the field or laboratory (Schuur <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) due to empirical and modelling uncertainties which still need to be addressed (Bradford <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>As microorganisms drive biogeochemical cycling and participate in the uptake and release of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, microbial data should be incorporated in climate models. Current models use soil properties to model changes in fluxes, without considering microbial communities and the changes in community composition induced by climate change (Bardgett, Freeman and Ostle <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Nazaries <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Adding microbial information into models will improve their predictions; however, detailed microbial data is still required, with a focus on the microbial community, diversity, function, stability and long-term changes in these communities (Graham <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Nazaries <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). While global surveys of microbial diversity have already been conducted (Tedersoo <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Delgado-Baquerizo <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), the number of Arctic samples is restricted (Malard and Pearce <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and therefore, microbial data is still lacking for most permafrost-affected regions.</p><p>To accurately model spatial distribution patterns of microbes and incorporate microbial data from permafrost-affected regions in climate models in the near future, the first step is to produce a baseline database of microbial diversity with respect to biogeographical distribution. Biogeography is the study of biodiversity across space and time; it gives insights into ecological mechanisms such as speciation, extinction, dispersal and species interactions (Martiny <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Fierer <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), improving our understanding of community assembly. Theoretically, distant and isolated habitats are expected to present high endemicity as a consequence of intrinsic dispersal limitations and environmental filtering (Mittelbach and Schemske <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kleinteich <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Bahram <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Thus, isolated, pristine ecosystems with limited human presence, such as the Arctic region, should harbor endemic communities. However, microbial communities may be less constrained by geographical barriers and thus, have long been considered ubiquitous (Finlay <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; O'Malley <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Yet, recent studies have uncovered patterns of microbial biogeography on global scales (Fierer and Jackson <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Lauber <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Tedersoo <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Henschel, Anwar and Manohar <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Bahram <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Delgado-Baquerizo <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). They demonstrated that microbial distribution is nonrandom, generally influenced by biotic and abiotic factors such as plant cover, soil pH, C/N ratio or precipitation, and that communities vary from one region to another. However, whether these patterns apply to Arctic microbial communities is still subject to debate as these studies tend to have a low number of Arctic samples and Arctic studies have generally focused on small-scale patterns in restricted areas, as shown by Metcalfe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (<xref rid="bib1_217_1567079012999" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) highlighting the focuses on Abisko, Sweden and Toolik lake, Alaska. Large-scale studies are therefore required to improve our understanding not only of the spatial distribution of microorganisms but also on the processes of community assembly. Producing a baseline database of diversity in the region will enable the accurate modelling of spatial distribution, linking with patterns of functional processes to evaluate the potential consequences of environmental change on ecosystem properties.</p><p>In this study, we conducted a Pan-Arctic survey of bacterial communities in Arctic soils to provide a baseline of Arctic bacterial diversity. We addressed the following questions: (i) Are bacterial taxa ubiquitously distributed or are there biogeographical patterns? (ii) What are the key factors influencing bacterial community structure? (iii) Are there taxa closely associated with the key edaphic properties and what can we learn from them? (iv) If bacterial taxa are not ubiquitous, is there a core microbiome?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Soil samples were collected across the Arctic region between April 2017 and September 2017, and the global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of each site were recorded with a portable GPS (Fig.&#x000a0; &#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>). All sites were generally remote with limited human presence; however, in Iceland and Norway where tourist activities are frequent, we aimed to sample at least 500 m away from human-related activities. At each location, three to five soil samples were collected within 100 m<sup>2</sup> under the most common vegetation, for a total of 200 independent Arctic samples across 43 sites, with the aim to cover the broadest geographical area possible. Despite the extent, it should be noted that large areas of Canada and Russia remain uncharacterized and under-represented, highlighting areas where sampling should be prioritized in the future. Approximately 150 g of soil per sample was collected from the top 15 cm, avoiding plant roots and rocks and using an ethanol-cleaned shovel and Whirl-Pak bags (Nasco, WI, USA). Remaining plant roots and rocks were removed manually in a class II microbiological safety cabinet; samples were homogenized by manual mixing and frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C before transportation to the United Kingdom.

Dereplication was performed to identify unique sequences. A two-step chimera detection method was used, first by aligning against ChimeraSlayer Gold database provided with SILVA (Pruesse <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), second by using the <italic>de novo</italic> detection module in vsearch. <italic>De novo</italic> operational taxonomic unit (OTU) calling was performed on high-quality trimmed sequences at 97% similarity level using the USEARCH (Edgar <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) algorithm for clustering implemented in vsearch to generate OTUs. Unique chimera filtered sequences were aligned using the Python Nearest Alignment Space Termination (PyNAST) (Caporaso <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) tool with a relaxed neighbor-joining tree built using FastTree (Price, Dehal and Arkin <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).

Multiple rarefactions were performed in QIIME with the smallest sample size as maximum depth. Alpha diversity (richness, Shannon and Simpson indices) were calculated in QIIME on the matrices resulting from the multiple rarefactions. The differences in alpha diversity indices were tested in QIIME using nonparametric (Monte-Carlo) tests across different pH categories with a Bonferroni correction.</p><p>The nonrarefied OTU table was normalized using cumulative-sum scaling (CSS) in QIIME (Paulson <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The resulting OTU table was input into R for subsequent analyses. Using the phyloseq package (McMurdie and Holmes <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), we calculated the Bray&#x02013;Curtis dissimilarity distance and visualized the ordination using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Using the cmdscale, envfit and ordisurf functions in the vegan package (Dixon <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), we calculated and visualized the significant correlations between edaphic properties and bacterial community dissimilarity in relation to the pH gradient. Permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PerMANOVA) was conducted using the adonis function with 999 permutations. Pearson's correlation with 999 permutations was used to evaluate the collinearity of environmental variables.</p><p>To evaluate the spatial component, the geographic locations of the sampling sites were transformed into cartesian coordinates using the SoDA package (Chambers <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and the euclidean distance was calculated using the vegan package. The presence of a linear trend was tested by redundancy discriminant analysis and ANOVA as prescribed in Borcard, Gillet and Legendre (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). A significant linear trend was identified, violating the second-order stationarity assumption where the mean of the variable and its spatial covariance are the same over the study area and its variance is finite. In other words, spatial correlation coefficients cannot be tested for significance if an overall trend is present in the data (Franklin and Mills <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Borcard, Gillet and Legendre <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and therefore, the data was detrended by linear regression of the <italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic> coordinates. To carry meaningful spatial analysis, constructing spatial variables representing spatial structures at all relevant scales is necessary (Borcard, Gillet and Legendre <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). To do so, we used distance-based Moran's Eigenvector Maps (dbMEM) on detrended data and <italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic> coordinates using the adespatial R package (Dray <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).

Of these 125 unique OTUs, most belonged to the Acidobacteria (27%), Verrucomicrobia (20%), Actinobacteria (14%), Planctomycetes (14%) and Proteobacteria (14%). At the class level, Acidobacteria group 1 dominated at 14%, while the rest of the identified classes had balanced relative abundances oscillating between 5 and 8%.

The identification of a core Arctic soil microbiome is novel and this low number of cosmopolitan OTUs illustrates the potential for endemism. For the rest of the bacterial community, spatial and edaphic factors influenced distribution across the region.</p><sec id="sec4-1"><title>Arctic bacterial community assembly</title><p>The distance&#x02013;decay curve (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">B</xref>) illustrated the influence of geography on bacterial communities. The spatial autocorrelation is a proxy for dispersal limitation, which was restricted to &#x0223c;20 m (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). However, the lack of small-scale data is problematic in estimating the real autocorrelation range. The variation partitioning analysis quantified the importance of both, selection (deterministic) and dispersal (stochastic), on the bacterial community structure. Environmental variables explained 30% of the total variation (selection), of which 15% was spatially structured, corresponding to the induced spatial dependence, as described in Borcard, Gillet and Legendre (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Spatial components (trend + MEMs) alone explained 9% of the variation, illustrating the spatial autocorrelation (Borcard, Gillet and Legendre <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), or dispersal.</p><p>Here, we focused on environmental variables previously identified as influencing bacterial communities elsewhere and included pH, conductivity, moisture and organic carbon. However, 63% of the variation remained unexplained by either environmental or spatial factors in the variation partitioning analysis. This unexplained variance could be the result of unmeasured biotic or abiotic factors, directly or indirectly influencing bacterial communities. Examples of unmeasured edaphic properties could include total nitrogen, zinc, calcium oxide or nickel, all shown to have an influence on bacterial community structure in the Arctic (Wojcik <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Other ecosystem properties such as ice presence, active layer depth or soil texture are likely to have some influence. Climatic and topographic variables such as temperature, precipitation (Yergeau and Kowalchuk <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Castro <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Nielsen and Ball <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and altitude (Shen <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Xu <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) are also known to influence bacterial assemblage and were not included in this study. Vegetation cover is a known driver of bacterial community assemblage in the Arctic region (as reviewed by Malard and Pearce (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>)) which was not included in this analysis. Biotic interactions may also be a major part of the unexplained variance observed and could include competition and predation within bacterial communities or with other members of the soil biota (Wardle <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Singh <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Other processes influencing bacterial communities include diversification and drift, both likely to account for some of the unexplained variance (Martiny <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2"><title>The importance of pH</title><p>We evaluated the impact of environmental variables known to influence global soil bacterial communities. Overall, pH explained the most variation (18.7%) in bacterial community structure and diversity while TOC, moisture and conductivity explained between 2 and 5% of the variance, respectively. The identification of pH as a key factor influencing Arctic soil bacterial community composition is in line with previous Arctic studies over both, small and large scales (M&#x000e4;nnist&#x000f6;, Tiirola and H&#x000e4;ggblom <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chu <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Ganzert, Bajerski and Wagner <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Siciliano <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Schostag <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, this study is the first to quantify the magnitude of influence, highlighting the large variation in bacterial community remaining unexplained. While pH has been identified globally as a major factor influencing microbial diversity and community structure (Fierer and Jackson <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Lauber <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Tedersoo <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Delgado-Baquerizo <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), the underlying processes and mechanisms by which it does remain unclear. Studies have demonstrated that the soil pH is correlated with other elements of the geochemistry and has a strong impact on nutrient and water availability as well as solubility and adsorption (Gray <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). For instance, acidic pH increases aluminum, hydrogen and manganese solubility, retarding plant root growth due to high toxicity (Clark and Baligar <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Singh <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Acidic soils have not only nutrient deficiencies such as calcium magnesium and potassium but also decreased phosphorus and molybdenum solubilities (Clark and Baligar <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Gray <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Alkaline soils are generally the result of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration, leading to low water availability and in common with acidic soils, nutrient deficiencies are found with decreased phosphorus, iron, copper or zinc for instance (Clark and Baligar <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). In similar ways, acidic and alkaline soils are generally considered harsh environments requiring a wide range of adaptations from microorganisms while acidoneutral soils are considered the optimum environment for microbial life (Fierer and Jackson <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Rousk <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>); such differences in soil composition are likely driving the observed differences in microbial community composition by pH range.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3"><title>Distribution of generalist and specialist taxa</title><p>Microbial communities are assembled by deterministic (selection) and stochastic (dispersal) processes. It has been hypothesized that communities primarily structured by deterministic processes will host more specialist taxa, highly adapted to the ecosystem, while communities influenced by dispersal will harbor primarily generalist taxa, more resilient to change (Pandit, Kolasa and Cottenie <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Graham and Stegen <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Sriswasdi, Yang and Iwasaki <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). While specialist taxa are restricted to certain niches, they can be locally abundant; shared taxa, or generalists, are distributed across many niches (Barber&#x000e1;n <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In most cases, specialist will be more abundant because generalists rapidly become specialists to adapt to their ecosystems, despite generalists having evolutionary advantages (Sriswasdi, Yang and Iwasaki <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, bacterial communities were specialist-dominated in acidic soils, generalist-dominated in acidoneutral soils and a mixed community in alkaline samples. The higher abundance of specialists in acidic soils (considered the harshest systems) could illustrate the need for environmental adaptations to survive in these ecosystems and suggests that deterministic processes likely structure microbial communities. Geographically, the first cluster identified by the Bray&#x02013;Curtis dissimilarity matrix (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>) grouped all acidic samples from northern Norway, western Greenland and Alaska, illustrating the similarities of their bacterial communities despite the large distances separating these locations, further suggesting the strong influence of selection over dispersal. The dominance of generalists in acidoneutral soils illustrates the lower environmental pressure to have specific survival adaptations and infers the dominance of stochastic processes in community structuring. Eastern Greenland, Svalbard and Iceland were grouped together by the Bray&#x02013;Curtis dissimilarity matrix. Geographically, these locations connected through the Greenland sea, a possible route of dispersal through aerosolization and long-distance aeolian transport (&#x00160;antl-Temkiv <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Finally, alkaline soils hosted a mixed community of specialists and generalists, suggesting the combination of both, selection and dispersal, in community structuring. The abundance of generalist taxa in alkaline soils, generally considered a harsh system in many ways similar to acidic soils, highlights the adaptability of generalists to a wide range of environmental conditions. Interestingly, the Bray&#x02013;Curtis dissimilarity matrix clustered the Canadian (alkaline) and Russian (acidoneutral) samples together. The Russian samples were on the higher end of the acidoneutral pH scale and the grouping of these samples illustrates the blurred boundary between acidoneutral and alkaline pH categories. While environmental selection may be driven by many variables, dispersal likely occurs via long-distance aeolian dispersal (&#x00160;antl-Temkiv <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4-4"><title>The importance of indicator taxa</title><p>The indicator species analysis determined OTU-pH range associations identifying different classes of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, primarily, characteristic of each pH range. The identification of abundant indicator species with strong habitat associations opens the possibility of predicting the presence and abundance of these taxa across the Arctic region. This is especially important for taxa such as Ca. Methylacidiphilum, a known methanotroph unlike others as it belongs to the Verrucomicrobia phylum instead of the Proteobacteria (Dunfield <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Khadem <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). While natural CH<sub>4</sub> emissions come primarily from wetlands, the identification of these phylotypes in acidic soils suggests wetland may not be the only major source of northern methane emissions. Understanding the distribution and abundance of such indicator taxa, combined with field gas measurements, may allow large-scale estimates of climate-active gases release rates in the region, from soils and wetlands (Wartiainen <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; J&#x000f8;rgensen <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>CONCLUDING REMARKS</title><p>This study investigated patterns in soil bacterial diversity across the Arctic and demonstrated that bacterial communities differed across the region. However, the dispersal range was limited to &#x0223c;20 m and the variation in communities across the Arctic was primarily driven by environmental rather than spatial factors. The key edaphic property influencing communities we identified was pH, in accordance with that seen elsewhere. However, 63% of the variation remained unexplained, calling for more in-depth investigations of the drivers of bacterial community structure in the region. We identified unique and indicator taxa closely associated to the soil pH. Finally, a core microbiome composed of only 13 ubiquitously distributed taxa was identified, highlighting the potential for endemism in the region. While this study brings a deeper understanding of Arctic bacterial community assemblages, this is also a baseline for future functional studies in the region, which will be critical to forecast the ecological consequences of environmental change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>fiz128_Supplemental_Files</label><media xlink:href="fiz128_supplemental_files.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from the European Commission's Marie Sklowdowska Curie Actions program under project number 675546.
