  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine fluctuations in power over a range of scales (a band), we used scale-averaged wavelet power which is a time series of the average variance in a certain band. Thus, the scale-averaged wavelet power can be used to examine modulation of one time series by another, or modulation of one frequency by another within the same time series. We have performed this analysis using online Matlab codes

Three ensemble members are available under this project with transient GHG forcing for the period 850–2005 CE. Since the changes in GHG before 1850 are small and due to natural causes we only investigate the period after 1850 when the GHG increases constantly. The PSA pattern is obtained through EOF analysis of the SON average 500 mb geopotential height in the Southern Hemisphere (30°S–90°S; 0°–360°E) for the period 1850–2005. Before applying EOF analysis the data is weighted with square root of cosine of its latitude. While all three ensemble members shows the similar PSA pattern in EOF analysis, only third ensemble member is used in this study as the increase in PSA activity, as discussed in the text, is most prominent in this member than other two.
