   <span class="bold">a</span>) First mode of Empirical orthogonal function (EOF), multiplied by the standard deviation of the corresponding principle component, derived from the SON 500 mb geopotential height (z500) over the southern hemisphere (30°S–90°S; 0–360°E) for the period 1850–2005. The pattern depicts the classical Pacific South American (PSA) pattern characterized by a high (low) pressure anomaly over the South Pacific during El Niño (La Niña). EOF1 explains 28.5% of the total variance. This plot was generated using the NCAR Command Language (Version 6.3.0) [Software]. (2015), Boulder, Colorado: UCAR/NCAR/CISL/TDD. http://dx.doi.org/10.5065/D6WD3XH5. (

   <span class="bold">c</span>) SON average z500 (m) computed over the region 60°S–75°S, 60°W–120°W (thin grey line) and its average variance at 2–8 year band (red curve) Note that the results are shown for the third ensemble member which shows the distinct amplification of PSA activity. However, similar spatial pattern and its amplification are also found in other two ensemble members of CMSE-LME project (Fig.
