 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine fluctuations in power over a range of scales (a band), we used scale-averaged wavelet power which is a time series of the average variance in a certain band. Thus, the scale-averaged wavelet power can be used to examine modulation of one time series by another, or modulation of one frequency by another within the same time series. We have performed this analysis using online Matlab codes
