 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The wavelet transform can be used to analyze time series that contain nonstationary power at many different frequencies. We use Morlet wavelet to decompose the time series into time-frequency space which enable us to identify the modes of variability and how those modes vary with time
