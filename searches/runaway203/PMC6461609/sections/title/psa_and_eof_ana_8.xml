  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/LME/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/LME/</span>). Three ensemble members are available under this project with transient GHG forcing for the period 850–2005 CE. Since the changes in GHG before 1850 are small and due to natural causes we only investigate the period after 1850 when the GHG increases constantly. The PSA pattern is obtained through EOF analysis of the SON average 500 mb geopotential height in the Southern Hemisphere (30°S–90°S; 0°–360°E) for the period 1850–2005. Before applying EOF analysis the data is weighted with square root of cosine of its latitude. While all three ensemble members shows the similar PSA pattern in EOF analysis, only third ensemble member is used in this study as the increase in PSA activity, as discussed in the text, is most prominent in this member than other two.
