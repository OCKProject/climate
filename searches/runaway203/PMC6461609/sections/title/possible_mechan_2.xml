 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compare scaled average temperature variance at ENSO band (Antarctic ice core and tree-ring records) with the GHG radiative forcing derived from PMIP3 model simulations of the last millennium

  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>). The increasing temperature variance at ENSO band is concomitant with the increase of GHG radiative forcing. The greenhouse gas induced radiative forcing (warming) could change the influence of ENSO on Antarctic temperature in two ways i.e. (i) changes in ENSO properties such as its spatial pattern, amplitude and frequencies and (ii) changes in the ENSO teleconnections to Antarctica. Model simulations corresponding to the time slices and the regions of our interest in the present study would have been more robust approach to find exact reason and unequivocally explain the mechanism for such changes observed in the temperature records which is beyond the scope of the present study. However, considering large number of studies based on the model simulations have already demonstrated how increasing GHG derived radiative forcing has changed the mean oceanic state and ENSO properties, atmospheric circulation and their influence on southern hemisphere temperature. In recent studies, the influence of anthropogenic GHG induced warming on the ENSO type have been examined based on CMIP3 and CMIP5 models

  </span> and found that the intensity of the central pacific (CP) type ENSO increases steadily from the pre-industrial to the historical simulations and the future projections, but the intensity of the EP ENSO decreases. Changes in ENSO types also affects the teleconnections features in Antarctic temperature as suggested in many studies

  </span>. Here, for an illustrative purpose, we have shown surface temperature response in Antarctica to EP and CP El Niños based two extreme El-Nino 1997/98 (EP type) and 2015/16 (CP type) when both occurred during the positive phase of SAM (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>). We observe almost opposite image in the Antarctic surface air temperature pattern in response to EP and CP type ENSO. Shift in ENSO type can affect the upward propagation of planetary waves into the stratosphere and induce polar temperature

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span> have investigated the response of the atmospheric circulation to an enhanced radiative greenhouse gas forcing using a transient integration of a coupled global climate model (CGCM). They compared zonal mean and sectorial mean (908W–908E) stationary Rossby wavenumber (Ks) for the periods of year 1860–89 and 2070–99 and observed that the zonal mean MSLP response to an enhanced GHG forcing has changed in the strength and position of this gradient (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8d,e</a>). This is also observed in increasing PSA activity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7c</a>) which is the results of rossby wave trains that generate from tropics.
