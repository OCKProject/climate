 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we used oxygen isotope (δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O) records of ice cores from East and West Antarctica (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, Table

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. These ice core records were chosen based on two criteria; (i) sufficiently longer records with a resolution of minimum one year and (ii) locations of these cores should come under the influence of ENSO and PDO. We found four such records of δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O from East and West Antarctica that are suitable for this purpose (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Most of these ice core records are obtained from reasonable high accumulation regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) and therefore provide resolution records at seasonal to annual scales. Uncertainty on these ice cores chronology ranges from ±1 to ±5 years over the past five centuries. Chronology of these ice core records and their uncertainties are discussed in the Supplementary Section 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>. The common time interval of the four records ranges from 1533 to 1993 CE and 1674 to 2000 CE for East Antarctica and West Antarctica respectively except Siple ice core (1674 to 1982 CE) from West Antarctica. Therefore, we considered top part (1983–2000) of another record from the Gomez ice core which is adjacent to Siple ice core and stack over the Siple ice core record to make it comparable to the time length of the other three ice core records from West Antarctica (1674 to 2000 CE). By doing so, we could increase the length of the record of common temperature signal extracted from west Antarctic cores and compare top part with the instrumental record of temperature available from the Byrd station (Supplementary Section 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Spatial correlations of ERA 40 Reanalysis surface air temperature with Niño 3.4 and PDO indices highlights significant (at 90% significance level) positive correlations in these two regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d,e</a>) and hence, it is expected that the ice core records selected for this study register the signals of ENSO and PDO.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to large variability in mean value of δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O records from one to another core, we have compared their anomaly records (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b,c</a>). This shows variability in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O records from East Antarctica is slightly larger than that of West Antarctica. This could be due to the fact that the core locations in the East Antarctica comes under the influence of more cyclonic activity compared to West Antarctica
  <span class="sup">

  <span class="sup">18</span>O records of Antarctic ice cores have been used extensively to reconstruct past temperature, however, large portion of δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O variability is still unexplained by temperature alone as other factors
  <span class="sup">

  <span class="sup">18</span>O values
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. To examine whether the secondary processes might have played any significant role to alter the climate signal of these ice core records, we compared δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O records with the snow accumulation records available in literature except for two ice cores i.e. Siple station and IND22 (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Overall, snow accumulation in West Antarctic ice cores shows higher accumulation than that of the East Antarctica. All records, obtained from these three ice cores from Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica, show fairly stable accumulation rates throughout the last nine centuries
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) whereas the west Antarctic ice core sites show relatively more variability. The accumulation rate and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O show significant correlations in some of the records i.e. DML05 and DML17 (East Antarctica) and US-ITSE-2000-1 (West Antarctica). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of secondary processes that could possible influence δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O-temperature relationship. In order to circumvent this problem, our strategy was to extract maximum temperature signal from multiple ice core records of δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O which would be more reliable and representative to the regions/sectors. In this study, we have reconstructed temperature records separately for the East and West Antarctica based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of these ice core records. The first component (PC1) derived from PCA is regarded as temperature which explains maximum variability in the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O records (See Methods and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). To confirm whether, PC1 is temperature signal, we have compared with instrumental record available from the Byrd station which shows significant correlations (r = 0.66, n = 45) (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). In case of East Antarctica, we did not find similar instrumental record in the proximity of the core sites for comparison, therefore, we used reanalysis ERA 40 record of temperature averaged across the region shown in the grid box (76°S to 70°S;12°E to 357°E); they show significant correlations (r = 0.53, n = 35). To translate PC1 time series into temperature record, we employed regression equations to the entire time series of PC1 of the East and West Antarctica (see Supplementary Section 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Reconstructed annual average temperature anomalies of East and West Antarctica range between −2° to 2 °C (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a,b</a>). Wavelet analysis (Morlet wavelet)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> decomposes the temperature time series into time and frequency space which shows significant periodicities at different frequency bands ranging from 2–64 years in both East and West Antarctica (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c,d</a>). It is noteworthy to observe the increasing trend in high frequency oscillations in 2–8 years band during the past two centuries; however, this is more prominent in East Antarctic record. Spectral analysis of the temperature records shows same periodicities in these two time series. We found significant (90% χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> level) periodicities of ~5.3, 7.6, 10, 13, 18 and 40 years in East Antarctica (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e)</a> and ~2.6, 2.8, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 12.5 and 40 years (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2f</a>) in West Antarctica temperature records. The common periodicities of 5.3, 5.1 in ENSO band (2–8 years), ~13 year and ~40 years are observed in both the time series. It is important to identify these periodicities in Antarctic SAT records and find their linkages to climate modes which are known to modulate Antarctic climate. The shorter periodicities in 2–8 years band is likely to be of ENSO signal whereas the longer periodicities in 16–32 and 32–64 years bands are likely to be of PDO signal. In order to confirm whether these periodicities in 2–8 years band in Antarctic SAT records actually represent ENSO signal or not, we performed spatial correlation analysis of mean annual temperature of East Antarctica (1959–1981 CE) and West Antarctica (1959–1983 CE) with ERA 40 surface air temperature (at 2 m height) and NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis SST (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) during spring (Sept-Oct-Nov), when ENSO signals are more prominent in the southern high-latitudes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Spatial correlations highlight the regions of significant correlations (at 90% significance level) in color band. The spatial correlation patterns in case of East Antarctica temperature show almost similar to that of the classical ENSO pattern in the Eastern equatorial Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b</a>). This indicates response of East Antarctic temperature to the tropical Eastern Pacific temperature variability. However, in case of West Antarctica, it shows weak spatial correlations in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c,d</a>). This could be because of influence of other dominant climate mode i.e. SAM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> and Amundsen Sea Low (AML)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> which are known to influence more over the West Antarctica and Antarctic Peninsular regions than East Antarctica. In case of East Antarctica, such strong and persistent correlations of temperature records indicate that the non-stationary oscillations in the East Antarctic temperature time series in 2–8 years period represent ENSO variability. The temperature anomalies of both East and West Antarctica show similar extent of variability in both time series (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). However, they do not show any consistent relationship at interannual scale
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. It is noteworthy to observe that both the records (East and West Antarctica) show discernable increasing trend since ~1950–1993 CE respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a,b</a>). The cross wavelet of these two time series highlights the highest common power at 32–64 years bands (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>) which is consistent with the observation of common periodicity of ~40 years in the power spectrum analysis (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e,f</a>). We also observe that the common periodicity with in-phase relation (vector arrow pointing rightward) at 32–64 years band which is restricted within the time window of ~1650–1850 CE. Further, the cross wavelet also highlights the increasing occurrence of high frequency oscillations at 2–8 years band since ~1850 CE (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). However, discernable increasing trend is observed since the beginning of the 19
  <span class="sup">th</span> century. These evidences clearly indicate shifting in dominant mode of temperature variability from lower to higher frequency band since the 18
  <span class="sup">th</span> century. To quantify relative changes in amplitude of these frequencies, we have performed variance analysis (see methods) for three different frequency bands such as 2–8, 16–32 and 32–64 years bands (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c,d</a>). The variance of the temperature records at 2–8 years band shows increasing trend since ~1850 CE, however, dramatic increase is observed since the beginning of the 19
  <span class="sup">th</span> century. The variance in the East Antarctic temperature record at ENSO band shows almost 2–3 times higher in the 19
  <span class="sup">th</span> century over the time interval 1533–1993 CE. This observation is consistent with the earlier reports based on model prediction
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>

  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. This increase is more prominent and systematic in case of East Antarctic records compared to that of West Antarctica. On contrary, variance at lower frequency band 32–64 years shows monotonic decrease since ~1850 CE (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c,d</a>). To confirm whether the temperature signal in this frequency band reflects PDO signal, we have analyzed an independent PDO index reconstructed by D’Arrigo
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Though multiple reconstructions of the PDO exist but they demonstrate weak coherence prior to the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. We preferred to choose D’Arrigo PDO index over others because it is comparable to our records in terms of resolution and length of the records. Power spectrum analysis of the PDO index shows dominant decadal periodicities of 11, 20, 28 and 50 years (Supplementary, Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3a</a>). Variance analysis of the PDO index at 32–64 years band also shows declining trend since ~1850 CE which is consistent with that of West and East Antarctica (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c,d</a>). The observation of decreasing trend in variance of these records since ~1850 CE further confirm that decadal variability of temperature associated with PDO has been declining. However, this is still an open question whether the increase of higher frequency oscillations is at the expense of the decrease in lower frequencies or due to the changes in their phase relationship since the beginning of the industrial era which requires further investigation. Since the timing of increasing trend of ENSO like signals in Antarctic SAT coincides with beginning of the industrial era ~1850 CE pointing towards possible influence of increasing GHG forcing in modulating Antarctic temperature. ENSO reconstruction of the past seven centuries (1301–2005 CE) based on tree ring records from the tropics and mid-latitude have shown increase in ENSO activity in the 20th century in response of continuing global warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. We have analyzed these tree ring based temperature anomaly record (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>) and compared with East Antarctic surface temperature. The wavelet and variance analysis of the tree ring based temperature anomaly record shows increasing trend at 2–7 year which is consistent with that of East Antarctic record (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b,c</a>). Therefore, concomitant increase in temperature variability at ENSO band since ~1850 CE found in both the records from two spatially distinct regions i.e. low latitude (tropics to mid-latitude) and high latitude (Antarctica) indicate common cause i.e. greenhouse gas (GHGs) induced radiative forcing forcing for such changes. However, it is important to understand how the increase in ENSO activity is reflected in the Antarctic SAT under the greenhouse forcing during the post-industrial era.

We calculated Pearson correlation coefficient of two time series in four different time slices i.e. 1900–1991 CE (last century), 1850–1991 CE (post-industrial), 1533–1850 CE (pre-industrial) and 1533–1991 CE (full period), taking into account the effect of their autocorrelation (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). This shows significant correlation (r = 0.433, n = 141, 99% significance level) during the post-industrial era (1850–1991 CE) whereas it does not show significant correlation (r = 0.075, 95% significance level) during the pre-industrial time slice (1533–1850 CE). This indicates modulation of East Antarctica temperature response to SAM and associated atmospheric circulation patterns during greenhouse warming period. However, it is important to understand at what time scale SAM influences East Antarctic temperature. Power spectrum analysis of Dätwyler SAM index shows significant (95% χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> level) periodicities of 2.3, 3.7, 14 years and 132 years (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). Further, wavelet coherence between the SAM and East Antarctic temperature time series highlight the phase relationship at different frequency bands (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c</a>). It is important to note that wavelet coherence does not show any significant phase relation between these two time series at ENSO band (2–8 years). However, we have observed significant coherency of these times series in other frequency bands i.e. in phase relation at 14–32 year band in the last century and 64–128 year band during entire record (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c</a>). Further, we have performed variance analysis of Abram and Dätwyler SAM indices in ENSO band and compared with that of East Antarctic temperature record (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6d,e</a>). It is important to note that variance of SAM records do not show discernable increasing trend in 2–8 years since 1850 CE. Therefore, we don’t find any conclusive evidence which can suggest SAM might influence in increasing variance of East Antarctic temperature at ENSO band.

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compare scaled average temperature variance at ENSO band (Antarctic ice core and tree-ring records) with the GHG radiative forcing derived from PMIP3 model simulations of the last millennium

   </span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>). The increasing temperature variance at ENSO band is concomitant with the increase of GHG radiative forcing. The greenhouse gas induced radiative forcing (warming) could change the influence of ENSO on Antarctic temperature in two ways i.e. (i) changes in ENSO properties such as its spatial pattern, amplitude and frequencies and (ii) changes in the ENSO teleconnections to Antarctica. Model simulations corresponding to the time slices and the regions of our interest in the present study would have been more robust approach to find exact reason and unequivocally explain the mechanism for such changes observed in the temperature records which is beyond the scope of the present study. However, considering large number of studies based on the model simulations have already demonstrated how increasing GHG derived radiative forcing has changed the mean oceanic state and ENSO properties, atmospheric circulation and their influence on southern hemisphere temperature. In recent studies, the influence of anthropogenic GHG induced warming on the ENSO type have been examined based on CMIP3 and CMIP5 models
