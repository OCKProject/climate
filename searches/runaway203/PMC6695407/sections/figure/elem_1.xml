  <p>Fluxes of nutrients and organic carbon. Fluxes of bioavailable nutrients and organic carbon associated with subglacial meltwater and ice discharge from (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) northern and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) southern hemisphere ice sheets at the present day and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) northern hemisphere ice sheets during Meltwater Pulse 1a (14.5 kyr B.P.). LGM extents of ice sheets in both hemispheres are indicated by a black line in the maps. Nutrient fluxes and their uncertainty refer to the following species: N = DIN + loosely sediment bound NH
   <sub>4</sub>
   <span class="sup">+</span> (also including loosely bound NO
   <sub>3</sub>
   <span class="sup">−</span> for icebergs), 
   <span class="italic">P</span> = DIP + bioavailable sediment bound P (MgCl
   <sub>2</sub>-P + NaOH-P), Fe = DFe (&lt;0.02 μm) + CNFe (colloidal/nanoparticulate Fe, 0.02–0.45 μm) + SSFe (sediment-bound ascorbic acid extractable nanoparticulate Fe, e.g., ferrihydrite), Si = DSi + ASi and OC = POC + DOC. All fluxes include minimum, maximum and mid-range estimates calculated from published estimates of the range of nutrient concentrations and freshwater fluxes. Please see
