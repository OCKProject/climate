  <p>Conceptual diagram of ice sheets in the global carbon cycle. The diagram indicates the potential direct and indirect impacts of ice sheets. (1) direct sequestration or emission of CO
   <sub>2</sub>/CH
   <sub>4</sub> by microbial activity in ice sheets, (2) burial of terrestrial OM exported from ice sheets by rivers, (3) emission of CO
   <sub>2</sub> by respiration or uptake by primary production in the oceans (4) export productionâ€“OM produced by primary production which is not recycled before it sinks to the ocean floor
