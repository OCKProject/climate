 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fate of legacy OM beneath ice sheets is poorly known because of the inaccessibility of the subglacial environment. It is likely to include erosion and export of sedimentary OM (e.g., from soil, marine and lake sediments) from the ice sheet, storage in subglacial basins and frozen bed zones, and active respiration via microbial activity to CO
  <sub>2</sub> or CH
  <sub>4</sub>. These greenhouse gases may be consumed by further microbial activity, transported in the dissolved/gas phases within a subglacial hydrological system or stored as gas hydrate in sediments (for CH
  <sub>4</sub>). Such processes of active carbon cycling create a direct link between ice sheets and carbon cycles of the atmosphere and oceans (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) and are explored in the following sections.

Indeed, where ice is warm at the bed and exhibits high rates of flow (e.g., close to the ice sheet margins), erosion rates could be considerable. For example, erosion rates of up to 0.6 mm a

   <span class="sup">

   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>
   </span>. For example, if we assume a subglacial POC store in Greenland of 27 Pg C (Fig.

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" href="#CR114">114</a>
   </span>. Future projections indicate that the total magnitude of DOC exported in glacier runoff between now and 2050 will be approximately 48 Tg C as annual glacier mass loss increases, particularly from mountain glaciers

   </span>. This increasing flux of glacier DOC provides a subsidy of bioavailable carbon to receiving streams, rivers, estuaries and coastal systems and will be disproportionally impactful in heavily glaciated coastal systems (e.g., Greenland, Gulf of Alaska, Patagonia) that are home to commercially important fisheries.

  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are substantial uncertainties regarding the magnitude of present day sub-ice sheet CH

Global subglacial methane hydrate stocks at the present day are likely to be dominated by those in Antarctic sedimentary basins (estimated at up to 300 Pg C as methane hydrate and free gas

   <sub>4</sub> hydrate reserves to destabilisation is high because of their predicted location around the continent’s periphery in sedimentary basins where ice thinning in a warming climate is probable. A priority for future ice sheet research is to establish the presence of methane hydrate beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and to assess its vulnerability to destabilisation in a warming climate. Clues to this may be found in the paleo-record and are discussed below.

   <p id="Par41">Methane hydrate (see inset image) is one of the three phases in which CH
    <sub>4</sub> may be present, the other two being dissolved methane and free gas. Two critical conditions are required for methane hydrate to form in sediments. First, saturation with respect to methane must be attained in sediment porewaters. Second, pressure and temperature conditions must be suitable for hydrate formation—where low temperatures and high pressures favour hydrate over free gas for the saturated phase. These temperature and ice thickness pre-requisites are easily attained beneath thick ice sheets, and recent work shows in situ microbial methane production in subglacial sediments

    </span>. Methane hydrate itself comprises a methane molecule surrounded by a cage of water molecules, creating an ice-like structure. In marine sediments, methane hydrate may occupy up to a few percent of the sediment porosity. There are three additional factors that favour methane hydrate formation beneath ice sheets: a small and finite sulphate pool in subglacial sediments (via oxidation of sulphide minerals and/or overridden marine sediments) that reduces the potential for methane loss via Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane (AOM), frozen conditions creating a seal over the ice sheet bed, and finally glaciation periods of 10
