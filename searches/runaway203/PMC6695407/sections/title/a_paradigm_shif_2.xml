 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1999, the first communities of microorganisms were discovered beneath a valley glacier in the Swiss Alps
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> driving a major shift in our world-view of glaciers and ice sheets as abiotic systems to extensive icy biomes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Microbial communities have since been found ubiquitously in glacial systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, ranging from sub-micron diameter liquid ice veins between ice crystals
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> to large subglacial water bodies, such as Subglacial Lake Whillans situated 800 m beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. The survival of these seemingly diverse communities is due to their adaptation to a unique combination of physical and geochemical conditions that are not encountered anywhere else on Earth.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, liquid water is abundant in ice sheets, generated by the melting of surface ice and snow and by geothermal/frictional heating and pressure melting of ice at the glacier bed. Surface melt is often widespread on the Greenland Ice Sheet and supplies melt to well-developed drainage systems at the ice sheet bed (where ice is at the pressure melting point)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. These drainage systems evolve seasonally from slow-inefficient distributed drainage to fast-efficient drainage (e.g., channels), with residence times shifting from months to &lt;1 day
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. In contrast, surface melt is largely absent in Antarctica, apart from in marginal locations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Nonetheless, the bed of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is hydrologically active, with subglacial lakes, swamps, channels and groundwater aquifers fed by the melting of basal ice layers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Water flowing in such long residence time drainage systems here may take years to decades to emerge at the ice margin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the sliding of glaciers over their bedrock generates very fine, highly reactive rock flour by glacial crushing and grinding. This is the source of a potent mixture of electron acceptors (e.g., oxidised forms of sulphur and iron such as sulphate and Fe(III)), electron donors (e.g., OM, hydrogen
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, as well as reduced elemental species such as Fe(II) in iron sulphide minerals), micro-nutrients and macro-nutrients, liberated by chemical dissolution. In the deep, dark and cold ecosystems beneath ice sheets, these rock-sourced redox pairs and nutrients promote the metabolism of a diverse mix of chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic microorganisms, able to fix and supply autochthonous carbon to the wider subglacial ecosystem. In Antarctic Subglacial Lake Whillans, a large proportion of phylotypes in sediments were related to chemolithoautotrophic species that use reduced forms of sulphur, nitrogen and iron as energy sources
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, as glaciers and ice sheets expand, they bury OM associated with soil, vegetation, lake and marine sediments. Furthermore, OM is deposited by aeolian processes onto the ice surface, originating from distant sources or from proximal surfaces surrounding the ice. This allochthonous material is supplemented by organic carbon fixed in situ by abundant autotrophic microorganisms in melting zones of ice sheet surfaces
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, and thus, influences rates of ice melting by surface darkening (see Box 
  <a rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec3">1</a>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diverse oxidising and reducing conditions evolve in response to patterns of water flow beneath ice sheets, from fast flowing oxic channels to slower drainage through anoxic or hypoxic sediments and subglacial lakes. These hydrogeochemical environments create niches for microbial colonisation and permit a diverse range of biogeochemical processes to be supported across the redox spectrum, including sulphide oxidation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>, denitrification
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>, sulphate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>, and iron reduction
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Well-developed hydrological systems, together with the release of icebergs via calving, create the potential for OM and nutrient transport out of the ice sheet and into downstream aquatic ecosystems (e.g., lakes, rivers, oceans). The release of fresh, buoyant subglacial meltwaters often some 100 s of m below the ocean surface at the margins of marine-terminating outlet glaciers also stimulates the upwelling of marine water and transport of associated nutrients to the ocean surface

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. It is this combination of in situ microbial activity, dynamic processes of meltwater export and glacial advance/retreat cycles that creates an active connection between ice sheets, the ocean and the atmosphere (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) and which we explore in subsequent sections.

     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177" href="#CR177">177</a>
    </span>. The melt zones of ice sheets are host to diverse communities of microorganisms that thrive during the summer months across a range of aqueous ecosystems including surface lakes, wet bare ice, snow and cryoconite holes (small cylindrical water-filled depressions, created by the solar heating of surface aggregates of mineral and organic particles and microbial cells, known as cryoconite)
    <span class="sup">
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178" href="#CR178">178</a>
    </span>. Bare ice surfaces are dominated by ice algae
    <span class="sup">
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179" href="#CR179">179</a>
    </span>, which are commonly green algae on the Greenland Ice Sheet
    <span class="sup">

     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181" href="#CR181">181</a>

    <span class="sup">
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182" href="#CR182">182</a>
    </span>. The activity of these microorganisms has recently drawn attention via the hypothesis that the biologically driven accumulation of OM accelerates ice melting, via its effect upon ice surface darkening
    <span class="sup">

    </span>. Net bioaccumulation depends upon the balance of CO
    <sub>2</sub> fixed from the atmosphere by phototrophs and CO
    <sub>2</sub> returned to the atmosphere by respiration, and is influenced by a wide range of physical and biogeochemical processes. Recent work on the Greenland Ice Sheet suggests that carbon fixation exceeds carbon consumption, making the ice sheet surface net autotrophic (i.e., a CO

     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179" href="#CR179">179</a>
    </span>. Autochthonous OM is supplemented by wind-blown material, which becomes biologically altered on the ice sheet surface by the release of exopolymeric substances which bind particles

     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185" href="#CR185">185</a>
    </span>. The direct impact of the bioalbedo effect has yet to be fully quantified. However, initial investigations indicate that algal abundance on Greenland ice surfaces explains 70% of the variation ice reflectance, suggesting a significant impact of ice algae on ice surface albedo
    <span class="sup">
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
