Disentangling the complex set of interactions between these future changes in ice sheet mass balance and the carbon cycle is a challenging task—measurement programmes typically cover short time periods (years) relative to changes in warming climate (decades) and there is a dearth of mechanistic models capable of simulating biogeochemical processes within ice sheets and their wider ramifications. In the final section of this paper, we draw upon the geological record to explore possible biogeochemical impacts of melting ice sheets in the past in order to provide clues to potential impacts in a future warming world. In doing so, we introduce potential indirect (ocean fertilisation) and direct (e.g., CH
  <sub>4</sub> release from subglacial sedimentary basins) impacts of ice sheets on the global carbon cycle during past phases of ice sheet growth and retreat during the Quaternary (Fig.

   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). There is insufficient confidence in past iceberg flux estimates from the Antarctic Ice Sheet to calculate LGM fluxes of iceberg hosted Fe. However, we know from marine cores that IRD fluxes to the Atlantic sector of the sub-Antarctic Southern Ocean around the LGM were x10–20 present day fluxes, which is consistent with more intense IRD fertilisation of sub-Antarctic waters at this time (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Together, these findings suggest that a combination of high ice discharge and slower iceberg melting due to colder sea surface temperatures
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158" href="#CR158">158</a>

   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Later during deglaciation, we hypothesise that warmer ocean waters reduced iceberg transport offshore, such that Fe fertilisation of the sub-Antarctic zone substantially decreased and that of the Antarctic zone likely increased (Fig.

  <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is difficult with the current data available to conclusively evaluate the role of iceberg-associated Fe in fertilising the Southern Ocean during the last glacial period alongside the more widely acclaimed dust. Certainly, the magnitude of present day IRD–Fe fluxes, when combined with the similarity in temporal and spatial patterns of IRD export and those for dust (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), suggest that IRD may play a role in the Southern Ocean fertilisation story and warrants investigation. Unequivocally solving this mystery, however, requires a multi-pronged approach. First, it requires parallel study of a range of marine cores over a wide geographical area of the Southern Ocean to tease out the temporally variable contributions of both dust and IRD to the lithogenic flux record. Traditionally, IRD is assumed to account for the coarser fraction of lithogenic material in marine cores, which is variably defined (e.g., 250 μm−2 mm
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158" href="#CR158">158</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160" href="#CR160">160</a>
   </span>). However, research on the grain size distribution of debris of glacial sediments, including those entombed in icebergs, often have an important fine (i.e., silt/clay) fraction
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163" href="#CR163">163</a>
   </span>. Thus, while the presence of larger particles (e.g., sand) in marine cores might point towards IRD rather than dust inputs, the presence of silt/clays could reflect inputs from either IRD or dust. Geochemical provenance studies may help elucidate the precise origin of the lithogenic fraction in marine cores
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150" href="#CR150">150</a>
   </span>, as may the use of biomarkers. The presence of n-alkanes derived from leaf waxes in the lithogenic material in marine cores is often interpreted as indicative of a dusty source
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156" href="#CR156">156</a>
   </span>. While it seems unlikely that leaf waxes are present in sediments beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet, the presence of these biomarkers in Antarctic IRD has not been evaluated. Finally, biogeochemical models have strong potential to reveal the magnitude of fertilisation impacts that could be possible in a glacial ocean via various Fe inputs, including dust and IRD. Model simulation of dust and ice sheet-sourced Fe impacts on Southern Ocean fertilisation and thus, productivity, have been attempted for a modern ocean and suggest strong influences by ice sheet Fe inputs

   </span>. However, these simulations have not been conducted for an LGM ocean. Part of the challenge of conducting such model studies is the grave uncertainty regarding potential Fe fluxes from the ice sheet to the ocean, which need to be better constrained. In summary, determining the role of iceberg-borne Fe in fertilising the Southern Ocean is no simple task, but has the potential to reveal powerful insights regarding the relationship between Fe export from the ice sheet (via melt and icebergs) and export production in the Southern Ocean, which may become more pertinent in a future warming world.

   </span>. Ice thickness reductions in marginal areas of the Antarctic Ice Sheet during the last deglaciation were significant (e.g., 300–800 m in East Antarctica

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>
   </span>. The potential impacts of such release events on atmospheric CH
   <sub>4</sub> concentrations are unclear, and are complicated by the uncertainty regarding the fate of CH
   <sub>4</sub> in marine waters (e.g., oxidation to the less potent greenhouse gas, CO
   <sub>2</sub>). For example, recent work off the coast of Svalbard has indicated that high CH
   <sub>4</sub> gas fluxes from the seafloor instead stimulate enhanced marine productivity, likely due to indirect transportation of nutrient-rich water and CO
   <sub>2</sub> (from dissociated CH
   <sub>4</sub>) from depth. In this case, the negative radiative forcing exceeded positive radiative forcing associated with CH
   <sub>4</sub> release

   <sub>4</sub> hydrate destabilisation on atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub>. If the CH
   <sub>4</sub> is released to the atmosphere during non-linear ice retreat, it could impact the effectiveness of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change emissions-based agreements to keep climate warming to a minimum of 2 °C by 2100.

  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The balance of evidence presented in the previous sections supports our opening hypothesis that ice sheets have an important impact on local, regional and global carbon cycles via a suite of direct and indirect effects. The estimated magnitude of these effects is summarised in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>. Sub-Antarctic sedimentary basins represent by far the largest single store of POC within ice sheets (6000–21,000 Pg C), and ice sheets may also contain significant reserves of climatically sensitive methane hydrate (500 Pg C at the LGM). Export terms (POC and DOC in runoff/icebergs) are comparatively small (&lt;10 Tg a
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) but have potential regional importance for marine and lacustrine food webs due to the high lability of this material. The important indirect effect of meltwater and iceberg nutrient export upon the carbon cycle, via impacts on marine productivity, is illustrated by modelled 100 s Tg C a
   <span class="sup">−1</span> of export production in the Southern Ocean associated with iron export from the ice sheet which reduces outgassing from the Southern Ocean by 30%

  </p>
  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scrutiny of the geological record also hints that these impacts were greater during periods of rapid ice sheet change over the last glacial-interglacial cycle. For example, a reduction in iceberg fluxes (and therefore, Fe) to the sub-Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean from 20 to 11 kyr B.P. correlates in timing with the increase in atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> recorded in the EPICA Dome C ice core (Figure 5). On the other side of the world, the observation of pock marks aligned to the position of former ice sheets are consistent with the release of CH
   <sub>4</sub> gas flares as the northern hemisphere deglaciated
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" href="#CR122">122</a>
   </span>. Despite these clues from the past, the impact of future climate warming in the Polar regions on the feedbacks between ice sheets and the global carbon cycle is highly uncertain. Predictions suggest that there may be increased fluxes of bioavailable nutrients to the ocean with rising freshwater discharge
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
   </span> and destabilisation of hydrate reserves beneath ice sheets as ice thins
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>
   </span>. These two processes have opposing potential impacts upon atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations, the former (nutrient fluxes to the ocean) acting as a negative feedback on warming and the latter (hydrate destabilisation) as a positive feedback. Discerning the relative importance of these impacts is hampered by a currently poor representation of ice sheet biogeochemical processes in global biogeochemical models due to gaps in data and understanding.
  </p>
  <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, high uncertainty surrounds the estimates in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>, and future research must address several notable gaps in our current understanding, and hence predictive capabilities, of ice mass biogeochemical response to future warming. First, the basal regions of ice sheets are remote and challenging to access, and all predictions to date concerning the subglacial methane hydrate reserves or nutrient fertilisation potential, rely upon models calibrated to observations either in the laboratory or on smaller, more accessible valley glaciers. Direct access and sampling of deep subglacial aquatic environments such as subglacial lakes and sedimentary basins is essential, complemented by geophysical methods from which sub-ice conditions (e.g., hydrate) can be inferred. This requires a technological leap
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167" href="#CR167">167</a>
   </span>. Second, a shift in focus towards the downstream impact of ice sheets will help drive new understanding. This should encompass research spanning the full land-to-ocean continuum, together with paleo-environmental studies that seek to detect past changes in the ocean and/or atmosphere systems in response to biogeochemical perturbations related to ice sheets. Large-scale uncertainty, however, still centres upon the fate of nutrients in fjords, beneath ice shelves and in nearshore coastal environments and in constraining changes to nutrient fluxes from glacial runoff, icebergs and via meltwater induced  upwelling as the freshwater flux increases. Last, coupled biogeochemical models, including feedbacks between the glacial cryosphere, atmosphere and oceans are required to test the sensitivity of carbon sinks or sources to changes in the terrestrial cryosphere. From a field where life was thought absent until two decades ago, the possibility for new discovery is immense, but demands creativity, tenacity and technological investment in order to narrow current uncertainties and to reveal the true role of ice sheets in the global carbon cycle.
