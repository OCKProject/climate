 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sedimentary OM beneath ice sheets which is not eroded and exported from the glacier system is available as a substrate for subglacial microbial metabolism. An important fate for sedimentary OM buried beneath the ice is microbial respiration to greenhouse gases, and specifically CH

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" href="#CR119">119</a>
  </span>. However, there is high uncertainty regarding the magnitude of sinks for the CH
  <sub>4</sub> produced, and how much CH
  <sub>4</sub> is oxidised to CO
  <sub>2</sub> before being released to the subglacial drainage system. This would reduce the positive radiative forcing associated with CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from ice sheets by approximately a factor of 20. In very long residence time (i.e., years) subglacial hydrological systems, such as Subglacial Lake Whillans, results suggest that most CH
  <sub>4</sub> generated in lake sediments is oxidised to CO
  <sub>2</sub> before reaching the lake water
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" href="#CR116">116</a>
  </span>. However, observations from the Greenland Ice Sheet indicate that if subglacial meltwaters/sediments are transported rapidly via efficient channels to the margin during summer melt, this oxidative sink is much reduced and lateral fluxes of CH
  <sub>4</sub> at the ice margin are high

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" href="#CR117">117</a>
  </span>. This suggests that subglacial hydrology is key in determining how much subglacial CH
  <sub>4</sub> is released to the atmosphere
  <sub>.</sub> This uncertainty regarding CH
  <sub>4</sub> export calls for wider study of CH
  <sub>4</sub> production and export from large glacier catchments draining ice sheets.

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are substantial uncertainties regarding the magnitude of present day sub-ice sheet CH
  <sub>4</sub> hydrate reserves because of the difficulties of accessing sediments in subglacial sedimentary basins. Global subglacial methane hydrate stocks at the present day are likely to be dominated by those in Antarctic sedimentary basins (estimated at up to 300 Pg C as methane hydrate and free gas
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>
  </span>). At the LGM, the global sub-ice sheet hydrate reserve could have been much larger (&gt;500 Pg C, 20% of the present day marine hydrate stocks), with hydrate also present beneath former northern hemisphere ice sheets

  </span> (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> for details and calculation methods). The vulnerability of Antarctic subglacial CH
  <sub>4</sub> hydrate reserves to destabilisation is high because of their predicted location around the continent’s periphery in sedimentary basins where ice thinning in a warming climate is probable. A priority for future ice sheet research is to establish the presence of methane hydrate beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and to assess its vulnerability to destabilisation in a warming climate. Clues to this may be found in the paleo-record and are discussed below.
