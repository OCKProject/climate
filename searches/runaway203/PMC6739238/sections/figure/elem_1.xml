  <p>The proposed steps for the development of storylines for biological invasions in the twenty-first century. For each step, the relevant tasks are highlighted. In addition, we propose a set of participants that should contribute to each of the steps (the left hand side in italics). For step 3, we show multiple possibilities for the storyline development, as is explained in the text. The darker boxes show the development procedure we propose as the most suitable.</p>
