  <p>The one-by-one mapping approach to establish the relationships among different sets of environmental scenarios. (a) The different axes represent three different sets of global environmental change scenarios (x-axis: shared socioeconomic pathways [SSP], Oâ€™Neill et al. 
   <a rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib79">2017</a>; y-axis: radiative forcing or representative concentration pathways [RCP], van Vuuren et al. 
   <a rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib116">2011</a>; z-axis: alien species scenario narratives [ASN]). The scenarios can be combined using reference assumptions described in the individual storylines. The mapping of different sets of scenarios provides information on their similarity and, therefore, how results from one framework can be linked to another. (b) A narrative comparison between the four hypothetical ASNs and the SSPs and (c) a comparison between the four hypothetical ASNs and the RCPs. The congruency between scenarios is bound between 0 (no relationship) and 1 (a perfect relationship), with darker colors indicating higher congruency between the narratives.
