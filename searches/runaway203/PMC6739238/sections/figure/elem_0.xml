 <div class="caption">
  <p>The key elements and key steps for developing a framework for scenarios and models of biological invasions. The figure is composed of a conceptual layer (circles) that describe the stepwise scenario development process from initial data assessment and mobilization to storyline construction, model quantification, and, finally, to full scenarios of biological invasions. The grey circle (top right) resembles the potential option space of biological invasions in the future and the explored space by four exemplary individual alien species scenarios (S1â€“S4). The boxes depict components that influence the development process or that might be influenced by it. The arrows between the conceptual and influencing properties indicate strong interactions. The grey dashed arrow and box represent the potential long-term aim of fully integrated environmental assessment scenarios including all relevant parts of the Earth's system.</p>
