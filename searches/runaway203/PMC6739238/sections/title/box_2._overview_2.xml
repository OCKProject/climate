  <span class="bold">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SDGs consist of 17 universal sustainable development goals that have been agreed on by 193 countries and national territories to be achieved by 2030. The SDGs are a successor of the 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) established in 2000. Alien species impact is addressed in the SDGs 14 (“Life below water”) and 15 (“Life on land”) that aim to “conserve, protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial [and aquatic] systems.” Both targets urge that “by 2020, [we] introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on the land and water ecosystems, and control or eradicate the priority species.”</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC, alien species are mentioned in several sections. For terrestrial systems (sections 4, 11, 19, 22, and 27), the IPCC mentions among the key risks to ecosystems and ecosystem services the “Reduction of biodiversity and potential losses of important ecosystem services. Risk of loss of endemic species, mixing of ecosystem types, and increased dominance of invasive organisms.” Similar risks are formulated for marine ecosystems (sections 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 19, 22, and 27), concerning the “Loss of coral cover, Arctic species, and associated ecosystems with reduction of biodiversity and potential losses of important ecosystem services.”</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CBD promotes sustainable development with a strong focus on biological diversity. Implemented in 1992 and signed by 150 countries, the later adopted Strategic Plan for Biodiversity proposes 20 biodiversity targets (Aichi targets) that are aimed to be accomplished by 2020. Aichi target 9 specifically deals with alien species, stating that “by 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled and eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.”</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)</span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The IPBES assessment that is currently in progress for the development of a first report on the global status of biodiversity is going to devote a working group to invasive alien species. The “Deliverable 3bii: Thematic assessment on invasive alien species and their control” scenario aims to comprehensively “assess the threat that alien species pose to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and livelihoods and the general status of and trends in impact of invasive species by region and subregion, taking into account various knowledge and value systems.”</p>
