 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biological invasions can be described by different metrics that capture different facets of the phenomenon (e.g., numbers, abundance, impacts of alien species), at different spatial resolution (e.g., from small scales such as plots to larger entities such as countries), and for different taxonomic groups (e.g., on the basis of data availability; Latombe et al. 
  <a rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib66">2017</a>). Different metrics can be considered suitable under varying scale and focus of the scenarios. Although most of the above-mentioned metrics are generally positively correlated with each other, there may also be substantial differences among the conclusions that can be drawn (Hulme et al. 
  <a rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib42">2013</a>, Jeschke et al. 
  <a rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib49">2014</a>). In addition, the response variable might change according to the specific target of the scenario exercise. Therefore, regional or local scenarios might be more focused on specific vulnerable areas (e.g., invasion risk of conservation areas) or high-risk species (e.g., the Invasive Alien Species of Union Concern as defined by the European Union).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent establishments of comprehensive global databases on alien species distributions for different taxonomic groups (e.g., GloNAF for vascular plants, van Kleunen et al. 
  <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">2015</a>, Pyšek et al. 
  <a rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib88">2017</a>; GAVIA for birds, Dyer et al. 
  <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">2017</a>; the Alien Herptile Database for amphibians and reptiles, Capinha et al. 
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">2017</a>; GABI for ants, Janicki et al. 
  <a rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib48">2016</a>, Guenard et al. 
  <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">2017</a>) and the temporal dynamics of alien species accumulation during the last centuries (Alien Species First Records database, Seebens et al. 
  <a rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib95">2017a</a>) substantially improved our knowledge about the spatiotemporal dynamics of biological invasions at a global scale. These databases for the first time provide a robust baseline for quantifying future scenarios of biological invasions. On the contrary, robust and comparable data on the impacts of alien species in different regions are still largely lacking, and in many cases, uncertainties in impact assessments are large (Simberloff et al. 
  <a rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib104">2013</a>, Jeschke et al. 
  <a rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib49">2014</a>). However, more recently, standardized assessment schemes for impacts of biological invasions on the environment (Blackburn et al. 
  <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">2014</a>) and on human livelihoods (Bacher et al. 
  <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">2018</a>) have been proposed that might gather consistent data for future integration of impacts into scenarios. Given these constraints on the availability of alien species’ impact data, we propose to concentrate, for the time being, on the change in number and abundance of alien species in regions as, so far, the most suitable and most coherent metrics for quantifying the ASNs.
