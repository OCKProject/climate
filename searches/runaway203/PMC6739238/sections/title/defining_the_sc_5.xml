 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scenario process starts by defining the scope of the exercise with respect to the overarching theme and the specific components of the system we want to explore. Setting a clear scope from the beginning helps structuring the process and defining main targets and outputs the project wants to achieve (Henrichs et al. 
  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2010</a>). In our case, the scope is to develop the first global storylines to derive robust future predictions on how numbers, abundances, distributions and impacts of alien species might change throughout the course of the twenty-first century (figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">2</a>a). These storylines are intended to explore how these aspects of biological invasions might change under different assumptions on how the global socioecological system and its components likely develop. In addition, this exercise is intended to advance invasion science by identifying key aspects of the system and emerging challenges in the near and distant future.
