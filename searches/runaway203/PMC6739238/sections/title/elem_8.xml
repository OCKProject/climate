 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To convert the aforementioned scenario storylines to quantitative projections, we need to use appropriate models. This is done by identifying the response variables of interest, the relevant predictor variables that produce changes in the response variables, and the adequate models to quantify the relationships between the response variables and the predictors.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biological invasions can be described by different metrics that capture different facets of the phenomenon (e.g., numbers, abundance, impacts of alien species), at different spatial resolution (e.g., from small scales such as plots to larger entities such as countries), and for different taxonomic groups (e.g., on the basis of data availability; Latombe et al. 
   <a rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib66">2017</a>). Different metrics can be considered suitable under varying scale and focus of the scenarios. Although most of the above-mentioned metrics are generally positively correlated with each other, there may also be substantial differences among the conclusions that can be drawn (Hulme et al. 
   <a rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib42">2013</a>, Jeschke et al. 
   <a rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib49">2014</a>). In addition, the response variable might change according to the specific target of the scenario exercise. Therefore, regional or local scenarios might be more focused on specific vulnerable areas (e.g., invasion risk of conservation areas) or high-risk species (e.g., the Invasive Alien Species of Union Concern as defined by the European Union).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent establishments of comprehensive global databases on alien species distributions for different taxonomic groups (e.g., GloNAF for vascular plants, van Kleunen et al. 
   <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">2015</a>, Pyšek et al. 
   <a rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib88">2017</a>; GAVIA for birds, Dyer et al. 
   <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">2017</a>; the Alien Herptile Database for amphibians and reptiles, Capinha et al. 
   <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">2017</a>; GABI for ants, Janicki et al. 
   <a rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib48">2016</a>, Guenard et al. 
   <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">2017</a>) and the temporal dynamics of alien species accumulation during the last centuries (Alien Species First Records database, Seebens et al. 
   <a rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib95">2017a</a>) substantially improved our knowledge about the spatiotemporal dynamics of biological invasions at a global scale. These databases for the first time provide a robust baseline for quantifying future scenarios of biological invasions. On the contrary, robust and comparable data on the impacts of alien species in different regions are still largely lacking, and in many cases, uncertainties in impact assessments are large (Simberloff et al. 
   <a rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib104">2013</a>, Jeschke et al. 
   <a rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib49">2014</a>). However, more recently, standardized assessment schemes for impacts of biological invasions on the environment (Blackburn et al. 
   <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">2014</a>) and on human livelihoods (Bacher et al. 
   <a rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib4">2018</a>) have been proposed that might gather consistent data for future integration of impacts into scenarios. Given these constraints on the availability of alien species’ impact data, we propose to concentrate, for the time being, on the change in number and abundance of alien species in regions as, so far, the most suitable and most coherent metrics for quantifying the ASNs.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predictor variables</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many drivers of biological invasions, such as land use (Hurtt et al. 
   <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">2011</a>), human population development (Lutz et al. 
   <a rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib70">2014</a>), and climate change (IPCC 
   <a rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib46">2014</a>), and their historic states have been reconstructed and projected into the future under different scenarios (e.g., the representative concentration pathways, van Vuuren et al. 
   <a rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib116">2011</a>, or the shared socioeconomic pathways, O’Neill et al. 
   <a rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib79">2017</a>). Key challenges are the identification of the relationships of these drivers with future biological invasions and the availability of data that represent proxies for the underlying drivers—that is, the predictor variables. Ideally, such data have to fulfill several criteria: They have an appropriate spatial and temporal (i.e., historic and current) coverage, they capture the attributes of the drivers essential for biological invasions, they have ideally been used and tested by other environmental change models (which, of course, does not apply for novel proxies of specific importance to biological invasions), and projections on their future developments under different assumptions are available (table S1).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although, for some drivers, all these criteria are met (e.g., for drivers of biophysical changes, such as climate or land use), for several others, this is not the case (e.g., political, technological, and societal responses to invasions), including some for which none of the criteria currently applies (a completeness assessment is included in the data set descriptions in table S1). Improving this situation will be highly challenging, because the indicators developed to capture socioeconomy, political governance, or societal developments often lack information particularly for historic times and projections of future development of these indicators are highly uncertain, if possible at all (e.g., because of high variability within and between countries and unpredictable future changes in society, politics, and technology).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyzing response and predictor variables with different spatiotemporal resolution and quality requires a differentiated identification of their relationships and interactions using adequate methods. On the basis of data availability and the understanding of the processes, models to investigate these relationships might be constructed through equations that capture the mechanistic understanding of the relevant processes (e.g., as are used in global circulation models) or could be constructed using data driven approaches that establish statistical relationships on the basis of historic observations (e.g., regression models). For long-term scenarios, mechanistic models are preferable, because they can more adequately display long-term trends and are more flexible to integrate adaptation or mitigation strategies (IPBES 
   <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2016</a>). Furthermore, mechanistic models can more flexibly capture systems dynamics, such that drivers or underlying mechanisms might likely change in the future, as is expected for biological invasions (e.g., Walther et al. 
   <a rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib118">2009</a>, Sitzia et al. 
   <a rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib105">2018</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drivers characterized mainly by qualitative or semiquantitative information (e.g., societal perception of alien species, beliefs and value systems) are often substituted by socioeconomic metrics resulting in a loss of valuable information (IPBES 
   <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2016</a>). Therefore, developing conceptual models on the basis of expert elicitation (Krueger et al. 
   <a rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib62">2012</a>) or using approaches such as agent-based modeling (Kelly et al. 
   <a rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib53">2013</a>) or social network analysis (Burt et al. 
   <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">2013</a>) might improve the understanding of these indirect drivers on alien species richness and abundance. When this is not feasible (e.g., because of abrupt changes in human preferences, Swart et al. 
   <a rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib107">2004</a>, or unpredictable shifts in international relations such as emerging conflicts, Chadefaux 
   <a rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib15">2017</a>), comprehensive storylines need to be developed and refined on the basis of expert knowledge for an adequate assessment.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Harnessing expert knowledge has been shown to offer novel and highly useful opportunities for classical ecological model development and can significantly account for model uncertainty and insufficient data (Krueger et al. 
   <a rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib62">2012</a>, Drescher et al. 
   <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">2013</a>), as is the case for developing scenarios and models of biological invasions. Especially, Bayesian modeling frameworks (e.g., Bayesian Network models) can account for highly heterogeneous sources of data and knowledge and significantly improve model accuracy (Ghazoul and McAllister 
   <a rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib32">2003</a>, Constantinou et al. 
   <a rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib17">2016</a>). Such models have already been applied in other fields such as climate change (Reside et al. 
   <a rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib89">2018</a>) and hydrology (Safavi et al. 
   <a rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib93">2015</a>) or for modeling socioeconomic (Dawkins et al. 
   <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">2018</a>) and cultural behavior (Shaw et al. 
   <a rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib100">2016</a>). A recurrent adaptation and refinement of the models in conjunction with the development of more balanced storylines will ensure a consistent advancement of either of the two and contribute to the successful implementation of the biological invasion scenarios (see the core element of figure 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More recently, models for predicting changes in alien species richness and abundance have been proposed that explore different facets of the invasion process and at different invasion stages (Seebens et al., 
   <a rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib98">2015</a>, 
   <a rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib99">2016</a>, Liebhold et al. 
   <a rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib68">2017</a>). These models already capture some dynamics for drivers discussed above and are valuable baseline models for further development and integration of other drivers into their conceptual structure. Nevertheless, model development in invasion sciences is still less advanced than that in other fields (e.g., climate change modeling). For example, current models still do not effectively include social, political, economic, or cultural factors relevant to the invasion process (Vaz et al. 
   <a rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib112">2017</a>). Furthermore, in many cases, we still lack a thorough understanding of the causal links between drivers and invasion success and how these might change in the future. For that matter, it would be highly beneficial to strengthen interdisplinary collaboration on ecological and socioeconomic modeling, as well as between different working groups on invasion modeling, model evaluation at different scales, and synthesis of existing approaches.
