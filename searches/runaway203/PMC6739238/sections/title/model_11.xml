 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyzing response and predictor variables with different spatiotemporal resolution and quality requires a differentiated identification of their relationships and interactions using adequate methods. On the basis of data availability and the understanding of the processes, models to investigate these relationships might be constructed through equations that capture the mechanistic understanding of the relevant processes (e.g., as are used in global circulation models) or could be constructed using data driven approaches that establish statistical relationships on the basis of historic observations (e.g., regression models). For long-term scenarios, mechanistic models are preferable, because they can more adequately display long-term trends and are more flexible to integrate adaptation or mitigation strategies (IPBES 
  <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2016</a>). Furthermore, mechanistic models can more flexibly capture systems dynamics, such that drivers or underlying mechanisms might likely change in the future, as is expected for biological invasions (e.g., Walther et al. 
  <a rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib118">2009</a>, Sitzia et al. 
  <a rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib105">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Drivers characterized mainly by qualitative or semiquantitative information (e.g., societal perception of alien species, beliefs and value systems) are often substituted by socioeconomic metrics resulting in a loss of valuable information (IPBES 
  <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2016</a>). Therefore, developing conceptual models on the basis of expert elicitation (Krueger et al. 
  <a rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib62">2012</a>) or using approaches such as agent-based modeling (Kelly et al. 
  <a rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib53">2013</a>) or social network analysis (Burt et al. 
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">2013</a>) might improve the understanding of these indirect drivers on alien species richness and abundance. When this is not feasible (e.g., because of abrupt changes in human preferences, Swart et al. 
  <a rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib107">2004</a>, or unpredictable shifts in international relations such as emerging conflicts, Chadefaux 
  <a rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib15">2017</a>), comprehensive storylines need to be developed and refined on the basis of expert knowledge for an adequate assessment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Harnessing expert knowledge has been shown to offer novel and highly useful opportunities for classical ecological model development and can significantly account for model uncertainty and insufficient data (Krueger et al. 
  <a rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib62">2012</a>, Drescher et al. 
  <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">2013</a>), as is the case for developing scenarios and models of biological invasions. Especially, Bayesian modeling frameworks (e.g., Bayesian Network models) can account for highly heterogeneous sources of data and knowledge and significantly improve model accuracy (Ghazoul and McAllister 
  <a rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib32">2003</a>, Constantinou et al. 
  <a rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib17">2016</a>). Such models have already been applied in other fields such as climate change (Reside et al. 
  <a rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib89">2018</a>) and hydrology (Safavi et al. 
  <a rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib93">2015</a>) or for modeling socioeconomic (Dawkins et al. 
  <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">2018</a>) and cultural behavior (Shaw et al. 
  <a rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib100">2016</a>). A recurrent adaptation and refinement of the models in conjunction with the development of more balanced storylines will ensure a consistent advancement of either of the two and contribute to the successful implementation of the biological invasion scenarios (see the core element of figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More recently, models for predicting changes in alien species richness and abundance have been proposed that explore different facets of the invasion process and at different invasion stages (Seebens et al., 
  <a rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib98">2015</a>, 
  <a rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib99">2016</a>, Liebhold et al. 
  <a rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib68">2017</a>). These models already capture some dynamics for drivers discussed above and are valuable baseline models for further development and integration of other drivers into their conceptual structure. Nevertheless, model development in invasion sciences is still less advanced than that in other fields (e.g., climate change modeling). For example, current models still do not effectively include social, political, economic, or cultural factors relevant to the invasion process (Vaz et al. 
  <a rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib112">2017</a>). Furthermore, in many cases, we still lack a thorough understanding of the causal links between drivers and invasion success and how these might change in the future. For that matter, it would be highly beneficial to strengthen interdisplinary collaboration on ecological and socioeconomic modeling, as well as between different working groups on invasion modeling, model evaluation at different scales, and synthesis of existing approaches.
