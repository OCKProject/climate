  <span class="bold">Driver, pressure, impact:</span> The terminology follows the DPSIR (driving forces, pressures, states, impacts and responses) framework developed by the European Environment Agency (

  </span>) that describes how societies interact with the environment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Integrated assessment models (IAM):</span> IAM’s represent a quantification of parts of Earth's system by acknowledging a set of interacting natural and social systems. These subsystems are described through different scenarios (see below) that provide the narrative foundation of IAMs. IAMs produce projections on how the system might change under different assumptions explored in the scenario storylines (see below; Parson and Fisher-Vanden

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Prediction:</span> A prediction is a numerical estimate of a specific output (e.g., alien species numbers or impacts) for a specific time point in the future based on a quantitative model and ideally associated with a certain degree of confidence or uncertainty (IPCC 
  <a rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib46">2014</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Representative concentration pathways (RCP):</span> A set of scenarios for climate change that include a set of climate forcing agents. The RCPs were produced in 2014 for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and are the successor scenarios of the ones used in the Special Report on Emissions (SRES). They act as the reference scenarios for different radiative forcing scenarios in climate research (van Vuuren et al. 
  <a rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib116">2011</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Scenario:</span> Following the definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scenario describes a “coherent, internally consistent and plausible description of one possible future state of the world.” Generally a set of scenarios is described to capture the range of possible future states of a system (IPCC 
  <a rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib46">2014</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP):</span> A set of socioeconomic scenarios first published in 2015 to supplement the RCP climate scenarios developed by the IPCC. They explore alternative pathways of global socioeconomic developments and aim to inform climate research about adaptation and mitigation strategies (O’Neill et al. 
  <a rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib80">2014</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="bold">Storylines or narratives:</span> The two terms are used interchangeably. They are the core of each scenario and describe the main characteristics, drivers and dynamics of the system. Furthermore, they provide information on relationships and feedback loops between key drivers (IPCC 
  <a rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib46">2014</a>). Prominent examples are the storylines developed for the “Shared socioeconomic pathways,” “Sustainability: Taking the green road,” “Middle of the road,” “Regional rivalry: A rocky road,” “Inequality: A road divided,” and “Fossil-fueled development: Taking the highway” scenarios (O’Neill et al. 
  <a rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib79">2017</a>).
