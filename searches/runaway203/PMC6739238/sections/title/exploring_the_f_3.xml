 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We present a conceptual framework for the development of scenarios and models on how alien species richness and impact might change in the twenty-first century (figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">1</a>). This includes two main tasks: First is the establishment of qualitative scenario narratives (i.e., the alien species scenario narratives; ASN) based on current and historic knowledge available to identify the relevant pressures that drive biological invasions, to identify their potential developments in the future, and to generate a set of consistent storylines about plausible trajectories of drivers and their effect on biological invasions in the future. Second is the quantification of pressures and impacts for these storylines based on the quantification of the effects of the drivers on alien species invasions in the future under different socioeconomic and biophysical assumptions. This work is the basis for the subsequent development of numerical models. For reasons of consistency, the development of such models of biological invasions should use, as much as possible, the output of already existing quantitative scenario frameworks (i.e., global land use or vegetation models) to numerically characterize the possible future trajectories of important drivers of biological invasions.

   <p>The key elements and key steps for developing a framework for scenarios and models of biological invasions. The figure is composed of a conceptual layer (circles) that describe the stepwise scenario development process from initial data assessment and mobilization to storyline construction, model quantification, and, finally, to full scenarios of biological invasions. The grey circle (top right) resembles the potential option space of biological invasions in the future and the explored space by four exemplary individual alien species scenarios (S1–S4). The boxes depict components that influence the development process or that might be influenced by it. The arrows between the conceptual and influencing properties indicate strong interactions. The grey dashed arrow and box represent the potential long-term aim of fully integrated environmental assessment scenarios including all relevant parts of the Earth's system.</p>
