 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Developing scenarios and models of biological invasions for the twenty-first century is an urgently needed but highly challenging task. The recent advances in data availability and the formulation of mechanistic models for individual drivers of biological invasions allow addressing this task appropriately for the first time. In the present article, we provide the conceptual foundation and a roadmap for the development of scenarios and models of biological invasions. This framework has to be tested, applied, and refined in future studies with the long-term goal to develop comprehensive integrated assessment models of biological invasions. Several challenges and key actions have to be solved on the way (figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">1</a>, table S2). First, more data needs to be gathered (e.g., through field work or modeling of historic driver trajectories), especially for model validation, and a comprehensive assessment of data availability, quality, and consistency is crucial. Furthermore, expert based quality assessment, evaluation, and refinement of the ASNs and the resulting models is vital. This can be achieved by establishing an ASN working group, including experts from various fields, that coordinates these tasks. Models need to be subsequently developed and improved to integrate crucial steps (i.e., integration of different stages of the invasion process) and identify underlying processes and mechanisms between alien species richness and impacts for the development of more mechanistic models. Finally, the ASNs need to be communicated to the relevant communities to build and increase the awareness regarding the necessity of integrating biological invasion models into existing models of socioeconomic and natural systems.

We believe that the ASN concept presented in the present article provides an important contribution for understanding—and proactively managing—the future of biological invasions. We simultaneously call for further work on each step along the process (data mobilization, storyline development and refinement, model construction, and initiative connection) to make it a fully operational approach that captures all relevant drivers of biological invasions. This will allow an assessment of the potential long-term consequences of human mediated species movements on the same basis as done for other features of global environmental change.</p>
