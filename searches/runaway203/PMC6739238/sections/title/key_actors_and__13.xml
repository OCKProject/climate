 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The establishment of biological invasion scenarios is a highly complex task that strongly depends on the engagement of different key actors who adopt different functions. These stakeholders necessarily have different backgrounds, including governmental and nongovernmental bodies (i.e., IPBES, IPCC, IUCN, and CBD), the scientific community, and other research institutes and stakeholder groups (e.g., Future Earth,

  </span>; the Great Transition Initiative,

  </span>). All these groups might contribute to different stages and challenges of the scenario building process (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">supplemental table S2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a coordinating umbrella organization, IPBES appears to be most promising, in the sense that it can provide necessary infrastructure, resources, and visibility across the scientific and political domains and might contribute to further capacity building. Especially objective 3: “Thematic and methodological issues,” with its deliverables; 3(b)(ii): “Thematic assessment on invasive alien species and their control”; and 3(c): “Policy support tools and methodologies for scenario analysis and modeling of biodiversity and ecosystem services on the basis of a fast track assessment and a guide” would be highly suitable for coordinating the scenario building process. In addition, the IUCN and CBD, global institutions with a vast network, existing working groups (e.g., the IUCN’s Invasive Species Specialist Group), and widely accepted agendas (e.g., the CBD Aichi targets), should engage strongly in the scenario development process. All three institutions—IPBES, IUCN, and CDB—are crucial players that align the scientific world with the political sphere and are therefore perfectly suited to host and support such an undertaking through their infrastructure and the provision of targeted funding for scenario and model development for biological invasions.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequently, we suggest that the translation of the scenarios to models and the model implementation and parameterization should be realized through a self-organizing scientific community approach similar to the one adopted for other environmental topics (e.g., climate or land-use change). Therefore, the establishment of novel structures, such as specialized working groups on different aspects of the biological invasions scenarios (comparable to the IPCC working groups) or the establishment of a model intercomparison project (MIP) as in other environmental scenario modeling communities (e.g., AgMIP for agriculture systems modeling (Rosenzweig et al. 
  <a rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib91">2013</a>) or ISI-MIP for climate change impact modeling (Warszawski et al. 
  <a rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib119">2014</a>), can be a valuable tool to steer and efficiently organize this process.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, the path has been paved to start and develop an open scientific community approach through a joint funding call by the Belmont Forum and BiodivERsA, which is targeted at the development application of scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services (
  <span class="italic">
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biodiversa.org/1400" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.biodiversa.org/1400</span>
  </span>). Among the 21 funded projects are two, “InvasiBES” and “AlienScenarios,” focused solely on alien species scenarios; the authors of the present article are involved in the latter. In addition, other working groups, such as the GEO BON working group on using an essential biodiversity variable approach to invasion monitoring (GEO BON 
  <a rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib75">2015</a>) or the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research working group sTWIST: Theory and Workflows for Alien and Invasive Species Tracking (

   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.idiv.de/sdiv/working_groups/wg_pool/stwist.html" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.idiv.de/sdiv/working_groups/wg_pool/stwist.html</span>
  </span>), have been established and provide a valuable baseline for the biological invasions scenario development.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We can not stress enough that such an undertaking will only be successful in a joint effort with high degrees of collaboration and knowledge exchange between researchers, legislators, and the general public. Given the already existing and emerging structures we are, however, confident that this will be the case and invite other groups to engage in this endeavor.</p>
