 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many drivers of biological invasions, such as land use (Hurtt et al. 
  <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">2011</a>), human population development (Lutz et al. 
  <a rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib70">2014</a>), and climate change (IPCC 
  <a rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib46">2014</a>), and their historic states have been reconstructed and projected into the future under different scenarios (e.g., the representative concentration pathways, van Vuuren et al. 
  <a rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib116">2011</a>, or the shared socioeconomic pathways, O’Neill et al. 
  <a rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib79">2017</a>). Key challenges are the identification of the relationships of these drivers with future biological invasions and the availability of data that represent proxies for the underlying drivers—that is, the predictor variables. Ideally, such data have to fulfill several criteria: They have an appropriate spatial and temporal (i.e., historic and current) coverage, they capture the attributes of the drivers essential for biological invasions, they have ideally been used and tested by other environmental change models (which, of course, does not apply for novel proxies of specific importance to biological invasions), and projections on their future developments under different assumptions are available (table S1).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although, for some drivers, all these criteria are met (e.g., for drivers of biophysical changes, such as climate or land use), for several others, this is not the case (e.g., political, technological, and societal responses to invasions), including some for which none of the criteria currently applies (a completeness assessment is included in the data set descriptions in table S1). Improving this situation will be highly challenging, because the indicators developed to capture socioeconomy, political governance, or societal developments often lack information particularly for historic times and projections of future development of these indicators are highly uncertain, if possible at all (e.g., because of high variability within and between countries and unpredictable future changes in society, politics, and technology).</p>
