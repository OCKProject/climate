 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are different ways to construct storylines on the basis of the previously defined subset of driving forces (IPBES 
  <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2016</a>). Storylines can explore a range of possible futures (exploratory scenarios; Kok et al. 
  <a rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib59">2011</a>), develop pathways to a specific predefined target (target-seeking scenarios; Alcamo 
  <a rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib1">2001</a>), or explore the effects of different policies (policy-screening scenarios; IPBES 
  <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, storylines can be constructed inductively, incrementally, or deductively (Henrichs et al. 
  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2010</a>, Wodak and Neale 
  <a rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib122">2015</a>). Inductive storylines are based on the description of individual events and likely effects that result from specific decisions made in the present. They provide a large degree of freedom to explore possible futures but, at the same time, are less systematic in their construction (Henrichs et al. 
  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2010</a>). Incremental storylines describe deviations from a most plausible reference scenario (i.e., business as usual). Such a reference scenario generally assumes that historic trajectories continue without dramatic or sudden changes and allows the assessment of how changes in system drivers lead to deviations from this scenario (Henrichs et al. 
  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2010</a>). Finally, the deductive approach uses a more systematic assessment of the range of possibilities on how the identified drivers are likely going to change future trends and interact with other aspects of the global socioecological system. That way, consistent logic of the different storylines can be identified providing a holistic view on the topic (Jaeger et al. 
  <a rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib47">2007</a>, Henrichs et al. 
  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A final crucial step is to decide whether the storylines should be constructed depending on already existing scenario frameworks or independently (Zurek and Henrichs 
  <a rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib123">2007</a>). Developing dependent storylines with strong links to existing frameworks facilitates the establishment of links between them and at a later stage to adopt the new findings into integrated model frameworks. However, these storylines would be constrained on the assumptions of the existing framework that might not consider all relevant aspects. Constructing independent storylines provides the freedom to explore different facets of the focal system more rigorously and in a way specifically tailored to the respective topic. These independent storylines can then, a posteriori, be linked to other scenarios (see below).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because no attempt has so far been made to develop global biological invasion storylines, we suggest to start with exploratory scenarios using a deductive approach to develop independent storylines (figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">2</a>c). The development of independent storylines enables the exploration of plausible futures for biological invasions without being constrained by already existing scenarios of other facets of global environmental change (e.g., climate change) that do not capture all aspects relevant for biological invasions. Descriptive storylines allow us to explore the future range of possible outcomes of alien species richness, abundance, and impacts. Only when we understand the interactions between the various drivers and how they influence the future trajectories of biological invasions can we then develop more focused scenarios that provide insights into how we can arrive at specific desired targets (e.g., target-seeking scenarios on how to achieve the goals of Aichi target 9 of the Convention on Biological Diversity). Finally, we suggest following a deductive scenario process to ensure the most systematic approach to obtain storylines through standardized methods and processes. This way, other working groups and initiatives can assess, reproduce, and extend the storylines in the future.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After establishing the conceptual foundation, the first ASN storylines can be constructed. We suggest using a two-axes approach (van der Heijden 
  <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">2005</a>), in which each axis represents one of the identified influential drivers resulting in a 2 ⋅ 2 storyline matrix for different driver combinations (e.g., social values versus trade, land use and land cover change versus climate change). The qualitative description of futures with a focus on the respective two drivers should also include an assessment of their impact on other drivers of the system and the implications on future biological invasions. Each of these two-axes approaches will therefore result in four comprehensive storylines of the future system with a specific focus on the two drivers on the main axes. Given the complexity of the topic (i.e., biological invasions) and the multitude of influential drivers, such an assessment will result in multiple qualitative storylines. However, because all of them consider the entire system (with a different special focus on individual drivers) the storylines will, in many cases, follow similar logic. Those storylines with similar logic and underlying assumptions can be aggregated into scenario families (i.e., archetypes) that have overlapping scope and describe similar potential futures (Hunt et al. 
  <a rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib43">2012</a>, Kriegler et al. 
  <a rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib61">2012</a>). This way, a high number of storylines can be condensed to a more practical number (e.g., 4–5, as was suggested by IPBES 
  <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2016</a>), which is essential for the communication of the ASNs to stakeholders and politicians, as well as for a targeted future development of biological invasion scenarios.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We acknowledge that alternative valid approaches for constructing storylines of biological invasions exist. Scrutinizing the validity and comprehensiveness of the driver assessment and storyline logic, as well as their construction process is crucial. Furthermore, there is substantial potential for future refinements and improvements of the ASN concept. However, we believe that the approach presented in the present article provides a useful basis for developing comprehensive qualitative storylines of biological invasions.</p>
