 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biological invasions depend on a range of different biotic, abiotic, socioeconomic, and sociocultural drivers (a nonexhaustive selection of likely relevant major drivers is shown in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">supplemental table S1</a>). Their importance, however, differs with respect to the spatial and temporal context, the environmental realm (marine, freshwater, terrestrial), and the taxonomic groups considered. Identifying these drivers and evaluating which might be most important for biological invasions in the future is a daunting task. Making use of available knowledge requires the inclusion of different experts (i.e., scientists, stakeholders, and decision-makers) with a broad range of expertise to ensure that all relevant facets of the system are addressed. Stakeholders can adopt different roles related to the degree of involvement and resulting responsibilities. These can range from mere consultation and decision support to codesigning or leading specific decisions in the storyline evolution (Volkery et al.

  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2010</a>). In addition, the expert panel should not only encompass various scientific and nonscientific backgrounds but should also be well balanced in terms of gender and geographical and cultural backgrounds (Hannagan and Larimer 
  <a rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib35">2010</a>, Krueger et al. 
  <a rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib62">2012</a>, IPBES 
  <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We propose that the driver assessment for the biological invasion scenarios should follow a two-step procedure that involves different groups of participants at the different stages. In a first step, experts in invasion science and thematically closely related fields of environmental change identify a long list of drivers, mechanisms, and pathways of biological invasions. Such an assessment should be done in a systematic manner using established methods such as systematic literature reviews, meta-analysis, or participatory surveys (e.g., Lortie 
  <a rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib69">2014</a>, Kuebbing et al. 
  <a rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib63">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequently, a scientist and stakeholder panel with expertise in the previously identified drivers should be invited to discuss individual features and trajectories of the drivers and how they interact (figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">2</a>b). Within this context, the drivers can then be classified into different categories to provide a more nuanced assessment on their impacts and how they interact. We can distinguish between direct drivers with immediate effects and indirect drivers with cascading effects (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity 
  <a rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib94">2014</a>, IPBES 
  <a rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib45">2016</a>) or between exogenous drivers, whose effects are beyond immediate human control (e.g., climate change, market or technology development), and endogenous drivers, whose effects can be mitigated by human control (e.g., species introduction or removal, land-use change). Understanding these different facets of the drivers and their interactions is crucial for identifying possible societal interventions, uncertainties, and thresholds (Henrichs et al. 
  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The process of driver discussion and prioritization can be structured by using a variety of different techniques that reduce the uncertainty in the assessment and increase reproducibility (e.g., Delphi technique, Okoli and Pawlowski 
  <a rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib81">2004</a>; fuzzy set theory, Kok et al. 
  <a rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib58">2015</a>; multiagent role games, Bousquet et al. 
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">2002</a>).
