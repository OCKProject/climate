 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our scenario ensemble allows us to assess how 2300 sea-level rise changes as a function of our scenario parameters. All other parameters being equal, median sea-level rise in 2300 is about 40 cm higher in scenarios that only stabilize temperature rise by keeping global CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions at net-zero levels, compared to scenarios that additionally reach net-zero GHG emissions and thus peak and decline global-mean temperatures (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). The spread within each of these two scenario groups is of similar magnitude. Since emission levels toward the end of the century are constrained by the Paris Agreement’s net-zero goal, near-term emissions (for example in the year 2030) become a predictor for 2300 sea-level rise. Higher emissions in 2030 imply higher long-term sea-level rise (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). A clear relation between 2050 emission levels (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>) and long-term sea-level rise holds for net-zero GHG scenarios. The net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> scenarios that have reached zero emissions in 2050 show a difference of 30 cm for median sea-level rise in 2300 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>), which is solely caused by difference in emissions before 2050. This difference reaches &gt;1.5 m for the 95th percentile (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4e</a>), underscoring the importance of early emission reductions to limit the risk of extreme sea-level rise. Furthermore, we find that a delay of global peak emissions by 5 years in scenarios compatible with the Paris Agreement results in around 20 cm of additional median sea-level rise in 2300 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). Based on the 95th percentile, we estimate that each 5 years of delay bear the risk of an additional 1 m of sea-level rise by 2300 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4f</a>).
