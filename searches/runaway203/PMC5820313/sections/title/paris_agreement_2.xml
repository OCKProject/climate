 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigate scenarios that achieve the net-zero GHG emission goal of the Paris Agreement and hold global-mean temperature rise at various levels below 2 °C (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>). We also explore scenarios that only achieve net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions, while still stabilizing temperature rise below 2 °C (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Throughout the manuscript, we discuss the results for these two subsets of our scenario ensemble. Our stylized emissions scenarios vary CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions of fossil-fuel use and industry only, and are otherwise equal to RCP2.6. The reduction rates after peak emissions (0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 GtC yr
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) are set to span the range between the minimal rate for reaching the Paris temperature goal with very early peak emissions and the maximum rate assessed in the literature
