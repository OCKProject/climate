      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, we link stylized emission scenarios that reflect the Paris Agreement
         goals to sea-level rise in the year 2300. Our results indicate that sea-level rise
         will continue until and beyond 2300 even for scenarios that reach net-zero GHG emissions
         in the second half of the 21st century. The long-term sea-level legacy under the Paris
         Agreement scenarios are strongly influenced by emission reductions in the next couple
         of decades because offsetting sea-level rise in the 22nd and 23rd centuries is hindered
         by its high inertia, low reversibility and the limited effect of net-zero GHG emissions.
         By combining climate and sea-level uncertainties, our analysis reveals a persistent
         risk of high sea-level rise even under pathways in line with the Paris Agreement.
         However, extreme sea-level rise projections at the 95th percentile of our distribution
         can be halved through early and stringent emission reductions.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our scenario set, we vary fossil-fuel and industry CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions to create scenarios with different characteristics. Climate forcers other
         than CO
         <sub>2</sub> are co-emitted when fossil fuel is burned
         <span><a>26</a></span>. We do not vary co-emissions in our scenarios as the difference through changes in
         co-emissions is limited given the stringency of each of our scenarios
         <span><a>26</a></span>. For the achievement of net-zero GHG emissions levels, residual non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions are balanced by negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions. Variations in these residual non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> GHGs could result in higher or lower rates of temperature decline after peak warming.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A model that makes the sea-level assessment feasible for multiple emission scenarios
         needs to rely on simplified representations of the underlying processes. This comes
         with a number of caveats. Our methodology largely builds on the link between sea-level
         response and global-mean temperature increase. It cannot be ruled out that such link
         is weak for some components or will get weaker in the future. We have accounted for
         the potential of self-sustained ice loss that becomes independent of global-mean temperature
         change in our parametrization for the Antarctic ice sheet (Methods section).
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the Greenland ice sheet, potential self-sustained dynamics are not included in
         our parametrization though feedbacks exist
         <span><a>27</a>, 
            <a>28</a></span> and their future role for Greenland ice loss is not fully clear. The melt-elevation
         feedback—lower elevation leads to increased melt, which lowers elevation—can lead
         to threshold behavior and long-term decay of the ice sheet, but it would evolve slowly
         under the levels of warming assessed here
         <span><a>27</a></span>. The melt-albedo feedback
         <span><a>28</a></span>—melting exposes darker ice, which absorbs more heat and increases melt—is not yet
         incorporated fully in process-based simulations. It is also not explicitly modeled
         in our approach and enters only indirectly through the calibration to recent observations
         of high-surface melting. Anomalous atmospheric conditions are proposed as the main
         cause for this recent high melting
         <span><a>29</a>, 
            <a>30</a></span>. This makes it less probable that future ice loss is dominated by the melt-albedo
         feedback. Our Greenland solid ice discharge parametrization does not account for ice
         flow instability. The potential for large-scale self-accelerating marine-ice-sheet-instability-driven
         ice loss like in Antarctica is limited in Greenland as it does not have large marine
         ice basins that are open to the ocean
         <span><a>31</a></span>. Warmer ocean temperatures will still affect ice loss, which is covered in our approach.
         Our estimate of Greenland’s solid ice discharge is above the range of ice-sheet model
         simulations, but these simulations do not fully resolve outlet glaciers dynamics and
         do not fully reflect the observed continuing solid ice discharge
         <span><a>20</a></span>. Nevertheless, the absence of feedbacks in the Greenland mass balance representation
         of our approach is a caveat and we cannot rule out that such feedbacks add to the
         presented numbers here. Changes in land water storage
         <span><a>32</a>, 
            <a>33</a></span> are not covered in our method as they are not directly linked to climate change.
         More details are given in Methods section.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some earth-system response features associated with falling global temperatures in
         net-zero GHG scenarios may not be captured correctly by the reduced-complexity model
         MAGICC. In particular, the hemispheric upwelling-diffusion ocean model may not comprehensively
         simulate the ocean response to sustained atmospheric cooling
         <span><a>34</a></span>. However, sea-level rise from ocean warming is calculated by the sea-level model
         and not directly by MAGICC in our approach.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the slow response to climate warming, sea level will continue to rise after
         temperatures have stabilized. Positive rates of sea-level rise will likely persist
         through 2300 even under net-zero GHG emissions and decreasing global-mean temperatures.
         Stabilizing global-mean temperature rise or achieving net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions can only be seen as a first step to halt global sea-level rise. Early peaking
         and stringent emissions reductions thereafter are vital and important to reduce the
         risk of low-probability high-end sea-level rise, yet insufficient to stop global sea-level
         rise by 2300. Delayed near-term mitigation action in the next decades will leave a
         substantial legacy for long-term sea-level rise.
