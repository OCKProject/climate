      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our scenario ensemble allows us to assess how 2300 sea-level rise changes as a function
         of our scenario parameters. All other parameters being equal, median sea-level rise
         in 2300 is about 40 cm higher in scenarios that only stabilize temperature rise by
         keeping global CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions at net-zero levels, compared to scenarios that additionally reach net-zero
         GHG emissions and thus peak and decline global-mean temperatures (Fig. 
         <a>4a</a>). The spread within each of these two scenario groups is of similar magnitude. Since
         emission levels toward the end of the century are constrained by the Paris Agreement’s
         net-zero goal, near-term emissions (for example in the year 2030) become a predictor
         for 2300 sea-level rise. Higher emissions in 2030 imply higher long-term sea-level
         rise (see Fig. 
         <a>4a</a>). A clear relation between 2050 emission levels (Fig. 
         <a>4b</a>) and long-term sea-level rise holds for net-zero GHG scenarios. The net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> scenarios that have reached zero emissions in 2050 show a difference of 30 cm for
         median sea-level rise in 2300 (Fig. 
         <a>4b</a>), which is solely caused by difference in emissions before 2050. This difference
         reaches &gt;1.5 m for the 95th percentile (Fig. 
         <a>4e</a>), underscoring the importance of early emission reductions to limit the risk of extreme
         sea-level rise. Furthermore, we find that a delay of global peak emissions by 5 years
         in scenarios compatible with the Paris Agreement results in around 20 cm of additional
         median sea-level rise in 2300 (Fig. 
         <a>4c</a>). Based on the 95th percentile, we estimate that each 5 years of delay bear the risk
         of an additional 1 m of sea-level rise by 2300 (Fig. 
         <a>4f</a>).
