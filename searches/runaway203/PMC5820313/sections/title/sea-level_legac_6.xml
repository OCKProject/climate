  </span>, which is at times referred to as temperature overshoot. The time of overshoot relates quasi-linearly to median sea-level rise in 2300 for net-zero GHG scenarios, adding ~4 cm of median sea-level rise per 10 years overshoot above 1.5 °C (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>). Net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> scenarios show that without balancing other GHG emissions through negative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions, median sea-level rise above 1.5 m is possible for temperature stabilization below 2 °C. No scenario in our set shows median sea-level rise below 1.2 m by 2300 once its global-mean temperatures pass the 1.5 °C level (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>, half-filled markers). Another way to look at overshoots is by considering the integrated overshoot temperature over time. When this overshoot integral is larger than 60 °C·yr (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>), the difference in year 2300 median sea-level rise between net-zero GHG and net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> scenarios disappears. This equivalence can be understood by looking at the characteristic temperature evolution in both scenario subsets (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement exhibit small but persistent overshoot, while net-zero GHG scenarios show higher but shorter overshoots. At an integral overshoot value larger than 60 °C·yr, the additional early sea-level rise pulse during the high overshoot in net-zero GHG scenarios cannot be compensated through lower rates of sea-level rise later due to declining temperatures until 2300. Only a limited amount of sea-level rise can be avoided through falling temperatures over multiple centuries.
