         <span><a>16</a>, 
            <a>17</a></span> to determine the climate system response to the net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> and the net-zero GHG scenarios (Figs. 
         <a>1</a>b, e, respectively). To cover the uncertainty, we sample from 600 sets of climate
         and carbon cycle parameters, which are constrained through past climate change and
         climate models of higher complexity. Scenarios not in line with the criterion of holding
         warming below 2 °C with a likelihood of at least 66% are excluded (gray lines in Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). The net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions scenarios show temperature stabilization (Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>). In these scenarios decaying atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations are balancing the evolution from the transient to the equilibrium
         temperature response, while non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> GHGs (dominated by shorter lived GHGs like CH4) are approximately constant and thus
         result in a constant non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> temperature contribution. Scenarios with net-zero GHGs result in declining temperatures
         (Fig. 
         <a>1e</a>), because atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations decline faster than in the net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> case, and all other contributions are kept the same
