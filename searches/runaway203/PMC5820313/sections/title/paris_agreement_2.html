      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigate scenarios that achieve the net-zero GHG emission goal of the Paris
         Agreement and hold global-mean temperature rise at various levels below 2 °C (Fig. 
         <a>1d</a>). We also explore scenarios that only achieve net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions, while still stabilizing temperature rise below 2 °C (Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>). Throughout the manuscript, we discuss the results for these two subsets of our
         scenario ensemble. Our stylized emissions scenarios vary CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions of fossil-fuel use and industry only, and are otherwise equal to RCP2.6.
         The reduction rates after peak emissions (0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 GtC yr
         <span>−2</span>) are set to span the range between the minimal rate for reaching the Paris temperature
         goal with very early peak emissions and the maximum rate assessed in the literature
         <span><a>22</a></span>. See Methods section for a detailed description.
