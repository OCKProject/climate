      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we assess the sea-level legacy of temporarily exceeding a 1.5 °C warming
         level
         <span><a>3</a>, 
            <a>23</a></span>, which is at times referred to as temperature overshoot. The time of overshoot relates
         quasi-linearly to median sea-level rise in 2300 for net-zero GHG scenarios, adding
         ~4 cm of median sea-level rise per 10 years overshoot above 1.5 °C (Fig. 
         <a>5a</a>). Net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> scenarios show that without balancing other GHG emissions through negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions, median sea-level rise above 1.5 m is possible for temperature stabilization
         below 2 °C. No scenario in our set shows median sea-level rise below 1.2 m by 2300
         once its global-mean temperatures pass the 1.5 °C level (Fig. 
         <a>5a</a>, half-filled markers). Another way to look at overshoots is by considering the integrated
         overshoot temperature over time. When this overshoot integral is larger than 60 °C·yr
         (Fig. 
         <a>5b</a>), the difference in year 2300 median sea-level rise between net-zero GHG and net-zero
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> scenarios disappears. This equivalence can be understood by looking at the characteristic
         temperature evolution in both scenario subsets (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). Net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement exhibit small but persistent overshoot,
         while net-zero GHG scenarios show higher but shorter overshoots. At an integral overshoot
         value larger than 60 °C·yr, the additional early sea-level rise pulse during the high
         overshoot in net-zero GHG scenarios cannot be compensated through lower rates of sea-level
         rise later due to declining temperatures until 2300. Only a limited amount of sea-level
         rise can be avoided through falling temperatures over multiple centuries.
