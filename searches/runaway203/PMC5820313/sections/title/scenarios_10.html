      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We construct our scenarios by modifying the harmonized emissions of Representative
         Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6)
         <span><a>11</a></span>. This is the only of four RCPs that is close to the requirements set by the Paris
         Agreement. We update this pathway with observed 2005–2015 fossil-fuel and cement CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions
         <span><a>35</a></span> and then modify fossil-fuel and cement CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions, while keeping land use CO
         <sub>2</sub> and GHG emissions other than CO
         <sub>2</sub> unchanged. The constructed scenarios, shown in Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>, d, vary in two parameters: the peak year of fossil-fuel and cement CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions (henceforth referred to as CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions) and the reduction rate of those CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions. We let CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions increase linearly with the mean 2009–2015 rate until the year of peak emissions
         (between 2020 and 2040 in steps of 5 years) and linearly decline emissions after the
         peak until net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>) or net-zero GHG emissions (Fig. 
         <a>1d</a>) are reached. Negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions compensate residual land-use CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions in the net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> scenarios and compensate land-use CO
         <sub>2</sub> plus all other residual GHG emissions of the RCP2.6 scenario in the net-zero GHG
         scenarios. For global-mean temperature and sea-level responses to the original RCP2.6
         scenario see Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a> and Supplementary Data 
         <a>3</a>. We here use the 100-year global warming potential (GWP-100) from the Second Assessment
         Report of the IPCC
         <span><a>24</a>, 
            <a>36</a></span> to estimate the amount of CO
         <sub>2</sub> needed to offset the other emissions of the RCP2.6 scenario.
