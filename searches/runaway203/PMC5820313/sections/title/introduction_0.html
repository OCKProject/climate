      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the 21st UNFCCC climate conference in Paris, countries renewed their global commitment
         to combat climate change and its impacts. The Paris Agreement
         <span><a>1</a></span> sets a temperature goal of holding the increase in the global-mean temperature well
         below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C
         above pre-industrial levels. To accomplish this, the agreement aims at peaking global
         greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible and achieving ‘a balance between
         anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the
         second half of the 21st century’. This balance can be interpreted as achieving net-zero
         GHG emissions between 2050 and 2100 (ref.
         <span><a>2</a>, 
            <a>3</a>)
            </span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea-level rise is one of the major consequences of anthropogenic climate change
         <span><a>4</a>–
            <a>6</a></span> and the effects of sea-level rise in its combination with storm surges and land subsidence
         can already be observed today
         <span><a>7</a></span>. Global sea-level rise consists of the sum of several components in response to a
         common forcing, and shows a slow and delayed response to today’s atmospheric warming
         and GHG emissions. Thermal expansion of ocean water, the retreat of mountain glaciers
         and ice caps, and the mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are the
         main drivers of sea-level rise linked to climate change. These contributors respond
         in different ways to a warmer climate, and all respond on timescales that range from
         centuries to millennia
         <span><a>8</a></span>. GHG emissions of today and of the near future hence commit the Earth system to a
         sea-level rise legacy, which will only fully unfold in the centuries to come.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Process-resolving
         <span><a>4</a></span> and semi-empirical
         <span><a>9</a>, 
            <a>10</a></span> assessments of sea-level rise under climate change predominantly utilize the RCP
         scenarios
         <span><a>11</a></span> and are often limited to the 21st century. Probabilistic estimates have been published
         for the 22nd century
         <span><a>12</a></span> and the importance of climate policy was highlighted for sea-level rise during this
         century
         <span><a>13</a></span> and until 2300 (ref. 
         <span><a>14</a></span>). A recent 10,000-year perspective of 21st century climate policy and sea-level rise
         <span><a>8</a></span> extends earlier assessments of multi-millennial sea-level commitment
         <span><a>15</a></span>. What has not been examined so far are the sea-level rise implications of achieving
         the Paris Agreement’s temperature and mitigation goals over the coming century and
         beyond.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We here explore the sea-level legacy until 2300 within the constraints of the Paris
         Agreement with a reduced-complexity carbon cycle and climate model ensemble
         <span><a>16</a>, 
            <a>17</a></span> and a component-based simple sea-level model
         <span><a>18</a></span>. The sea-level model accounts for new evidence showing a higher sensitivity of the
         Antarctic ice sheet to global climate change
         <span><a>19</a></span>. We calibrate the Greenland component to newer observations that include the recent
         years of high-mass loss
         <span><a>20</a>, 
            <a>21</a></span>. We apply the methodology of ref. 
         <span><a>18</a></span> without changes for thermal expansion and glaciers, which yield estimates similar
         to the IPCC AR5 for 21st century sea-level rise
         <span><a>4</a></span>. We find that sea level continues to rise in almost all cases throughout 2300, with
         sea-level stabilization possible but not probable under declining global-mean temperatures.
         In our scenarios, near-term emissions reductions strongly affect long-term sea-level
         rise as post-2050 emissions are constrained by the Paris Agreement.
