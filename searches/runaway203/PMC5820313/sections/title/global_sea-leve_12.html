            </span>. For thermal expansion, glaciers and the Greenland surface mass balance, the model
         combines the long-term sensitivity
         <span><a>15</a></span> of each component to global-mean temperature warming with the individual recent observations.
         Future evolution is thus constrained to both long-term sensitivity and past observations.
         For the three components, we use a pursuit curve approach, in which the difference

         <span>S</span><sub>eq</sub>(

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use a response-function approach
         <span><a>39</a>, 
            <a>40</a></span> for the Greenland solid ice discharge due to missing long-term sensitivity estimates
         or past trends in observations. This assumes that frontal stress release
         <span><a>41</a></span> and runoff lubrication
         <span><a>42</a></span> can be approximated as linearly depending on the global-mean temperature anomaly
         (ref. 
         <span><a>18</a></span>, equation 4). Both Greenland surface mass balance and solid ice loss are calibrated
         to new observations
         <span><a>20</a>, 
            <a>21</a></span>. To cover the recently proposed increased sensitivity of the Antarctic ice sheet
         to global warming
         <span><a>19</a></span>, we update our method to capture the corresponding Antarctic sea-level contribution.
         We utilize a parametrization that combines a slow and gradual response to global warming
         with a fast discharge term that mimics ice instability
         <span><a>38</a></span>. The parametrization has four free parameters that include a threshold temperature
         and a rate for fast discharge. Fast discharge contributes to sea-level rise once the
         threshold temperature is passed. We create a 29-member ensemble of the four-parameter
         set by calibrating our parametrization to the response of each ensemble member available
         from ref. 
         <span><a>19</a></span> for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios simultaneously.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The long response times of ice sheets, glaciers and ocean make it probable that a
         fraction of their contribution originates from their ongoing adaptation to past climate
         change, i.e., the little or the last ice age
         <span><a>5</a>, 
            <a>6</a>, 
            <a>10</a>, 
            <a>43</a></span>. Only for glaciers we are able to explicitly incorporate such a natural fraction,
         which is declining and below 30% at present
         <span><a>43</a></span>. We do not include changes in land water storage as climate mainly influences its
         decadal variability
         <span><a>44</a></span> and not its long-term trend. Direct human influence on land water storage through
         groundwater pumping
         <span><a>33</a>, 
            <a>45</a></span> and dam building
         <span><a>32</a></span> cannot be linked to global climate change and would thus unnecessarily blur our analysis.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our aggregate uncertainty estimates are based on Monte-Carlo sampling: for each sea-level
         contribution, we draw from the calibrated sets of sea-level functions, which incorporate
         the different observational datasets and long-term estimates, and from the 29 calibrated
         parameter sets of the Antarctic component. We drive the selected sea-level functions
         with a global-mean temperature pathway, randomly drawn from the 600 member global-mean
         temperature ensemble for a specific scenario. The sampling is repeated 10000 times.
