 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We construct our scenarios by modifying the harmonized emissions of Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. This is the only of four RCPs that is close to the requirements set by the Paris Agreement. We update this pathway with observed 2005–2015 fossil-fuel and cement CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> and then modify fossil-fuel and cement CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions, while keeping land use CO
  <sub>2</sub> and GHG emissions other than CO
  <sub>2</sub> unchanged. The constructed scenarios, shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, d, vary in two parameters: the peak year of fossil-fuel and cement CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions (henceforth referred to as CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions) and the reduction rate of those CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. We let CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions increase linearly with the mean 2009–2015 rate until the year of peak emissions (between 2020 and 2040 in steps of 5 years) and linearly decline emissions after the peak until net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) or net-zero GHG emissions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>) are reached. Negative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions compensate residual land-use CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions in the net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> scenarios and compensate land-use CO
  <sub>2</sub> plus all other residual GHG emissions of the RCP2.6 scenario in the net-zero GHG scenarios. For global-mean temperature and sea-level responses to the original RCP2.6 scenario see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> and Supplementary Data 
  <a rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM6">3</a>. We here use the 100-year global warming potential (GWP-100) from the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC

  </span> to estimate the amount of CO
  <sub>2</sub> needed to offset the other emissions of the RCP2.6 scenario.
