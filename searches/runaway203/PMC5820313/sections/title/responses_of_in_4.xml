  <sub>2</sub> (temperature stabilization) scenarios are displayed in Fig.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, the low-probability high-end estimate is dominated by the ice sheets. A 3 m contribution from Antarctica cannot be ruled out for our warmest scenario, which achieves temperature stabilization through net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub>, peaks emissions in year 2035 and thereafter follows a reduction rate of 0.7 GtC yr
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. This is &gt;2 m above the most stringent temperature stabilization scenario in our set with peak year 2020 and subsequent reduction rate of 0.7 GtC yr
  <span class="sup">−2</span> (Supplementary Data 
  <a rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM7">4</a>). A negative Antarctic contribution is not probable but possible under temperature stabilization. In contrast, thermal expansion, mountain glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet continue to add to sea-level rise under temperature stabilization (see also Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Under the Paris Agreement’s net-zero GHG constraint and the implied declining global-mean temperatures, all contributions except Greenland can stabilize during the 22nd century (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). Thermal expansion, mountain glaciers and the Antarctic ice sheet can contribute negatively toward the end of the 22nd century in our model, but only the Antarctic contribution can be significantly negative. See Methods section for more details on the responses of the individual components, including a comparison to results from more comprehensive models. Percentile estimates for each sea-level component response to each net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> and net-zero GHG scenario are provided as Supplementary Data
