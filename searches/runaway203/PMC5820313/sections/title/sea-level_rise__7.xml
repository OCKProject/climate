 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our approach allows to link long-term sea-level rise to 2030 emission levels, the current maximum time frame for the NDCs under the Paris Agreement. The NDC emissions aggregated for all countries are estimated to result in a range from 49 to 58 Gt CO

  <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">1</a>). Median sea-level rise in 2300 for the four net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> scenarios consistent with the NDCs is between 145 and 164 cm. The four net-zero GHG scenarios consistent with the NDCs show a median sea-level rise in 2300 between 105 and 123 cm. Our 95th percentile estimates indicate a risk of sea-level rise between 4.1 m and 4.8 m for the four NDC-consistent net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> scenarios and between 2.3 and 3 m for the four NDC-consistent net-zero GHG scenarios (Supplementary Data 
  <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">2</a>). These NDC sea-level estimates rely on stylized emission pathways that successfully reach either net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub> or net-zero GHG emissions in the 21st century based on very ambitious annual reduction rates after 2030. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) suggest that 2030 emission levels implied by current NDCs need to be brought down substantially to achieve the Paris Agreement mitigation and long-term temperature goal
