      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Responses of individual sea-level components</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The four individual sea-level rise contributions for net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> (temperature stabilization) scenarios are displayed in Fig. 
         <a>2</a>. The median contributions have the same order of magnitude. Due to the high sensitivity
         to global temperature change of the Antarctic component
         <span><a>19</a></span>, the low-probability high-end estimate is dominated by the ice sheets. A 3 m contribution
         from Antarctica cannot be ruled out for our warmest scenario, which achieves temperature
         stabilization through net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>, peaks emissions in year 2035 and thereafter follows a reduction rate of 0.7 GtC yr
         <span>−2</span>. This is &gt;2 m above the most stringent temperature stabilization scenario in our
         set with peak year 2020 and subsequent reduction rate of 0.7 GtC yr
         <span>−2</span> (Supplementary Data 
         <a>4</a>). A negative Antarctic contribution is not probable but possible under temperature
         stabilization. In contrast, thermal expansion, mountain glaciers and the Greenland
         ice sheet continue to add to sea-level rise under temperature stabilization (see also
         Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). Under the Paris Agreement’s net-zero GHG constraint and the implied declining global-mean
         temperatures, all contributions except Greenland can stabilize during the 22nd century
         (Fig. 
         <a>3</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). Thermal expansion, mountain glaciers and the Antarctic ice sheet can contribute
         negatively toward the end of the 22nd century in our model, but only the Antarctic
         contribution can be significantly negative. See Methods section for more details on
         the responses of the individual components, including a comparison to results from
         more comprehensive models. Percentile estimates for each sea-level component response
         to each net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> and net-zero GHG scenario are provided as Supplementary Data 
         <a>4</a>.
