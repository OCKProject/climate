            In the model of ref.

            temperature increase over Greenland (their Fig.

            <span><a>55</a></span>, the ice loss through this feedback has been estimated to be between 3.6 and 16%
            of the forcing-driven ice loss in 2200 (ref. 
            <span><a>56</a></span>). Relating this fraction to our scenarios with lower warming is however not straightforward.
            Still, both ref.

            sufficiently large to dismiss or invalidate our approach on the timescales and warming
            levels assessed here. In three recent publications process-based ice sheet models
            have been used to project future Greenland ice loss. Ref.

            <span><a>52</a></span> find 10 cm surface mass balance contribution from Greenland until 2100 under the
            RCP4.5 scenario. Ref. 
            <span><a>57</a></span> find 4 (2–6) cm for the same scenario until 2100. The melt-albedo feedback
            <span><a>28</a></span> is not fully integrated in these studies and may render these model results too low.
            This feedback has a physical (less snow and more bare ice absorb more radiation) and
            a biological component (wetter conditions allow more ice surface algae growth
            <span><a>30</a>,

            Greenland ice loss while fully including this feedback. Ref.

            for the end of the century, and therewith highlighted that models are still incomplete
            for such projections. Assuming that yearly repeated 2012 conditions can be used as
            an upper bound for climate scenarios that stay below 2 °C, the upper bound of 670
            Gt mass loss in 2012 would lead to 56 cm sea-level rise when summed up for 300 years.
            This is about 13 cm above our 95th percentile surface mass balance estimate for Greenland
            for RCP2.6. If the melt-albedo feedback becomes a major driver of Greenland ice loss,
            these values could be exceeded. Research however now suggests that while the melt-albedo
            feedback enhances the ice loss, changes in the atmospheric circulation are the ultimate
            driver of the high melting in recent years
            <span><a>29</a>, 
               <a>30</a></span>. A runaway feedback between atmospheric changes and the Greenland melt is not evident,
            which makes a self-sustained ice sheet collapse (as compared to climate-forcing driven
            collapse) less probable. Median sea-level rise from the combined Greenland surface
            mass balance and solid ice discharge ranges from 45 to 61 cm in 2300 for our net-zero
            CO
            <sub>2</sub> scenarios and 32–48 cm for net-zero GHG scenarios (Supplementary Data 
            <a>4</a>).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antarctic ice sheet: We apply a parametrization for Antarctic mass loss
            <span><a>38</a></span>, which incorporates increased sensitivity to global warming through two newly proposed
            instability mechanisms
            <span><a>59</a></span>. The mechanisms suggest a tight link between future atmospheric warming and Antarctic
            ice discharge
            <span><a>19</a></span>. The discharge thus also depends on the emission scenario. Our parametrization is
            calibrated to the results of ref. 
            <span><a>19</a></span> and combines a slow and gradual response to global warming with a fast discharge
            term that mimics ice instability. Once a trigger temperature of 1.9–3.2 °C global-mean
            temperature rise is reached, the fast discharge adds to sea-level rise at a constant
            rate of 2–20 mm per year. Technical details are available at 
            <span>https://github.com/matthiasmengel/fast_ant_sid</span>. Median sea-level rise from the Antarctic ice sheet ranges from 13 to 36 cm in 2300
            for our net-zero CO
            <sub>2</sub> scenarios and 4–19 cm for net-zero GHG scenarios (Supplementary Data

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ice sheet loss through the marine ice-sheet instability, which is initiated by warmer
            ocean waters, may not be fully covered by our method. Such instability may already
            be underway in West Antarctica
            <span><a>60</a>–
               <a>62</a></span>. The instability is difficult to directly link to anthropogenic climate change. While
            ref. 
            <span><a>62</a></span> does not provide rates of sea level rise for the main phase of the collapse, simulations
            for West Antarctica as a whole indicate an upper bound of 5 cm in the first 200 years
            <span><a>63</a></span>. The risk of ocean-driven marine-ice-sheet instability hence increases uncertainty
            in future sea level rise, but the numbers available from process-based simulations
            suggest a minor role for the timescale considered here. Once triggered and independent
            of the forcing, it would not affect relative changes between scenarios.
