 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Possible changes in UV radiation during summer are most relevant from an environmental and health perspective. In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, we compare measured, calculated, and projected UVIs for summer at all 17 sites in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. The figure shows that the World Avoided trends depend greatly on latitude and that differences between the two model runs are also latitude-dependent. For example, at latitude 40°N, there is close agreement between the two models (for other seasons, see Supplementary Data).

    <p>Comparison of normalized UVI ratios for summer months at all sites between measurements, calculations for clear skies based on the ozone assimilation, and clear-sky models for the World Avoided and World Expected scenarios. Note that the vertical axis scale varies between panels.</p>

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the exception of Hoher Sonnblick, the measured data from all sites closely match the calculated values and are much closer to the World Expected curves than the World Avoided curves. However, there is a significant divergence between the measured values and World Expected values at higher latitudes: measured and calculated UVI ratios are more or less constant over time while the World Expected curves have a broad maximum during the first decade of the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century (last two panels of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). This suggests that the impact of the large spring-time ozone depletions persists for too long into the following summer in the model. This is a well-known limitation of CCMs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> for which the causes are not fully understood, and is an area of current research.
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The measurements at Hoher Sonnblick (Panel f) show a continuation of the previously reported upward trend in summertime UVI
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>, which was attributed to changes in aerosols or cloud cover. This increase is not present in all seasons, so it is not a calibration artefact. However, there are several seasonal gaps in the data, and the year-to-year variability is also much greater at this mountainous site (see Supplementary Data), possibly due to variable snow cover.
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At some other sites, the length of the time series is too short for reliable trend estimates. Only nine of the 17 sites have more than 20 years of data coverage.</p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> also indicates that UVI ratios calculated from the assimilated ozone data are generally less than unity prior to the 1990s and before the start of UV measurements. The slope in the calculated data is generally consistent with the slope in the datasets of the three CCM models. These model calculations imply that considerable changes in summer UVI occurred between 1978 and 1990 (about 5% at northern mid-latitude sites, up to 10% at southern mid-latitude sites and up to 20% at the three Antarctic sites). However, direct UVI observations needed to confirm these changes do not exist.
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After accounting for differences in elevation between the sites, we note that latitude-for-latitude, the mean summer UVI values tend to be larger at the southern hemisphere (SH) sites compared with the northern hemisphere (NH) sites, as has been predicted and observed previously
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. This NH/SH difference is as expected. For example, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows that at 45°S, the peak UVI value is larger than at 45°N by approximately 13%. Approximately half of this difference is due to ozone differences and half is due to Sun-Earth separation differences. The much larger NH/SH differences reported in the past

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span> also include effects of clouds and aerosols, which were not considered in the CCM calculations. The NH/SH asymmetry is projected to be only slightly smaller by year 2100.
