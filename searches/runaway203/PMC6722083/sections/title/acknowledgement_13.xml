 <p>The number of people involved with maintaining measurements at the various sites is too large for them to be named individually, but we gratefully acknowledge the long-term contribution from Michael Kotkamp from NIWA Lauder, who has been responsible for maintaining data quality and archival of data from all the “NIWA” instrumented sites for more than 25 years. We also thank Dan Smale for generating the 5D TUV lookup tables, and Stefan Seckmeyer for the IDL code to interpolate them. This work was supported by NIWA as part of its government-funded core research. The authors wish to acknowledge the use of New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI) high performance computing facilities, consulting support and/or training services as part of this research. New Zealand’s national facilities are provided by NeSI and funded jointly by NeSI’s collaborator institutions and through the Ministry of Business, Innovation &amp; Employment’s Research Infrastructure programme.
