 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We complement these measurements with projections from chemistry-climate models (CCMs), representing either the “World Avoided” or “World Expected” scenario. In the World Avoided scenario, the concentration of ozone-depleting substances continues unabated without being controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In contrast, the World Expected scenario simulates changes in ozone resulting from curbing ozone-depleting substances in full compliance with the Montreal Protocol

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All CCM model projections must assume a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) usually consider four pathways called RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, which are labelled according to the projected radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values (+2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively). Here we assume RCP 6.0 forcings

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> for constituents other than the halogenated ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). In the World Avoided simulations, chlorinated or brominated source gases are assumed to increase by 3% per year from 1974 onwards. This rate of increase is modest compared to their actual rate of increase of 3.7 to 4% per year during the 1970s and 1980s before controls came into place

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. In the World Expected simulations, all halogenated (chlorinated or brominated) ODSs follow the WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) A1 scenario

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, which assumes compliance with the Montreal Protocol. Although now nine years old, more recent ODS scenarios differ only in minor regards from this scenario
