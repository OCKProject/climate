 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now compare these UVI projections from the CCM models with observed changes in UVI and with those expected from clear-sky calculations using the assimilated ozone values. Results for Lauder are shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a> displays the time series of daily ozone derived from the NIWA/BS ozone assimilation for the period since satellite measurements became available. In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>, the peak UVI measured within one hour of local noon is compared with the UVI calculated for clear-sky conditions using the NIWA/BS ozone data. There is good agreement in the seasonal range between measured and modelled UVI.

     <span class="bold">f</span>) determined from measurements of the NDACC instruments (blue), calculated from total ozone column (black), and projected by the two World Avoided (red and magenta) and World Expected (green) CCM model runs. UVI changes were normalized as described in the text and the “UVI ratios” shown in Panels (c–f) are ratios relative to these normalizations. Note that for the season that spans two years (summer at this southern hemisphere site), the year label refers to the year at the start of the season. For example, the summer of Dec 2017 to Feb 2018 is plotted at 2017.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of the large seasonal and day-to-day variability, it is difficult to see any long-term effects (other than in the upper envelope of data) in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>. The lower four panels of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> redress this by considering seasonal means, with each data point representing the mean over different 3-month periods. Because of the previously discussed biases in calculated and modelled ozone, all data shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c–f</a> were normalized. The measured UVI values were normalized to the average of all values, while the calculated UVIs were normalized to the average of only those years with measurements. The normalized peak UVI changes derived from measurements (blue lines) are compared with those calculated from the assimilated ozone dataset (black lines). Also shown in these panels are the corresponding UVI changes that would have occurred according to the World Avoided calculations reported by the GEOS-CCM model (broken red lines) and the NIWA-UKCA model (broken magenta lines). UVI values in the World Expected are also shown (broken green lines). The heavier solid lines for each model run include smoothing with an approximating spline. Both World Avoided datasets and the World Expected dataset were normalized to the average of the calculated UVI values of the years 1978 to 1987; the decade that immediately preceded the signing of the Montreal Protocol. Corresponding plots for all other sites are in Supplementary Data.

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the period prior to 2020 shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, projected changes are generally smaller with the NIWA-UKCA model than with the GEOS-CCM model. However, this is not everywhere the case. At northern mid-latitudes, the two models are in close agreement (see Supplementary Data). They are also similar at high southern latitudes during summer, while the NIWA-UKCA values are larger at high northern latitudes. Reasons for these model differences are outside the scope of the present study.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As expected, the World Expected line (green) is usually below the World Avoided line (pink). However, for a short period in the late 1990s, which is most pronounced in the winter, it is higher. Differences of this magnitude are within the range of spread between model runs of about 5%.</p>
