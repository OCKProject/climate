 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the less complete data coverage early in the period, our statistical analysis is restricted to the period since 1996. This period also excludes effects from the eruption of Mt Pinatubo, which led to significant effects on ozone and UV at some locations

  </span> that would lead in turn to a modulation of similar relative magnitude, but of opposite sign, in the UVI.
 </p>
 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even for the period since 1996, measured data are unfortunately incomplete at some sites, and only a small number of sites have full data coverage through to the end of 2018 (see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). For example, due to funding restrictions, measurements were terminated in 2017 at Arctic sites that were initiated by Biospherical Instruments (BSI). Their time series from Ushuaia and San Diego are also restricted to the period before 2010 and 2008 respectively. There was also a gap from 2003 to 2008 in Melbourne data. Of the 17 sites, only three (Lauder, Palmer, and Thessaloniki) have near-complete data coverage for the full period from 1996 to 2018. However, six others (Barrow, Hoher Sonnblick, Boulder, Mauna Loa, Arrival Heights and South Pole) have only a few years of missing data over that period. Greatest confidence should be placed on data from these nine stations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are other possible forcing mechanisms that drive interannual variability in UVI. These include variability due to the QBO or the 
  <span class="italic">El Nino</span> Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, over time scales as long as 22 years, any such effects are small, and have not been considered in the statistical analysis. In these seasonal averages, where each data point is separated from the previous value by a period of 9 months, any statistical auto-correlation effects should also be small. In the trend analysis, we have assumed that any long-term changes over the period 1996 to 2018 could be represented by a linear change, which is a reasonable assumption (e.g., see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Results of the statistical analysis are shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>. The results are not particularly sensitive to the start year, resulting in a similar picture (not shown) if the start-date for the analysis is changed by 1 or 2 years.

     <span class="italic">The two World Avoided Simulations give similar trends:</span> With the exception of Palmer Station in winter, there is good agreement between the trends derived from the two World Avoided simulations. (At Palmer Station, the sun is only 2° above the horizon (SZA
     <sub>min</sub> = 88°) at the winter solstice, so peak UVI values during this period are small.) The calculated UVI is also sensitive to small modelling and sampling differences (see Supplementary Data). Also, as shown in Fig. 
     <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> (lower left panel), there are significant differences in the seasonal variability between the two model projections in this latitude region and period.

    <p id="Par49">
     <span class="italic">UV Trends are large in the World Avoided Simulations:</span> In the World Avoided (without the Montreal Protocol), UVI levels would have increased over the last 22 years by approximately 50% per decade at high southern latitudes in spring, and by 30% per decade in summer. Increases of up to 20% per decade would have been seen at northern high latitudes. At midlatitudes, the increases would have been approximately 5–10% per decade. Such changes would have been clearly detectable in the measurement data.

   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par50">
     <span class="italic">Measurements Differ from the World Avoided Simulations:</span> In the spring and summer, the observed trends for all nine sites with good data coverage (solid symbols in Fig. 
     <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>) are significantly different from the World Avoided trends at all mid- and high-latitudes in the southern hemisphere, and at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. At northern mid-latitudes, differences between measured trends and trends from the World Avoided simulations are significant in summer at all sites except Hoher Sonnblick, but in other seasons the results are more mixed.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par51">
     <span class="italic">Measurements follow the World Expected Simulations:</span> For all sites, trends calculated from the measurements are consistent with the World Expected scenario, though uncertainties are large at Hoher Sonnblick, and other sites (e.g., San Diego, Saint Denis and Obs. Haute-Provence), where there are only a few years of observation. While variability in UVI is close to that predicted by changes in ozone at the southern hemisphere sites, the situation is more complex at northern mid-latitude sites, such as Hoher Sonnblick, where the effects of changes in aerosols and clouds are more important in some seasons.

   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par52">
     <span class="italic">Evidence of a Downward Tendency in UVI since 1996 in the Southern Hemisphere:</span> At the three Antarctic sites (South Pole, Arrival Heights, and Palmer Station) the measured UVIs reveal decreases of about 5% per decade during summer, however, only the trend at Arrival Heights is significant at the 95% confidence level. We note that UVIs calculated from changes in ozone show almost no change, suggesting that changes in albedo or cloud cover contribute to the trends in the measured UVIs. We also note that measurements at these three remote sites are potentially affected by long-term drifts of approximately 1% per decade, which are associated with hardware modifications and changes in calibration standards. Even if these drifts were confirmed, the downward trend at Arrival Heights would remain statistically significant. At the South Pole and Arrival Heights, both measured and calculated UVIs appear to have decreased during spring (the period most affected by the ozone hole), however, trends calculated from these changes are not yet statistically significant. At Lauder, small downward trends in measured UVI are observed for summer and autumn, which are on the verge of being statistically significant. These trends are generally consistent with trends derived from the NIWA/BS ozone dataset, although throughout the southern hemisphere, trends are systematically more negative for measurements than for calculations for all seasons.
