Yet, although our main concern about ozone depletion is the subsequent increase in harmful solar UV radiation at the Earth&#x02019;s surface, no studies to date have demonstrated its effectiveness in that regard. Here we use long-term UV Index (UVI) data derived from high-quality UV spectroradiometer measurements to demonstrate its success in curbing increases in UV radiation. Without this landmark agreement, UVI values would have increased at mid-latitude locations by approximately 20% between the early 1990s and today and would approximately quadruple at mid-latitudes by 2100. In contrast, an analysis of UVI data from multiple clean-air sites shows that maximum daily UVI values have remained essentially constant over the last ~20 years in all seasons, and may even have decreased slightly in the southern hemisphere, especially in Antarctica, where effects of ozone depletion were larger. Reconstructions of the UVI from total ozone data show evidence of increasing UVI levels in the 1980s, but unfortunately, there are no high-quality UV measurements available prior to the early 1990s to confirm these increases with direct observations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Risk factors</kwd><kwd>Atmospheric chemistry</kwd><kwd>Atmospheric chemistry</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004629</institution-id><institution>Ministry for Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003524</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CNES, France</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Concern about ozone depletion arose primarily because of its potential to increase UV-B radiation, and the consequent effects on health and the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Observations of unexpected springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone over Antarctica<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> &#x02014; commonly referred to as the &#x0201c;ozone hole&#x0201d; &#x02014; led to the rapid adoption of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It has been shown that without this treaty and its subsequent Amendments and Adjustments, ozone holes would by now also be occurring over the North Pole, resulting in highly elevated UVI in the Arctic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Even at mid-latitudes, the UVI would by now have increased markedly, and would more than double at some latitudes by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, due to the success of the Montreal Protocol, ozone decreases appear to have been brought under control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, though any effects on surface UV irradiances have not previously been confirmed by measurements.</p><p id="Par3">We attempt to redress this issue by using an analysis of long-term UV measurements from instruments that meet the stringent requirements of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ndacc.org">www.ndacc.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>NDACC Measurements</title><p id="Par4">The network was established in 1991 to ensure the highest quality monitoring of stratospheric properties that may be influenced by mankind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Initially it was called the Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC) because the focus at that time was on ozone depletion. Its scope was broadened in 2005 to become NDACC in recognition of the increasing threats from climate change and an equal focus of the network on tropospheric composition. Spectral UV measurements had been part of the network since the mid-1990s when rigorous measurement criteria were established to ensure that changes in UV due to future ozone depletion would be detectable for ozone changes as small as 1%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, this detection target is extremely challenging and can be met only at wavelengths of less than 300&#x02009;nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Here we focus on the UVI, which is a more relevant quantity from a health perspective. The UVI is a scaled version of the spectral irradiance weighted by the action spectrum for erythema (reddening from sunburn) in human skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and is widely used to disseminate UV information to the public<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In sunlight, the UVI is dominated by the contribution from wavelengths between 300 and 315&#x02009;nm. NDACC protocols (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ndsc.ncep.noaa.gov/organize/protocols/appendix6/">https://www.ndsc.ncep.noaa.gov/organize/protocols/appendix6/</ext-link>) require a measurement uncertainty of less than 5% in this wavelength range. Given this uncertainty, changes in the UVI that are caused by a 4% change in total ozone become detectable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">At the time the NDACC was established, the research community was mainly concerned about detecting increases in UV radiation due to the anticipated continuation of ozone depletion. However, because of the unprecedented success of the Montreal Protocol and its subsequent Adjustments and Amendments, the peak tropospheric chlorine loadings occurred before the turn of the century. Consequently, further ozone depletion and further UVI increases were not expected after that time. And over the longer term, a reduction in UVI is now projected due to ozone recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. But to date, there has been no clear demonstration of the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol in curbing surface UV increases. This is partly due to a lack of high quality measurements prior to the early 1990s, but is also because of the compounding effects of other factors affecting UV radiation, including the effects of clouds and aerosols.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Model Projections</title><p id="Par6">We complement these measurements with projections from chemistry-climate models (CCMs), representing either the &#x0201c;World Avoided&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;World Expected&#x0201d; scenario. In the World Avoided scenario, the concentration of ozone-depleting substances continues unabated without being controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In contrast, the World Expected scenario simulates changes in ozone resulting from curbing ozone-depleting substances in full compliance with the Montreal Protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">All CCM model projections must assume a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) usually consider four pathways called RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, which are labelled according to the projected radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values (+2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Here we assume RCP 6.0 forcings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> for constituents other than the halogenated ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). In the World Avoided simulations, chlorinated or brominated source gases are assumed to increase by 3% per year from 1974 onwards. This rate of increase is modest compared to their actual rate of increase of 3.7 to 4% per year during the 1970s and 1980s before controls came into place<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In the World Expected simulations, all halogenated (chlorinated or brominated) ODSs follow the WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) A1 scenario<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, which assumes compliance with the Montreal Protocol. Although now nine years old, more recent ODS scenarios differ only in minor regards from this scenario<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data Analysis Method</title><p id="Par8">We first calculate seasonal mean UVI values from the ozone fields projected by these CCM models to assess their long-term projections, out to the year 2100. We then compare these projected UVI values (out to year 2020) with corresponding measurements by NDACC instruments, as well as clear-sky UVIs calculated from measured total ozone columns. We finally assess whether observed UVIs differ substantially from those inferred from CCMs that either broadly follow the observed slow decline of stratospheric halogen, or alternatively, a scenario of increasing halogen.</p><p id="Par9">The sites considered for analysis cover a wide range of latitudes in both hemispheres, including the tropics, mid-latitudes, and polar regions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Details of sites included in the study.

In the early part of the record (prior to mid-1993), only a single monochromator version of the Brewer instrument (range 290&#x02013;330&#x02009;nm) was used, which also had a poorer stray light rejection at shorter wavelengths. But for the purposes of this paper, which focuses on UVI, these limitations are less important. For the calculation of UVI, a model-derived correction factor is used to account for the missing part of the spectrum. The instrument at San Diego is also not part of NDACC; however, it is identical to the instruments used in Antarctica (South Pole, Arrival Heights, and Palmer Station). Similarly, the instrument at Melbourne is not yet part of the NDACC, although it is identical to those at Lauder, Mauna Loa, and Alice Springs.</p><p id="Par11">We also note that at most sites, the data quality and frequency have both increased over time. For example, prior to 1996, data from Lauder were available only during periods when rain was not imminent, and for the following two years scans were disabled during (rare) rainy conditions. These limitations impart a potential clear-weather bias to early data at that site, particularly prior to 1996. Before 1997, measurements at the NSF (National Science Foundation) sites were taken only once per hour while spectral scans have been performed every 15&#x02009;minutes in later years. Further analysis of data from a subset of sites suggests that these differences in the sampling protocol have virtually no effect on the results discussed in this study. At the Haute-Provence Observatory global irradiance measurements were available every 30&#x02009;min prior to September 2010, and every 15&#x02009;min after that date. At Villeneuve d&#x02019;Ascq, scans are performed every 30&#x02009;min.</p><p id="Par12">We considered whether to use peak daily values, peak values during a specified time window (e.g., &#x000b1;1&#x02009;hour of local noon), or mean values over the noon period (e.g., &#x000b1;0.5&#x02009;hour of local noon). Variations in seasonal mean UVIs calculated from the three quantities agreed to within &#x000b1;3%, which is smaller than the measurement uncertainty of &#x000b1;5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. By using peak values instead of mean values, cloud effects on seasonal averages are reduced and time-series derived from measurements therefore agree slightly better with our modelling results, which do not take attenuation from clouds into account. The following analysis is therefore based on seasonal means of the daily maximum UVI observed within &#x000b1;1&#x02009;hour of local noon (12:00 UTC at Greenwich; 00:45 UTC at Lauder, etc). Data gaps were treated as described by Bernhard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

In general, modelled and measured total ozone column amounts (TOCs) agree reasonably well. For the reference period 1978&#x02013;1987 (i.e., the period between the year when ozone measurements from space became available globally and the year when the Montreal Protocol came into effect), TOCs calculated with the NIWA-UKCA model (both World Expected and World Avoided) for sites between 45&#x000b0;S and 45&#x000b0;N &#x02013; which represents 71% of the globe &#x02013;are on average 8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4% (&#x000b1;1&#x003c3;) higher than the measured TOCs.

It overestimates the measured TOC by 2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5% on average, with a maximum bias of 12%. Deviations between the modeled and measured TOCs become larger at higher latitudes, especially in the southern hemisphere. In this latitude range, differences can exceed 20% with biases from GEOS model exceeding those from the NIWA-UKCA model. These larger biases are partly a consequence of the low ozone amounts there and partly due to the difficulty to correctly model the destruction of ozone by heterogeneous chemical processes, which strongly depend on the temperature of the lower stratosphere. Furthermore, specific sites are not necessarily well represented by the zonal means used in the model. This is especially true for high-latitude southern hemisphere sites (i.e., Ushuaia and Palmer Station) in spring when the position of the ozone hole is frequently displaced toward the South American quadrant. Some of the discrepancy may also be due to interpolation errors in the ozone assimilation during the polar night, but this is irrelevant for changes in the UVI. Even though some uncertainties remain in the models, the agreement in geographic and seasonal patterns gives confidence that they can be used to project future changes. Finally, we also note that there may be errors in the model projections if factors such as changes in the Brewer-Dobson circulation are not properly parameterised.</p><p id="Par27">Previous studies have also shown that the CCM models tend to overestimate ozone amounts. For example, the GEOS-CCM used previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> has a high-ozone bias at mid to high latitudes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, which would lead to UVI estimates that are too low by approximately 10% at latitude 45&#x000b0; S.

The reasonable level of consistency between these models adds further confidence to those predictions but also illustrates some significant differences.</p><p id="Par29">It is interesting to note that by the year 2100, projected ozone declines are largest at high latitudes, and smallest in the tropics.

Even with the high ozone bias in the model, the calculated peak UVI would have exceeded 40 in over 70% of the area of the globe. Because of the latitudinal redistribution in ozone described above, at the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the largest clear-sky UVI values projected at mid-latitudes are similar to those in the tropics.

The slope in the calculated data is generally consistent with the slope in the datasets of the three CCM models. These model calculations imply that considerable changes in summer UVI occurred between 1978 and 1990 (about 5% at northern mid-latitude sites, up to 10% at southern mid-latitude sites and up to 20% at the three Antarctic sites). However, direct UVI observations needed to confirm these changes do not exist.</p><p id="Par40">After accounting for differences in elevation between the sites, we note that latitude-for-latitude, the mean summer UVI values tend to be larger at the southern hemisphere (SH) sites compared with the northern hemisphere (NH) sites, as has been predicted and observed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

At northern mid-latitudes, differences between measured trends and trends from the World Avoided simulations are significant in summer at all sites except Hoher Sonnblick, but in other seasons the results are more mixed.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par51"><italic>Measurements follow the World Expected Simulations:</italic> For all sites, trends calculated from the measurements are consistent with the World Expected scenario, though uncertainties are large at Hoher Sonnblick, and other sites (e.g., San Diego, Saint Denis and Obs. Haute-Provence), where there are only a few years of observation. While variability in UVI is close to that predicted by changes in ozone at the southern hemisphere sites, the situation is more complex at northern mid-latitude sites, such as Hoher Sonnblick, where the effects of changes in aerosols and clouds are more important in some seasons.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52"><italic>Evidence of a Downward Tendency in UVI since 1996 in the Southern Hemisphere:</italic> At the three Antarctic sites (South Pole, Arrival Heights, and Palmer Station) the measured UVIs reveal decreases of about 5% per decade during summer, however, only the trend at Arrival Heights is significant at the 95% confidence level. We note that UVIs calculated from changes in ozone show almost no change, suggesting that changes in albedo or cloud cover contribute to the trends in the measured UVIs. We also note that measurements at these three remote sites are potentially affected by long-term drifts of approximately 1% per decade, which are associated with hardware modifications and changes in calibration standards. Even if these drifts were confirmed, the downward trend at Arrival Heights would remain statistically significant. At the South Pole and Arrival Heights, both measured and calculated UVIs appear to have decreased during spring (the period most affected by the ozone hole), however, trends calculated from these changes are not yet statistically significant. At Lauder, small downward trends in measured UVI are observed for summer and autumn, which are on the verge of being statistically significant. These trends are generally consistent with trends derived from the NIWA/BS ozone dataset, although throughout the southern hemisphere, trends are systematically more negative for measurements than for calculations for all seasons.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">Where data are available in the early 1990s, most sites show evidence of increasing UVI in the earliest part of the record when ozone was declining. However, the short length of the data record prior to 2000, and possible interference from the eruption of Mt Pinatubo, hinder our ability to ascribe changes in UVI to changes in ozone.</p><p id="Par54">In most cases, we find that calculated and measured trends have been small and are in most cases not significantly different from zero. With the exception of one site (Hoher Sonnblick), they also agree with each other to within their error bars, and with trends calculated with the World Expected model.</p><p id="Par55">At clean-air sites in the southern hemisphere, the UVI has followed the World Expected scenario within the limits of the measurement uncertainty. Differences between measurements and the two World Avoided models are already highly significant in the Arctic, and at southern hemisphere sites, especially in Antarctica. The situation is more complex at mid-latitudes in the northern hemisphere, where the effects of changes in aerosol and clouds mask effects of ozone.</p><p id="Par56">For winter and autumn, changes observed at mid-latitude sites are mixed. Measurements show a tendency towards decreasing UVI in the southern hemisphere and increasing UVI in the northern hemisphere. However, few of the observed long-term changes since 1996 are statistically significant.</p><p id="Par57">A statistically significant decrease in measured summertime UVI has been observed at the Antarctic site Arrival Heights, and the reduction in UVI at Lauder is close to being statistically significant at the 95% level. However, at both sites, trends calculated from ozone remain close to zero, showing that the reductions in UVI must be due to other factors (e.g., changes in cloud, aerosol, or surface albedo). Measurements during the last few years at Lauder also show signs of decreases in UVI, which also cannot be attributed to ozone changes.</p><p id="Par58">The Montreal Protocol has been effective in curbing increases in harmful UVI. Without the Montreal Protocol, UVI values at northern and southern latitudes &#x0003c;50&#x000b0; would by now be 10 to 20% larger in all seasons compared to UVIs observed during the early 1990s. These changes would have had grave consequences for public health and would have led to increases in skin cancer occurrences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. For latitudes &#x0003e;50&#x000b0;S, UVI values would have increased over the same period between 25% (Ushuaia in summer and autumn) to more than 100% (South Pole in spring and summer).</p><p id="Par59">UVI values in the future remain uncertain because of:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par60">possible volcanic eruptions, which could temporarily exacerbate ozone depletion as long as chlorine levels remain elevated;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par61">interactions with other aspects of climate change, such as changes in clouds and aerosols;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par62">slowly varying natural modes of variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, such as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, which may affect cloud cover but are not included in the study;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par63">effects of increasing greenhouse gases, which will lead to stratospheric cooling and changes in dynamics that may subsequently cause ozone to increase above levels observed in 1980 outside polar regions;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par64">non-compliance to the Montreal Protocol, such as found in a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par65">The reduced number of operational sites measuring UV irradiance is concerning.
