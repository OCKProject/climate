  <p>Quantile regression of 24-h intensity changes. 
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">d</span> Slope of the quantiles for 24-h intensity changes during the period 1982–2009. Slopes are shown for IBTrACS (
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">c</span>) and ADT-HURSAT (
   <span class="bold">b</span>, 
   <span class="bold">d</span>) globally (
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">b</span>) and in the Atlantic basin (
   <span class="bold">c</span>, 
   <span class="bold">d</span>). The black dots represent the slope derived from least squares regression of intensity change as a function of year for each quantile from 0.05 to 0.95 in steps of 0.05. Shading represents the 5th and 95th percentiles of the regressions with randomly perturbed observational data (Methods). The red solid line shows the (constant value) trend in the mean as measured by ordinary least squares regression, and the red dotted lines show the 90% confidence interval
