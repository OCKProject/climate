  <p>Rapid intensification ratio trends. 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Observed trends in the rapid intensification (RI) ratio of ADT-HURSAT (black) and IBTrACS (blue) over the 28-year period 1982â€“2009 using 
   <span class="bold">a</span> global and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Atlantic data. RI ratio is defined as the number of 24-h intensity changes above 30 knots divided by the total number of 24-h intensity changes. Trends in the time series of the annual mean RI ratio are denoted by dashed lines. The slopes of the trend lines as well as their 90% confidence intervals are provided. The slopes and confidence intervals are calculated using 1000 randomly perturbed samples of the observational data. Shading represents the 5th and 95th percentiles of the 1000 regressions with these randomly perturbed observational data (Methods)
