  <p>Anthropogenic forcing’s effects on RI ratio in HiFLOR. 
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">c</span> Simulated changes in RI ratio by the 1940CTL (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), 1990CTL (
   <span class="bold">b</span>), and 2015CTL (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) relative to the 1860CTL. Percent difference in RI ratio between HiFLOR 1860CTL and each climate change simulation is plotted in each 5° × 5° grid box. Data is only plotted in a grid box if at least one TC passes through the grid box every 50 years in the two experiments used to calculate percent difference. Red (blue) squares indicate grid boxes where a larger (smaller) percentage of 24-h intensity changes exceed 30 knots in the climate change simulations than in the 1860CTL. Grid boxes that achieve a 
   <span class="italic">p</span> value of 0.05 using a binomial proportion test are considered statistically significant. White “Xs” are located in grid boxes that are not statistically significant
