  <p>Observed trends in RI ratio vs. 1860CTL natural variability. 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Box and whisker plot represents the distribution of slopes of RI ratio in the QDM-corrected 1860 HiFLOR control simulation. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Global and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Atlantic basin results are plotted. Each slope is calculated by applying least squares regression analysis to annual RI ratio values in overlapping 28-year periods. Thus, the number of slopes for a control simulation is the number of available years subtracted by 28 (i.e., 1860CTL has 1422 slopes). The red line in each box indicates the median of the slopes. The box is bounded by the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data, and the whiskers bracket approximately 99% of the data. Red plus signs indicate outliers whose values are outside of whiskersâ€™ range. IBTrACS and ADT-HURSAT trends in annual mean RI ratio between 1982 and 2009 are respectively represented by blue and green dotted lines and the corresponding 
   <span class="italic">p</span> values are listed below each line
