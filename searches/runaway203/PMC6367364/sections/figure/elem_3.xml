  <p>The effects of quantile mapping on 24-intensity change probability densities. 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Common logarithm of the probability densities calculated from IBTrACS (black), ADT-HURSAT (blue), HiFLOR 1990CTL (ORIG), HiFLOR QDM-corrected 1990CTL, and HiFLOR BCQM-corrected 1990CTL 24-h intensity changes. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Global and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Atlantic basin results are plotted. QDM and BCQM are quantile mapping designed to bias correct 1990CTL to more closely represent the distribution of IBTrACS. ADT-HURSAT and IBTrACS probabilities are computed using the 17-year period centered around 1990 (1982–1998). HiFLOR probability density curves are generated using 250 years of intensity changes from the 1990CTL. Data is binned in 20 knot increments between −110 and 110 knots, and each bin entry is plotted as a dot on a curve. All distributions are bounded below by 10
