  </span> were used here to represent natural climate variability and provide the framework for exploring anthropogenic effects. Control simulations were created using anthropogenic forcing fixed at 1860 (1860CTL), 1940 (1940CTL), 1990 (1990CTL), and 2015 (2015CTL) levels. Owing to limited computational resources, 1860CTL, 1940CTL, 1990CTL, and 2015CTL were run for different lengths: 1500, 200, 300, and 200 years, respectively. The first 50 years of all simulations were disregarded to mitigate effects of model drift. Basic conclusions remained similar even when we using the smallest sample size (150 years) for all the control simulations. The fixed forcing agents for the control simulations were atmospheric CO

  <sub>3</sub>, anthropogenic tropospheric sulfates, black and organic carbon, and solar irradiance.
