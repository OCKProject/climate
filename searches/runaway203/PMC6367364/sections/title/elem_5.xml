   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>. One of the benefits of only using data from these U.S. agencies is they follow the same definition of maximum winds: the highest 1-min average at 10 m height over a smooth surface

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span>. Best-track data start as operational estimates of the intensity and track of a TC and are refined at the end of a TC’s lifetime with a combination of in situ (e.g., dropsondes, scatterometers, and buoys), radar, and satellite measurements. Best-track intensity and position estimates are available every 6 h at the four synoptic times (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC) and are recorded to the nearest 5 knots (1 kt = 0.5144 m s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) and 0.1° latitude/longitude

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The creation of ADT-HURSAT consists of four main steps. Geostationary satellite imagery is first analyzed from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP)-B1 data

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>. Then, the data are centered on IBTrACS TCs and subsampled to be both spatially and temporally homogeneous. Finally, a simplified version of the advanced Dvorak technique
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span> is used to evaluate the data and determine a maximum TC wind speed. ADT-HURSAT data are produced every 3 h based on satellite data that has been uniformly subsampled to a horizontal resolution of 8 km, and wind speeds are recorded to the nearest tenth of a Dvorak “T-number” (depending on the current intensity, between 1 and 3 knots).
  </p>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although ADT-HURSAT and IBTrACS represent the two most reliable multi-decadal observational datasets for TC intensification trend analysis, they both have limitations. In IBTrACS, Atlantic and East Pacific in situ observations have rapidly improved in the last 30 years, while other basins were rarely able to obtain aircraft reconnaissance. In fact, the west Pacific was the only other basin that had access to aircraft reconnaissance but these observations stopped in 1987. As a result, the number of measurements available in different basins varies considerably, leading to temporal and spatial inconsistencies in IBTrACS observational quality. Better intensity estimates at the end of the historical record potentially causes heightened detection of the larger intensity changes. Additionally, best-track estimates are also susceptible to human error because they are assembled at operational centers.</p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared to IBTrACS, ADT-HURSAT employs reduced-resolution satellite imagery, both in space and time. The omission of in situ measurements to accompany the coarsened satellite imagery is especially problematic for ADT-HURSAT identifying “scene type” changes when an eye is forming. As a result, there is a well-documented unphysical plateau at the eye formation stage of TC development in intensity observations from ADT-HURSAT. Low intensity changes are present for long periods of time and then the ADT-HURSAT is forced “to catch up” with higher intensity changes once it finally detects an eye. Thus, peak TC intensities (and changes) may not be fully resolved by ADT-HURSAT, especially in the cases of a transient, small eye. However, these deficiencies remain consistent throughout the time series, which suggests that there is a low likelihood of a systematic bias in ADT-HURSAT trends. It is also possible that larger eyes and a longer mean duration of the “plateau” period for TCs in the Atlantic basin could lead to minimal effects of these deficiencies.</p>

  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For consistency, intensity change values in HiFLOR and the observational datasets are rounded to the nearest five knots. We only consider TCs that are active for at least 72 h and exceed wind speeds of 34 knots for at least 36 h. We restrict our analysis sample to only consider cases where the TC center is located over the ocean, the starting and ending TC position are below 40° of latitude, and the TC intensity stays above 34 knots.

Control simulations were created using anthropogenic forcing fixed at 1860 (1860CTL), 1940 (1940CTL), 1990 (1990CTL), and 2015 (2015CTL) levels. Owing to limited computational resources, 1860CTL, 1940CTL, 1990CTL, and 2015CTL were run for different lengths: 1500, 200, 300, and 200 years, respectively. The first 50 years of all simulations were disregarded to mitigate effects of model drift. Basic conclusions remained similar even when we using the smallest sample size (150 years) for all the control simulations. The fixed forcing agents for the control simulations were atmospheric CO

  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ADT-HURSAT and IBTrACS respectively provide intensity estimates to the nearest 1–3 and 5 knots. We use Monte Carlo techniques to create random noise before analyzing the discretized data. Random noise prevents multiple data points from having the same value and provides an estimate of the typical error associated with measuring TC intensity. 1000 subsamples were produced by adding random noise from a uniform distribution on the interval ±

The magnitude of this random noise is derived by adding 5 knots of error in quadrature (propagation of errors stemming from the intensity change calculation), which is a conservative estimate for the typical error associated with each TC intensity observation

   </span>. To calculate the slope of any intensification metric for ADT-HURSAT and IBTrACS, we use the slope of the mean of the 1000 subsamples for that particular metric. For example, quantile regression involved the calculation of every 5th percentile in each of the 1000 subsamples for each year. One-thousand slopes of each percentile were calculated and the mean of the slopes was considered the best estimate of the 1982–2009 slope of the quantile. The 5th and 95th percentiles of the 1000 slopes were considered the uncertainty bounds for the quantile.

  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, two univariate bias correction methods were tested. We primarily focus on results produced using an additive version of QDM
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
   </span> by making use of R programming language code contained in the CRAN MBC package version 0.10–4
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
   </span>. As reported in Appendix A of Cannon et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
   </span>, the additive version of QDM is functionally very similar to the equidistant CDF matching algorithm of Li et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. The formulation of QDM aims to preserve relative changes in model-simulated climate variable quantiles. In other words, with respect to the quantiles, QDM guards against distorting the underlying climate model’s climate sensitivity. For comparison purposes, we also used a simpler and more standard quantile mapping approach called BCQM. The more commonly used standard BCQM method develops transfer equations solely from comparisons of observations and model data sets drawn from a common historical (baseline) period, which can yield results in which the relative trends in bias corrected output differ from those of the raw GCM results. Meanwhile, the QDM method also incorporates adjustments accounting for differences between the modeled distributions of the historical period and future projections. As is generally the case for statistical bias correction methods, QDM and BCQM both assume that the GCM biases present in the historical period are consistent with biases in the GCM’s future projections (i.e., a stationarity assumption).

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both of these mappings, IBTrACS serves as the training dataset that 1990CTL data is nudged to because its observations have lower errors than ADT-HURSAT. ADT-HURSAT was also tested as the target distribution for the bias correction, but these results are excluded since the basic conclusions of the results remain the same. After establishing the transfer function for the bias correction using 1990CTL, the other control simulations are also bias-corrected.</p>
