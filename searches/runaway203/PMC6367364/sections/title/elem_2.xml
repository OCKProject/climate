IBTrACS is composed of TC best-track data from different operational agencies whose TC intensity observations became more reliable when global satellite coverage was introduced in the early 1980s (except for the Indian Ocean which did not gain continuous satellite coverage until 1998)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span>. Over much of the globe, satellite data quality has improved through increasing resolution and decreasing view angles, which enhances the accuracy of the most recent intensity estimates. The recent addition of more in situ measurements in the Atlantic and the East Pacific leads to lower errors in these basins, which results in additional spatial and temporal inhomogeneities in the observations

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to gauge the impact of these inhomogeneities on TC intensification trends, we first compare the probability of 24-h wind speed changes in IBTrACS and a more homogeneous record of TC intensity, the Advanced Dvorak Technique-Hurricane Satellite-B1 (ADT-HURSAT)

ADT-HURSAT incorporates artificially degraded intensity estimates in certain regions so its data quality is consistent both spatially and temporally, which is better suited for trend analysis. However, this increased data consistency means the best technology and analysis techniques are not utilized in ADT-HURSAT, which leads to individual intensity estimates with higher average errors than those in IBTrACS

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As expected, the differences in the ADT-HURSAT and IBTrACS intensity change distributions are larger for the global data, while the two datasets show more agreement in the Atlantic basin. For the global results, TCs in ADT-HURSAT maintain their intensity for a larger percentage of cases than in IBTrACS but also have significantly more instances of intensification rates between 50 and 90 knots (resulting in a “shelf” in this part of the distribution). IBTrACS curves appear almost linear in both plots which imply that probability densities are exponentially distributed. Thus, IBTrACS suggests that TC intensification and dissipation are likely controlled by statistically random environmental and internal processes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>. Meanwhile, ADT-HURSAT’s shelf-like pattern suggests that RI is a special process that could preferentially augment the probability of the highest intensification rates. The former interpretation is much more likely considering the ADT-HURSAT algorithm exhibits well-documented problems during TC eye formation (Methods).

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed in Bhatia et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span>, the discrepancies among basins and datasets cannot be attributed to specific physical processes or data deficiencies. A summary of the potential explanations for this behavior are included in the Methods section. We here argue that the agreement among the observational datasets in the Atlantic basin provides some level of confidence in the trend analysis in this basin. On the other hand, both observational datasets have larger uncertainties in global intensity changes. Therefore, any conclusions stemming from the global trend analysis must be treated with caution.

The 28-year period is selected for analysis because it is the longest continuous sample where ADT-HURSAT produces relatively reliable global intensity data. Quantile regression is calculated for every 5% quantile between 5% and 95% (Methods). IBTrACS shows significant trends in all quantiles except the ones between 35% and 45%. The 95th percentile shows the largest trend of about +4 knots decade
   <span class="sup">−1</span>. The negative slopes for the lower percentiles and positive slopes for the upper quantiles suggests a broadening of the intensity change distribution, implying less TCs maintaining a steady intensity and more TCs exhibiting high-intensity fluctuations. ADT-HURSAT shares a similar pattern for the slopes of the quantiles but the trends are more muted. Despite being relatively small in magnitude, ADT-HURSAT quantile slopes greater than the 50% quantile are statistically significant and positive, with the 90th percentile having the largest slope of approximately 1 knot decade

  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the global data, ADT-HURSAT trends are clearly much smaller than those in IBTrACS, yet IBTrACS trends are likely more susceptible to data homogeneity problems. Therefore, it is our interpretation that the weaker global trends shown by ADT-HURSAT are more likely to be correct. This conclusion is particularly notable because multiple studies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span> have assumed that IBTrACS is reliable during the time frame considered in our study when in reality, there is likely a spurious trend masked by the data. It is possible that resolution and algorithm issues with ADT-HURSAT prevent it from resolving the intensity changes and have slightly dampened largest trends. However, it is much more likely that the influx of new satellites has enabled better detection of intensity changes in the later years of the time series and thus, artificially enhanced the slope of the extreme quantiles in IBTrACS.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Atlantic basin, the quantile regression for ADT-HURSAT and IBTrACS yields similar results for extreme intensity changes. For both observational datasets, the 95th percentile shows the largest trend. This quantile increases by over +4 knots decade
   <span class="sup">−1</span> in ADT-HURSAT and +3 knots decade
   <span class="sup">−1</span> in IBTrACS. The upward trend in TC activity during the 1990s is typically attributed to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which features multidecadal fluctuations in SSTs in the Atlantic basin
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span>. In the late 1990s, the phase of the AMO shifted from negative to positive which coincides with warming in parts of the Atlantic basin where TCs develop
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
   </span>. Therefore, the AMO phase favored RI at the end of the time series. In addition to the AMO behavior, the reliability of the observational data in the Atlantic basin suggests the positive trend in intensification rates during 1982–2009 is likely robust. IBTrACS has its lowest errors in the Atlantic basin because of the plentiful in situ observations that are incorporated into the best-track analysis. ADT-HURSAT relies on best-track positions to accurately assign a scene type and find an eye, which suggests that the additional reconnaissance in this basin could also help with ADT-HURSAT’s intensity estimates.
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a complement to quantile regression, we also analyze how the annual rapid intensification ratio (RI ratio) has changed from 1982 to 2009. RI ratio is defined as the number of 24-h intensity changes greater than 30 knots divided by the total number of intensity changes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span>, and it reflects changes in the probability of the highest TC intensification rates. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> illustrates the Atlantic basin and global trends in RI ratio for ADT-HURSAT and IBTrACS. For both observational datasets, slopes are positive and significant in the global and Atlantic basin data. Much like Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, the Atlantic basin trends for the observational datasets are very similar. Over the 28-year period, the percentage of 24-h intensity changes that exceed an intensification rate of 30 knots approximately triples in IBTrACS and ADT-HURSAT. IBTrACS shows a similar rise in RI ratio for the global data but ADT-HURSAT has a much smaller slope.

In the Atlantic basin, 35.7% of the variance in IBTrACS RI ratio is explained by ADT-HURSAT RI ratio. For the global data, the percentage explained drops to 1.8%, further highlighting the lack of agreement between the two observational datasets at global scales. The variations in the slope of RI ratio among the global observations as well as the lack of a published theory

Global results are also presented with the caveat that the ADT-HURSAT data are likely more realistic because of the homogeneous time series.</p>

   <span class="italic">r</span> ≈ 0.64) and other basins to a lesser extent.

As a technique to account for the typical error associated with measuring TC intensity, the probability of each bin was calculated using 1000 subsamples that incorporated random error (Methods). To verify the quality of the control simulations, the 17-year period between 1982 and 1998 was selected for analysis because it is the longest available period with observational data that is centered on a control simulation. The 1990CTL data matches the shape of the IBTrACS curve but the distribution is not as broad as either of the observational datasets, indicating that HiFLOR underestimates the frequency of rapid weakening and intensification.

In order to mitigate the effects of systematic biases in HiFLOR intensity changes on estimating the internal variability of intensification rates, we utilize a statistical downscaling technique known as quantile mapping

In this case, random error is not included in the probability estimates because we aim to nudge HiFLOR to the best guess of the intensity distribution. Clearly, the bias corrections are aligning the tails of the 1990CTL more closely with the tails of the observations. When we explore the potential influence of anthropogenic forcing on TC intensification rates, it is critical that HiFLOR provides a realistic picture of natural climate variability. Bias-corrections increase the probability of extreme intensity changes in the HiFLOR control simulations, which broadens the intensity change distribution. Thus, the bias-corrections enhance the annual variations in RI ratio and the range of the RI ratio slopes in the HiFLOR simulations, which translates into more stringent statistical tests for establishing significant observational trends.

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to explore whether the observed changes between 1982 and 2009 could be attributable to anthropogenic forcing, we compare RI ratio in the three climate change simulations to the preindustrial 1860CTL. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> shows the percent difference in RI ratio between 1860CTL and the HiFLOR simulations with stronger anthropogenic forcing (1940CTL, 1990CTL, and 2015CTL). The analysis only involves HiFLOR simulations so bias corrections and random error are not applied to the data (Methods). Grid boxes that are not statistically significant are demarcated with a white “X”. The prevalence of red boxes throughout the maps conveys that a larger percentage of TCs are undergoing RI in 1940CTL, 1990CTL, and 2015CTL than in 1860CTL. There are no significant blue grid boxes in the 1990CTL and 2015CTL maps, and the number of gridboxes that record significant increases in RI ratio is 41 (9.7% of all shaded gridboxes) in 1940CTL, 156 (34.7% of all shaded gridboxes) in 1990 CTL, and 164 (38.2% of all shaded gridboxes) in 2015CTL. Historical radiative forcing changes applied to HiFLOR clearly lead to more frequent large intensification rates, but the available simulations do not allow us to strictly attribute the identified growth in RI during the period 1982–2009 to anthropogenic forcing. An ensemble of experiments that simulate anthropogenically forced climate change during this specific period, including changes in RI ratio, would be better suited for more comprehensive attribution analysis. Thus, for now, we can only conclude that anthropogenic forcing significantly increases extreme TC intensification rates in the HiFLOR model compared to preindustrial (1860CTL) conditions.

Data is only plotted in a grid box if at least one TC passes through the grid box every 50 years in the two experiments used to calculate percent difference. Red (blue) squares indicate grid boxes where a larger (smaller) percentage of 24-h intensity changes exceed 30 knots in the climate change simulations than in the 1860CTL. Grid boxes that achieve a

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the two most reliable long-term observational records available for TC intensity changes, the proportion of 24-h TC intensification rates greater than 30 knots significantly increases in the Atlantic basin between 1982 and 2009. Results averaged over all basins show a significant increase in TC intensification rates in IBTrACS but not in ADT-HURSAT. By itself, a 28-year upward trend in a TC intensification metric does not necessarily reflect the effects of anthropogenic climate forcing because of the intrinsic natural variability of the climate system. Here, we use bias-corrected TC intensification rates simulated by HiFLOR to demonstrate that natural variability cannot explain the magnitude of the observed upward trend in the Atlantic basin. These conclusions are possible because HiFLOR is a unique climate model that can successfully simulate the most intense TCs and highest intensification rates in multicentury simulations.</p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study is limited by the ability of a climate model to accurately represent natural variability as well as the uncertainty around the trends in relatively short observational records. However, this study represents a crucial first step in quantifying the precise roles of stochastic processes, anthropogenic warming, and natural variability when assessing changes in TC intensification rates. Further analysis with additional high-resolution climate models and a longer and more reliable observational record is required to confirm these conclusions. Regardless, these trends provide another example of the potentially serious repercussions of anthropogenic warming for TCs.</p>
