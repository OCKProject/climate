 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For consistency, intensity change values in HiFLOR and the observational datasets are rounded to the nearest five knots. We only consider TCs that are active for at least 72 h and exceed wind speeds of 34 knots for at least 36 h. We restrict our analysis sample to only consider cases where the TC center is located over the ocean, the starting and ending TC position are below 40° of latitude, and the TC intensity stays above 34 knots. The warm core criteria discussed in Murakami et al.
