  <span class="sup">2−</span> show strong powers in the 41-kyr and 93-kyr bands (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). Powers in similar bands (41-kyr and 98-kyr) are also observed in the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O record, which is closely linked to SST and sea ice extent in the AZ. To our knowledge, the relationship between DMS emissions and SST has not been directly investigated. The growth rate of phytoplankton (unicellular algae), however, shows little dependence on SST near the melting point of sea ice
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. Hence, covariance of the residual nssSO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> flux and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O record at DF (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>) does not imply that decreased summer SST is a major cause of reduced DMS emissions. Although the integrated summer insolation at 55°S, the latitude of a major source region of DMS, shows strong spectral power in the 41-kyr band, variability in solar radiation could not be a major cause of the reduced DMS emissions during glacials because it is less than 3% (
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">Supplementary Discussion</a>). The large seasonal difference in sea ice extent during glacials implies large areas of melting sea ice in summer, which would lead to enhanced DMS emissions because melting sea ice is an important DMS source

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. However, this is not the case because DMS-derived sulphate decreases in glacials (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). Thus, the change in winter sea ice extent does not directly affect overall DMS emissions in the AZ on orbital timescales.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vertical mixing and upwelling appear to dominate the nutrient and iron supply in Antarctic surface waters
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. This would decrease the nutrient/iron abundance and thus DMS emissions in summer. Reduced vertical mixing and upwelling during glacials should also reduce the CO

  <span class="sup">2−</span> flux variations and their links to climate change is needed, the data provided here can be used to constrain the sulphur cycle and climate models. Ongoing analyses of sulphur isotopes of SO

  <span class="sup">34</span>S) in DF core will reduce the estimation uncertainty of DMS-derived sulphate, and enable more quantitative discussion on the interaction between DMS-derived sulphate and climate.
