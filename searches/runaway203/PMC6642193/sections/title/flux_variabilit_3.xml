   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>

  <span class="sup">2−</span> against nssCa
  <span class="sup">2+</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) shows a lower bound whose slope is close to the stoichiometric ratio for CaSO
  <sub>4</sub>, indicating that a large proportion of nssSO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> during cold periods exists as CaSO

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CaSO
