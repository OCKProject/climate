Fifty-nine samples were newly cut from DF1 core, re-measured, and the new data were added to the earlier dataset. Measurement errors were generally less than 10% but may be higher for low concentrations. For DF2 core, 10-cm-long samples were cut every 0.5 m and measured on two Dionex DX-500 ion chromatographs: one for anions and the other for cations. Measurement errors were estimated to be less than 3%. Sea salt (ss) Na
