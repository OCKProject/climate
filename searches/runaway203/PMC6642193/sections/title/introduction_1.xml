  <span class="sup">2−</span> can thus cool the Earth by indirect forcing, in addition to direct forcing owing to increased scattering of solar radiation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. To understand these effects, DMS emissions and their links to climate should be evaluated in a pristine environment
  <span class="sup">

  <span class="sup">2−</span> and methanesulphonate (CH
  <sub>3</sub>SO

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>

  <span class="sup">2−</span> is mainly of marine biogenic DMS origin. A subsequent study on the same ice core
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span> reports increased MSA concentrations in addition to nssSO

  <span class="sup">2−</span>, further supporting the interpretation of [
  <span class="italic">5</span>] because MSA originates solely from DMS, whereas nssSO

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,

  </span>. Based on these results, DMS emissions and hence nssSO

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>

Furthermore, two deep ice cores drilled at Dome C (EDC) and Dronning Maud Land (EDML) in East Antarctica (Supplementary Fig.

  </span>, while concentrations increase during glacials. Wolff et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span> point out that increased nssSO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> concentrations in ice cores from sites with low accumulation rates (e.g., Vostok, EDC, EDML) are mainly caused by decreased accumulation rates in glacials, and can therefore not be interpreted as evidence of increased atmospheric nssSO

  <span class="sup">2−</span>. The nearly constant nssSO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> fluxes at EDC and EDML, which face the Indian and Atlantic Ocean sectors of the SO, respectively, have been interpreted to reflect stable DMS emissions and hence stable marine biogenic productivity in the Antarctic Zone (AZ) of the SO over glacial cycles, assuming that the major source of nssSO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> is DMS
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. In contrast, marine sediment records show that export production decreases in the AZ during glacials but increases further north in the Sub-Antarctic Zone (SAZ) of the SO
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. This implies reduced primary productivity in the AZ but increased primary productivity in the SAZ during glacials. The disparity between ice and marine core records has been attributed to differences in marine organisms that contribute to these records

  <span class="sup">

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>

  <span class="sup">34</span>S in the ice cores from the East Antarctic interior can be used to infer source contributions. Lower δ

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Consequently, little change in the nssSO

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we propose this alternative interpretation of nssSO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> flux and make a revised calculation of DMS-derived sulphate, using new ice core records obtained at DF, spanning the last 720,000 years
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. On the basis of the revised calculation, we compare the DMS-derived sulphate record from DF with those from EDC and EDML. We find that DMS-derived sulphate fluxes decrease in glacials, which indicates reduced DMS emissions in the AZ of the SO. This suggests that primary production, as well as export production, decreases during glacials, which is consistent with marine sediment records
