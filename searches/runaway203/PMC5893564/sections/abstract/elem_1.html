      <p>Periodic changes in the tilt of the Earth’s axis alter the distribution of incoming
         solar radiation. Here, the authors show that the temperature response to this forcing
         seemingly differs in models and Antarctic ice cores, with a better agreement reached
         if ice cores are recording a seasonally weighted signal.
