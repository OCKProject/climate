      <p>Much of the global annual mean temperature change over Quaternary glacial cycles can
         be attributed to slow ice sheet and greenhouse gas feedbacks, but analysis of the
         short-term response to orbital forcings has the potential to reveal key relationships
         in the climate system. In particular, obliquity and precession both produce highly
         seasonal temperature responses at high latitudes. Here, idealized single-forcing model
         experiments are used to quantify Earthâ€™s response to obliquity, precession, CO
         <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets, and a linear reconstruction methodology is used to compare these
         responses to long proxy records around the globe. This comparison reveals mismatches
         between the annual mean response to obliquity and precession in models versus the
         signals within Antarctic ice cores. Weighting the model-based reconstruction toward
         austral winter or spring reduces these discrepancies, providing evidence for a seasonal
         bias in ice cores.
