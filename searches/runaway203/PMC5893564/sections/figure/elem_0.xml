  <p>Modeled temperature response to obliquity. Annual mean surface air temperature anomaly (°C) for 
   <span class="bold">a</span> CM2.1, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> CESM, and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> HadCM3 for the low–high obliquity experiments. Annual, zonal-mean anomalies for 
   <span class="bold">d</span> surface air temperature and 
   <span class="bold">e</span> insolation. In (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>), hatching indicates anomalies which are not significant at a 0.05 level according to a two-tailed 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-test (i.e., the means of the two 100-year model outputs are not found to be significantly different). Surface air temperature is calculated at 2 m for CM2.1 and CESM and 1.5 m for HadCM3. Global mean temperature anomalies are −0.54 °C for CM2.1, −1.07 °C for CESM, and −0.48 °C for HadCM3
