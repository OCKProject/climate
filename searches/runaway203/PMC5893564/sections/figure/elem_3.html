         <p>Mismatch between ice cores and linear reconstructions using different monthly averages.
            Relative mismatch between proxy temperature records and linear reconstructions using
            different monthly averages. Each grid box corresponds to the mismatch for a linear
            reconstruction averaged over a portion of the year. The 
            <span>y</span>-axis defines the central month of the mean and the 
            <span>x</span>-axis defines the number of months included in the mean. The rightmost column (labeled
            12) indicates a 12-month mean. Values are the root mean square error (RMSE) of each
            monthly mean case normalized by the RMSE of the annual mean case, so monthly mean
            reconstructions which better match the proxy record compared to the annual mean case
            have values &lt;1. Contours are drawn from 0.7 to 1.3 with a contour interval of 0.1.
            The black dot indicates the lowest RMSE. As an example of how to interpret this figure,
            the lowest RMSE in the top center panel corresponds to a 5-month average centered
            on Septemberâ€”in other words July to November. The calculation is done for all three
            Antarctic locations (EPICA Dome C, Dome Fuji, and Vostok) for (top) CM2.1 and (bottom)
