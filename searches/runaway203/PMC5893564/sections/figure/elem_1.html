         <p>Temperature signals in ice cores and annual mean linear reconstructions. Temperatures
            over the past several glacial cycles from ice cores (black) and GFDL CM2.1 annual
            mean model-based linear reconstructions (dashed blue) for 
            <span>a</span> EPICA Dome C, 
            <span>b</span> Dome Fuji, and 
            <span>c</span> Vostok. The model-based linear reconstruction is the sum of contributions from obliquity
            (red), precession (orange), greenhouse gases (green), and ice sheets (gray). Reconstruction
            ΔT is plotted relative to 1 ka and the proxy records are plotted with the same mean
            value as the reconstruction
