  <p>Temperature signals in ice cores and seasonally-averaged linear reconstructions. Like Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, but using the best fit seasonal weighting for the GFDL CM2.1 linear reconstruction (black dots in upper row of Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Temperatures over the past several glacial cycles from ice cores (black) and GFDL CM2.1 seasonally-averaged model-based linear reconstructions (dashed blue) for 
   <span class="bold">a</span> EPICA Dome C, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Dome Fuji, and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Vostok. The model-based linear reconstructions are the sum of seasonally weighted contributions from obliquity (red), precession (orange), greenhouse gases (green), and ice sheets (gray). The weighting is 
   <span class="bold">a</span> July–September for EPICA Dome C, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> July–November for Dome Fuji, and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> October for Vostok, although other seasonal means also improve the fit compared to the annual mean case (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The seasonally weighted reconstructions shown here generally match the obliquity and precession-scale variability in the proxy records better than the annual mean reconstructions shown in Fig.
