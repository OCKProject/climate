         <p>Obliquity temperature response in GFDL CM2.1 and estimated from proxies. Temperature
            changes at specific proxy locations in the GFDL CM2.1 lowâ€“high obliquity experiment
            (blue dots) and the apparent direct short-term obliquity response in proxies (red
            dots), which were derived by scaling the modeled obliquity response in the linear
            reconstructions to match the proxies. To show how the modeled temperature anomalies
            at proxy locations compare to zonal-mean values, lines show the zonal-mean anomalies
            for both surface air temperature (solid) and surface temperature (dashed) in GFDL
            CM2.1
