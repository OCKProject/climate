  <p>Temperature signals in ice cores and annual mean linear reconstructions. Temperatures over the past several glacial cycles from ice cores (black) and GFDL CM2.1 annual mean model-based linear reconstructions (dashed blue) for 
   <span class="bold">a</span> EPICA Dome C, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Dome Fuji, and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Vostok. The model-based linear reconstruction is the sum of contributions from obliquity (red), precession (orange), greenhouse gases (green), and ice sheets (gray). Reconstruction ΔT is plotted relative to 1 ka and the proxy records are plotted with the same mean value as the reconstruction
