         <p>Temperature signals in ice cores and seasonally-averaged linear reconstructions. Like Fig.
            
            <a>2</a>, but using the best fit seasonal weighting for the GFDL CM2.1 linear reconstruction
            (black dots in upper row of Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). Temperatures over the past several glacial cycles from ice cores (black) and GFDL
            CM2.1 seasonally-averaged model-based linear reconstructions (dashed blue) for 
            <span>a</span> EPICA Dome C, 
            <span>b</span> Dome Fuji, and 
            <span>c</span> Vostok. The model-based linear reconstructions are the sum of seasonally weighted
            contributions from obliquity (red), precession (orange), greenhouse gases (green),
            and ice sheets (gray). The weighting is 
            <span>a</span> July–September for EPICA Dome C, 
            <span>b</span> July–November for Dome Fuji, and 
            <span>c</span> October for Vostok, although other seasonal means also improve the fit compared to
            the annual mean case (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). The seasonally weighted reconstructions shown here generally match the obliquity
            and precession-scale variability in the proxy records better than the annual mean
            reconstructions shown in Fig.
