         <p>Modeled temperature response to obliquity. Annual mean surface air temperature anomaly
            (°C) for 
            <span>a</span> CM2.1, 
            <span>b</span> CESM, and 
            <span>c</span> HadCM3 for the low–high obliquity experiments. Annual, zonal-mean anomalies for 
            <span>d</span> surface air temperature and 
            <span>e</span> insolation. In (
            <span>a</span>) and (
            <span>b</span>), hatching indicates anomalies which are not significant at a 0.05 level according
            to a two-tailed 
            <span>t</span>-test (i.e., the means of the two 100-year model outputs are not found to be significantly
            different). Surface air temperature is calculated at 2 m for CM2.1 and CESM and 1.5 m
            for HadCM3. Global mean temperature anomalies are −0.54 °C for CM2.1, −1.07 °C for
            CESM, and −0.48 °C for HadCM3
