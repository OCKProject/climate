      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another possible explanation for the model–data mismatch involves the seasonal cycle.
         Obliquity affects high-latitude insolation primarily in the summer months, so the
         temperature response is larger in summer than in winter, which is subject to polar
         night. The obliquity signal could be diminished if, for example, the ice cores preferentially
         record winter more than summer temperature—the relatively small winter temperature
         anomalies would be preferentially recorded. A seasonal bias would affect the recorded
         precession signal as well, potentially both in timing and magnitude, because of the
         seasonal nature of the temperature response to precession. The degree to which a seasonal
         bias can modify the recorded climate signal has been discussed in past work, and caution
         should be used when attempting to separate orbital signals which represent the actual
         climate response from those introduced by a seasonal bias in the recording mechanism
         <span><a>28</a></span>. It is worth noting that a seasonal bias would not strongly affect the greenhouse
         gas and ice sheet signals in Antarctic ice core records because, at least in the models,
         the temperature responses to ice sheets and greenhouse gases do not vary extensively
         throughout the year at the ice core sites (Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>4</a>, 
         <a>5</a>). Therefore, the temperature response to changes in greenhouse gases or ice sheets,
         which appear to be the bulk of the signal, should be recorded relatively accurately
         regardless of any potential seasonal bias, which is beneficial for studies of climate
         sensitivity. This point is relevant for lagged orbital responses as well. The EPICA
         Dome C record, for example, has a pronounced obliquity signal, but it lags the obliquity
         forcing by 5 ka
         <span><a>15</a></span>, suggesting the influence of slow feedbacks like ice sheets. Dome Fuji also contains
         obliquity-scale lags associated with slow feedbacks
         <span><a>29</a></span>. Any temperature response due to these slow feedbacks should be captured in the ice
         cores, regardless of any potential seasonal bias, because temperature responses due
         to ice sheets and CO
         <sub>2</sub> are not very seasonal. Only the fast response to obliquity and precession (i.e.,
         the temperature response to radiative forcing plus fast feedbacks) would be very distorted
         by a seasonal bias in the recording mechanism due to the large seasonality of these
         responses (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). Because of the largely seasonal nature of obliquity and precession signals, they
         provide a way to probe potential seasonal biases in long proxy records. In these ice
         core records, it is the fast, direct obliquity response which might be under-represented.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate whether a seasonally weighted linear reconstruction would better match
         the proxy temperature records, mismatches are computed between each proxy record and
         seasonally weighted linear reconstructions (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). A boxcar weighting function is employed to compute the mean over a continuous span
         expressed in months. Two factors are allowed to vary in this analysis: the center
         month of the mean and the time spanned by the mean, ranging from one to all twelve
         months. The general results do not differ substantially if a sinusoidal weighting
         function is used instead.

               <p>Mismatch between ice cores and linear reconstructions using different monthly averages.
                  Relative mismatch between proxy temperature records and linear reconstructions using
                  different monthly averages. Each grid box corresponds to the mismatch for a linear
                  reconstruction averaged over a portion of the year. The 
                  <span>y</span>-axis defines the central month of the mean and the 
                  <span>x</span>-axis defines the number of months included in the mean. The rightmost column (labeled
                  12) indicates a 12-month mean. Values are the root mean square error (RMSE) of each
                  monthly mean case normalized by the RMSE of the annual mean case, so monthly mean
                  reconstructions which better match the proxy record compared to the annual mean case
                  have values &lt;1. Contours are drawn from 0.7 to 1.3 with a contour interval of 0.1.
                  The black dot indicates the lowest RMSE. As an example of how to interpret this figure,
                  the lowest RMSE in the top center panel corresponds to a 5-month average centered
                  on September—in other words July to November. The calculation is done for all three
                  Antarctic locations (EPICA Dome C, Dome Fuji, and Vostok) for (top) CM2.1 and (bottom)
                  CESM

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For CM2.1, linear reconstructions weighted toward Antarctic winter or spring best
         match the proxy records for all three Antarctic ice cores (Figs. 
         <a>4</a>, 
         <a>5</a>). On average, the best weightings reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) to 86%
         of their annual mean values. Some of the remaining mismatch is due to higher-frequency
         variability, which the reconstruction methodology is not expected to capture. When
         all time series are filtered in the obliquity band, the best weightings reduce the
         RMSE to 34% of the annual mean values, constituting a much better match for this component
         (Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>6</a>-
         <a>8</a>).

                  <span>b</span> Dome Fuji, and 
                  <span>c</span> Vostok. The model-based linear reconstructions are the sum of seasonally weighted
                  contributions from obliquity (red), precession (orange), greenhouse gases (green),
                  and ice sheets (gray). The weighting is 
                  <span>a</span> July–September for EPICA Dome C, 
                  <span>b</span> July–November for Dome Fuji, and 
                  <span>c</span> October for Vostok, although other seasonal means also improve the fit compared to
                  the annual mean case (Fig. 
                  <a>4</a>). The seasonally weighted reconstructions shown here generally match the obliquity
                  and precession-scale variability in the proxy records better than the annual mean
                  reconstructions shown in Fig. 
                  <a>2</a></p>
            </div>
            <div></div>
         </div>
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The improved fit is attributable to two factors. First, the local temperature response
         to obliquity is reduced in these months, reducing the obliquity signal. Second, this
         seasonal weighting alters the precession signal to generally be more consistent with
         precession-scale temperature variability in the proxy record, such as some of the
         variations in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a–e and 7 (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>, Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>6</a>-
         <a>8</a>). A seasonal mean can modify the apparent timing of these precession peaks because
         different months are warmed in different phases of the precessional cycle
         <span><a>30</a></span>. Conducting these calculations with CESM gives approximately the same results (Fig. 
         <a>4d–f</a>), with the best weighted reconstructions reducing RMSE to 91% of the annual mean
         values on average. When all time series are filtered in the obliquity band, the best
         weightings reduce RMSE to 62% of the annual mean values for the CESM case.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A bias in Antarctic ice cores toward austral winter or spring is relatively consistent
         with some past studies. A comparison of temperature trends between EPICA and a transient
         simulation of the last 21 ka with ECBilt-Clio showed that the proxy record was best
         matched when the simulation was averaged over austral spring
         <span><a>31</a></span>. Another study showed that a seasonal bias could explain why the precession signal
         in Antarctic ice cores appears to be out of phase with local insolation
         <span><a>30</a></span>. That research focused on the timing of precession variability, and here we show
         that this explanation helps improve the fit of the obliquity signal as well. Performing
         the analysis by applying seasonal weighting to the obliquity or precession components
         alone shows that mismatch is generally reduced in both cases (Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>9</a>, 
         <a>10</a>). This provides two separate lines of evidence that Antarctic temperature records
         may be biased toward winter or spring. Previous work has suggested that the precession
         signal in Antarctic temperature may be a response to the duration of the summer, which
         is longer when perihelion occurs at the Southern Hemisphere winter solstice
         <span><a>32</a></span>. However, this explanation is undermined by the fact that such an orbital configuration
         produces annual mean cooling rather than warming over most of Antarctica in both the
         CM2.1 and CESM. Additionally, this explanation would not help explain the obliquity
         discrepancy.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A seasonal bias in ice cores could result from several factors. In particular, the
         mean isotopic signature could be biased by preferential snowfall during a particular
         part of the year. As compiled in previous work (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a> in ref. 
         <span><a>30</a></span>), observations from Vostok, Mizuho, and Dome Fuji stations, as well as data from
         the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) suggest that Antarctic
         snowfall is reduced during Antarctic summer, in line with this explanation. This snowfall
         seasonality is supported by some modeling results
         <span><a>33</a></span>, but not by others. In general, it is unclear whether models can simulate Antarctic
         precipitation accurately enough to be useful for this purpose
         <span><a>34</a></span>. The importance of seasonal precipitation to the interpretation of ice cores has
         been previously argued
         <span><a>35</a></span>, as well as the potential importance of seasonal sublimation
         <span><a>30</a>,
            <a>36</a></span>. If precipitation is reduced during Antarctic winter instead, it would be evidence
         against the seasonality argument presented in this paper.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerable uncertainties still surround the topic of isotopic signatures in ice
         cores. In addition to seasonal variations, covariance between temperature and precipitation
         on synoptic timescales has the potential to affect isotopic ratios, which could be
         troublesome if these relationships change over time, although this effect may be less
         important for the interior of East Antarctica than for more coastal regions
         <span><a>37</a>,
            <a>38</a></span>. Other influences on isotopic composition could stem from changes in the temperature
         and source of evaporated moisture, regional changes in ice sheet elevation, changes
         in lapse rate, and more
         <span><a>29</a>,
            <a>38</a>–
            <a>41</a></span>. Investigating all of these factors is beyond the scope of the present analysis.
         We focus on the potential impact of a seasonal bias because it is the most straightforward
         explanation for the apparent model/data temperature discrepancy presented here, but
         other explanations are certainly possible.
