      <p>M.P.E. conducted most of the CM2.1 and CESM simulations and conducted the bulk of
         the analysis. C.S.J. provided additional analysis and feedback, A.J.B. provided guidance
         for some model simulations and analysis, and D.W.L. provided insight about the choice
         of proxy records. P.J.V. ran the HadCM3 simulations, M.C. conducted analysis of climate
         emulator results, and P.N.D. ran the CESM ice sheets simulation and an additional
         preindustrial simulation.
