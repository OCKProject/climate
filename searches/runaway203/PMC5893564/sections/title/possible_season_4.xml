 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another possible explanation for the model–data mismatch involves the seasonal cycle. Obliquity affects high-latitude insolation primarily in the summer months, so the temperature response is larger in summer than in winter, which is subject to polar night. The obliquity signal could be diminished if, for example, the ice cores preferentially record winter more than summer temperature—the relatively small winter temperature anomalies would be preferentially recorded. A seasonal bias would affect the recorded precession signal as well, potentially both in timing and magnitude, because of the seasonal nature of the temperature response to precession. The degree to which a seasonal bias can modify the recorded climate signal has been discussed in past work, and caution should be used when attempting to separate orbital signals which represent the actual climate response from those introduced by a seasonal bias in the recording mechanism
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. It is worth noting that a seasonal bias would not strongly affect the greenhouse gas and ice sheet signals in Antarctic ice core records because, at least in the models, the temperature responses to ice sheets and greenhouse gases do not vary extensively throughout the year at the ice core sites (Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). Therefore, the temperature response to changes in greenhouse gases or ice sheets, which appear to be the bulk of the signal, should be recorded relatively accurately regardless of any potential seasonal bias, which is beneficial for studies of climate sensitivity. This point is relevant for lagged orbital responses as well. The EPICA Dome C record, for example, has a pronounced obliquity signal, but it lags the obliquity forcing by 5 ka
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, suggesting the influence of slow feedbacks like ice sheets. Dome Fuji also contains obliquity-scale lags associated with slow feedbacks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Any temperature response due to these slow feedbacks should be captured in the ice cores, regardless of any potential seasonal bias, because temperature responses due to ice sheets and CO
  <sub>2</sub> are not very seasonal. Only the fast response to obliquity and precession (i.e., the temperature response to radiative forcing plus fast feedbacks) would be very distorted by a seasonal bias in the recording mechanism due to the large seasonality of these responses (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). Because of the largely seasonal nature of obliquity and precession signals, they provide a way to probe potential seasonal biases in long proxy records. In these ice core records, it is the fast, direct obliquity response which might be under-represented.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate whether a seasonally weighted linear reconstruction would better match the proxy temperature records, mismatches are computed between each proxy record and seasonally weighted linear reconstructions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). A boxcar weighting function is employed to compute the mean over a continuous span expressed in months. Two factors are allowed to vary in this analysis: the center month of the mean and the time spanned by the mean, ranging from one to all twelve months. The general results do not differ substantially if a sinusoidal weighting function is used instead.

    <p>Mismatch between ice cores and linear reconstructions using different monthly averages. Relative mismatch between proxy temperature records and linear reconstructions using different monthly averages. Each grid box corresponds to the mismatch for a linear reconstruction averaged over a portion of the year. The 
     <span class="italic">y</span>-axis defines the central month of the mean and the 
     <span class="italic">x</span>-axis defines the number of months included in the mean. The rightmost column (labeled 12) indicates a 12-month mean. Values are the root mean square error (RMSE) of each monthly mean case normalized by the RMSE of the annual mean case, so monthly mean reconstructions which better match the proxy record compared to the annual mean case have values &lt;1. Contours are drawn from 0.7 to 1.3 with a contour interval of 0.1. The black dot indicates the lowest RMSE. As an example of how to interpret this figure, the lowest RMSE in the top center panel corresponds to a 5-month average centered on September—in other words July to November. The calculation is done for all three Antarctic locations (EPICA Dome C, Dome Fuji, and Vostok) for (top) CM2.1 and (bottom) CESM

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For CM2.1, linear reconstructions weighted toward Antarctic winter or spring best match the proxy records for all three Antarctic ice cores (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). On average, the best weightings reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) to 86% of their annual mean values. Some of the remaining mismatch is due to higher-frequency variability, which the reconstruction methodology is not expected to capture. When all time series are filtered in the obliquity band, the best weightings reduce the RMSE to 34% of the annual mean values, constituting a much better match for this component (Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>-

     <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The seasonally weighted reconstructions shown here generally match the obliquity and precession-scale variability in the proxy records better than the annual mean reconstructions shown in Fig.

 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The improved fit is attributable to two factors. First, the local temperature response to obliquity is reduced in these months, reducing the obliquity signal. Second, this seasonal weighting alters the precession signal to generally be more consistent with precession-scale temperature variability in the proxy record, such as some of the variations in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a–e and 7 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>-
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). A seasonal mean can modify the apparent timing of these precession peaks because different months are warmed in different phases of the precessional cycle
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Conducting these calculations with CESM gives approximately the same results (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d–f</a>), with the best weighted reconstructions reducing RMSE to 91% of the annual mean values on average. When all time series are filtered in the obliquity band, the best weightings reduce RMSE to 62% of the annual mean values for the CESM case.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A bias in Antarctic ice cores toward austral winter or spring is relatively consistent with some past studies. A comparison of temperature trends between EPICA and a transient simulation of the last 21 ka with ECBilt-Clio showed that the proxy record was best matched when the simulation was averaged over austral spring
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. Another study showed that a seasonal bias could explain why the precession signal in Antarctic ice cores appears to be out of phase with local insolation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. That research focused on the timing of precession variability, and here we show that this explanation helps improve the fit of the obliquity signal as well. Performing the analysis by applying seasonal weighting to the obliquity or precession components alone shows that mismatch is generally reduced in both cases (Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). This provides two separate lines of evidence that Antarctic temperature records may be biased toward winter or spring. Previous work has suggested that the precession signal in Antarctic temperature may be a response to the duration of the summer, which is longer when perihelion occurs at the Southern Hemisphere winter solstice
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. However, this explanation is undermined by the fact that such an orbital configuration produces annual mean cooling rather than warming over most of Antarctica in both the CM2.1 and CESM. Additionally, this explanation would not help explain the obliquity discrepancy.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A seasonal bias in ice cores could result from several factors. In particular, the mean isotopic signature could be biased by preferential snowfall during a particular part of the year. As compiled in previous work (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a> in ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>), observations from Vostok, Mizuho, and Dome Fuji stations, as well as data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) suggest that Antarctic snowfall is reduced during Antarctic summer, in line with this explanation. This snowfall seasonality is supported by some modeling results
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>, but not by others. In general, it is unclear whether models can simulate Antarctic precipitation accurately enough to be useful for this purpose
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. The importance of seasonal precipitation to the interpretation of ice cores has been previously argued
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>, as well as the potential importance of seasonal sublimation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. If precipitation is reduced during Antarctic winter instead, it would be evidence against the seasonality argument presented in this paper.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerable uncertainties still surround the topic of isotopic signatures in ice cores. In addition to seasonal variations, covariance between temperature and precipitation on synoptic timescales has the potential to affect isotopic ratios, which could be troublesome if these relationships change over time, although this effect may be less important for the interior of East Antarctica than for more coastal regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. Other influences on isotopic composition could stem from changes in the temperature and source of evaporated moisture, regional changes in ice sheet elevation, changes in lapse rate, and more
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Investigating all of these factors is beyond the scope of the present analysis. We focus on the potential impact of a seasonal bias because it is the most straightforward explanation for the apparent model/data temperature discrepancy presented here, but other explanations are certainly possible.
