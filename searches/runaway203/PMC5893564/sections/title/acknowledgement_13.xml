 <p>The authors would like to thank J. Shakun for his data set of proxy-derived temperatures aligned to LR04, V. Massonâ€“Delmotte for suggestions about past ice core research, and F. Parrenin for the Vostok temperature reconstruction data. M.P.E. was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics and a grant from the Paleo Perspective on Climate Change program of the National Science Foundation (Grant ATM0902735), as well as support from the University of Southern California and Northern Arizona University. This work was partially funded under the State of Arizona Technology and Research Initiative Fund (TRIF), administered by the Arizona Board of Regents. The authors would also like to thank the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) at Princeton, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the Computational &amp; Information Systems Lab (CISL), and the Hadley Center for computational resources to complete these simulations.</p>
