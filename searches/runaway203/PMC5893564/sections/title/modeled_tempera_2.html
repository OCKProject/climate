      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two-coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) are used to model the
         climate response to changes in obliquity, precession, CO
         <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets. These are the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Climate
         Model 2.1 (CM2.1) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community
         Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2. The temperature response to orbital forcing
         is also explored in the Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3 (HadCM3). For CM2.1
         and CESM, single-forcing equilibrium simulations are conducted at low (22.079°) and
         high (24.480°) obliquity, the extreme values of the past 900 ka
         <span><a>10</a></span>. All other forcings, such as greenhouse gases, ice sheets, precession, and eccentricity,
         are prescribed at preindustrial values. The models lack dynamic ice sheet and carbon
         cycle components, so orbital experiments capture the short-term climate response,
         but exclude slow feedbacks related to ice sheets and the carbon cycle. Additional
         single-forcing experiments isolate the climate response to changes in precession,
         CO
         <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets (Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a>). The HadCM3 simulations
         <span><a>11</a></span>, which are only used to examine the obliquity response, employ a different experimental
         design: simulations are conducted at regular intervals over the past 120 ka using
         different combinations of orbital forcings, and the obliquity response is extracted
         from the orbit-only simulations through statistical regression. In all models, obliquity
         is evaluated as a reduction in Earth’s axial tilt by taking the difference between
         a low obliquity (22.079°) response and a high obliquity (24.480°) response.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all three models, reduced obliquity produces pronounced cooling in the mid and
         high latitudes of both hemispheres and some areas of mild warming near the equator
         (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). Obliquity redistributes insolation but does not alter the global average of annual
         mean insolation. The change in total radiative forcing, which accounts for albedo,
         is small (global mean radiative forcing anomalies are +0.1 W m
         <span>−2</span> for CM2.1 and +0.2 W m
         <span>−2</span> for CESM). Despite this mildly positive radiative forcing, cooling is much more widespread
         than warming, with all three models producing negative global mean temperature change.
         Global mean temperature anomalies are −0.54 °C for CM2.1, −1.07 °C for CESM, and −0.48 °C
         for HadCM3. The level of agreement between the models over most latitudes suggests
         that these results are fairly robust. The primary difference between models occurs
         in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, where CESM produces considerably more cooling
         than the other models, associated with widespread Arctic albedo anomalies in summer
         and fall due to changes in snow cover and sea ice.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the obliquity signal in models and proxy records is central to the current
         analysis, so it is useful to understand what drives the modeled response. In the tropics,
         the temperature response is near zero even though annual mean insolation increases
         by 3.2 W m
         <span>−2</span> (radiative forcing increases by 2.4 W m
         <span>−2</span>). Analysis of energy transports and radiative feedbacks helps explain the lack of
         a tropical temperature response to obliquity forcing. In part, the increased radiative
         forcing is balanced by increased poleward heat transport in both the atmosphere and
         ocean. In the atmosphere, the tropical portion of this modified heat transport is
         associated with changes in the Hadley circulation
         <span><a>6</a></span> (Supplementary Note 
         <a>1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). From the extra-tropics to the poles, poleward heat transport is increased primarily
         through changes in sensible heat transport, associated with baroclinic eddies
         <span><a>6</a></span>. These atmospheric changes, together with increased ocean heat transport, redistribute
         heating and diminish the tropical warming. Some locations, especially parts of the
         tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, even show a slight cooling (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). Equatorial Pacific cooling in CM2.1 and CESM is greater below the surface, which
         has previously been suggested to explain tropical obliquity variations opposite to
         local insolation forcing in the early Pleistocene
         <span><a>12</a>–
            <a>14</a></span>. The present work shows that heat transport is enough to counter the direct insolation
         forcing at the surface, as already suggested in past work
         <span><a>15</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At higher latitudes, insolation is reduced during summer months. The change from high-to-low
         obliquity results in an annual mean insolation decrease of ~13 W m
         <span>−2</span> in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles–that is, a loss of 7% of the total local insolation.
         This translates to a mean radiative forcing of approximately −6 W m
         <span>−2</span> within the Arctic Circle and −5 W m
         <span>−2</span> within the Antarctic Circle in CM2.1 and CESM. Despite the increased equator-to-pole
         heat transport seen here and in another study
         <span><a>16</a></span>, all three models show considerable cooling at high latitudes, facilitated by the
         effect of strong surface albedo and lapse rate feedbacks (Supplementary Note 
         <a>2</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). Low-latitude feedbacks are mixed, so these strong high-latitude feedbacks bring
         about global mean cooling in response to lowered obliquity, as explored in
         <span><a>4</a></span>.
