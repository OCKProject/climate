      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that a seasonal bias may exist in Antarctic ice cores. Such a
         bias would help explain the relative lack of in-phase obliquity signal in these records,
         as well as aspects of precession-scale variability. Conversely, this analysis strongly
         argues against a pronounced austral summer bias; such a bias would generally produce
         a larger obliquity signal and a precession signal out of phase with the precession-scale
         variability in the ice core records. If ice cores are recording an austral winter/spring
         seasonal signal, then the annual mean Antarctic temperature record has the potential
         to look somewhat different: obliquity-scale variability should be somewhat larger
         and precession variability should generally be shifted a little in timing (cf. Figures 
         <a>2</a> and 
         <a>5</a>). As discussed in previous work
         <span><a>30</a></span>, a seasonal signal would reduce the need to explain precessional variability as a
         response to Northern Hemisphere summer insolation forcing
         <span><a>42</a></span>, which has been difficult to justify, especially if Southern Hemisphere climate variations
         precede those in the Northern Hemisphere
         <span><a>32</a>,
            <a>43</a></span>. If Antarctic orbital temperature variability does respond more directly to local
         insolation, Southern Hemisphere insolation could have a larger role in producing past
         climate variations than typically assumed. Additionally, a seasonal bias should not
         greatly interfere with the use of Antarctic ice core records to estimate climate sensitivity,
         as the modeled Antarctic temperature responses to CO
         <sub>2</sub> and ice sheet changes are relatively consistent throughout the year (Supplementary
         Figs. 
         <a>4</a>, 
         <a>5</a>). An exception to this would be if the climate response to obliquity is used when
         calculating climate sensitivity. The general method outlined in this paper may be
         useful for exploring potential biases in other records, as long as the modeled responses
         are considered robust in the regions of investigation. As more data becomes available,
         further exploration of these potential seasonal biases is encouraged.
