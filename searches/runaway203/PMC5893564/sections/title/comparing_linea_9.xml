   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> were used. The records in the temperature stack
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> were aligned to the LR04 benthic stack by that study’s authors, generally using δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O to align records. The NGRIP ice core was left on its published ages
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>, with a shift so that ages are relative to year 1950 instead of 2000. The Antarctic ice core records were aligned to the annual mean linear reconstructions, with these alignments done separately for the two models used in the analysis (GFDL CM2.1 and NCAR CESM). The alignment was done using matching software
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. If no alignment is done, offsets in the timing of deglaciations affect the results. To test that the analysis is not overly sensitive to the details of this alignment, an alternate approach was also taken: no alignment was performed on the ice core age models, but periods of deglaciation prior to the most recent one were omitted from the analysis. This alternate analysis yields results similar to the main results presented in this paper, suggesting that the details of this alignment do not overly affect the results. Not all records were well suited to the present analysis, so two selection criteria were applied. Records that span multiple orbital cycles are preferred, so any records which contained less than 100 ka of overlap with the linear reconstructions were rejected. Additionally, some records exhibit temporal variability distinctly different from the typical 'sawtooth' shape observed in the greenhouse gas and sea level forcing records, potentially because of uncertainties in the proxy temperature relationship. To remove records with unusual variability as well as records with apparent age model mismatch, records which do not match the unfitted annual mean linear reconstruction of either model with at least a coefficient of efficiency of 0.5 were excluded. This selects records, which already match the linear reconstruction somewhat well, a qualification which should be kept in mind when evaluating results.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conduct the model–data comparison, proxy records were compared to the linear reconstruction at the location of the proxy record, using modeled surface temperature for sediment cores and NGRIP and surface (2 m) air temperature for the Antarctic ice cores. To determine how much of the modeled annual mean obliquity signal was reflected in the proxy records (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), the annual mean obliquity term in the reconstruction was multiplied by a scaling factor ranging from −1000 to 1000. This results in a set of possible linear temperature reconstructions differing only by the magnitude of the direct obliquity signal. After removing the mean difference between the reconstruction and proxy, the RMSE was calculated for each version of the linear temperature reconstruction. The solution with the smallest RMSE was deemed to be the solution best supported by the proxy record. This 'best' scaling factor was used to calculate the red dots in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>. This comparison was performed for each proxy record separately.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if a seasonal-weighted linear reconstruction better matched the Antarctic proxy records, RMSE was calculated between each proxy record and a set of linear temperature reconstructions computed using different monthly weightings. As opposed to the calculation described above, no aspects of the linear reconstruction were directly scaled to be larger or smaller. Instead, climate signals only changed as a result of different monthly averages. Averaging windows were centered on each month and spanned either 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 months, for a total of 72 monthly weighting combinations plus the 12-month mean (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). A boxcar weighting function was employed so that months were either included in the mean or excluded, although the use of a sinusoidal weighting function gave relatively similar results. Before computing RMSE, the mean difference between the linear reconstruction and proxy temperature time series was removed. Results are computed as RMSE for each monthly mean case divided by RMSE of the annual mean case (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Values less than 1 indicate instances in which a seasonally weighted reconstruction better matches the proxy record.
