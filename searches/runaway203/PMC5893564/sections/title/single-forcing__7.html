      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify the climate responses produced by changes in obliquity, precession, CO
         <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets, idealized single-forcing experiments were conducted, where only
         one forcing is applied while other forcings are prescribed at preindustrial levels.
         Simulations were conducted with the GFDL CM2.1 and the NCAR CESM1.2. Forcing parameters
         used for the simulations are given in Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a>, and a broader overview of the CM2.1 simulations is presented in past work
         <span><a>17</a></span>. CESM simulations were generally forced with identical values to CM2.1 simulations
         except for slight differences in the control values. For ice sheet-forced simulations,
         GFDL CM2.1 uses the ICE-5G last glacial maximum (LGM) ice sheets
         <span><a>44</a></span> and NCAR CESM uses the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3)
         LGM ice sheets, which are a blend of three ice sheet reconstructions, with added ice
         shelves in the western Labrador Sea
         <span><a>45</a></span>. Simulations were run for 500 years or longer. These experiments are here referred
         to as 'fingerprint' experiments, since they quantify the distinct climate response
         patterns to individual forcings. A different experimental design was employed for
         the HadCM3 simulations used in Fig. 
         <a>1c, d</a>, as described in Supplementary Note 
         <a>5</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For CM2.1 and CESM monthly output, an adjustment was typically made to the calendar.
         When the timing of perihelion is modified, as in some of the simulations described
         above, the speed at which Earth travels through different parts of its orbit is altered
         according to Kepler’s second law. This means that calendar months in different simulations
         will correspond to different parts of Earth’s orbit, complicating the interpretation
         of monthly anomalies. This 'calendar effect' has been described in past research
         <span><a>46</a></span>. To account for this complicating factor, all monthly output from CM2.1 and CESM
         were processed onto a common fixed-angular calendar, in which every 'month' corresponds
         to a 30° arc of Earth’s orbit. This calculation was done using the method described
         in
         <span><a>47</a></span>. No monthly results from HadCM3 are presented, so no calendar correction is needed.
