         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify the climate responses produced by changes in obliquity, precession, CO
            <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets, idealized single-forcing experiments were conducted, where only
            one forcing is applied while other forcings are prescribed at preindustrial levels.
            Simulations were conducted with the GFDL CM2.1 and the NCAR CESM1.2. Forcing parameters
            used for the simulations are given in Supplementary Table 
            <a>1</a>, and a broader overview of the CM2.1 simulations is presented in past work
            <span><a>17</a></span>. CESM simulations were generally forced with identical values to CM2.1 simulations
            except for slight differences in the control values. For ice sheet-forced simulations,
            GFDL CM2.1 uses the ICE-5G last glacial maximum (LGM) ice sheets
            <span><a>44</a></span> and NCAR CESM uses the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3)
            LGM ice sheets, which are a blend of three ice sheet reconstructions, with added ice
            shelves in the western Labrador Sea
            <span><a>45</a></span>. Simulations were run for 500 years or longer. These experiments are here referred
            to as 'fingerprint' experiments, since they quantify the distinct climate response
            patterns to individual forcings. A different experimental design was employed for
            the HadCM3 simulations used in Fig. 
            <a>1c, d</a>, as described in Supplementary Note 
            <a>5</a>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For CM2.1 and CESM monthly output, an adjustment was typically made to the calendar.
            When the timing of perihelion is modified, as in some of the simulations described
            above, the speed at which Earth travels through different parts of its orbit is altered
            according to Kepler’s second law. This means that calendar months in different simulations
            will correspond to different parts of Earth’s orbit, complicating the interpretation
            of monthly anomalies. This 'calendar effect' has been described in past research
            <span><a>46</a></span>. To account for this complicating factor, all monthly output from CM2.1 and CESM
            were processed onto a common fixed-angular calendar, in which every 'month' corresponds
            to a 30° arc of Earth’s orbit. This calculation was done using the method described
            in
            <span><a>47</a></span>. No monthly results from HadCM3 are presented, so no calendar correction is needed.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the effects of each forcing in the past, and to allow for comparison with
            proxy time series data, a linear reconstruction methodology is employed. Model output
            from the single-forcing experiments is scaled by past forcings using an updated version
            of the method described in the appendix of
            <span><a>17</a></span>: anomalies from orbital experiments (consisting of simulations for high and low obliquity,
            simulations with precession at the two solstices and two equinoxes with increased
            eccentricity, and a simulation with zero eccentricity) are scaled by orbital parameters
            <span><a>48</a></span>; Anomalies from the CO
            <sub>2</sub> experiment are scaled by the radiative forcing of CO
            <sub>2</sub> from a combined CO
            <sub>2</sub> record from EPICA Dome C and Vostok
            <span><a>49</a></span> as well as the radiative forcing of CH
            <sub>4</sub> from EPICA Dome C
            <span><a>50</a></span>, computed according to the equations in Table 6.2 of the Intergovernmental Panel
            on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report
            <span><a>51</a></span>; Anomalies from the ice sheet experiment are scaled by sea level changes, which is
            used as an analog for ice sheet volume. The sea level record is a stack of seven different
            sea level records computed using different methods
            <span><a>52</a></span>. Potentially, uncertainties in the magnitude of obliquity variability in the sea
            level record could affect the results of this paper, especially if obliquity variations
            unrelated to sea level are also being recorded in the sea level record. However, the
            use of a multi-record stack rather than an individual sea level record should help
            reduce the impact of potential uncertainties in any particular method. It should also
            be noted that the climate response to ice sheets may relate to both ice sheet area
            and volume, but a linear scaling with sea level has been used here for simplicity.
            An additional source of uncertainty concerns the timing of individual ice sheet changes
            relative to the global mean sea level record. In the present work, the linear reconstruction
            assumes that all ice sheets vary synchronously with the global mean sea level record.
            However, evidence suggests that after the LGM, at least, Antarctic ice melt may have
            lagged considerably behind the global sea level changes
            <span><a>44</a></span>. Differences between the timing or characteristics of Antarctic ice sheet changes
            and global sea level anomalies could affect results of this analysis, especially considering
            that orbital-scale variations are present in the sea level curve (see Supplementary
            Note 
            <a>3</a>).  Also note that the global mean sea level curve contains precession-scale variability
            approximately in line with Northern Hemisphere summer insolation; this means that
            the precession signal in the linear reconstruction is already largely in phase with
            the Antarctic ice core signals, even in the annual mean reconstruction (Supplementary
            Figs. 6-8).  While it is unclear how realistic this is, the seasonal averaging of
            the linear reconstruction still generally shifts the timing of the direct precession
            signal and reduces mismatch in the current analysis.  Furthermore, without quantitative
            knowledge of the ice sheet differences over the past few glacial periods, it is unclear
            how to account for this limitation in the present work. Finally, regarding greenhouse
            gases, by treating CH
            <sub>4</sub> as an equivalent amount of radiative forcing due to CO
            <sub>2</sub>, the effect of CH
            <sub>4</sub> can be approximated without the need for a dedicated CH
            <sub>4</sub> simulation, which can be computationally expensive. The sea level stack was already
            aligned to LR04, and the other forcing time series (CO
            <sub>2</sub>, CH
            <sub>4</sub>, and orbit) are left on their published age models.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The computed 'linear reconstructions' estimate the contribution of individual forcings
            in producing past climate change, and can be summed together to compute a model-based
            estimate of total temperature change at any location. The linear reconstruction methodology
            used here has been updated from previous work
            <span><a>17</a></span> primarily in four ways: a slightly different data set of orbital parameters is used
            here (we use the same data set that was used to align the LR04 benthic stack)
            <span><a>48</a></span>, greenhouse gas values from EPICA Dome C/Vostok are used instead of those from Vostok
            alone, a sea level stack is used rather than a single record, and linear reconstruction
            anomalies are computed relative to the preindustrial simulation rather than a zero
            eccentricity state.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparing linear reconstructions with proxy records</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore climate signals preserved in proxies, long proxy temperature records were
            selected from multiple sources. For polar records, EPICA Dome C
            <span><a>15</a></span>, Dome Fuji
            <span><a>19</a></span>, Vostok
            <span><a>20</a></span>, and NGRIP
            <span><a>53</a></span> were analyzed. For other regions, many proxy records which had been compiled for
            a global temperature stack
            <span><a>18</a></span> were used. The records in the temperature stack
            <span><a>18</a></span> were aligned to the LR04 benthic stack by that study’s authors, generally using δ
            <span>18</span>O to align records. The NGRIP ice core was left on its published ages
            <span><a>53</a></span>, with a shift so that ages are relative to year 1950 instead of 2000. The Antarctic
            ice core records were aligned to the annual mean linear reconstructions, with these
            alignments done separately for the two models used in the analysis (GFDL CM2.1 and
            NCAR CESM). The alignment was done using matching software
            <span><a>54</a>,
               <a>55</a></span>. If no alignment is done, offsets in the timing of deglaciations affect the results.
            To test that the analysis is not overly sensitive to the details of this alignment,
            an alternate approach was also taken: no alignment was performed on the ice core age
            models, but periods of deglaciation prior to the most recent one were omitted from
            the analysis. This alternate analysis yields results similar to the main results presented
            in this paper, suggesting that the details of this alignment do not overly affect
            the results. Not all records were well suited to the present analysis, so two selection
            criteria were applied. Records that span multiple orbital cycles are preferred, so
            any records which contained less than 100 ka of overlap with the linear reconstructions
            were rejected. Additionally, some records exhibit temporal variability distinctly
            different from the typical 'sawtooth' shape observed in the greenhouse gas and sea
            level forcing records, potentially because of uncertainties in the proxy temperature
            relationship. To remove records with unusual variability as well as records with apparent
            age model mismatch, records which do not match the unfitted annual mean linear reconstruction
            of either model with at least a coefficient of efficiency of 0.5 were excluded. This
            selects records, which already match the linear reconstruction somewhat well, a qualification
            which should be kept in mind when evaluating results.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conduct the model–data comparison, proxy records were compared to the linear reconstruction
            at the location of the proxy record, using modeled surface temperature for sediment
            cores and NGRIP and surface (2 m) air temperature for the Antarctic ice cores. To
            determine how much of the modeled annual mean obliquity signal was reflected in the
            proxy records (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>), the annual mean obliquity term in the reconstruction was multiplied by a scaling
            factor ranging from −1000 to 1000. This results in a set of possible linear temperature
            reconstructions differing only by the magnitude of the direct obliquity signal. After
            removing the mean difference between the reconstruction and proxy, the RMSE was calculated
            for each version of the linear temperature reconstruction. The solution with the smallest
            RMSE was deemed to be the solution best supported by the proxy record. This 'best'
            scaling factor was used to calculate the red dots in Fig. 
            <a>3</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>3</a>. This comparison was performed for each proxy record separately.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if a seasonal-weighted linear reconstruction better matched the Antarctic
            proxy records, RMSE was calculated between each proxy record and a set of linear temperature
            reconstructions computed using different monthly weightings. As opposed to the calculation
            described above, no aspects of the linear reconstruction were directly scaled to be
            larger or smaller. Instead, climate signals only changed as a result of different
            monthly averages. Averaging windows were centered on each month and spanned either
            1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 months, for a total of 72 monthly weighting combinations plus
            the 12-month mean (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). A boxcar weighting function was employed so that months were either included in
            the mean or excluded, although the use of a sinusoidal weighting function gave relatively
            similar results. Before computing RMSE, the mean difference between the linear reconstruction
            and proxy temperature time series was removed. Results are computed as RMSE for each
            monthly mean case divided by RMSE of the annual mean case (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). Values less than 1 indicate instances in which a seasonally weighted reconstruction
            better matches the proxy record.
