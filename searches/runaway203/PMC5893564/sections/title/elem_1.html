         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two-coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) are used to model the
            climate response to changes in obliquity, precession, CO
            <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets. These are the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Climate
            Model 2.1 (CM2.1) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community
            Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2. The temperature response to orbital forcing
            is also explored in the Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3 (HadCM3). For CM2.1
            and CESM, single-forcing equilibrium simulations are conducted at low (22.079°) and
            high (24.480°) obliquity, the extreme values of the past 900 ka
            <span><a>10</a></span>. All other forcings, such as greenhouse gases, ice sheets, precession, and eccentricity,
            are prescribed at preindustrial values. The models lack dynamic ice sheet and carbon
            cycle components, so orbital experiments capture the short-term climate response,
            but exclude slow feedbacks related to ice sheets and the carbon cycle. Additional
            single-forcing experiments isolate the climate response to changes in precession,
            CO
            <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets (Supplementary Table 
            <a>1</a>). The HadCM3 simulations
            <span><a>11</a></span>, which are only used to examine the obliquity response, employ a different experimental
            design: simulations are conducted at regular intervals over the past 120 ka using
            different combinations of orbital forcings, and the obliquity response is extracted
            from the orbit-only simulations through statistical regression. In all models, obliquity
            is evaluated as a reduction in Earth’s axial tilt by taking the difference between
            a low obliquity (22.079°) response and a high obliquity (24.480°) response.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all three models, reduced obliquity produces pronounced cooling in the mid and
            high latitudes of both hemispheres and some areas of mild warming near the equator
            (Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). Obliquity redistributes insolation but does not alter the global average of annual
            mean insolation. The change in total radiative forcing, which accounts for albedo,
            is small (global mean radiative forcing anomalies are +0.1 W m
            <span>−2</span> for CM2.1 and +0.2 W m
            <span>−2</span> for CESM). Despite this mildly positive radiative forcing, cooling is much more widespread
            than warming, with all three models producing negative global mean temperature change.
            Global mean temperature anomalies are −0.54 °C for CM2.1, −1.07 °C for CESM, and −0.48 °C
            for HadCM3. The level of agreement between the models over most latitudes suggests
            that these results are fairly robust. The primary difference between models occurs
            in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, where CESM produces considerably more cooling
            than the other models, associated with widespread Arctic albedo anomalies in summer
            and fall due to changes in snow cover and sea ice.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the obliquity signal in models and proxy records is central to the current
            analysis, so it is useful to understand what drives the modeled response. In the tropics,
            the temperature response is near zero even though annual mean insolation increases
            by 3.2 W m
            <span>−2</span> (radiative forcing increases by 2.4 W m
            <span>−2</span>). Analysis of energy transports and radiative feedbacks helps explain the lack of
            a tropical temperature response to obliquity forcing. In part, the increased radiative
            forcing is balanced by increased poleward heat transport in both the atmosphere and
            ocean. In the atmosphere, the tropical portion of this modified heat transport is
            associated with changes in the Hadley circulation
            <span><a>6</a></span> (Supplementary Note 
            <a>1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). From the extra-tropics to the poles, poleward heat transport is increased primarily
            through changes in sensible heat transport, associated with baroclinic eddies
            <span><a>6</a></span>. These atmospheric changes, together with increased ocean heat transport, redistribute
            heating and diminish the tropical warming. Some locations, especially parts of the
            tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, even show a slight cooling (Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). Equatorial Pacific cooling in CM2.1 and CESM is greater below the surface, which
            has previously been suggested to explain tropical obliquity variations opposite to
            local insolation forcing in the early Pleistocene
            <span><a>12</a>–
               <a>14</a></span>. The present work shows that heat transport is enough to counter the direct insolation
            forcing at the surface, as already suggested in past work
            <span><a>15</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At higher latitudes, insolation is reduced during summer months. The change from high-to-low
            obliquity results in an annual mean insolation decrease of ~13 W m
            <span>−2</span> in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles–that is, a loss of 7% of the total local insolation.
            This translates to a mean radiative forcing of approximately −6 W m
            <span>−2</span> within the Arctic Circle and −5 W m
            <span>−2</span> within the Antarctic Circle in CM2.1 and CESM. Despite the increased equator-to-pole
            heat transport seen here and in another study
            <span><a>16</a></span>, all three models show considerable cooling at high latitudes, facilitated by the
            effect of strong surface albedo and lapse rate feedbacks (Supplementary Note 
            <a>2</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>2</a>). Low-latitude feedbacks are mixed, so these strong high-latitude feedbacks bring
            about global mean cooling in response to lowered obliquity, as explored in
            <span><a>4</a></span>.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine how well the modeled responses are reflected in past climate, model results
            are compared with long proxy time series data from ice and ocean sediment cores. A
            linear reconstruction methodology, similar to that used in past work
            <span><a>17</a></span>, is employed to compare the idealized single-forcing experiments with time-varying
            proxy records. Put simply, results from the single-forcing experiments, which isolate
            the climate response to obliquity, precession, CO
            <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets, are scaled by the time-varying forcings of the Late Quaternary to
            compute model-based estimates of the climate responses to individual forcings over
            the past several glacial cycles. Summed together, this creates a linear reconstruction
            of total climate change which can be compared to proxies. To put all records onto
            comparable age models, sediment cores were aligned to the LR04 benthic stack in past
            work
            <span><a>18</a></span>, but some uncertainty exists in ice core age models. Leaving ice core records on
            their original published age models caused the timing of deglaciations to vary between
            records and the reconstruction, affecting results. To better align major climate features,
            Antarctic ice cores were aligned to the annual mean linear reconstructions. The timing
            of various records remains a potential source of uncertainty in the current analysis.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Past work suggests that the linear reconstruction methodology is more appropriate
            for some regions than others
            <span><a>17</a></span>, with regions of sea ice presenting a particular difficulty. Still, because orbital
            forcing is well-characterized and produces highly seasonal responses over much of
            the world, focusing on regional orbital responses provide a valuable test of proxy
            records.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total linear reconstruction covers 1–430 ka, the older bound of which is determined
            by the length of the shortest component used in the reconstruction. When interpreting
            the reconstruction, the obliquity and precession components should be regarded as
            the short-term climate responses to imposed insolation anomalies, while the additional
            contributions from greenhouse gas and ice sheet anomalies are quantified separately.
            This distinction between the direct short-term response, which quantifies the fast
            climate response to insolation changes, and the slower changes associated with ice
            sheet and carbon cycle feedbacks, should be kept in mind in the following analysis.
            See the methods section for more detail.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the model-based linear reconstruction compares well with proxy temperatures
            from the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) Dome C
            <span>15</span>, Dome Fuji
            <span><a>19</a></span>, and Vostok
            <span><a>20</a></span> ice cores (Fig. 
            <a>2</a>). This linear reconstruction methodology allows the contribution from each forcing
            or feedback to be estimated. However, some of the larger mismatches between the ice
            cores and linear reconstructions appear to be related to the obliquity response. The
            linear reconstruction is generally too warm when obliquity causes Antarctic warming
            and too cold when obliquity causes Antarctic cooling. To explore this in a different
            way, a fitting methodology is employed: at each proxy location, the magnitude of the
            short-term obliquity component in the linear reconstruction is scaled to find the
            value that produces the best fit between the total linear reconstruction and the proxy
            record. This is done for the three Antarctic ice cores as well as a variety of records
            from other latitudes (Supplementary Table 
            <a>2</a>).

         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, outside of the Antarctic region the obliquity values supported by the
            proxy records are similar to the annual mean values of GCM simulations, or at least
            not different in a uniform way (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). At low latitudes, the models and proxies both show relatively little sensitivity
            to obliquity, consistent with the hypothesis that changes in heat transport counteract
            much of the annual mean insolation forcing at those latitudes. At high latitudes,
            proxies show some obliquity signal
            <span><a>21</a>,
               <a>22</a></span>, but there is a consistent mismatch in magnitude between the short-term obliquity
            response in models and that inferred from Antarctic proxies. Multiple long ice cores
            show similar responses in Antarctica, so the following analysis focuses on that region
            rather than Greenland. The Antarctic ice cores support only 24–33% of the fast, direct
            response to obliquity simulated by CM2.1 (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>), and 44–88% of the response in CESM (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). This discrepancy presents an intriguing question, and several possible hypotheses
            to explain the mismatch are outlined below.

                     (blue dots) and the apparent direct short-term obliquity response in proxies (red
                     dots), which were derived by scaling the modeled obliquity response in the linear
                     reconstructions to match the proxies. To show how the modeled temperature anomalies
                     at proxy locations compare to zonal-mean values, lines show the zonal-mean anomalies
                     for both surface air temperature (solid) and surface temperature (dashed) in GFDL

         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One possible explanation involves the alignment of the proxy records. As stated earlier,
            the present analysis draws a distinction between the fast response to insolation forcing,
            which is captured in the orbital GCM simulations, and the longer-term obliquity response
            associated with slow feedbacks. If the age models are not correctly aligned, the comparison
            may suffer. The possibility is further explored using spectral analysis (Supplementary
            Note 
            <a>3</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second possible explanation for the mismatch is that the models may be too sensitive
            to obliquity forcing in the Antarctic. This could happen, for instance, if the modeled
            surface albedo or lapse rate feedbacks are too strong in that region, a negative feedback
            is absent, or if the southward heat transport from lower latitudes is too weak. The
            role of heat transport in dampening the Antarctic response to obliquity has been explored
            in past work using the LOVECLIM Earth system model of intermediate complexity and
            the MIROC GCM
            <span><a>16</a></span>. However, because the temperature response is generally robust across the three models
            explored in the present work (Fig. 
            <a>1</a>), any shortcoming would likely have to be systematic across these models. Additionally,
            the radiative forcing due to obliquity is large at high latitudes (−5 W m
            <span>−2</span> in the Antarctic Circle in CM2.1 and CESM), so a large temperature response seems
            reasonable, provided there is no error in the calculated strength of the orbital cycles.
            Dust is one possible source of error, as changes of dust
            <span><a>23</a></span> are not included in this methodology. Some GCM simulations suggest that dust has
            little effect on Antarctic temperatures
            <span><a>24</a>,
               <a>25</a></span>. However, dust may have considerable indirect effects on clouds
            <span><a>26</a></span>, so the potential impact of dust in the present study is unclear. The mismatch could
            also stem from differences in the obliquity temperature response at the surface and
            higher in the atmosphere, where the snow preserved in ice cores forms, but the model
            results do not seem to support this. However, the discrete and course nature of the
            models’ vertical grids makes this possibility difficult to evaluate.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional possible reason for the mismatch concerns shortcomings of the linear
            reconstruction methodology. Because the CM2.1 and CESM linear reconstructions are
            based on idealized single-forcing experiments, where one forcing is applied and all
            others are prescribed at preindustrial levels, any nonlinearities between multiple
            forcings are excluded. This may be important, for example, if the climate response
            to obliquity would be different under glacial boundary conditions, especially since
            glacials are more common than interglacials during the period of comparison, the Late
            Quaternary. Hypothetically, a diminished climate response to obliquity during colder
            conditions could help explain the mismatch. However, an analysis of the Antarctic
            temperature response to obliquity under a variety of background conditions conducted
            with a climate emulator using HadCM3 simulations
            <span><a>27</a></span> suggests that the climate response to obliquity is not heavily dependent on ice sheet
            extent or greenhouse gas concentrations (Supplementary Note 
            <a>4</a> and Supplementary Figs. 
            <a>11</a>,

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Possible seasonal bias in Antarctic ice cores</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another possible explanation for the model–data mismatch involves the seasonal cycle.
            Obliquity affects high-latitude insolation primarily in the summer months, so the
            temperature response is larger in summer than in winter, which is subject to polar
            night. The obliquity signal could be diminished if, for example, the ice cores preferentially
            record winter more than summer temperature—the relatively small winter temperature
            anomalies would be preferentially recorded. A seasonal bias would affect the recorded
            precession signal as well, potentially both in timing and magnitude, because of the
            seasonal nature of the temperature response to precession. The degree to which a seasonal
            bias can modify the recorded climate signal has been discussed in past work, and caution
            should be used when attempting to separate orbital signals which represent the actual
            climate response from those introduced by a seasonal bias in the recording mechanism
            <span><a>28</a></span>. It is worth noting that a seasonal bias would not strongly affect the greenhouse
            gas and ice sheet signals in Antarctic ice core records because, at least in the models,
            the temperature responses to ice sheets and greenhouse gases do not vary extensively
            throughout the year at the ice core sites (Supplementary Figs. 
            <a>4</a>, 
            <a>5</a>). Therefore, the temperature response to changes in greenhouse gases or ice sheets,
            which appear to be the bulk of the signal, should be recorded relatively accurately
            regardless of any potential seasonal bias, which is beneficial for studies of climate
            sensitivity. This point is relevant for lagged orbital responses as well. The EPICA
            Dome C record, for example, has a pronounced obliquity signal, but it lags the obliquity
            forcing by 5 ka
            <span><a>15</a></span>, suggesting the influence of slow feedbacks like ice sheets. Dome Fuji also contains
            obliquity-scale lags associated with slow feedbacks
            <span><a>29</a></span>. Any temperature response due to these slow feedbacks should be captured in the ice
            cores, regardless of any potential seasonal bias, because temperature responses due
            to ice sheets and CO
            <sub>2</sub> are not very seasonal. Only the fast response to obliquity and precession (i.e.,
            the temperature response to radiative forcing plus fast feedbacks) would be very distorted
            by a seasonal bias in the recording mechanism due to the large seasonality of these
            responses (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>5</a>). Because of the largely seasonal nature of obliquity and precession signals, they
            provide a way to probe potential seasonal biases in long proxy records. In these ice
            core records, it is the fast, direct obliquity response which might be under-represented.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate whether a seasonally weighted linear reconstruction would better match
            the proxy temperature records, mismatches are computed between each proxy record and
            seasonally weighted linear reconstructions (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). A boxcar weighting function is employed to compute the mean over a continuous span
            expressed in months. Two factors are allowed to vary in this analysis: the center
            month of the mean and the time spanned by the mean, ranging from one to all twelve
            months. The general results do not differ substantially if a sinusoidal weighting
            function is used instead.

                  <p>Mismatch between ice cores and linear reconstructions using different monthly averages.
                     Relative mismatch between proxy temperature records and linear reconstructions using
                     different monthly averages. Each grid box corresponds to the mismatch for a linear
                     reconstruction averaged over a portion of the year. The 
                     <span>y</span>-axis defines the central month of the mean and the 
                     <span>x</span>-axis defines the number of months included in the mean. The rightmost column (labeled
                     12) indicates a 12-month mean. Values are the root mean square error (RMSE) of each
                     monthly mean case normalized by the RMSE of the annual mean case, so monthly mean
                     reconstructions which better match the proxy record compared to the annual mean case
                     have values &lt;1. Contours are drawn from 0.7 to 1.3 with a contour interval of 0.1.
                     The black dot indicates the lowest RMSE. As an example of how to interpret this figure,
                     the lowest RMSE in the top center panel corresponds to a 5-month average centered
                     on September—in other words July to November. The calculation is done for all three
                     Antarctic locations (EPICA Dome C, Dome Fuji, and Vostok) for (top) CM2.1 and (bottom)

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For CM2.1, linear reconstructions weighted toward Antarctic winter or spring best
            match the proxy records for all three Antarctic ice cores (Figs. 
            <a>4</a>, 
            <a>5</a>). On average, the best weightings reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) to 86%
            of their annual mean values. Some of the remaining mismatch is due to higher-frequency
            variability, which the reconstruction methodology is not expected to capture. When
            all time series are filtered in the obliquity band, the best weightings reduce the
            RMSE to 34% of the annual mean values, constituting a much better match for this component

                     <span>c</span> October for Vostok, although other seasonal means also improve the fit compared to
                     the annual mean case (Fig. 
                     <a>4</a>). The seasonally weighted reconstructions shown here generally match the obliquity
                     and precession-scale variability in the proxy records better than the annual mean
                     reconstructions shown in Fig.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The improved fit is attributable to two factors. First, the local temperature response
            to obliquity is reduced in these months, reducing the obliquity signal. Second, this
            seasonal weighting alters the precession signal to generally be more consistent with
            precession-scale temperature variability in the proxy record, such as some of the
            variations in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a–e and 7 (Fig. 
            <a>5</a>, Supplementary Figs. 
            <a>6</a>-
            <a>8</a>). A seasonal mean can modify the apparent timing of these precession peaks because
            different months are warmed in different phases of the precessional cycle
            <span><a>30</a></span>. Conducting these calculations with CESM gives approximately the same results (Fig. 
            <a>4d–f</a>), with the best weighted reconstructions reducing RMSE to 91% of the annual mean
            values on average. When all time series are filtered in the obliquity band, the best
            weightings reduce RMSE to 62% of the annual mean values for the CESM case.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A bias in Antarctic ice cores toward austral winter or spring is relatively consistent
            with some past studies. A comparison of temperature trends between EPICA and a transient
            simulation of the last 21 ka with ECBilt-Clio showed that the proxy record was best
            matched when the simulation was averaged over austral spring
            <span><a>31</a></span>. Another study showed that a seasonal bias could explain why the precession signal
            in Antarctic ice cores appears to be out of phase with local insolation
            <span><a>30</a></span>. That research focused on the timing of precession variability, and here we show
            that this explanation helps improve the fit of the obliquity signal as well. Performing
            the analysis by applying seasonal weighting to the obliquity or precession components
            alone shows that mismatch is generally reduced in both cases (Supplementary Figs. 
            <a>9</a>, 
            <a>10</a>). This provides two separate lines of evidence that Antarctic temperature records
            may be biased toward winter or spring. Previous work has suggested that the precession
            signal in Antarctic temperature may be a response to the duration of the summer, which
            is longer when perihelion occurs at the Southern Hemisphere winter solstice
            <span><a>32</a></span>. However, this explanation is undermined by the fact that such an orbital configuration
            produces annual mean cooling rather than warming over most of Antarctica in both the
            CM2.1 and CESM. Additionally, this explanation would not help explain the obliquity
            discrepancy.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A seasonal bias in ice cores could result from several factors. In particular, the
            mean isotopic signature could be biased by preferential snowfall during a particular
            part of the year. As compiled in previous work (Fig. 
            <a>2a</a> in ref. 
            <span><a>30</a></span>), observations from Vostok, Mizuho, and Dome Fuji stations, as well as data from
            the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) suggest that Antarctic
            snowfall is reduced during Antarctic summer, in line with this explanation. This snowfall
            seasonality is supported by some modeling results
            <span><a>33</a></span>, but not by others. In general, it is unclear whether models can simulate Antarctic
            precipitation accurately enough to be useful for this purpose
            <span><a>34</a></span>. The importance of seasonal precipitation to the interpretation of ice cores has
            been previously argued
            <span><a>35</a></span>, as well as the potential importance of seasonal sublimation
            <span><a>30</a>,
               <a>36</a></span>. If precipitation is reduced during Antarctic winter instead, it would be evidence
            against the seasonality argument presented in this paper.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerable uncertainties still surround the topic of isotopic signatures in ice
            cores. In addition to seasonal variations, covariance between temperature and precipitation
            on synoptic timescales has the potential to affect isotopic ratios, which could be
            troublesome if these relationships change over time, although this effect may be less
            important for the interior of East Antarctica than for more coastal regions
            <span><a>37</a>,
               <a>38</a></span>. Other influences on isotopic composition could stem from changes in the temperature
            and source of evaporated moisture, regional changes in ice sheet elevation, changes
            in lapse rate, and more
            <span><a>29</a>,
               <a>38</a>–
               <a>41</a></span>. Investigating all of these factors is beyond the scope of the present analysis.
            We focus on the potential impact of a seasonal bias because it is the most straightforward
            explanation for the apparent model/data temperature discrepancy presented here, but
            other explanations are certainly possible.
