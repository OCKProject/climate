      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Slow temperature variations over Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles have been
         dictated by changes in Earth’s orbital obliquity, precession, and eccentricity, as
         well as slow feedbacks involving atmospheric composition and ice sheets. Although
         questions remain surrounding the interaction between orbital forcing and greenhouse
         gas and ice sheet dynamics
         <span><a>1</a>,
            <a>2</a></span>, the present research focuses on the climate’s direct short-term response to orbital
         forcing, which has been explored to varying degrees in past research
         <span><a>3</a>–
            <a>9</a></span>. Primarily, this paper focuses on the climate response to obliquity, or the axial
         tilt of the earth, which varies by up to ~2.5° with a period of 40 ka.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in Earth’s obliquity affect the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of insolation.
         Because this forcing is well known, it presents a good target to explore the climate
         system’s response. Reduced obliquity results in positive annual mean insolation anomalies
         in the tropics while higher latitudes have increased insolation in winter and strongly
         decreased insolation in summer (see Fig. 
         <a>1a</a> in ref. 
         <span><a>7</a></span>). These anomalies amplify the annual mean equator-to-pole insolation gradient and
         diminish the seasonal insolation cycle in both hemispheres. Unlike precession, obliquity’s
         seasonally-varying insolation anomalies do not locally sum to zero in the annual mean.

                  to a two-tailed

                  different). Surface air temperature is calculated at 2 m for CM2.1 and CESM and 1.5 m
                  for HadCM3. Global mean temperature anomalies are −0.54 °C for CM2.1, −1.07 °C for
                  CESM, and −0.48 °C for HadCM3

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, the climate response to obliquity is explored in model experiments
         and proxies. Model results show larger temperature responses at high latitudes than
         low latitudes, helped by radiative feedbacks and heat transport. In order to compare
         these modeled climate responses to signals preserved in proxy records, a linear reconstruction
         methodology is employed in which the results of the single-forcing model experiments
         are scaled by past climate forcings to produce a time-varying estimate of past climate
         change based on the model results. Results show that the model-based linear reconstruction
         has a larger direct obliquity response in Antarctica than suggested by Antarctic ice
         cores. The mismatch between the linear reconstruction and Antarctic ice cores is diminished
         when the linear reconstruction is averaged over austral winter or spring, offering
         evidence for a seasonal bias in the Antarctic ice cores. A seasonal bias in the Antarctic
         ice cores would not dramatically alter the recording of climate signals due to ice
         sheets and greenhouse gases—which make up the bulk of the climate response—but could
         alter the apparent magnitude and timing of climate responses to orbital forcing, which
         has implications for our understanding of past climate.
