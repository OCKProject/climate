      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine how well the modeled responses are reflected in past climate, model results
         are compared with long proxy time series data from ice and ocean sediment cores. A
         linear reconstruction methodology, similar to that used in past work
         <span><a>17</a></span>, is employed to compare the idealized single-forcing experiments with time-varying
         proxy records. Put simply, results from the single-forcing experiments, which isolate
         the climate response to obliquity, precession, CO
         <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets, are scaled by the time-varying forcings of the Late Quaternary to
         compute model-based estimates of the climate responses to individual forcings over
         the past several glacial cycles. Summed together, this creates a linear reconstruction
         of total climate change which can be compared to proxies. To put all records onto
         comparable age models, sediment cores were aligned to the LR04 benthic stack in past
         work
         <span><a>18</a></span>, but some uncertainty exists in ice core age models. Leaving ice core records on
         their original published age models caused the timing of deglaciations to vary between
         records and the reconstruction, affecting results. To better align major climate features,
         Antarctic ice cores were aligned to the annual mean linear reconstructions. The timing
         of various records remains a potential source of uncertainty in the current analysis.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Past work suggests that the linear reconstruction methodology is more appropriate
         for some regions than others
         <span><a>17</a></span>, with regions of sea ice presenting a particular difficulty. Still, because orbital
         forcing is well-characterized and produces highly seasonal responses over much of
         the world, focusing on regional orbital responses provide a valuable test of proxy
         records.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total linear reconstruction covers 1–430 ka, the older bound of which is determined
         by the length of the shortest component used in the reconstruction. When interpreting
         the reconstruction, the obliquity and precession components should be regarded as
         the short-term climate responses to imposed insolation anomalies, while the additional
         contributions from greenhouse gas and ice sheet anomalies are quantified separately.
         This distinction between the direct short-term response, which quantifies the fast
         climate response to insolation changes, and the slower changes associated with ice
         sheet and carbon cycle feedbacks, should be kept in mind in the following analysis.
         See the methods section for more detail.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the model-based linear reconstruction compares well with proxy temperatures
         from the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) Dome C
         <span>15</span>, Dome Fuji
         <span><a>19</a></span>, and Vostok
         <span><a>20</a></span> ice cores (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). This linear reconstruction methodology allows the contribution from each forcing
         or feedback to be estimated. However, some of the larger mismatches between the ice
         cores and linear reconstructions appear to be related to the obliquity response. The
         linear reconstruction is generally too warm when obliquity causes Antarctic warming
         and too cold when obliquity causes Antarctic cooling. To explore this in a different
         way, a fitting methodology is employed: at each proxy location, the magnitude of the
         short-term obliquity component in the linear reconstruction is scaled to find the
         value that produces the best fit between the total linear reconstruction and the proxy
         record. This is done for the three Antarctic ice cores as well as a variety of records
         from other latitudes (Supplementary Table 
         <a>2</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, outside of the Antarctic region the obliquity values supported by the
         proxy records are similar to the annual mean values of GCM simulations, or at least
         not different in a uniform way (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). At low latitudes, the models and proxies both show relatively little sensitivity
         to obliquity, consistent with the hypothesis that changes in heat transport counteract
         much of the annual mean insolation forcing at those latitudes. At high latitudes,
         proxies show some obliquity signal
         <span><a>21</a>,
            <a>22</a></span>, but there is a consistent mismatch in magnitude between the short-term obliquity
         response in models and that inferred from Antarctic proxies. Multiple long ice cores
         show similar responses in Antarctica, so the following analysis focuses on that region
         rather than Greenland. The Antarctic ice cores support only 24–33% of the fast, direct
         response to obliquity simulated by CM2.1 (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>), and 44–88% of the response in CESM (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). This discrepancy presents an intriguing question, and several possible hypotheses
         to explain the mismatch are outlined below.

                  changes at specific proxy locations in the GFDL CM2.1 low–high obliquity experiment
                  (blue dots) and the apparent direct short-term obliquity response in proxies (red
                  dots), which were derived by scaling the modeled obliquity response in the linear
                  reconstructions to match the proxies. To show how the modeled temperature anomalies
                  at proxy locations compare to zonal-mean values, lines show the zonal-mean anomalies
                  for both surface air temperature (solid) and surface temperature (dashed) in GFDL

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One possible explanation involves the alignment of the proxy records. As stated earlier,
         the present analysis draws a distinction between the fast response to insolation forcing,
         which is captured in the orbital GCM simulations, and the longer-term obliquity response
         associated with slow feedbacks. If the age models are not correctly aligned, the comparison
         may suffer. The possibility is further explored using spectral analysis (Supplementary
         Note 
         <a>3</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second possible explanation for the mismatch is that the models may be too sensitive
         to obliquity forcing in the Antarctic. This could happen, for instance, if the modeled
         surface albedo or lapse rate feedbacks are too strong in that region, a negative feedback
         is absent, or if the southward heat transport from lower latitudes is too weak. The
         role of heat transport in dampening the Antarctic response to obliquity has been explored
         in past work using the LOVECLIM Earth system model of intermediate complexity and
         the MIROC GCM
         <span><a>16</a></span>. However, because the temperature response is generally robust across the three models
         explored in the present work (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>), any shortcoming would likely have to be systematic across these models. Additionally,
         the radiative forcing due to obliquity is large at high latitudes (−5 W m
         <span>−2</span> in the Antarctic Circle in CM2.1 and CESM), so a large temperature response seems
         reasonable, provided there is no error in the calculated strength of the orbital cycles.
         Dust is one possible source of error, as changes of dust
         <span><a>23</a></span> are not included in this methodology. Some GCM simulations suggest that dust has
         little effect on Antarctic temperatures
         <span><a>24</a>,
            <a>25</a></span>. However, dust may have considerable indirect effects on clouds
         <span><a>26</a></span>, so the potential impact of dust in the present study is unclear. The mismatch could
         also stem from differences in the obliquity temperature response at the surface and
         higher in the atmosphere, where the snow preserved in ice cores forms, but the model
         results do not seem to support this. However, the discrete and course nature of the
         models’ vertical grids makes this possibility difficult to evaluate.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional possible reason for the mismatch concerns shortcomings of the linear
         reconstruction methodology. Because the CM2.1 and CESM linear reconstructions are
         based on idealized single-forcing experiments, where one forcing is applied and all
         others are prescribed at preindustrial levels, any nonlinearities between multiple
         forcings are excluded. This may be important, for example, if the climate response
         to obliquity would be different under glacial boundary conditions, especially since
         glacials are more common than interglacials during the period of comparison, the Late
         Quaternary. Hypothetically, a diminished climate response to obliquity during colder
         conditions could help explain the mismatch. However, an analysis of the Antarctic
         temperature response to obliquity under a variety of background conditions conducted
         with a climate emulator using HadCM3 simulations
         <span><a>27</a></span> suggests that the climate response to obliquity is not heavily dependent on ice sheet
         extent or greenhouse gas concentrations (Supplementary Note 
         <a>4</a> and Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>11</a>, 
         <a>12</a>).
