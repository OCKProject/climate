   <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets, idealized single-forcing experiments were conducted, where only one forcing is applied while other forcings are prescribed at preindustrial levels. Simulations were conducted with the GFDL CM2.1 and the NCAR CESM1.2. Forcing parameters used for the simulations are given in Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, and a broader overview of the CM2.1 simulations is presented in past work
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>. CESM simulations were generally forced with identical values to CM2.1 simulations except for slight differences in the control values. For ice sheet-forced simulations, GFDL CM2.1 uses the ICE-5G last glacial maximum (LGM) ice sheets
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
   </span> and NCAR CESM uses the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3) LGM ice sheets, which are a blend of three ice sheet reconstructions, with added ice shelves in the western Labrador Sea

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
   </span>. Simulations were run for 500 years or longer. These experiments are here referred to as 'fingerprint' experiments, since they quantify the distinct climate response patterns to individual forcings. A different experimental design was employed for the HadCM3 simulations used in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c, d</a>, as described in Supplementary Note

  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For CM2.1 and CESM monthly output, an adjustment was typically made to the calendar. When the timing of perihelion is modified, as in some of the simulations described above, the speed at which Earth travels through different parts of its orbit is altered according to Kepler’s second law. This means that calendar months in different simulations will correspond to different parts of Earth’s orbit, complicating the interpretation of monthly anomalies. This 'calendar effect' has been described in past research
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
   </span>. To account for this complicating factor, all monthly output from CM2.1 and CESM were processed onto a common fixed-angular calendar, in which every 'month' corresponds to a 30° arc of Earth’s orbit. This calculation was done using the method described in
   <span class="sup">

  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the effects of each forcing in the past, and to allow for comparison with proxy time series data, a linear reconstruction methodology is employed. Model output from the single-forcing experiments is scaled by past forcings using an updated version of the method described in the appendix of

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
   </span>; Anomalies from the ice sheet experiment are scaled by sea level changes, which is used as an analog for ice sheet volume. The sea level record is a stack of seven different sea level records computed using different methods
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
   </span>. Potentially, uncertainties in the magnitude of obliquity variability in the sea level record could affect the results of this paper, especially if obliquity variations unrelated to sea level are also being recorded in the sea level record. However, the use of a multi-record stack rather than an individual sea level record should help reduce the impact of potential uncertainties in any particular method. It should also be noted that the climate response to ice sheets may relate to both ice sheet area and volume, but a linear scaling with sea level has been used here for simplicity. An additional source of uncertainty concerns the timing of individual ice sheet changes relative to the global mean sea level record. In the present work, the linear reconstruction assumes that all ice sheets vary synchronously with the global mean sea level record. However, evidence suggests that after the LGM, at least, Antarctic ice melt may have lagged considerably behind the global sea level changes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
   </span>. Differences between the timing or characteristics of Antarctic ice sheet changes and global sea level anomalies could affect results of this analysis, especially considering that orbital-scale variations are present in the sea level curve (see Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>).  Also note that the global mean sea level curve contains precession-scale variability approximately in line with Northern Hemisphere summer insolation; this means that the precession signal in the linear reconstruction is already largely in phase with the Antarctic ice core signals, even in the annual mean reconstruction (Supplementary Figs. 6-8).  While it is unclear how realistic this is, the seasonal averaging of the linear reconstruction still generally shifts the timing of the direct precession signal and reduces mismatch in the current analysis.  Furthermore, without quantitative knowledge of the ice sheet differences over the past few glacial periods, it is unclear how to account for this limitation in the present work. Finally, regarding greenhouse gases, by treating CH
   <sub>4</sub> as an equivalent amount of radiative forcing due to CO
   <sub>2</sub>, the effect of CH
   <sub>4</sub> can be approximated without the need for a dedicated CH
   <sub>4</sub> simulation, which can be computationally expensive. The sea level stack was already aligned to LR04, and the other forcing time series (CO
   <sub>2</sub>, CH
   <sub>4</sub>, and orbit) are left on their published age models.

  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore climate signals preserved in proxies, long proxy temperature records were selected from multiple sources. For polar records, EPICA Dome C
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span>, Dome Fuji

   </span>, and NGRIP
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
   </span> were analyzed. For other regions, many proxy records which had been compiled for a global temperature stack
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span> were used. The records in the temperature stack
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span> were aligned to the LR04 benthic stack by that study’s authors, generally using δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O to align records. The NGRIP ice core was left on its published ages
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
   </span>, with a shift so that ages are relative to year 1950 instead of 2000. The Antarctic ice core records were aligned to the annual mean linear reconstructions, with these alignments done separately for the two models used in the analysis (GFDL CM2.1 and NCAR CESM). The alignment was done using matching software
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
   </span>. If no alignment is done, offsets in the timing of deglaciations affect the results. To test that the analysis is not overly sensitive to the details of this alignment, an alternate approach was also taken: no alignment was performed on the ice core age models, but periods of deglaciation prior to the most recent one were omitted from the analysis. This alternate analysis yields results similar to the main results presented in this paper, suggesting that the details of this alignment do not overly affect the results. Not all records were well suited to the present analysis, so two selection criteria were applied. Records that span multiple orbital cycles are preferred, so any records which contained less than 100 ka of overlap with the linear reconstructions were rejected. Additionally, some records exhibit temporal variability distinctly different from the typical 'sawtooth' shape observed in the greenhouse gas and sea level forcing records, potentially because of uncertainties in the proxy temperature relationship. To remove records with unusual variability as well as records with apparent age model mismatch, records which do not match the unfitted annual mean linear reconstruction of either model with at least a coefficient of efficiency of 0.5 were excluded. This selects records, which already match the linear reconstruction somewhat well, a qualification which should be kept in mind when evaluating results.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conduct the model–data comparison, proxy records were compared to the linear reconstruction at the location of the proxy record, using modeled surface temperature for sediment cores and NGRIP and surface (2 m) air temperature for the Antarctic ice cores. To determine how much of the modeled annual mean obliquity signal was reflected in the proxy records (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), the annual mean obliquity term in the reconstruction was multiplied by a scaling factor ranging from −1000 to 1000. This results in a set of possible linear temperature reconstructions differing only by the magnitude of the direct obliquity signal. After removing the mean difference between the reconstruction and proxy, the RMSE was calculated for each version of the linear temperature reconstruction. The solution with the smallest RMSE was deemed to be the solution best supported by the proxy record. This 'best' scaling factor was used to calculate the red dots in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>. This comparison was performed for each proxy record separately.
  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine if a seasonal-weighted linear reconstruction better matched the Antarctic proxy records, RMSE was calculated between each proxy record and a set of linear temperature reconstructions computed using different monthly weightings. As opposed to the calculation described above, no aspects of the linear reconstruction were directly scaled to be larger or smaller. Instead, climate signals only changed as a result of different monthly averages. Averaging windows were centered on each month and spanned either 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 months, for a total of 72 monthly weighting combinations plus the 12-month mean (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). A boxcar weighting function was employed so that months were either included in the mean or excluded, although the use of a sinusoidal weighting function gave relatively similar results. Before computing RMSE, the mean difference between the linear reconstruction and proxy temperature time series was removed. Results are computed as RMSE for each monthly mean case divided by RMSE of the annual mean case (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Values less than 1 indicate instances in which a seasonally weighted reconstruction better matches the proxy record.
