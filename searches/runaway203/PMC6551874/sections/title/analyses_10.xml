 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To predict the most common migratory areas, we converted the annual distribution models for the fall and spring seasons to binary models using the ‘reclassify’ tool in ArcGIS 10.5. Predicted presences were differentiated from predicted absences using the threshold between 0 and 1 that minimized the total error rate for each model [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]. We calculated the total area of predicted presence for each year by multiplying the number of presence pixels by the pixel area (500 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>). We also calculated the mean latitude and mean longitude of observed telemetry locations in spring and fall to quantify geographic shifts among years. For both migratory seasons, we summed models across years to determine the number of years each pixel was predicted to have been used by caribou. From these, we identified primary migratory areas that were predicted to have been used repeatedly by caribou across the study area in both spring and fall. We also used ArcGIS to calculate the mean pixel values of the top environmental predictors in areas of predicted presence and absence in spring and fall. We intentionally excluded a spatial land cover predictor from the model to subsequently evaluate proportional land cover use independently in relation to predicted distribution areas. We related predicted presence areas during migratory seasons with a comprehensive land cover map of the region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>] using the tabulate area tool in ArcGIS. We calculated landcover selection by dividing the percentage of pixels predicted as presences in each cover type by the percentage of pixels of that cover type available in the study area.
