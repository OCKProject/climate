 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on our environmental niche models, we found that caribou were predicted to select lowland tussock tundra, tall shrubs and herbaceous cover types in spring and fall. The selection of tussock tundra and herbaceous cover types are similar to other habitat selection research in the region, however the selection for tall shrubs runs counter to other results [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. In an analysis of caribou movement through NOAT using step-selection functions, caribou exhibited random-walk behavior, and exploited areas of tussock tundra and dwarf shrubs, while avoiding tall shrubs, rugged terrain, and rivers [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. Such selection is consistent with caribou maximizing energetic efficiency and seeking out areas of optimal forage, namely patches of exposed lichen in warm microclimates, especially on the south side of the Brooks Range [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>]. In fall and winter, caribou obtained ~ 71% of their forage from lichens, whereas the next most important forage types, moss and shrubs comprised just 20% [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>]. In fact, lichens typically comprised 65–70% of the diet of migratory caribou with substantial predation pressure in Alaska [

 <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results did not show any major influence of topographic variables (e.g., elevation, aspect, slope, terrain ruggedness) in models for any season or year. However, there was a positive relationship between occurrence and elevation above 200 m and an inverse relationship with terrain ruggedness. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. Similarly, caribou in the Porcupine Herd were shown to use corridors at higher elevations but with relatively gentle terrain, while avoiding spruce forests, steep mountains, and wet lowlands [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>]. Together these results suggest that caribou follow energetically efficient courses through snow-free areas to minimize locomotive resistance and maximize available forage, while largely conforming to learned directional orientation to guide migration [
