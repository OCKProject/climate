 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the first time, we were able to quantitatively predict the repeated use of the major WAH migratory areas during spring and fall at a 500 m scale. The 4 main areas used during spring and fall were along both the western and eastern boundaries of KOVA, the western edge of the Baird Mountains, north of Noorvik, and along the west coast through CAKR. These areas were used with varied intensity and frequency, but all were used at least 5 of the 8 years of the study period. Seasonal distribution models developed here provide the highest resolution predictions of spatio-temporal patterns and variation of the WAH, while remaining consistent with other prior distribution estimates (see [

 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cross-validated model accuracy was excellent for the more stationary seasons (calving, insect-relief, and winter), and these models were also spatially accurate when evaluated against the 2017–18 seasonal WAH telemetry dataset (Mean Residuals 
  <span class="underline">&lt;</span> 0.12). Model accuracy during the more transitory periods (spring, fall, and late summer) was good, but models for spring and fall did not predict as well to the 2017–18 data. Their good internal model accuracy (88.45 and 83.22% respectively), yet high mean residuals and large standard deviations (0.39 
  <span class="italic">± 0.30</span> and 0.30 
  <span class="italic">± .13</span>, respectively), are further evidence of the large inter-annual variability in migratory distributions of the WAH.

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a similar investigation, Nicholson et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>] used a Brownian-Bridge analysis to determine that caribou in the CAH also used a variety of routes each year, reflecting variability in individual navigation and decision making. They found, similar to our models for the WAH, that despite annual variability in distributions, specific areas were used repeatedly by caribou. These results, taken with the longitudinal and latitudinal variation from year to year, support the notion that caribou are adaptable in the location and timing of migration, and responsive to local conditions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>], while retaining a collective memory of landscapes over time [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. This also implies that while certain areas may be favored by caribou over the long-term and used repeatedly, migration and ultimately harvest success in any given year will vary substantially. For example, in 2010 when the mean distribution of the WAH in fall was farthest to the east, communities around Kotzebue Sound (e.g., Noatak, Kiana, and Selawik) were unable to harvest any caribou that year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Since then, the mean longitude of caribou during migration has trended to the westward extreme before returning to the mean during the final year of our study. Successful management of the WAH should recognize this full range of geographic potential, while focusing conservation efforts on the most-frequently used migratory areas outlined above.
