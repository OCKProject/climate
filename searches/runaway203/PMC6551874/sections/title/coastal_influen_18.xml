 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also documented a correlation between the predicted occurrence of caribou and coastal features, as evidenced by the moderate importance of the distance to coast and mean sea ice extent predictors in many of the caribou distribution models. In both the fall and spring models, we predicted caribou to occur within 160 km of the coast. In spring, this predicted area of occurrence was directly adjacent to the coast (&lt; 25 km) and spring ice on Kotzebue Sound, where snow is windswept and packed. In fall they were predicted to occur more than 35 km from the coast. This more inland migration would bring them through the warmer, drier areas east of Kotzebue Sound where the growing season is longer. Such a seasonal, clockwise movement may help the herd avoid recently-foraged areas while also extending forage access later into the fall. During the insect avoidance season, caribou were predicted to occur within 60 km of the coast, potentially to take advantage of ocean winds and cooler temperatures that keep insects at bay [

 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted distribution of caribou in spring and fall also corresponded with the proximity to the mean maximum and minimum sea ice extents (Table

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). While this relationship could coincidentally stem from the existing geographic range of the WAH near two oceans, the associations between caribou and sea ice extent could also be indicative of the direct or indirect influences of sea ice on climate, land cover, and by extension, on the distribution of the WAH [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>]. Sea ice loss has been shown to indirectly affect terrestrial ecosystems through changes in climate that lengthen the growing season, promote the increase of summer plant biomass (as indicated by NDVI) [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>] and increase the amount of fall snowfall, which in turn insulates and raises ground temperatures [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. Associations with the minimum ice extent in both spring and fall were strongest when caribou were between 450 and 750 km away from the ice edge, likely reflecting only the geographic position the WAH in the region. In contrast, the correlation with mean maximum sea ice in spring were evident at much closer distances, indicating the possibility of direct effects as well. Furthermore, telemetry data show that some WAH caribou even traveled over sea ice to cross Kotzebue Sound [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>], so the loss of sea ice as a travel medium, much like an increase in snow depth or water content, could theoretically increase the energetic costs of migrating WAH caribou as well [
