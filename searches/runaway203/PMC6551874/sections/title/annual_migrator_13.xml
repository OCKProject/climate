 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Annual models during migration seasons provided the means to identify areas of repeated use representing favored migratory habitat. The size of predicted distributions varied annually in size between 21,641 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and 74,071 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> between 2009 and 2017 (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Annual predictions of migration patterns varied geographically over the study period with the predicted core of the WAH shifting longitudinally from year to year. We documented an easterly trend in predicted distribution prior to 2012 that became westerly in subsequent years (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). Spring models ranged from between 235 km to the east and 148 km to the west of the mean longitude and between 199 km to the east and 246 km to the west of the fall model mean (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). The average latitude varied somewhat between 97 km south and 58 km north of the pooled spring model mean and between 75 km south and 112 km north of the pooled fall model mean (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>).

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We summed the annual binary model predictions to identify 4 frequently used habitats (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>). Areas consistently predicted as presences during both seasons in 5–7 of the 8 years included the area along the western extent of the Baird Mountains (Area 2), the uplands along the western boundary of KOVA near Kiana (Area 3), and along the eastern boundary of KOVA west of Ambler (Area 4). Area 1 which traverses the CAKR coastline past Kotzebue was mainly used in fall, and Area 2 which crosses the Kobuk River north of Noorvik was used primarily in spring. Each year at least 1 alternative migratory area was used in addition to the primary one, however south of the Kobuk River, predicted presences in each year converged on a single main area arcing around Kotzebue Sound and west into BELA. Through this area, models predicted caribou farther inland during the fall than in the spring (Figs.

  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>,
