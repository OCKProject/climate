 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Animals undertake a variety of movements based on both intrinsic and external factors including climate, food availability, competition, and predation risk [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Movement decisions are made at a range of scales from individual steps (length and direction) [

  <span class="italic">Rangifer tarandus</span>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Migration is often defined as the cyclical movement of populations between disjunct ranges as a means of increasing fitness as populations seek quality forage and avoid seasonally abundant pests and predators [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prevalence and length of long-distance terrestrial migrations have been steadily declining and phenology has been altered due to a range of limiting factors. Impediments to movement include barriers such as transportation corridors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], fences [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>], urban and industrial development [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>], unavailable forage and habitat [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>], and unstable ice and snow conditions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. These obstacles cause animals to expend additional time and energy to navigate. Disturbances to seasonal movements of herds may also include wildfires, high densities of hunters, predators, or development near migratory bottlenecks or stopover sites [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Because migration routes are difficult to restore once interrupted, identifying and conserving important migratory areas now should be a top priority for land managers [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alaska includes over 30 herds of caribou distributed throughout the state, although many of these are smaller herds that undertake only local migrations or none at all [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. Four large migratory herds range across the Brooks Range in northern Alaska. The largest among these is the Western Arctic Herd (WAH), comprising 259,000 individuals in 2017 and distributed seasonally across over 360,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of northwestern Alaska (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. After reaching its historic nadir of 75,000 individuals in 1976, the WAH grew rapidly to nearly 490,000 animals, making it one of the largest caribou herds in the world in 2003 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. By 2016, the herd had declined 60% to 201,000 animals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. During their typical annual migratory cycle, WAH caribou travel from wintering grounds on and near the Seward Peninsula, over the Brooks Range to calve on the North Slope. They then make their way towards the coast to escape insect harassment in mid-summer before returning south again in fall to their wintering grounds. The straight-line, round-trip distance between their winter and calving areas exceeds 1000 km, which is among the longest terrestrial migrations on the planet [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Caribou wander extensively and their total annual movements exceed 4400 km [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>].

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The WAH is one of the most important subsistence resources in northwest Alaska, providing local rural residents from over 40 communities with 11,000 caribou annually [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. During the 2000s, rural residents began to observe shifts in migrations away from communities, changes in herd phenology, and a decrease in the number and quality of caribou available for harvest [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. On average, sport hunters comprised roughly 5% of the total harvest each year until 2016 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. These user groups have come into conflict as traditional harvesters have perceived aircraft noise, often associated with sport hunting to be disruptive to caribou movements [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. However, research has not found influence of hunter activity on herd behavior at caribou movements at broad scales in the Noatak River Valley [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. In an effort to stem the herd’s decline, managers instituted closures for sport hunting and limits on traditional harvest in 2016 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. At this time, the herd is showing signs of recovering survival and recruitment rates [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. The health of the herd and the location of migratory movements from year to year will determine the success of subsistence harvesters who rely on caribou for their own food security.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, human development has been shown to influence caribou distributions during all seasons [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Transportation and industrial corridors such as frequently-traveled roads and railways as well as pipelines and seismic lines can act as barriers by delaying or interrupting crossing, especially when perpendicular to the direct of travel [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Roads and railways are also direct sources of mortality through collisions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>] and increased vigilance around these obstacles may also reduce foraging efficiency, harming individual health. Wilson et al. documented a delay in collared, female WAH caribou by an average of 33 days while crossing the Red Dog Mine road [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. The distribution of the CAH during calving in the Prudhoe Bay area has also been shown to be inversely related to road density and to shift at least 5 km away from pipelines and roads with even limited traffic levels of 100–200 vehicles/day, although they may use these areas during the insect relief season [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. Other disturbances associated with concentrations of humans that may affect caribou include noise disturbance from water- and aircraft [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>], and industrial machinery [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to anthropogenic impediments, caribou distribution patterns in northern Alaska are related to a collection of climate-induced effects including increased fire frequency and vegetative biomass, which act to convert lichen tundra to shrub-lands [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>], reducing available winter forage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Global climate change is already resulting in stronger and more intense storms and deeper snow-packs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>], but also more frequent rain-on-snow events that increase snow-pack density [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Such conditions make it difficult for caribou to access lichens and to travel efficiently in winter and spring [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. The size of the WAH has also been shown to vary with changes in the PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>], where positive phases (warmer conditions) tend to correlate with herd growth and larger population sizes versus smaller, declining populations during negative phases (colder conditions) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Furthermore, the dramatic decrease in sea ice extent observed over the past decades has also been hypothesized to affect caribou through changes in weather patterns, especially during the insect-avoidance season [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. The combined effects of shifting mean temperatures and precipitation, prevailing winds, insect phenology, and plant growth, affect the forage availability, predation rates, calf recruitment, individual body condition and ultimately the population distribution of the WAH throughout the year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying seasonal ranges, defining migratory habitat and detecting changes in caribou distributions and migration geography over time are among the stated monitoring objectives for the National Park Service [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>], and providing up-to-date information to local communities may help them to adapt to a rapidly changing Arctic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Despite regular research to estimate herd size, studies to quantify and track migratory areas in northern Alaska have only been conducted for the Central Arctic Herd (CAH) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. The factors behind WAH population dynamics, migratory patterns, and overall health are numerous and interactive, so deciphering these drivers and identifying impediments requires a multivariate approach that can incorporate dozens of variables. Here we use the machine learning algorithm, TreeNet, to analyze GPS telemetry data for the WAH over 8 years. This approach uses associations between caribou and the environment to develop accurate predictive models, identify important system predictors, and define non-linear responses. Our goals were to 1) model caribou seasonal distributions and change, 2) relate caribou occurrence to climatic, anthropogenic, and topographic predictors, and 3) to identify migratory areas predicted to have been used consistently by the WAH over the past decade. We hope these results may help to conserve an important regional subsistence resource and promote the preservation of one of the largest and longest remaining terrestrial migrations in the world.
