 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We developed ecological niche models that accurately predicted the relative occurrence of WAH caribou over 8 years based on relationships with 37 environmental predictors. We used these models to make inference to the geographic fidelity of caribou migrations, to identify non-linear thresholds in the environmental conditions most associated with predicted caribou distributions, and to rank their use of specific land cover types during migration. TreeNet’s recursive decision tree analysis allowed us to parse and predict this complex and interactive system. Important predictors in most models were primarily associated with 1) climate, 2) coastal features, and 3) human infrastructure. Our analysis also provides detailed and spatially-precise predictions of the migratory tendencies of WAH caribou and what environmental conditions are associated with movement patterns.</p>

  <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the first time, we were able to quantitatively predict the repeated use of the major WAH migratory areas during spring and fall at a 500 m scale. The 4 main areas used during spring and fall were along both the western and eastern boundaries of KOVA, the western edge of the Baird Mountains, north of Noorvik, and along the west coast through CAKR. These areas were used with varied intensity and frequency, but all were used at least 5 of the 8 years of the study period. Seasonal distribution models developed here provide the highest resolution predictions of spatio-temporal patterns and variation of the WAH, while remaining consistent with other prior distribution estimates (see [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]).
  </p>
  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cross-validated model accuracy was excellent for the more stationary seasons (calving, insect-relief, and winter), and these models were also spatially accurate when evaluated against the 2017–18 seasonal WAH telemetry dataset (Mean Residuals 
   <span class="underline">&lt;</span> 0.12). Model accuracy during the more transitory periods (spring, fall, and late summer) was good, but models for spring and fall did not predict as well to the 2017–18 data. Their good internal model accuracy (88.45 and 83.22% respectively), yet high mean residuals and large standard deviations (0.39 
   <span class="italic">± 0.30</span> and 0.30 
   <span class="italic">± .13</span>, respectively), are further evidence of the large inter-annual variability in migratory distributions of the WAH.
  </p>
  <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a similar investigation, Nicholson et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>] used a Brownian-Bridge analysis to determine that caribou in the CAH also used a variety of routes each year, reflecting variability in individual navigation and decision making. They found, similar to our models for the WAH, that despite annual variability in distributions, specific areas were used repeatedly by caribou. These results, taken with the longitudinal and latitudinal variation from year to year, support the notion that caribou are adaptable in the location and timing of migration, and responsive to local conditions [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>], while retaining a collective memory of landscapes over time [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. This also implies that while certain areas may be favored by caribou over the long-term and used repeatedly, migration and ultimately harvest success in any given year will vary substantially. For example, in 2010 when the mean distribution of the WAH in fall was farthest to the east, communities around Kotzebue Sound (e.g., Noatak, Kiana, and Selawik) were unable to harvest any caribou that year [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Since then, the mean longitude of caribou during migration has trended to the westward extreme before returning to the mean during the final year of our study. Successful management of the WAH should recognize this full range of geographic potential, while focusing conservation efforts on the most-frequently used migratory areas outlined above.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate</div>
  <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the variable importance rankings and partial dependence plots for individual predictors (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), WAH distribution during spring migration was largely predicted by 4 climatic variables (winter precipitation, PET, fall temperature, and snow-free date) all of which help to determine snow conditions across the region during migration. Winter precipitation and PET were important predictors in both spring and fall, and migrating caribou were predicted to occur in areas with low to moderate levels of winter precipitation and moderate PET. The importance of potential evapotranspiration in all of the seasonal models highlights a strong association between the WAH and broad-scale abiotic factors that determine PET across the region, including temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind, and biomass. This association corresponds with other results that demonstrated increasing herd size during positive (warm) phases of the PDO and a decreasing population during periods of low (cool) PDO [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. Areas in Alaska with the lowest PET occur primarily north of the Brooks Range and on the Seward Peninsula, compared to the warmer, drier conditions more common to interior Alaska. Likewise, most of the WAH range coincides with an area of northwest Alaska that receives moderate winter precipitation (50–120 mm) as compared to the higher totals found at the highest elevations or in the ranges of other arctic caribou herds. Areas receiving moderate amounts of fall precipitation or cool mean annual ground temperatures were also associated with caribou distribution in fall, corresponding to a similar area encompassing the northern Seward Peninsula, western Brooks Range, and western coast where caribou occur during fall. At the local scale, when posed with a range of available conditions in the Brooks Range, caribou were predicted to occur in valleys or west-facing ridges, where PET was higher and snow cover was shallower than higher elevations and on east facing aspects.
  </p>
  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earlier snow free dates were also highly predictive of caribou in spring, whereas a longer growing season was predictive of caribou in fall. In contrast to PET and winter precipitation trends which vary primarily across wider scales, the tight correspondence between early snow free date and areas predicted to have been repeatedly used by caribou in spring is apparent at a much finer local scale (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. Snow cover has previously been shown to affect the timing and habitat selection of migrating caribou as they seek out patches of emergent forage where snow has melted [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>]. Caribou have evolved exceptionally efficient locomotion such that the energy required to move is exceeded by the amount of forage they are able to obtain from new patches of high quality forage [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. However, sinking through deep or crusted snow increases energy expenditure exponentially, so encountering such conditions during migration could cause delays that result in phenological and geographic mismatches during calving that could ultimately lead to starvation. This may explain why caribou were not predicted to occur in areas of late snow melt (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>d) and were predicted to travel closer to the coast in spring (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>) on wind-packed snow or sea ice. To avoid poor snow conditions, spring migration is often constricted into areas where animals develop packed trails that tend to follow windswept terrain that hardens snow [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>] and aids locomotion or other areas with low snow accumulation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caribou also selected areas of tussock tundra and areas with tall shrubs during migration (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>) but did not select forested habitats. Tall vegetation can impede movements, reduce visibility and increase snow depth, which may account for caribou selecting tussock tundra during spring migration. This explanation runs counterintuitive to the predicted selection for tall shrubs, however. Tall shrubs tend to occur in riparian valleys, where caribou were often predicted to occur, so selection for this tall cover type could be coincident with other suitable environmental conditions in Brooks Range valleys. The winter model also showed caribou using areas with less than complete or shallow snow cover (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>f). Caribou may be using areas which tend to be snow free longer in fall and spring, and which have lower relative snow depths in winter, providing them with better traveling conditions and more accessible forage. Our models predicted WAH caribou to occur in areas where moderate precipitation and relatively warmer temperatures lead to earlier snow melt, and we surmise that these combine to minimize thermodynamic and nutritional stress throughout the year.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coastal influences</div>
  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also documented a correlation between the predicted occurrence of caribou and coastal features, as evidenced by the moderate importance of the distance to coast and mean sea ice extent predictors in many of the caribou distribution models. In both the fall and spring models, we predicted caribou to occur within 160 km of the coast. In spring, this predicted area of occurrence was directly adjacent to the coast (&lt; 25 km) and spring ice on Kotzebue Sound, where snow is windswept and packed. In fall they were predicted to occur more than 35 km from the coast. This more inland migration would bring them through the warmer, drier areas east of Kotzebue Sound where the growing season is longer. Such a seasonal, clockwise movement may help the herd avoid recently-foraged areas while also extending forage access later into the fall. During the insect avoidance season, caribou were predicted to occur within 60 km of the coast, potentially to take advantage of ocean winds and cooler temperatures that keep insects at bay [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted distribution of caribou in spring and fall also corresponded with the proximity to the mean maximum and minimum sea ice extents (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>f Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). While this relationship could coincidentally stem from the existing geographic range of the WAH near two oceans, the associations between caribou and sea ice extent could also be indicative of the direct or indirect influences of sea ice on climate, land cover, and by extension, on the distribution of the WAH [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>]. Sea ice loss has been shown to indirectly affect terrestrial ecosystems through changes in climate that lengthen the growing season, promote the increase of summer plant biomass (as indicated by NDVI) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>] and increase the amount of fall snowfall, which in turn insulates and raises ground temperatures [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. Associations with the minimum ice extent in both spring and fall were strongest when caribou were between 450 and 750 km away from the ice edge, likely reflecting only the geographic position the WAH in the region. In contrast, the correlation with mean maximum sea ice in spring were evident at much closer distances, indicating the possibility of direct effects as well. Furthermore, telemetry data show that some WAH caribou even traveled over sea ice to cross Kotzebue Sound [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>]. The decrease in sea ice extent in arctic Canada has caused Peary caribou to experience an increase in landscape resistance of 15% [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>], so the loss of sea ice as a travel medium, much like an increase in snow depth or water content, could theoretically increase the energetic costs of migrating WAH caribou as well [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human infrastructure</div>
  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also showed that caribou were negatively associated with roads at distances less than 20–100 km away during the spring, calving, insect-avoidance, late summer, and winter seasons (although there was no correlation in fall), and distance to roads was among the top predictors in each of these models (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). These trends may reflect the tendency of the WAH to occur in the geographic space between the Delong Mountain Transportation System (also known as the Red Dog Mine road), the road north of the community of Kobuk, and roads emanating from Nome. However, during the insect relief season, some WAH caribou were predicted to use habitat near the coast, placing them in an area closer to the Red Dog Mine road, yet they were still not predicted to occur within 20 km of the road (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>e). This distance towards the upper end of previously reported zones of influence by roads that extended 14–23 km [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>]. Wilson et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>] found that 30% of WAH caribou traveling within 15 km of the Red Dog Mine road were delayed by an average of 33 days during fall migration. Moreover, Leblond et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>] documented a road-displacement distance of 5 km and that a majority of their study population failed to cross a highway which lead to a loss of &gt; 50% of their range. Our models are consistent with this and other research that show caribou tending not to occur near human infrastructure, including roads, communities, and developed areas [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>]. For example, the density of females and calves in the CAH was shown to be low within 4–6 km of linear features within the herd’s calving area, although the herd did not avoid the area during other seasons [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>,

  </p>
  <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our models indicated a dissociation between caribou and towns during the spring, calving, insect-relief, and winter (but not fall) seasons by 20–75 km (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), with distance to community ranked among the top 10 predictors of 37 in all models (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The predicted tendency for caribou to occur away from communities may be best exemplified by their absence around the community of Noatak, but is also visible in the immediate vicinities of Kobuk, Kiana, Noorvik, Selawik, and Kotzebue in models and telemetry records (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>). Their predicted lack of occurrence near Noatak could also be related to spruce forests found in the valley, as caribou were predicted in treeless land cover types in much greater proportion relative to their availability (Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). However, the potential exists for caribou to be disturbed by noise from motorized equipment and airstrips that can be detected as far as 30 km of communities [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>], and begs further investigation. In contrast, caribou were weakly associated with communities within 75 km distance during fall, suggesting either that caribou are either less concerned with disturbances during this season, or that following preferred habitat during the southward migration brings them closer to more communities. In other words, communities may have historically been intentionally placed within preferred fall migratory areas, but shifting migratory patterns may be altering this association. While the passage of caribou may still continue in the vicinity of anthropogenic disturbances, the timing and duration of migration can be delayed in developed areas, and broader effects on population health have not yet been demonstrated [

  <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on our environmental niche models, we found that caribou were predicted to select lowland tussock tundra, tall shrubs and herbaceous cover types in spring and fall. The selection of tussock tundra and herbaceous cover types are similar to other habitat selection research in the region, however the selection for tall shrubs runs counter to other results [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. In an analysis of caribou movement through NOAT using step-selection functions, caribou exhibited random-walk behavior, and exploited areas of tussock tundra and dwarf shrubs, while avoiding tall shrubs, rugged terrain, and rivers [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. Such selection is consistent with caribou maximizing energetic efficiency and seeking out areas of optimal forage, namely patches of exposed lichen in warm microclimates, especially on the south side of the Brooks Range [
