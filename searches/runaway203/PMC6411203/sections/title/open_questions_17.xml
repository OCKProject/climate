 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As summarized in the past sections, over the last few years, we have gained substantial understanding of the past and future evolution of the ice cover. The most robust of these insights have been derived from a combination of model simulations and observational records, primarily records of sea-ice concentration. Based on this recent progress, we believe that we have a good first-order understanding of the trajectory of the future Arctic Ocean towards a possibly seasonal ice cover. However, many of the details of this trajectory remain poorly understood. We see the following four issues as the most important open questions regarding our understanding of the past and future trajectory of the Arctic sea-ice cover.</p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, we lack understanding of the different pathways by which the ocean and the atmosphere translate changes in the external forcing and their own internal variability into changes of the ice cover. For example, the pathways by which heat is transported to the central Arctic Ocean are not clear. A recent study found that in 11 CMIP5 models, the heat required to melt the ice cover enters the Arctic via the atmosphere. In 11 other CMIP5 models, it enters the Arctic via the ocean, and in four CMIP5 models, both oceanic and atmospheric pathways supply net heat to the Arctic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>]. This uncertainty is also reflected by the split between either atmospheric [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>] or oceanic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>] processes that have been suggested to be the main contributor to the observed evolution of the Arctic ice cover.
 </p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, we lack understanding of the regional evolution of the ice cover. For example, a regional analysis of trends in Arctic sea-ice coverage over recent decades has established substantial differences in response to the large-scale global warming [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>]. To understand these regional differences, we need to understand how the large-scale changes in the forcing are regionally translated into changes in the dynamics and thermodynamics of the ice cover. So far, only few studies address this topic. For example, variability of sea ice in the Barents Sea has been linked to large-scale changes in atmospheric flow regimes as captured by the North-Atlantic-Oscillation (NAO, [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>]), raising the possibility of a slow down of regional sea-ice loss in this region with a shift in the NAO index.
 </p>
 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, we lack understanding of many of the implications of the ongoing ice loss. For example, a number of studies have suggested that the large-scale sea-ice loss might affect atmospheric circulation patterns and mid-latitude weather systems (see, for example, reviews [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>â€“
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>]). In observational records, such link is probably hidden among substantial internal variability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>]. In modeling studies, the importance of a possible link depends critically on the experimental design [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>], raising questions on the robustness of inferred linkages in existing studies.
 </p>
 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourth, we lack a good understanding of the past and future evolution of sea-ice volume. This is related to the lack of a sufficiently long and sufficiently reliable observational record of sea-ice volume, to uncertainties in reanalyzed sea-ice volume [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>], and to a failure of many CMIP5 models to reproduce the observed distribution and time evolution of sea-ice thickness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>].
