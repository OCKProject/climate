 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future trajectory of the Arctic sea-ice cover can be described through a deterministic component arising primarily from future greenhouse gas emissions, and a chaotic component arising from internal variability. The deterministic component is expected to cause a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer for less than 2 
  <span class="sup">âˆ˜</span>C global warming relative to pre-industrial levels. To keep chances below 5 % that the Arctic Ocean will largely be ice free in a given year, total future CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions must remain below 500 Gt.
