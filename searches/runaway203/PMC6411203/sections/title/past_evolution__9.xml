 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major role of changes in the external forcing for the past evolution of Arctic sea ice has been identified both in the observational record and in model simulations. In particular, both in models and in observations the Arctic sea-ice coverage (i.e., sea-ice area or sea-ice extent) during summer is linearly related to the rise in global-mean temperature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>] suggest a simple conceptual model to explain the linearity, establishing an underlying causal relationship between temperature rise and Arctic sea-ice loss. Linear correlations have also been established between the evolution of Arctic summer sea ice and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>] and cumulative anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. These individual correlations are directly related to each other, because anthropogenic emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub> are also the main driver of the observed warming of the atmosphere [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], and the relationship between temperature rise and CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions has been largely linear in the past.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The linear relationships between the external drivers and Arctic sea-ice coverage do not only hold during summer, but have been shown to hold for all months, both for temperature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>] and for cumulative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. For the linear regression against CO
  <sub>2</sub>, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> values range between 0.75 and 0.92 for every month of the year over the period 1953–2017 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. This suggests that the majority of the ice loss across all seasons can directly be explained by the anthropogenic release of CO
  <sub>2</sub>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other changes in external forcing have only had a limited impact on the sea-ice cover in the past few decades. For example, the observational record shows no substantial co-variation of Arctic sea ice with changes in solar activity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. In particular, the slight weakening of solar activity since the early 2000s is inconsistent with the ongoing rapid loss of Arctic sea ice. Large observed volcanic eruptions such as El Chichon in 1982 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991 caused a small increase in simulated sea-ice coverage in the ensemble mean of large ensemble simulations, but their impact can not be identified in individual simulations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. This is particularly relevant given that the impact of volcanic eruptions has been suggested to be overestimated in CMIP5 model simulations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. Hence, natural changes in the external forcing have not played a major role for the observed evolution of the Arctic sea-ice cover.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also anthropogenic aerosols have probably been of limited importance for the observed evolution of the Arctic sea-ice cover in recent decades. This is because their abundance has remained largely unchanged in the recent past, which is why it is unlikely that aerosols contributed much to the observed rapid loss of sea-ice evolution [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>].
