The potential distribution resulting from our models covered a large part of western Korea, situated between ca. 100 and 700 meters above sea level west of the Baekdudaegan Mountain Range (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). There is also a disjunct area of high suitability located to the northeast in the Pyeongchang area, which matches with reports of the species in that region

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all RCPs, suitable area is expected to increase by 2050. However, for RCPs 6.0 and 8.5, suitable area will decrease significantly by 2070. The most favorable scenarios for suitable habitat (RCPs 2.6 and 4.5) resulted in increases of 243% and 275%, respectively, in suitable habitat area by 2070, while the less favorable scenarios (RCPs 6.0 and 8.5) resulted in decreases of 40% and 39%, respectively, in suitable area by 2070 (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Similarly, occurrence points located within suitable areas will be maintained through 2070 for RCPs 2.6 and 4.5 but will fall to 25.9% and 18.0% in RCPs 6.0 and 8.5, respectively (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, Fig.

   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), the three highest-contributing bioclimatic variables in order were Bio14 (precipitation of driest month), Bio4 (temperature seasonality), and Bio3 (isothermality). Similarly, Bio14 had the highest contribution and second highest permutation importance, the response to which was an increase in presence probability with precipitation in mm during the driest month. The variables with the lowest contributions were Bio2 (mean diurnal range), Bio6 (minimum temperature of coldest month), and Bio16 (precipitation of wettest quarter). However, Bio6 had the highest average permutation importance.
