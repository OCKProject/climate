  <span class="italic">Karsenia koreana</span>. Its breeding behaviour was observed for the first time in 2016, but it still lacks any formal description in the wild
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. The species is not as stringently bound to the aquatic environment as other amphibians due to the absence of a larval stage

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>

  <span class="italic">K. koreana</span> breeds and lays eggs on land and where they develop directly into adults without a larval stage

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until recently, 
  <span class="italic">K. koreana</span> had only been found at a few locations under rocks on moist hills of montane woodlands with limestone soils

  </span>, while other plethodontid salamanders are described in a range of different habitats 
  <span class="italic">e.g</span>., aquatic, fossorial, arboreal, stream, terrestrial or cave

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
