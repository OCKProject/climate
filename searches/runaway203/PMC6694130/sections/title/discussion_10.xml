 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results highlight a significantly larger habitat suitable for 
  <span class="italic">Karsenia koreana</span> than is the current known distribution of the species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span>. The fact that the model matches with the known presence in counties
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span> and five other data points
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>
  </span>. highlights the accuracy of our prediction. Discrepancies are not impossible as precise spatial modelling from a low number of samples can result in large variations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>
  </span>. The range of the species may be restricted by additional factors that could not be included in the model, such as competition. As an example, within plethodontid salamander, spatial distributions can be influenced by interference competition to complete competitive exclusion
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>
  </span>. Second, salamanders may have been extirpated from some parts of the range, for instance during the Korean War when logging was intensive. However, Plethodontids are lungless ectotherms, and it appears that their activity and geographic distribution is predominantly controlled by climate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>
  </span>. Finally, salamanders may exist in areas where they have not been discovered yet, which introduces a bias in the ecological preferences of the species, and on the SDM as a result. Additional field surveys are required to clearly record the occurrence of the species, and further observations would improve the precision of habitat suitability models.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite this potentially larger new range, the threat status of 
  <span class="italic">K. koreana</span> is still unresolved, as species with a limited range have often larger projected habitat loss and are more prone to extinction
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>
  </span>, and a present point of concern in the Republic of Korea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>
  </span>. The results of Maxent modelling identify areas that are potentially important habitats for 
  <span class="italic">K. koreana</span> and provide researchers with new potential survey locations. These results can inform future conservation efforts for the species in terms of protecting important habitat areas; the ranges calculated for habitat suitability fall within different threat levels of the IUCN red list of endangered species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
  </span>, and 
  <span class="italic">K. koreana</span> would thus join the list of endangered species from the Korean Peninsula
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>
  </span>. Additionally, acquiring the exact area of occupancy of the species would be important for ecological monitoring as 
  <span class="italic">K. koreana</span> is likely to be sensitive to the newly emerged Chytrid fungus 
  <span class="italic">Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>
  </span>. This fungus may soon be present in the Republic of Korea because of the pet trade, the same way it found its way to Europe
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>
  </span>, and the same way the anuran Chytrid fungus entered Korea

  </span>.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies evaluating the effect of climate change on amphibian populations are based on both breeding phenology
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">97</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">98</a>
  </span> and range shifts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, the impact of agriculture on amphibian assemblages is well-studied and has been found to have two main types of impacts: landscape fragmentation (reviewed by Cushman 2006
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>
  </span>) and chemical use (reviewed by Mann 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">100</a>
  </span>). The predicted range of suitability resulting from Maxent modelling is an increase of 80% from the current IUCN range of 5,687 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (or 1.8 times the IUCN range). This area contains 93.8% of the observed points, so it can be considered an improvement of the IUCN range, which only contains 51.4% of the observed points. Because some of the predicted areas are fragmented or too small, or because the species may not manage to disperse there, it is likely that the actual range will be smaller than the predicted 10,261 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. Additionally, there are areas with medium to high suitability where the species has yet to be recorded.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The jackknife analysis indicates that precipitation is likely a limiting environmental factor in the range of 
  <span class="italic">K. koreana</span>, and that the species requires sufficient precipitation in the dry winter months to persist. Projections for all RCPs indicate that future habitats for 
  <span class="italic">K. koreana</span> will be fragmented. In all cases, the suitable range for the species will shift, in which case the species may require translocation to persist. With continued development of natural areas by humans, translocation to more remote areas that already have protected status may be necessary. For instance, Baekdudaegan Mountains Reserve is currently outside the suitable range for 
  <span class="italic">K. koreana</span>, but projections indicate the species may be able to inhabit areas in the reserve in the future. Since the goal of this modelling was to determine effects of climate change on 
  <span class="italic">K. koreana</span>, this model leaves out other potentially important environmental factors, such as greenness and wetness. These factors will likely change along with the climate, and therefore, current maps of these factors could not be used in projections for this study.
