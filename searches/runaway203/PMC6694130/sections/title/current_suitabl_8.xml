  </span>. The IUCN range did not include the areas with high suitability in the northwestern and southern regions of the country. The potential distribution resulting from our models covered a large part of western Korea, situated between ca. 100 and 700 meters above sea level west of the Baekdudaegan Mountain Range (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). There is also a disjunct area of high suitability located to the northeast in the Pyeongchang area, which matches with reports of the species in that region

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Maxent modelling of current climate conditions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) produced a range of suitable habitat (cloglog output above the 10-percentile training presence threshold of 0.1964) was 10,261 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. This model had an averaged AUC of 0.984 ± 0.007 and TSS of 0.869 ± 0.017 and could therefore be accepted as a model for the species’ habitat suitability. Suitable area thresholded at the 10-percentile training presence covered 93.6% of total presence points including 14 of the 15 counties, cities, and districts reported in The Encyclopedia of Korean Amphibians
