  <p>Probability density functions (PDFs) of the threshold temperature for Arctic summer sea ice (red) and temperature increase (blue) at 2100. The PDFs are shown for 
   <span class="bold">a</span> T20 and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> business as usual. Joint probability density function (green) between the PDFs is shown on the plain spanned by temperature increase and threshold temperature axis. The domain for integration to obtain the probability of exceeding threshold is colored with gray
