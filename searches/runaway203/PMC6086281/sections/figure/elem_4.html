         <p>Probability density functions (PDFs) of the threshold temperature for Greenland ice
            sheet (red) and temperature increase (blue) at 2100. The PDFs are shown for 
            <span>a</span> T20 and 
            <span>b</span> business as usual. Joint probability density function (green) between the PDFs is
            shown on the plain spanned by temperature increase and threshold temperature axis.
            The domain for integration to obtain the probability of exceeding threshold is colored
            with gray
