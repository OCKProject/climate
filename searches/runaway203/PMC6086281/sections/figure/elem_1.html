         <p>Relationship between global temperature paths of ICA-RUS and threshold temperatures
            of 
            <span>a</span> Arctic summer sea ice and 
            <span>b</span> Greenland ice sheet. The temperature paths assume that the climate sensitivity assumed
            by policy maker is 3.65 °C and the climate sensitivity of actual climate is 3.00 °C.
            The temperature paths were adjusted so that mean temperature increase during 1986–2005
            is 0.61 °C from average of 1850–1900 (IPCC 
            <a>2013</a>)
