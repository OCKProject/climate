 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping elements (TEs), as introduced by Lenton et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2008</a>) and described as abrupt or irreversible changes in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2013</a>) with slightly different implications, are elements (i.e., subsystems) within the earth’s climate system that could pass critical thresholds, resulting in the destabilization, destruction, critical damage, or transmutation of the major subsystems of the climate system (Lenton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2008</a>; Schellnhuber et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2016</a>). Among the TEs that could be triggered within this century, Arctic summer sea-ice loss and Greenland ice sheet melting are two major TEs that could have large impacts on a global scale. For example, melting of the Greenland ice-sheet could result in a sea level rise (SLR) of more than 7 m (Lenton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2008</a>), although this transition will likely occur on a timescale of several hundreds of years to a millennium. Meanwhile, the disappearance of Arctic summer sea-ice is expected to have a great impact on humans and ecosystems in the Arctic region (Cohen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2014</a>), and the transition could occur in less than 10 years (Lenton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2008</a>). In addition to their potential considerable impacts, these TEs could pass their critical threshold (i.e., thresholds of global mean temperature) within this century, even if the Paris Agreement goal of an “increase in the global average temperature (well) below 2 °C above preindustrial levels” is achieved (Schellnhuber et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2016</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Integrated Climate Assessment—Risks, Uncertainties and Society (ICA-RUS) was a 5-year (2012–2016) research project that had the aim of developing and proposing strategies for global climate risk management, from which several papers, including this paper, have been submitted to the special feature of this journal. Although many of the research components of ICA-RUS focused on the risks and impacts that could appear within this century, and mitigation options that could be implemented in this century, the choice of strategies could lead to drastically different implications with regard to TEs (ICA-RUS Report 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>). For example, if the threshold of a TE is only 1.0 °C, it will inevitably be passed, regardless of which strategy is chosen. However, if the threshold is 2.0 °C, the strategic choice will greatly affect the likelihood of the threshold being passed (ICA-RUS Report 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To consider TEs when developing and proposing strategies (Emori et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2018</a> in this special feature), which are primarily outcomes of integrated assessment models (IAMs) of climate change, there are at least two topics that should be further investigated beyond the literature that was available when ICA-RUS was initiated: the uncertainty surrounding TEs and their threshold temperatures and the consequences of passing threshold temperatures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this paper in this special issue was to investigate these two topics based on specific examples of TEs. Based on an investigation of two major TEs (Arctic summer sea-ice loss and Greenland ice sheet melting), we assess (i) the probability of passing thresholds within this century both for Arctic summer sea-ice loss and Greenland ice sheet melting, and (ii) the potential impact of Greenland ice sheet melting beyond the threshold on a millennium timescale. In addition, this investigation provides estimations of the potential impact and probability of exceeding thresholds performed under consistent scenarios using the IAM simulations from ICA-RUS. The ultimate goal of this research was to support the incorporation of TEs and their threshold temperatures into strategies for the global-scale management of climate change risks, which could be realized through the incorporation of TEs and their thresholds into IAMs in a technical sense. Although we have not reached this ultimate goal, the analyses presented herein represent an indispensable preliminary step toward this goal.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The structure of this paper is as follows. The next section focuses on the two investigated TEs. We explain the details of our framework to estimate the probability of exceeding the threshold temperatures of TEs. Then, we apply the proposed framework to two TEs and discuss the results. Following this, we focus on the special case that has the highest probability of occurrence within our framework, and perform a millennial-scale estimation of sea level rise and its consequences considering the threshold behavior of the Greenland ice sheet.</p>
