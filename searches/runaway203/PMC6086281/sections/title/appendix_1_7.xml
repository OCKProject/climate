 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The probabilities of exceeding threshold temperatures are shown as a function of temperature increase (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>a for Arctic summer sea ice and Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>b for the Greenland ice sheet). The probability functions were computed by integrating the domain of the joint probability density (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>a, b, and Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>a and b) across the temperature increases in 2100. Higher target temperatures were associated with a higher probability of global mean temperature increase, and as a result, the probability of exceeding the thresholds by the end of this century increased because the probability that the threshold temperature would be lower than the temperature increase became higher. Furthermore, T15 had a low probability of achieving high temperature increases (e.g., &gt; 5 °C); therefore, the probability function of T15 reached equilibrium at lower temperature increases. Conversely, the probability function under business as usual (BaU) kept increasing, even at high temperatures, because BaU had a greater probability of high temperature increases.
