 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four global datasets were used to estimate the sea level rise and coastal exposure: global mean temperature, elevation, population, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (for details, see Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Our estimation used three emission pathways associated with SSP2 and three global mean emissions pathways by 2100 (T15, T20, and T25) (Su et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2017</a>). Actual climate sensitivity was fixed at 3.00 °C. From 2100 to 2300, anthropogenic emissions were maintained roughly at 2100 levels. In T15, T20, and T25, temperature after 2100 was limited to below 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 °C, respectively (Su et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2017</a>). To achieve the 1.5 °C target, a marked reduction in CO
  <sub>2</sub> is required, and as a result, T15 reaches negative emissions by 2100. To focus on the millennial-scale effects of exceeding the threshold, this estimation extended the period to the year 3000 with temperature fixed at the level of 2300 (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). This extension was considered to be reasonable because the temperature pathways were similar to the results of the Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity, with emissions following the representative concentration pathways (Zickfeld et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2009</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global asset distribution was calculated using the GDP per capita fixed at the year 2000 for each country (World Bank 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2016</a>). The asset distribution was calculated by multiplying the population count in grids with the per capita GDP of the country in the same manner as Sato et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>). A fixed population and GDP corresponding to that of 2000 were used for the entire period to highlight the changes between the scenarios that did not, and did, exceed the threshold temperature due to climate change. As such, vertical movements of land, population growth, migration, and socioeconomic development of countries were not considered in this study due to the uncertainty of such projections and calculation costs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future global mean sea level rise was estimated using a semi-empirical model (Eq. 
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>) created by Grinsted et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2010</a>) and Mengel et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2016</a>) for each sea level contributor. This study divided the contribution to SLR into four contributors: thermal expansion, glaciers and ice caps, Greenland ice sheet, and Antarctic ice sheet. Whereas we considered the threshold for the Greenland ice sheet, the threshold for the Antarctic ice sheet was not considered for the following reasons: Fig. 2d in Leverman et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2013</a>) indicates a linear increase in sea level rise with regard to the contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet against temperature increases. In addition, a literature review did not reveal any reliable range of threshold temperature due to the large uncertainties in the predictions of the tipping behavior of the Antarctic ice sheet (i.e., the West Antarctic and East Antarctic ice sheets). This motivated us to use a combination of linear functions, rather than setting a particular threshold for the Antarctic ice sheet.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the equilibrium sea level of thermal expansion, glaciers and ice caps, and the Antarctic ice sheet, the historical relationship between sea level and temperature derived from 10,000-year runs of six general circulation models, 19 results from runs of two glacier models, and the simulated sensitivity for 5 million years with an ice sheet model (Levermann et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2013</a>) were used, respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>a–c). The given values for the glaciers and Antarctica were the relationships developed at four levels (1, 2, 3, and 4 °C). Fitting, linear interpolation, and extrapolation were used to obtain values other than these points, whereas the values for thermal expansion were the slope values.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Mengel et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2016</a>) used tuple relationships between response time and sea level rise, we assumed that response time and equilibrium sea level rise were independent, so that we could consider the riskiest case of the highest equilibrium state with the shortest response time. Because of this assumption, our estimation provides a more severe case of sea level rise than the estimation in Mengel et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2016</a>). However, our worst case scenario of thermal expansion (i.e., combination of the shortest response time with the highest sea level rise of Table S1 in Mengel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2016</a>) would not be completely unrealistic. For example, from Fig. 13.13 and Table 13.8 in AR5 (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2013</a>), the “high” scenario (&gt; 700 ppm CO
  <sub>2</sub>) in 2300 could be 1.81 m of sea level rise due to thermal expansion. Figure 12.42 in AR 5 (2013) also indicates that the temperature increase from present-day would be around 3.0 °C in RCP6.0, under which CO
  <sub>2</sub> is about 750 ppm after 2100. Considering these figures, and assuming linear relations among temperature increase, response time, and sea level rise, a temperature increase of 1 °C in 100 years would be associated with about 0.6 m of sea level rise. This gives 0.6 and 100 as the tuples of the commitment parameter and calibrated parameter, respectively, which are not significantly different from the worst-case tuples of 0.626 and 81.7. Therefore, so that our simulation included the riskiest situation, we applied the shortest response time with the largest sea level rise given in Table S1 of Mengel et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the parameters of the Greenland ice sheet were assumed to have a threshold based on the most recently published papers that considered the elevation–temperature feedback associated with surface melting (Robinson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2012</a>; Levermann and Winkelmann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2016</a>). If the global mean temperature were to exceed the threshold of 1.6 °C above the preindustrial level, the Greenland ice sheet would presumably lose its volume irreversibly until an ice-free state equivalent to a 7.36-m SLR was achieved (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>d). The required time for complete volume loss was defined based on how long, and by how much, the temperature would exceed the threshold. Since the response time of the Greenland ice sheet is a monotonically decreasing function of both the atmospheric lapse rate and the melting sensitivity (Levermann and Winkelmann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2016</a>), the upper and lower limits of the estimates can be computed directly from the observed uncertainty interval of these quantities (see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> of Levermann and Winkelmann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2016</a>). The median estimate for the melting of the Greenland ice sheet varied from more than 2,000 years for a warming of + 1 °C to less than 500 years for a warming of + 5 °C. Here, the time-step was set to 5 years for the global mean emissions pathways.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the potentially inundated area, population, and assets using the following algorithm. First, the potentially inundated area was estimated for every 1-m increase in sea level, because we used elevation data from the Global Land 1-km Base Elevation (GLOBE) digital elevation model, which has a 1-m vertical resolution and a 30-arc second horizontal resolution. The computation of the potentially inundated area excluded land-locked inland areas that were below sea level. Coastal exposure with each 1-m rise in sea level was obtained from a distribution map of the inundated area, population, and assets. The coastal exposure from 2005 to 3000 was obtained by interpolating each 1-m exposure by the estimated sea level rise. We assumed no adaptation, and thus, the area of potentially inundated land calculated in this study does not fully account for dikes or defenses along coastlines, due to limitations in available data.</p>
