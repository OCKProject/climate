      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The probabilities of exceeding threshold temperatures are shown as a function of temperature
         increase (Fig. 
         <a>8</a>a for Arctic summer sea ice and Fig. 
         <a>8</a>b for the Greenland ice sheet). The probability functions were computed by integrating
         the domain of the joint probability density (see Fig. 
         <a>4</a>a, b, and Fig. 
         <a>5</a>a and b) across the temperature increases in 2100. Higher target temperatures were
         associated with a higher probability of global mean temperature increase, and as a
         result, the probability of exceeding the thresholds by the end of this century increased
         because the probability that the threshold temperature would be lower than the temperature
         increase became higher. Furthermore, T15 had a low probability of achieving high temperature
         increases (e.g., &gt; 5 °C); therefore, the probability function of T15 reached equilibrium
         at lower temperature increases. Conversely, the probability function under business
         as usual (BaU) kept increasing, even at high temperatures, because BaU had a greater
         probability of high temperature increases.
