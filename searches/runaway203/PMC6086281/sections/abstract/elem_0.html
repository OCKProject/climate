      <p>Evidence suggests that several elements (i.e., subsystems) of the Earth’s climate
         system could tip into a qualitatively different state due to on-going and future anthropogenically
         induced climate change. Risks associated with tipping could form a component of critical
         climate risks, and their consideration should be indispensable in decision-making.
         However, there is lack of scientific knowledge about the risks associated with tipping
         elements, inhibiting their incorporation into comprehensive risk assessments of climate
         change (i.e., assessments of impact, adaptation, and mitigation with uncertainty).
         Using two major tipping elements (Arctic summer sea-ice loss and Greenland ice-sheet
         melting) as examples, this study attempted to address this lack of knowledge by conducting
         several calculations under various policy choices based on target temperature, including
         (i) the probability of passing a threshold temperature in this century and (ii) the
         potential impact of passing a threshold temperature on a millennial timescale beyond
         this century. The first theme of this study [Item (i) above] suggested that probability
         of exceeding the threshold within this century is 24.8% for the Greenland ice sheet
         and 2.7% for Arctic summer sea ice under a 1.5 °C temperature goal. However, it should
         be noted that the estimated probabilities of exceeding the threshold are largely dependent
         on the specification of the probability density function and key assumptions. With
         regard to the second theme of this study [Item (ii) above], estimation of the potential
         global coastal exposure using the estimated sea level exhibited a significant gap
         between scenarios not exceeding the threshold (1.5 °C target) and those exceeding
         the threshold.
