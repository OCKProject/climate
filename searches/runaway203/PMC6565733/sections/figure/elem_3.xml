  <p>Rain vulnerability maps. 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Rain model for airport and marine multiplicative vulnerability equations considering 49 Inuit Nunangat communities. Includes baseline and future RCP 4.5–8.5 scenarios (2040, 2070, 2100). Boxplots includes mean, max-min, and outlier values. The 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis represents the baseline and the subsequent scenarios and y-axis mean vulnerability. The community of Quaqtaq was not included in the rain and snow models due to unavailability of physical features for its entire buffer. 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Communities vulnerability graph. Accumulative rain model vulnerability including baseline and future scenarios for the multiplicative equation for 49 Inuit Nunangat communities. Yellow bars represent baseline for both airport and marine models, red bars gradient delimit airport vulnerability and blue bars gradient marine vulnerability. The community of Quaqtaq was not included in the rain and snow models due to unavailability of physical features for its entire buffer
