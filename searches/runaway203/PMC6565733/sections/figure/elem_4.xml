  <p>Rain increment maps.Â 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Increment percentage/anomalies for the rain model (airport and marine multiplicative vulnerability equations) including 49 Inuit Nunangat communities and future RCP 4.5 (blue) and 8.5 (red) scenarios (2040, 2070, 2100). Boxplots include mean values, max-min values and outliers. The 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis represents the scenarios and the 
   <span class="italic">y</span>-axis the mean increment/anomalies values in percentage. The blank baseline map means that there are no baseline values for the increment analysis. The community of Quaqtaq was not included in the rain and snow models due to unavailability of physical features for its entire buffer. 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Communities rain increment. Increment percentage for the rain model including future scenarios for the multiplicative equation considering 49 Inuit Nunangat communities. Red bars gradient delimits airport increment/anomalies and blue bars gradient marine increment/anomaly. The community of Quaqtaq was not included in the rain and snow models due to unavailability of physical features for its entire buffer
