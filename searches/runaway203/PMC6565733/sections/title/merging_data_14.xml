 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the multiplex network analysis results of Freeman’s degree centrality C
  <sub>D</sub> and variables ranking, interviews, and the document review, we identified key variables and characteristics that are likely influential or highly correlated with transportation vulnerability across the region and would ideally be tracked. Qualitative data sources were used to triangulate exposures, sensitivities, and adaptive capacity components that were most important (

First, Data that might change over time needed to be regularly updated (at least every 5 years) so that indices could be continually updated; Second, exposure data needed to be linked to RCP scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 and be available for 2040, 2070, and 2100 with a resolution of ∼25-km or smaller; Third, sensitivity and adaptive capacity data needed to be available for all communities and be comparable across Inuit Nunangat regions. Based on this process, we selected 8 exposure variables, 18 sensitivity variables, and 10 variables to quantify adaptive capacity (Supplementary Table
