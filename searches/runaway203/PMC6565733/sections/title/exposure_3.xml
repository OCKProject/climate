  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), projected rain, snow, winter-summer temperature and sea level rise showed substantial increase in exposure across Inuit Nunangat through 2100. Annual mean temperature was modeled to increase between 6.4 °C (RCP4.5) and 10.6 °C (RCP8.5) on average across the region, while annual mean precipitation is projected to increase by 0.80 mm/day (RCP 4.5) and 1.43 mm/day (RCP8.5) on average by 2100

    <p>The diagram illustrates the four phases to develop the ACCVI framework. Phase 1 includes data collection and semi-structured interviews with decision makers, a systematic literature review translated into a multiplex network analysis model, inclusion criteria, and the use of buffer areas of 100-km to assess communities at local and regional scales. Phase 2 calculates exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices while hierarchizing variables. Phase 3 involves the final index calculation by applying map algebra techniques to combine indices. This phase was calibrated with two model types and two vulnerability equations. In the figure and throughout the article are only shown best calibration results symbolized by model Type I model and the Multiplicative Equation. Calculation results includes baseline and future IPCC RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios for aviation and marine sectors, dissected into four climate components (rain, snow, summer-winter temperatures) and sea level rise projections. In Phase 4, three types of results were produced: (
     <span class="bold">a</span>) exposure, where climate and biophysical variables are calculated; (
     <span class="bold">b</span>) vulnerability, where exposure results are combined using the vulnerability equation which incorporate socioeconomic dimensions of sensitivity and adaptive capacity for both aviation and marine sectors; (
     <span class="bold">c</span>) increment change, where final vulnerability index results are represented as fractional changes

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the assessed hazards, current exposure for summer-winter temperatures and rain have the widest distribution of exposure values (close to 1) when compared to other hazards (see Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> for all models). Future exposure scenarios indicate that summer-winter temperatures and rain models surpass the 0–1 index window (indicating an extreme future climate). In general, the models agree that exposure will increase towards the end of the century for rain, temperatures and sea level rise across the Arctic Archipelago and North Atlantic. While both winter-summer temperatures will increase most in more southerly communities, rain and snow exposure is projected to increase the most in eastern Inuit Nunangat. Nunavik and Nunatsiavut are projected to be most exposed under the rain model (see rain model example Fig.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea level rise models indicate that Nunatsiavut and Inuvialuit regions are especially sensitive to climate change. Under the sea level rise model across Inuit Nunangat, a higher magnitude of change is projected under the 8.5 scenario. Contrary to this trend, exposure decreases at the end of the century, notably in the Hudson Bay area and Canadian Archipelago, driven by isostatic rebound. This decrease in exposure could generate new challenges for ports, such as increased docking distance and potential local marine and coastal ecosystem changes.</p>
