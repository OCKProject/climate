 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Disaster Sensitivity Index was designed to capture present rates of search and rescues and major disasters, as well as estimate response speed from DOD for a major event.</p>
 <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Search and rescue rates were calculated based on data from Public Safety Canadaâ€™s Knowledge Management System for years 2013 and 2014. More recent data was not available. Using ArcGIS spatial analysis tools, each event was joined with the closest proximal community. Incidence rates were calculated using Statistics Canada 2016 population data. The majority of search and rescue events were related to subsistence hunting and traditional travel on the land
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>
  </span>. High search and rescue rates were seen as being an indicator of sensitivity for a variety of reasons. Research has demonstrated that communities with high search and rescue rates likely place high demands on emergency volunteers in the community and have high volunteer burnout rates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>
  </span>. There is also likely a connection between lower traditional knowledge levels and/or higher community hazards and elevated search and rescue rates.
 </p>
 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data on disasters near or in communities was also used as an indicator of sensitivity. Similar to tracking of marine incidents, it was assumed that communities that had previous disasters have more hazards. While it is possible that these communities have learned and adapted to reduce risks, the tracking of past disasters is often used to assess future risks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Public Safety maintains a database of qualifying disasters across Canada. To qualify an event has to meet one of more of the following criteria. First, 10 or more people killed; Second, 100 or more people affected/injured/infected/evacuated or homeless; Third, an appeal for national/international assistance; Fourth, historical significance; or Fifth, significant damage/interruption of normal processes such as that the community affected cannot recover on its own. Between 1900 and 2018, there were 6 qualifying disasters reported in Inuit Nunangat
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>
  </span>. Three events were due to flooding, one due to storm surge, one due to an avalanche, and one due to a major aviation disaster.
 </p>
 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Response to disasters and search and rescue needs across Inuit Nunangat is usually handled by local and territorial/provincial resources. However, response time by federal partners is important factor in sensitivity to large scale disasters. It is assumed that the longer a community would have to wait for assistance during a major disaster or search and rescue operation, the higher the probability of damage and life loss
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Additionally, response time to disasters is a recommended indicator in the Expert Panel on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience Results Report
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. We chose to look at response times and costs for the designated SAR assets CC-130, CH149, and CH-146. While CC-138s are used, they are not in a designated SAR Wing. Data for aircraft performance was obtained from the RCAF website and reports
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>
  </span>. Variables used to calculate response time were our best estimates given publicly accessible data.
