 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Focusing specifically on aviation and marine transportation vulnerability to climate change – due the availability of data and high importance of these sectors to communities – we develop a four-step process to assess current and future vulnerability in Inuit Nunangat (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). We term this model the Arctic Climate Change Vulnerability Index (ACCVI). Results are presented at a community scale since the vulnerability lens applied in this work focuses on impacts to social and economic systems.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results from the ACCVI model include both projected gross relative changes (gross value) in vulnerability from baseline to future scenario, as well as the relative increase in vulnerability (increment results). Both model outputs are insightful and contribute to a more holistic understanding of projected vulnerability change (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). Since results are relative values, they must be interpreted by compared values among communities and regions or over time under a given model.
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For vulnerability analysis with the ACCVI, sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices are held constant for future projections due to data and knowledge constraints; this is consistent with other studies

  </span> and represents a key methodological challenge for developing future vulnerability indicators. Therefore, vulnerability results should be interpreted as how Inuit Nunangat airport and marine infrastructure would be affected if projected climate change were part of today’s social conditions. Hence, future changes at the sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators would engender different vulnerability outcomes. Qualitative data were used to assist with interpretation of model outputs and development of policy relevant recommendations (
