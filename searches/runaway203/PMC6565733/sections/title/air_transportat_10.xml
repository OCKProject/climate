 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike municipalities in southern Canada, interruptions to air transit for a few days can severely reduce food availability in most communities
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. With the exception of Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk, every community across Inuit Nunangat depends solely on air transportation to bring in perishable goods, food, mail, on a year around basis
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. Aviation is also depended on for the majority of intercommunity travel across the region, including movement of technicians, mine employees, municipal and territory employees, and health care providers. Further, aviation infrastructure is a key component of the Canadian Department of Defenseâ€™s (DND) regional readiness and is relied upon for communication and emergency rerouting options of over 10,000 annual trans-polar flights

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In most communities, an interruption to air travel also has potential to obstruct any means of patients accessing definitive healthcare during medical emergencies

  </span>. The Office of the Auditor General reported that one prominent aeromedical evacuation company in the region had to cancel 29% of emergency medical evacuations annually due to a lack of reliable weather reporting
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. This is of particular concern, given most health centers across Inuit Nunangat do not have full-time physicians and lack resources to provide advanced life support to more than one patient; life-saving measures for most emergencies requires timely aeromedical access.
