 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the IPCC SREX (Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation) and the Arctic Council’s Adaptation Actions for a Changing Arctic assert, improved tools for projecting and estimating future vulnerability are essential to protect and improve the health and wellbeing of communities around the world
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Herein, this paper develops a new approach for assessing and projecting vulnerability to climate change, applying the tool in the Canadian Arctic. The approach responds to two challenges that affect vulnerability research in general and indicator-based in particular
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Firstly, the majority of studies on vulnerability are top down, focusing on climatic conditions best captured by models and identified by researchers as being important
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. These may or may not be relevant, and while integrated assessments have sought to capture how socio-economic-demographic shape vulnerability, this traditional approach has been critiqued as poorly representing the real-world complexities of human-environment interactions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Secondly, a significant body of case study research has developed over the last decade, focusing on complex interactions between climate change and society in specific locations, and have been described as bottom up as they focus on locally identified and relevant conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. These approaches provide rich detail but are often too context specific for informing decision making and lack a quantitative basis for incorporating climate projections to develop future vulnerability scenarios. This disconnect between top down and bottom up approaches, rooted in different disciplinary perspectives, presents a persistent stumbling block for developing credible future vulnerability scenarios
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is with these challenges in mind that this study proposes a new approach to developing vulnerability indices. Uniquely, the study starts with community-based research to develop a vulnerability index that incorporates both social and biophysical data with linked RCP projections across a region that is over 2 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, and is thus rooted in the climatic and socio-economic conditions that matter to a specific context. The approach is intended to complement and build on qualitative case studies, providing regional estimates of vulnerability that are increasingly demanded by decision makers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, along with specific community projections. Indeed, both the 2018 Expert Panel on Measuring Progress on Adaptation and Climate Resilience in Canada
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> and the 2018 Auditor General’s reports on adaptation in Canada, highlighted the importance of delineating which regions, sectors, and government services are most vulnerable
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we focus on Inuit Nunangat (Inuit homeland) of the Canadian Arctic. Encompassing over 50% of Canada’s coastline and 35% of the country’s landmass, Inuit Nunangat is home to 54,000 people living in 50 communities that range in size from 103 to 7740
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span> people. The region experiences some of the most pronounced climate change globally. Further, the regions Inuit population are generally are more sensitive to climate change given socio-economic conditions and stresses
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, as well as a reliance on the environment for livelihoods and well-being. High health burdens, including food insecurity, unintentional injury, and mental health, are linked to environmental systems and the region’s colonial history (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though environmental changes are anticipated to have negative short-term impacts on health, housing, the economy, and transportation systems, communities are also recognized for their resilience—a function of Indigenous knowledge systems, diversified livelihoods, and systems of self-governance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Indeed, communities across the Canadian Arctic have a history of adapting to environmental change, developing or shifting harvesting activities and patterns of travel and, more recently, transitioning economic systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. In addition, over the past decade, communities and regional governments have been taking proactive steps to adapt and find synergies, although most adaptation efforts to-date are either in the planning stage or do not involve concrete actions to reduce vulnerability

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Focusing on transportation system characteristics and infrastructure in communities, this study finds the most substantial driver of present and future vulnerability varies widely between communities and regions across Inuit Nunangat. At present, the most vulnerable aviation systems are observed in Nunatsiavut and the most vulnerable marine systems are observed in Nunavut; this reflects both social and biophysical patterns across Inuit Nunangat. Furthermore, vulnerability for the entire Inuit Nunangat is projected to increase over the coming decades, increasing on average across regions by 58% for future scenarios compared to the baseline. Under the 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, mean modeled vulnerability increased 56% and 60%, respectively, compared with present vulnerability.</p>
