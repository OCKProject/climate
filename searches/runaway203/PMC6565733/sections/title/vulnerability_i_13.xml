 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the past two decades, methods and approaches have been refined to better capture and analyze long-term climate change vulnerability through use of targeted variables which rely on accurate and well parametrized models

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. Common methods for quantifying vulnerability currently include use of score cards, quantitative indices, and targeted models or tools

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. Vulnerability indices require appropriate indicators to integrate social and environmental regional data that reflects spatial and temporal patterns of vulnerability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. Indices demand variables that are easily applicable, measurable, accessible, transferable, and non-redundant and depending on the vulnerability being assessed, they should integrate both quantitative and qualitative criteria while defining a system needs and boundaries

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Canadian Arctic, it is essential that an index, or any other means of quantifying vulnerability, also reflects Inuit values and is sensitive to the way in which communities are labeled and represented
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>. As widely described throughout the literature, assessment of climate change vulnerability in the North American Arctic must be informed by, and rooted in, the regional history

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>. This includes accounting for rapid socioeconomic and cultural changes that have occurred over the last half-century, as well as trauma associated with economic and social policies, oppression, and colonization
