 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exposure indices were used to project characteristics of climate change that may influence future vulnerability in the Canadian Arctic. We selected three climate variables (rain, snow and temperature winter-summer) that are known to be changing in magnitude or frequency–examined through mean values and extreme indices (Supplementary Note

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). These weather variables play a role in infrastructure exposure and potentially affect vulnerability. As an example, precipitation and winds may cause low visibility and navigability for aviation or permafrost changes and snow accumulation may impact airport operations. We also included projected sea level rise data to develop a sea level rise vulnerability model

 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exposure was calculated by combining climate variables and extreme indices such as temperature or precipitation projections and physical features such as permafrost, soils, elevation, slope, wind and water distance (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). A detailed example of the exposure rain model calculation where climate variables are added to physical features can be found in Supplementary Fig.
