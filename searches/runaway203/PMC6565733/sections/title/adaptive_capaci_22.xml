 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive capacity calculation</div>
 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive capacity was estimated using data from Statistics Canada and the Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) Community Wellbeing Index (CWI). This combination of data sources allowed us to weight socioeconomic conditions, housing conditions, education attainment, traditional knowledge, and demographics (Supplementary Fig.Â 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Developed by INAC, the CWI uses Statistics Canada census data to score communities based on socio-economic wellbeing, education attainment, labor force activities, income, and housing. Aggregated 2011 CWI scores were used in this study as the 2016 CWI had not yet been published by INAC. The CWI score was missing for 3 communities, which were given the mean regional score. The average CWI score across the region was 61, while the standard deviation was 11.7. Iqaluit had the highest CWI score, while Naujaat had the lowest reported CWI score.</p>
 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To supplement the CWI, we used data from the 2016 Canadian census. We looked at education attainment by using percent of high school diplomas, percent of trades certificates, and percent of the community that spoke Inuktitut. In combining western markers of education attainment and one element of Inuit Traditional Knowledge (language), we hoped to better reflect the diverse types of knowledge that build resilience

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. However, we acknowledge that an individual can have high levels of Traditional Knowledge without speaking Inuktitut and someone can have lower levels of Traditional Knowledge and speak Inuktitut. We also examined the percent of the community that was new immigrants as a new immigrant population likely has fewer land skills, limited knowledge of the Arctic, and no Inuit Traditional Knowledge. The percent of the population that was younger than 14 and older than 65 was also assessed. Knowing that language is only one of the many aspects of Inuit identity and culture, we strongly agree that future work needs to develop ways of measuring indicators for Inuit Traditional Knowledge for use in developing indices like those developed here.

 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average community percent population that had graduated from high school was reported at 10%. The community with the highest graduation rate was Ulukhaktok (19%) and the lowest was Taloyoak (4%). The average community percent population that had a trade certificate was 4%. Postville had the highest percent of individuals with a trade certificate (14%) while five communities reported 0%.</p>
 <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Communities with the highest percentage of recent immigrants were Quaqtaq, Iqaluit, Inuvik, and Coral Harbor. Statistics Canada defines recent immigrant as individuals who have immigrated to Canada between 2011 and 2016. Naujaat had the youngest population with the median age of 18 and 43.1% of the population under 14. Postville had the oldest population with an average age of 41.2 and over 17.1% of the population over 65.
