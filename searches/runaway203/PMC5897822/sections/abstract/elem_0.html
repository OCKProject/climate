      <p>The historical observational record offers a way to constrain the relationship between
         cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and global mean warming. We use a standard detection
         and attribution technique, along with observational uncertainties to estimate the
         all-forcing or ‘effective’ transient climate response to cumulative emissions (TCRE)
         from the observational record. Accounting for observational uncertainty and uncertainty
         in historical non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> radiative forcing gives a best-estimate from the historical record of 1.84°C/TtC
         (1.43–2.37°C/TtC 5–95% uncertainty) for the effective TCRE and 1.31°C/TtC (0.88–2.60°C/TtC
         5–95% uncertainty) for the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-only TCRE. While the best-estimate TCRE lies in the lower half of the IPCC likely
         range, the high upper bound is associated with the not-ruled-out possibility of a
         strongly negative aerosol forcing. Earth System Models have a higher effective TCRE
         range when compared like-for-like with the observations over the historical period,
         associated in part with a slight underestimate of diagnosed cumulative emissions relative
         to the observational best-estimate, a larger ensemble mean-simulated CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming, and rapid post-2000 non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> warming in some ensemble members.
