  <p>Historical CO
   <sub>2</sub>-induced and non-CO
   <sub>2</sub>-induced global surface air-temperature warming. ESMs (global mean air-temperature warming) are shown with thin coloured lines and estimated values from the observational attribution with a thick brown line (best-estimate—brown shading indicates 5–95% uncertainty). The observational estimate has been ‘de-blended’ (to estimate observed global mean surface air-temperature warming compatible with the blended air/ocean temperature observational series) to allow a like-for-like comparison with global mean air-temperature warming in the 1%/yr simulation from the ESMs. (
