         <p>Comparison of ESM-simulated warming (blended) and diagnosed cumulative CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions (thin pastel coloured lines) with unsmoothed in-filled observations (HadCRUT4-CW/GCP—thick
            red) and its attributed human-induced component (black—with 5–95% shading shown in
            purple in (
            <span>a</span>)). (
            <span>a</span>) Warming relative to the average of 1861–1880, (
            <span>b</span>) diagnosed cumulative CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions since 1870 (GCP observations are shown in red with grey shading 5–95%),

            <span>a</span>). ESM temperature time-series are ‘blended’ air/sea warming smoothed using a 10 year
            centred running mean in all cases. Beige shading in (
            <span>d</span>) indicates the total uncertainty from the calculation of human-induced warming and
            historical emissions. The purple crosses in (
            <span>c</span>) mark the all-time likely below carbon budget from the IPCC-AR5 Synthesis Report
            (IPCC SYN). (Online version in colour.)
