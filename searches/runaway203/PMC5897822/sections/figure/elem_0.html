         <p>Implications of the historical record for constraining TCRE. (
            <span>a</span>) Time-series of warming as a function of cumulative emissions for members of the
            observational HadCRUT4/GCP ensemble (grey), the best-estimate HadCRUT4-CW/GCP time-series
            (red) and best-estimate human-induced warming for HadCRUT4-CW (black) with beige lines
            showing a random sample from the joint human-induced warming/emission uncertainty.
            Estimates for the effective TCRE over a range of periods are shown in (
            <span>b</span>), derived from the same data as in (
            <span>a</span>). Grey bars show 5–95% ranges for observational uncertainty from the HadCRUT4/GCP
            ensemble. Beige bars show 5–95% ranges for total uncertainty from the human-induced
            warming calculation and emission observations. (
            <span>c</span>) The best-estimate (black line) and a random sample from the joint evolution of CO
            <sub>2</sub>-induced warming and cumulative emissions over the historical period (beige lines).
            Panel (
            <span>d</span>) as for panel (
            <span>b</span>) but using the data in panel (
            <span>c</span>). Black dots mark the best-estimate CO
            <sub>2</sub>-only TCRE estimate for each period. (Online version in colour.)
