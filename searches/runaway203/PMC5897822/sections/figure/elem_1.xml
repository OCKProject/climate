  <p>Comparison of ESM-simulated warming (blended) and diagnosed cumulative CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions (thin pastel coloured lines) with unsmoothed in-filled observations (HadCRUT4-CW/GCP—thick red) and its attributed human-induced component (black—with 5–95% shading shown in purple in (
   <span class="italic">a</span>)). (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) Warming relative to the average of 1861–1880, (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) diagnosed cumulative CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions since 1870 (GCP observations are shown in red with grey shading 5–95%), (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) the joint evolution of warming and cumulative CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions, and in (
   <span class="italic">d</span>) the all-forcing effective TCRE calculated with a moving average. The black line in (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) and (
   <span class="italic">d</span>) uses the attributed human-induced warming time-series from (
   <span class="italic">a</span>). ESM temperature time-series are ‘blended’ air/sea warming smoothed using a 10 year centred running mean in all cases. Beige shading in (
   <span class="italic">d</span>) indicates the total uncertainty from the calculation of human-induced warming and historical emissions. The purple crosses in (
   <span class="italic">c</span>) mark the all-time likely below carbon budget from the IPCC-AR5 Synthesis Report (IPCC SYN). (Online version in colour.)
