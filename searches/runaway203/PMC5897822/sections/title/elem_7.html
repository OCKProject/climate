      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimating the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-only TCRE from observations requires an estimate of the fraction of human-induced
         warming that is attributed to CO
         <sub>2</sub>. While CO
         <sub>2</sub> radiative forcing is relatively well constrained, total anthropogenic forcing remains
         uncertain largely due the range of possible aerosol ERF once interactions with clouds
         are accounted for [
         <a>26</a>,
         <a>44</a>,
         <a>45</a>]. For a given member of the ERF uncertainty sampling (subscript 
         <span>i</span>), linear regression (equation (3.1)) can be used to decompose attributed human-induced
         warming, 
         
         <div><span></span></div> (
         
         <div><span></span></div>), into the forced warming associated with each component of the anthropogenic radiative
         forcing, 
         
         <div><span>3.3</span><div></div>
         </div> where responses to the sampled individual components of the forcing (e.g. 
         
         <div><span></span></div>) are computed using equation (3.2). Convolving independent sampling of ERF uncertainty
         and other uncertainties, as described in §3a, provides a distribution for 
         
         <div><span></span></div> that can be combined with uncertainty in historical cumulative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions to make inferences about the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-only TCRE from observations.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large uncertainty in aerosol ERF propagates into a wide range of possible contributions
         of CO
         <sub>2</sub> to observed warming today. 
         <a>Figure 1</a><span>c</span> shows 300 members of the joint distribution of CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming and cumulative emissions (beige lines) with the best-estimate marked
         with the black line. The estimated CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming to-date (2016) ranges from as little as 0.51°C (5th percentile) to
         as much as 1.43°C (95th percentile) respectively, representing extremal cases in which
         non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> greenhouse gas forcing strongly dominates a weakly negative aerosol forcing (5th
         percentile) and when net non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> forcing is itself negative due to a strong negative aerosol forcing, partly masking
         the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming in the present-day climate (95th percentile). As long-lived forcing
         on the climate system is largely associated with elevated CO
         <sub>2</sub> and N
         <sub>2</sub>O concentrations (N
         <sub>2</sub>O currently contributes only approx. 9% of the forcing associated with CO
         <sub>2</sub> in the best-estimate case), our results indicate that there is a low, but non-zero,
         chance that current warming from long-lived GHGs already exceeds 1.5°C based on current-forcing
         uncertainties. This indicates that it still remains relatively unlikely that we are
         yet geo-physically locked-in to a long-lived component of warming in excess of the
         high ambition goal of the Paris Agreement and therefore a need to use carbon removal
         or solar geoengineering techniques to limit long-term warming beneath this threshold.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The best-estimate of CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming in 2016 is 0.74°C, corresponding to the best-estimate radiative forcing
         components, in which CO
         <sub>2</sub> forcing represents 74% of the net forcing in 2016. Approximately linear relationships
         between cumulative emissions and attributed CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming are seen across the uncertainty range from the attribution analysis
         (
         <a>figure 1</a><span>c</span>), leading to approximately period-invariant best-estimates and uncertainty intervals
         on the implied CO
         <sub>2</sub>-only TCRE estimates (
         <a>figure 1</a><span>d</span>). The best-estimate CO
         <sub>2</sub>-only TCRE estimate over the most recent decade (2007–2016) is 1.31°C/TtC and is approximately
         invariant over the four previous decades considered here. The 5–95% range of the TCRE
         over the most recent decade is 0.88–2.60°C/TtC, extending beyond the upper end of
         the 0.8–2.5°C/TtC 
         <span>likely</span> range of TCRE assessed by AR5. The overall similarity between the two ranges might
         be expected due to the inclusion of observational constraints in the expert judgement
         underlying the AR5 assessment. While observational attribution supports a best-estimate
         CO
         <sub>2</sub>-only TCRE in the bottom half of the AR5 likely range, the uncertainties associated
         with historical forcing mean that uncertainties in the observationally estimated CO
         <sub>2</sub>-only TCRE remain large, and a high TCRE cannot be conclusively ruled out by current
         observations.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This method assumes a linear separability between CO
            <sub>2</sub> and non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> warming, and a perfect scenario independence of the relationship between cumulative
            CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions and CO
            <sub>2</sub>-induced warming. While evidence exists for dependence of carbon-cycle feedbacks on
            the total warming within the climate system [
            <a>46</a>,
            <a>47</a>], as well as some scenario dependence of the response to cumulative emissions [
            <a>48</a>], to a first order these remain good assumptions to partition ESM-simulated historical
            warming into CO
            <sub>2</sub> and non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> contributions. An additional implicit assumption is that carbon-cycle feedbacks (which
            give rise to the relationship between warming and cumulative emissions in these experiments)
            estimated from the 1%/yr simulation are a good proxy for the carbon-cycle feedbacks
            over the historical period. For example, as the 1%/yr simulations have fixed preindustrial
            land-use forcing, unlike the historical simulation, some differences might be expected
            in the land carbon feedbacks between the two experiments for a single climate model.
            We provide a proxy test of the similarity between ESM carbon-cycle feedbacks in the
            two experiments using a simple climate carbon-cycle model in the electronic supplementary
            material. Based on this technique, we conclude that the difference in carbon-cycle
            feedbacks between the two experiments is unlikely to have a large effect on the diagnosed
            cumulative emissions over the historical integration, but could be expected to have
            a substantial effect under high future emission scenarios such as RCP8.5.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diagnosed cumulative emissions for a given atmospheric concentration evolution will
            also somewhat depend on the profile of other forcing agents, due to both non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> contributions to warming affecting natural carbon sinks and (in the case of aerosols)
            changes to the biogeochemical carbon-cycle feedback by direct impact on diffuse surface
            radiation. MacDougall 
            <span>et al.</span> [
            <a>49</a>] showed that in the UVic intermediate complexity model, the inclusion of non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> radiative forcing only caused a small reduction in diagnosed cumulative CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions over the historical period. Similarly, the study of MacDougall &amp; Knutti
            [
            <a>50</a>] indicates only a fractionally small increase in long-lived warming associated with
            the effect of present-day methane emission rates on the efficacy of carbon sinks.
            Therefore, while the effects of both non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> forcing on carbon sinks, and possible difference between carbon-cycle feedbacks in
            the 1%/yr and historical integrations, add uncertainty to estimates of ESM CO
            <sub>2</sub>-induced warming, the method used here can serve as a useful approximation over the
            historical period.
