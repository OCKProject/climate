      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of Earth System Models (ESMs), full complexity climate models which explicitly
         simulate important biogeochemical cycles (such as carbon) in the climate system, have
         enabled an improved understanding of the link between emissions of climatically important
         gases and realized climate change [
         <a>1</a>,
         <a>2</a>]. As atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
         <sub>2</sub>) concentration anomalies have long decay timescales [
         <a>3</a>], CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming is essentially permanent on human-relevant timescales [
         <a>4</a>,
         <a>5</a>] without the deployment of CO
         <sub>2</sub> removal technologies. Understanding possible future changes in the coupled climate–carbon
         cycle are therefore of critical importance to making long-term projections of climate
         change over centuries to millennia [
         <a>6</a>–
         <a>8</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ESM simulations have helped quantify the gradient of the approximately linear and
         scenario-independent relationship between cumulative emissions of CO
         <sub>2</sub> and resultant global mean warming [
         <a>9</a>–
         <a>12</a>] through coordinated experiments run by a set of ESMs from around the world [
         <a>2</a>]. Using ESM-based estimates along with observational constraints, the 5th Assessment
         Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed the
         
         <span>transient climate response to cumulative emissions</span> (TCRE—the global mean warming following a 1 TtC (1000 GtC) injection of CO
         <sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere) to be 
         <span>likely</span> (greater than 66% probability) between 0.8 and 2.5°C [
         <a>13</a>], similar to the 0.8–2.4°C ESM-based TCRE range reported in [
         <a>2</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The value of the TCRE has direct relevance to contemporary international climate policy
         as the approximate linearity between warming and cumulative emissions leads to an
         all-time ‘budget’ of allowable cumulative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions compatible with any given warming threshold, including the 1.5°C and 2°C
         thresholds of the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal [
         <a>14</a>,
         <a>15</a>]. While the timing of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions is important for economically
         efficient implementations of climate policy, particularly at national or regional
         levels, the cumulative CO
         <sub>2</sub> budget gives an unavoidable physical constraint on the total global CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions over all time. Although partitioning the global carbon budget into national
         shares is complex and value laden [
         <a>16</a>–
         <a>18</a>], carbon budget framings may play an important role in setting national-level policies
         to meet the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large uncertainty in estimates of TCRE propagates into substantial uncertainty
         in the allowable carbon budget for a given temperature threshold. For instance, varying
         TCRE from 0.8 to 2.5°C would change the all-time CO
         <sub>2</sub>-only cumulative carbon budget for a 2°C threshold (which would only correspond to
         an absolute warming of 2°C from preindustrial under the assumption that net non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> warming is negligible at time of peak warming) by 1700 GtC (ranging from 800 to 2500 GtC),
         corresponding to over 150 years of present-day global CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the large uncertainties in TCRE arising from ESM simulations, this paper investigates
         to what extent useful information can be derived from the historical record to further
         inform estimates of the TCRE, and hence constrain estimates of remaining carbon budgets.
         We build on the observational estimates made in both [
         <a>9</a>] and [
         <a>2</a>] to provide an update on observationally constrained TCRE, incorporating the most
         recent observations of both warming and emissions. The observational and model data
         used are discussed in §2. In §3a, we use a detection and attribution method that does
         not directly rely on estimates of forcing or response from complex climate models
         to estimate the all-forcing or ‘effective’ TCRE (the global mean warming from all-forcing
         agents following 1 TtC cumulative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions) [
         <a>19</a>] from observations and up-to-date assessments of radiative forcing uncertainty. We
         then compare these observational effective TCRE estimates with those simulated over
         the historical period in ESMs. In §3b, we discuss inferences about uncertainty in
         the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-only TCRE over the historical period and compare with estimates of ESM-simulated
         historical CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced and non-CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced. Section 4 contains a concluding discussion.
