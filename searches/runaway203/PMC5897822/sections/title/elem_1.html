         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational temperature time-series are taken from a spatially in-filled version
            of the Met Office Hadley Centre HadCRUT4 dataset [
            <a>20</a>] (which we refer to as HadCRUT4-CW). This 100 member ensemble of hybrid air/sea temperatures
            uses a statistical technique to in-fill unobserved regions in the original HadCRUT4
            product [
            <a>21</a>] so as to achieve complete global coverage and enable a like-for-like comparison
            with global ESM output [
            <a>22</a>]. Observational data are used at annual time resolution up until the end of 2016.
            The HadCRUT4-CW ensemble allows for a systematic sampling of observational uncertainty;
            however, methodological choices between different observational product represent
            another source of uncertainty. As a sensitivity test, we also conduct analysis using
            the best-estimate warming from the Berkeley Earth dataset [
            <a>23</a>], which shows higher warming over the historical period (see the electronic supplementary
            material).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed cumulative emission estimates are taken from the 2016 Global Carbon Project
            (GCP) dataset [
            <a>24</a>]. Observational uncertainties are accounted for using an ensemble created by independent
            sampling of uncertainties in fossil fuel and industry emissions, and land-use emissions
            as described in [
            <a>24</a>]. We also conduct sensitivity analysis using the 2017 GCP dataset [
            <a>25</a>], which indicates substantially higher historical land-use change emissions (see
            the electronic supplementary material).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A history of effective radiative forcing (ERF), and its uncertainty, is required to
            estimate the fraction of observed warming associated with both human activities and
            that associated specifically with CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions only. Best-estimate time-series of historical ERF for the individual components
            of anthropogenic and natural radiative forcing (e.g. CO
            <sub>2</sub>, other well-mixed GHGs, aerosols and volcanic) are taken from Myhre 
            <span>et al.</span> [
            <a>26</a>] and have been extended using observational data up to the end of 2016 as in [
            <a>27</a>]. The central estimate of ERF from non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> GHGs has been updated to incorporate a recent upward revision to the methane radiative
            forcing proposed in [
            <a>28</a>]. Volcanic forcing for the recent period is taken from Andersson 
            <span>et al.</span> [
            <a>29</a>], and solar forcing using data from Kopp [

         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical ERF uncertainty is sampled by multiplying the best-estimate forcing time-series
            for a given component of ERF by draws from a distribution of the fractional uncertainty
            in that component's 2011 forcing, as assessed in IPCC-AR5 [
            <a>26</a>]. Individual forcing components are sampled independently and then combined to create
            a distribution of uncertainty in total historical ERF on the climate system (see electronic
            supplementary material, figure S1).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ESM data used in this paper are taken from experiments conducted under the 5th
            Coupled Model Intercomparison Project—CMIP5 [
            <a>31</a>]. We use results from the historical simulation as well as from the Representative
            Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios [
            <a>32</a>,
            <a>33</a>] and the idealized 1%/yr atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentration increase experiment [
            <a>34</a>]. The list of ESMs used in this analysis is as follows: CESM1-BGC, CanESM2, GFDL-ESM2G,
            GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, IPSL-CM5B-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM,
            MIROC-EMS, MPI-ESM-LR, NorESM1-ME, bcc-csm1–1 and inmcm4. Models for which data are
            not available for the 1%/yr experiment are omitted from analysis that involves the
            use of those experiments (§3b(i)). In comparing the ESMs against the observational
            record, we consider the effect of observational processing on the modelled temperature
            anomalies to allow a like-for-like comparison with observational products. ‘Blended’
            time-series of globally complete simulated warming are taken from [
            <a>22</a>], which processed model output using a blend of surface air-temperatures (over land)
            and sea-surface temperatures (over ocean), similar to as in observational products.
            This enables a direct ‘like-for-like’ comparison between globally complete model output
            and observational products that are statistically in-filled to address observational
            coverage gaps in order to estimate a global mean value. We use the RCP8.5 scenario
            [
            <a>35</a>] when comparing ESMs to observations over the post-2005 period.

            are smoothed with a 10 year centred moving average to remove modes of unforced natural
            variability and help isolate the externally forced signal (1%/yr ESM simulations are
            smoothed with a 15 year running mean).
