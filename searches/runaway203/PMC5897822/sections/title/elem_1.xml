  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational temperature time-series are taken from a spatially in-filled version of the Met Office Hadley Centre HadCRUT4 dataset [
   <a rid="RSTA20160449C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C20">20</a>] (which we refer to as HadCRUT4-CW). This 100 member ensemble of hybrid air/sea temperatures uses a statistical technique to in-fill unobserved regions in the original HadCRUT4 product [
   <a rid="RSTA20160449C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C21">21</a>] so as to achieve complete global coverage and enable a like-for-like comparison with global ESM output [
   <a rid="RSTA20160449C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C22">22</a>]. Observational data are used at annual time resolution up until the end of 2016. The HadCRUT4-CW ensemble allows for a systematic sampling of observational uncertainty; however, methodological choices between different observational product represent another source of uncertainty. As a sensitivity test, we also conduct analysis using the best-estimate warming from the Berkeley Earth dataset [
   <a rid="RSTA20160449C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C23">23</a>], which shows higher warming over the historical period (see the electronic supplementary material).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ESM data used in this paper are taken from experiments conducted under the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project—CMIP5 [
   <a rid="RSTA20160449C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C31">31</a>]. We use results from the historical simulation as well as from the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios [
   <a rid="RSTA20160449C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C32">32</a>,

   <sub>2</sub> concentration increase experiment [
   <a rid="RSTA20160449C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C34">34</a>]. The list of ESMs used in this analysis is as follows: CESM1-BGC, CanESM2, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, IPSL-CM5B-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-EMS, MPI-ESM-LR, NorESM1-ME, bcc-csm1–1 and inmcm4. Models for which data are not available for the 1%/yr experiment are omitted from analysis that involves the use of those experiments (§3b(i)). In comparing the ESMs against the observational record, we consider the effect of observational processing on the modelled temperature anomalies to allow a like-for-like comparison with observational products. ‘Blended’ time-series of globally complete simulated warming are taken from [
   <a rid="RSTA20160449C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C22">22</a>], which processed model output using a blend of surface air-temperatures (over land) and sea-surface temperatures (over ocean), similar to as in observational products. This enables a direct ‘like-for-like’ comparison between globally complete model output and observational products that are statistically in-filled to address observational coverage gaps in order to estimate a global mean value. We use the RCP8.5 scenario [
   <a rid="RSTA20160449C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C35">35</a>] when comparing ESMs to observations over the post-2005 period.
