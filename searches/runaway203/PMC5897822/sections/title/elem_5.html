      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed warming is driven by multiple anthropogenic forcing agents; however, the
         concept of TCRE was derived from model-based results that focused primarily on CO
         <sub>2</sub>-only forced simulations [
         <a>2</a>,
         <a>9</a>]. The physical mechanisms that give rise to the approximate linearity between CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming and cumulative emissions, namely the compensation between logarithmic
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> radiative forcing and increasing airborne fraction [
         <a>9</a>,
         <a>37</a>], apply to CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming only. As such, a time-independent effective (all-forcing) TCRE would
         only be expected to the extent that CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming dominates the forcing mix, or if the relative contribution of non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> forcing to warming remains approximately constant over time.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational time-series (together with their uncertainties, 
         <a>figure 1</a><span>a</span>) can be used to assess the extent that the effective TCRE varies over time in the
         observational record. Grey bars in 
         <a>figure 1</a><span>b</span> show the 5–95% of historical effective TCRE associated purely with observational
         uncertainty. These are estimated using independent pairings of the HadCRUT4-CW and
         historical cumulative emission ensembles averaged over the periods shown to the right
         of the bars. They show a non-constant effective TCRE increasing from the early 1970s
         up until the 2010s. For the most recent decade (2007–2016), purely observational uncertainty
         in effective TCRE spans a 1.51–2.19°C/TtC 5–95% range, dominated by uncertainty in
         the historical cumulative emissions which vary by ±17% (5–95% uncertainty) compared
         with ±8% for the HadCRUT4-CW ensemble.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed warming is determined by a combination of an externally forced warming (associated
         with human and natural forcing on the climate system) and natural climate variability.
         Unlike contributions from natural variability, warming driven by human activity is
         expected to evolve relatively smoothly in time. To estimate human-induced warming,
         we use an attribution analysis. This analysis is based on the optimal fingerprinting
         method of detection and attribution of climate change [
         <a>38</a>], which uses a multiple linear regression to decompose observed warming, Δ
         <span>T</span><sub>obs</sub>, into a forced component associated with anthropogenic drivers, Δ
         <span>T</span><sub>anthro</sub>—the human-induced warming, a forced component associated with natural drivers, Δ
         <span>T</span><sub>nat</sub>, and an unforced residual natural variability (
         
         <div><span></span></div>), with 
         <span>δ</span> acting as a regression constant,

         in estimates of historical ERF components, and a broader range of possible fractional
         contributions of CO
         <sub>2</sub> to net forcing than simulated in the CMIP5 ensemble, to be used when making inferences
         about TCRE over the historical period. We account for uncertainty in the historical
         ERF using a distribution of possible ERF histories (see §2a) and parametric uncertainty
         using a sampling of 
         <span>q
            <sub>i</sub></span> and 
         <span>d
            <sub>i</sub></span> consistent with distributions for the realized warming fraction (the ratio of transient
         climate response—TCR—to equilibrium climate sensitivity [
         <a>40</a>]) and the short thermal response timescale of the climate system from Millar 
         <span>et al.</span> [
         <a>41</a>], approximating the distributions of these variables across CMIP5 general circulation
         models. Observational uncertainty is sampled using the HadCRUT4-CW ensemble and uncertainty
         associated with natural climate variability is sampled by adding realizations of control
         climate variability from CMIP5 to the observed time-series. Total uncertainty (5–95%)
         in attributed human-induced warming is shown by the purple shading in 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>a</span>. Haustein 
         <span>et al.</span> [
         <a>27</a>] showed that the dominant sources of uncertainty in this calculation are ERF and
         internal variability uncertainties. As control variability is added using global surface
         air-temperature fields, this may somewhat over-estimate the contribution of internal
         variability uncertainty in the blended air-temperature/sea-surface temperature product.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effective TCRE calculated using human-induced warming (black in 
         <a>figure 1</a>) displays substantially less variation over time than estimates from pure observed
         warming (grey bars) as the changing contributions of both temporary natural forcing
         (such as volcanic eruptions) and natural climate variability have been regressed out.
         This indicates that natural climate variability typically has a larger impact on estimates
         of effective TCRE from observations than changing fractional contributions to forced
         warming associated with evolving historical non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> forcing. Total uncertainty in the attributed effective TCRE is larger (beige bars
         in 
         <a>figure 1</a><span>b</span>) than that associated with purely observational uncertainty, as decadal mean uncertainty
         is much larger in human-attributable warming than observed warming. Over the 2007–2016
         period, the total uncertainty on the attributed effective TCRE displays a 5–95% range
         of 1.43–2.37°C/TtC and a best-estimate of 1.84°C/TtC.

            the ESMs (solid thin coloured lines) was 0.10°C (0.41 to −0.27°C ensemble range) warmer
            than the estimated human-induced warming from global (HadCRUT4-CW) observations (solid
            black line approximately 1°C in 2016). Historical cumulative CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions (to the end of 2016) are typically underdiagnosed relative to the GCP observations
            in many of the ESMs (by 27 GtC for the multi-model mean, 121 to −65.7 GtC ensemble
            range), with nine out of 15 ESMs diagnosing historical cumulative emissions to be
            less than best-estimate observed emissions between 1870 and 2016. As many ESMs typically

            of cumulative emissions in ESMs relative to the best-estimate observed value is persistent
            over the last half century and as such cannot be attributed to an artefact of the
            so-called ‘hiatus’ in warming which could have acted to temporarily reduce the observed
            annual airborne fraction, therefore allowing models to meet a similar concentration
            evolution with lower diagnosed emissions.

            <span>d</span>). Subsequent to substantial variability in the effective TCRE prior to 1980, in both
            ESMs and observations the effective TCRE has been approximately constant since 2000.

            ESM effective TCRE (2016) is 0.27°C/TtC higher than the estimate based on attributable
