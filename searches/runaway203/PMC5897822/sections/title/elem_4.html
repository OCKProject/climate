         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed warming is driven by multiple anthropogenic forcing agents; however, the
            concept of TCRE was derived from model-based results that focused primarily on CO
            <sub>2</sub>-only forced simulations [
            <a>2</a>,
            <a>9</a>]. The physical mechanisms that give rise to the approximate linearity between CO
            <sub>2</sub>-induced warming and cumulative emissions, namely the compensation between logarithmic
            CO
            <sub>2</sub> radiative forcing and increasing airborne fraction [
            <a>9</a>,
            <a>37</a>], apply to CO
            <sub>2</sub>-induced warming only. As such, a time-independent effective (all-forcing) TCRE would
            only be expected to the extent that CO
            <sub>2</sub>-induced warming dominates the forcing mix, or if the relative contribution of non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> forcing to warming remains approximately constant over time.

            of the bars. They show a non-constant effective TCRE increasing from the early 1970s
            up until the 2010s. For the most recent decade (2007–2016), purely observational uncertainty
            in effective TCRE spans a 1.51–2.19°C/TtC 5–95% range, dominated by uncertainty in

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed warming is determined by a combination of an externally forced warming (associated
            with human and natural forcing on the climate system) and natural climate variability.
            Unlike contributions from natural variability, warming driven by human activity is
            expected to evolve relatively smoothly in time. To estimate human-induced warming,
            we use an attribution analysis. This analysis is based on the optimal fingerprinting
            method of detection and attribution of climate change [
            <a>38</a>], which uses a multiple linear regression to decompose observed warming, Δ

            <sub>2</sub> to net forcing than simulated in the CMIP5 ensemble, to be used when making inferences
            about TCRE over the historical period. We account for uncertainty in the historical
            ERF using a distribution of possible ERF histories (see §2a) and parametric uncertainty
            using a sampling of

            models. Observational uncertainty is sampled using the HadCRUT4-CW ensemble and uncertainty
            associated with natural climate variability is sampled by adding realizations of control
            climate variability from CMIP5 to the observed time-series. Total uncertainty (5–95%)
            in attributed human-induced warming is shown by the purple shading in

            <span>et al.</span> [
            <a>27</a>] showed that the dominant sources of uncertainty in this calculation are ERF and
            internal variability uncertainties. As control variability is added using global surface
            air-temperature fields, this may somewhat over-estimate the contribution of internal
            variability uncertainty in the blended air-temperature/sea-surface temperature product.

            <a>figure 1</a>) displays substantially less variation over time than estimates from pure observed
            warming (grey bars) as the changing contributions of both temporary natural forcing
            (such as volcanic eruptions) and natural climate variability have been regressed out.
            This indicates that natural climate variability typically has a larger impact on estimates
            of effective TCRE from observations than changing fractional contributions to forced
            warming associated with evolving historical non-CO

            is much larger in human-attributable warming than observed warming. Over the 2007–2016

            with the black line. The estimated CO

            as much as 1.43°C (95th percentile) respectively, representing extremal cases in which
            non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> greenhouse gas forcing strongly dominates a weakly negative aerosol forcing (5th
            percentile) and when net non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> forcing is itself negative due to a strong negative aerosol forcing, partly masking
            the CO
            <sub>2</sub>-induced warming in the present-day climate (95th percentile). As long-lived forcing
            on the climate system is largely associated with elevated CO
            <sub>2</sub> and N
            <sub>2</sub>O concentrations (N
            <sub>2</sub>O currently contributes only approx. 9% of the forcing associated with CO
            <sub>2</sub> in the best-estimate case), our results indicate that there is a low, but non-zero,
            chance that current warming from long-lived GHGs already exceeds 1.5°C based on current-forcing
            uncertainties. This indicates that it still remains relatively unlikely that we are
            yet geo-physically locked-in to a long-lived component of warming in excess of the
            high ambition goal of the Paris Agreement and therefore a need to use carbon removal
            or solar geoengineering techniques to limit long-term warming beneath this threshold.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This method assumes a linear separability between CO
               <sub>2</sub> and non-CO
               <sub>2</sub> warming, and a perfect scenario independence of the relationship between cumulative
               CO
               <sub>2</sub> emissions and CO
               <sub>2</sub>-induced warming. While evidence exists for dependence of carbon-cycle feedbacks on
               the total warming within the climate system [
               <a>46</a>,
               <a>47</a>], as well as some scenario dependence of the response to cumulative emissions [
               <a>48</a>], to a first order these remain good assumptions to partition ESM-simulated historical
               warming into CO
               <sub>2</sub> and non-CO
               <sub>2</sub> contributions. An additional implicit assumption is that carbon-cycle feedbacks (which
               give rise to the relationship between warming and cumulative emissions in these experiments)
               estimated from the 1%/yr simulation are a good proxy for the carbon-cycle feedbacks
               over the historical period. For example, as the 1%/yr simulations have fixed preindustrial
               land-use forcing, unlike the historical simulation, some differences might be expected
               in the land carbon feedbacks between the two experiments for a single climate model.
               We provide a proxy test of the similarity between ESM carbon-cycle feedbacks in the
               two experiments using a simple climate carbon-cycle model in the electronic supplementary
               material. Based on this technique, we conclude that the difference in carbon-cycle
               feedbacks between the two experiments is unlikely to have a large effect on the diagnosed
               cumulative emissions over the historical integration, but could be expected to have
               a substantial effect under high future emission scenarios such as RCP8.5.

               also somewhat depend on the profile of other forcing agents, due to both non-CO
               <sub>2</sub> contributions to warming affecting natural carbon sinks and (in the case of aerosols)
               changes to the biogeochemical carbon-cycle feedback by direct impact on diffuse surface
               radiation. MacDougall 
               <span>et al.</span> [
               <a>49</a>] showed that in the UVic intermediate complexity model, the inclusion of non-CO
               <sub>2</sub> radiative forcing only caused a small reduction in diagnosed cumulative CO
               <sub>2</sub> emissions over the historical period. Similarly, the study of MacDougall &amp; Knutti
               [
               <a>50</a>] indicates only a fractionally small increase in long-lived warming associated with
               the effect of present-day methane emission rates on the efficacy of carbon sinks.
               Therefore, while the effects of both non-CO
               <sub>2</sub> forcing on carbon sinks, and possible difference between carbon-cycle feedbacks in
               the 1%/yr and historical integrations, add uncertainty to estimates of ESM CO
