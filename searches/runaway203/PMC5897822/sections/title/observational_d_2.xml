 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational temperature time-series are taken from a spatially in-filled version of the Met Office Hadley Centre HadCRUT4 dataset [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C20">20</a>] (which we refer to as HadCRUT4-CW). This 100 member ensemble of hybrid air/sea temperatures uses a statistical technique to in-fill unobserved regions in the original HadCRUT4 product [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C21">21</a>] so as to achieve complete global coverage and enable a like-for-like comparison with global ESM output [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C22">22</a>]. Observational data are used at annual time resolution up until the end of 2016. The HadCRUT4-CW ensemble allows for a systematic sampling of observational uncertainty; however, methodological choices between different observational product represent another source of uncertainty. As a sensitivity test, we also conduct analysis using the best-estimate warming from the Berkeley Earth dataset [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C23">23</a>], which shows higher warming over the historical period (see the electronic supplementary material).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed cumulative emission estimates are taken from the 2016 Global Carbon Project (GCP) dataset [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C24">24</a>]. Observational uncertainties are accounted for using an ensemble created by independent sampling of uncertainties in fossil fuel and industry emissions, and land-use emissions as described in [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C24">24</a>]. We also conduct sensitivity analysis using the 2017 GCP dataset [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C25">25</a>], which indicates substantially higher historical land-use change emissions (see the electronic supplementary material).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A history of effective radiative forcing (ERF), and its uncertainty, is required to estimate the fraction of observed warming associated with both human activities and that associated specifically with CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions only. Best-estimate time-series of historical ERF for the individual components of anthropogenic and natural radiative forcing (e.g. CO
  <sub>2</sub>, other well-mixed GHGs, aerosols and volcanic) are taken from Myhre 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C26">26</a>] and have been extended using observational data up to the end of 2016 as in [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C27">27</a>]. The central estimate of ERF from non-CO

  <a rid="RSTA20160449C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C28">28</a>]. Volcanic forcing for the recent period is taken from Andersson 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C29">29</a>], and solar forcing using data from Kopp [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical ERF uncertainty is sampled by multiplying the best-estimate forcing time-series for a given component of ERF by draws from a distribution of the fractional uncertainty in that component's 2011 forcing, as assessed in IPCC-AR5 [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C26">26</a>]. Individual forcing components are sampled independently and then combined to create a distribution of uncertainty in total historical ERF on the climate system (see electronic supplementary material, figure S1).
