 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of Earth System Models (ESMs), full complexity climate models which explicitly simulate important biogeochemical cycles (such as carbon) in the climate system, have enabled an improved understanding of the link between emissions of climatically important gases and realized climate change [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C1">1</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C2">2</a>]. As atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>) concentration anomalies have long decay timescales [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C3">3</a>], CO
  <sub>2</sub>-induced warming is essentially permanent on human-relevant timescales [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C4">4</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C5">5</a>] without the deployment of CO
  <sub>2</sub> removal technologies. Understanding possible future changes in the coupled climate–carbon cycle are therefore of critical importance to making long-term projections of climate change over centuries to millennia [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C6">6</a>–
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C8">8</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ESM simulations have helped quantify the gradient of the approximately linear and scenario-independent relationship between cumulative emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub> and resultant global mean warming [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C9">9</a>–
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C12">12</a>] through coordinated experiments run by a set of ESMs from around the world [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C2">2</a>]. Using ESM-based estimates along with observational constraints, the 5th Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed the 
  <span class="italic">transient climate response to cumulative emissions</span> (TCRE—the global mean warming following a 1 TtC (1000 GtC) injection of CO
  <sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere) to be 
  <span class="italic">likely</span> (greater than 66% probability) between 0.8 and 2.5°C [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C13">13</a>], similar to the 0.8–2.4°C ESM-based TCRE range reported in [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C2">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The value of the TCRE has direct relevance to contemporary international climate policy as the approximate linearity between warming and cumulative emissions leads to an all-time ‘budget’ of allowable cumulative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions compatible with any given warming threshold, including the 1.5°C and 2°C thresholds of the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C14">14</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C15">15</a>]. While the timing of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions is important for economically efficient implementations of climate policy, particularly at national or regional levels, the cumulative CO
  <sub>2</sub> budget gives an unavoidable physical constraint on the total global CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions over all time. Although partitioning the global carbon budget into national shares is complex and value laden [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C16">16</a>–
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C18">18</a>], carbon budget framings may play an important role in setting national-level policies to meet the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large uncertainty in estimates of TCRE propagates into substantial uncertainty in the allowable carbon budget for a given temperature threshold. For instance, varying TCRE from 0.8 to 2.5°C would change the all-time CO
  <sub>2</sub>-only cumulative carbon budget for a 2°C threshold (which would only correspond to an absolute warming of 2°C from preindustrial under the assumption that net non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> warming is negligible at time of peak warming) by 1700 GtC (ranging from 800 to 2500 GtC), corresponding to over 150 years of present-day global CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the large uncertainties in TCRE arising from ESM simulations, this paper investigates to what extent useful information can be derived from the historical record to further inform estimates of the TCRE, and hence constrain estimates of remaining carbon budgets. We build on the observational estimates made in both [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C9">9</a>] and [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C2">2</a>] to provide an update on observationally constrained TCRE, incorporating the most recent observations of both warming and emissions. The observational and model data used are discussed in §2. In §3a, we use a detection and attribution method that does not directly rely on estimates of forcing or response from complex climate models to estimate the all-forcing or ‘effective’ TCRE (the global mean warming from all-forcing agents following 1 TtC cumulative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions) [
  <a rid="RSTA20160449C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160449C19">19</a>] from observations and up-to-date assessments of radiative forcing uncertainty. We then compare these observational effective TCRE estimates with those simulated over the historical period in ESMs. In §3b, we discuss inferences about uncertainty in the CO
  <sub>2</sub>-only TCRE over the historical period and compare with estimates of ESM-simulated historical CO
  <sub>2</sub>-induced and non-CO
  <sub>2</sub>-induced. Section 4 contains a concluding discussion.
