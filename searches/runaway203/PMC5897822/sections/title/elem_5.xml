 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effective TCRE calculated using human-induced warming (black in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160449F1" href="#RSTA20160449F1">figure 1</a>) displays substantially less variation over time than estimates from pure observed warming (grey bars) as the changing contributions of both temporary natural forcing (such as volcanic eruptions) and natural climate variability have been regressed out. This indicates that natural climate variability typically has a larger impact on estimates of effective TCRE from observations than changing fractional contributions to forced warming associated with evolving historical non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing. Total uncertainty in the attributed effective TCRE is larger (beige bars in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160449F1" href="#RSTA20160449F1">figure 1</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>) than that associated with purely observational uncertainty, as decadal mean uncertainty is much larger in human-attributable warming than observed warming. Over the 2007–2016 period, the total uncertainty on the attributed effective TCRE displays a 5–95% range of 1.43–2.37°C/TtC and a best-estimate of 1.84°C/TtC.

This underestimate of cumulative emissions in ESMs relative to the best-estimate observed value is persistent over the last half century and as such cannot be attributed to an artefact of the so-called ‘hiatus’ in warming which could have acted to temporarily reduce the observed annual airborne fraction, therefore allowing models to meet a similar concentration evolution with lower diagnosed emissions.
