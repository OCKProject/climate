      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As CMIP5 ESM simulations were driven by observed atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration pathways, compatible anthropogenic emissions can be diagnosed from
         the simulated land and ocean carbon sinks compatible with the prescribed increase
         in atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> [
         <a>33</a>]. Therefore, CMIP5 historical simulations can be explicitly validated against the
         observational record in terms of their joint simulation of warming and anthropogenic
         cumulative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions, as both of these variables are outputs of the ESM simulations.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparisons between the observed record and ESMs for temperature and diagnosed cumulative
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions are shown in 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>a</span>,
         <span>b</span>. In 2016, the ensemble mean of the smoothed global mean blended air/sea warming for
         the ESMs (solid thin coloured lines) was 0.10°C (0.41 to −0.27°C ensemble range) warmer
         than the estimated human-induced warming from global (HadCRUT4-CW) observations (solid
         black line approximately 1°C in 2016). Historical cumulative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions (to the end of 2016) are typically underdiagnosed relative to the GCP observations
         in many of the ESMs (by 27 GtC for the multi-model mean, 121 to −65.7 GtC ensemble
         range), with nine out of 15 ESMs diagnosing historical cumulative emissions to be
         less than best-estimate observed emissions between 1870 and 2016. As many ESMs typically
         underestimate land or ocean carbon sinks, and hence compatible annual anthropogenic
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions needed to close the carbon budget [
         <a>6</a>,
         <a>33</a>,
         <a>42</a>,
         <a>43</a>], such underestimates in historical cumulative emissions are expected. This underestimate
         of cumulative emissions in ESMs relative to the best-estimate observed value is persistent
         over the last half century and as such cannot be attributed to an artefact of the
         so-called ‘hiatus’ in warming which could have acted to temporarily reduce the observed
         annual airborne fraction, therefore allowing models to meet a similar concentration
         evolution with lower diagnosed emissions.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Combining the ESM simulations of warming and diagnosed cumulative emissions typically
         produces estimates of the effective TCRE greater than the best-estimate from the historical
         period (
         <a>figure 2</a><span>c</span>,
         <span>d</span>). Subsequent to substantial variability in the effective TCRE prior to 1980, in both
         ESMs and observations the effective TCRE has been approximately constant since 2000.
         ESMs show a higher value than estimated from the observational best-estimate in 12
         out of 15 ESMs by 2016 (
         <a>figure 1</a><span>d</span>). Despite the substantial variation between different observationally based estimates
         of the effective TCRE, and substantial uncertainty in human-induced warming, the mean
         ESM effective TCRE (2016) is 0.27°C/TtC higher than the estimate based on attributable
         human-induced warming, and four out of 15 ESMs have effective TCREs greater than the
         observational 95th percentile for 2016 (approx. 2.45°C/TtC; 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>d</span>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Remaining carbon budgets estimates from ESMs are determined by the coevolution of
         simulated warming and diagnosed CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions and not by either in isolation. All but three of the 15 ESMs considered
         here have a greater warming than observational best-estimate human-induced warming
         when diagnosed cumulative emissions reach 565 GtC in both the blended and global surface
         air-temperature ESM time-series, with some models displaying warming already in excess
         of 1.5°C for 565 GtC emissions (
         <a>figure 3</a><span>a</span>) for both types of model output. Similarly, both blended and global surface air-temperature
         ESM time-series can have substantially lower diagnosed cumulative emissions than the
         observed best-estimate when warming reaches the 2016 best-estimate human-induced value
         of approximately 1.0°C (
         <a>figure 3</a><span>b</span>).
