      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ESM data used in this paper are taken from experiments conducted under the 5th
         Coupled Model Intercomparison Project—CMIP5 [
         <a>31</a>]. We use results from the historical simulation as well as from the Representative
         Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios [
         <a>32</a>,
         <a>33</a>] and the idealized 1%/yr atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration increase experiment [
         <a>34</a>]. The list of ESMs used in this analysis is as follows: CESM1-BGC, CanESM2, GFDL-ESM2G,
         GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, IPSL-CM5B-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM,
         MIROC-EMS, MPI-ESM-LR, NorESM1-ME, bcc-csm1–1 and inmcm4. Models for which data are
         not available for the 1%/yr experiment are omitted from analysis that involves the
         use of those experiments (§3b(i)). In comparing the ESMs against the observational
         record, we consider the effect of observational processing on the modelled temperature
         anomalies to allow a like-for-like comparison with observational products. ‘Blended’
         time-series of globally complete simulated warming are taken from [
         <a>22</a>], which processed model output using a blend of surface air-temperatures (over land)
         and sea-surface temperatures (over ocean), similar to as in observational products.
         This enables a direct ‘like-for-like’ comparison between globally complete model output
         and observational products that are statistically in-filled to address observational
         coverage gaps in order to estimate a global mean value. We use the RCP8.5 scenario
         [
         <a>35</a>] when comparing ESMs to observations over the post-2005 period.

         <sub>2</sub> emissions from Jones 
         <span>et al.</span> [
         <a>33</a>] (historical and RCP experiments) and Gillett 
         <span>et al.</span> [
         <a>2</a>] (1%/yr experiment) are used throughout. Land-use emissions have been added, where
         required, identically to as in [
         <a>36</a>]. Time-series of both warming and cumulative emissions for all RCP ESM simulations
         are smoothed with a 10 year centred moving average to remove modes of unforced natural
         variability and help isolate the externally forced signal (1%/yr ESM simulations are
         smoothed with a 15 year running mean).
