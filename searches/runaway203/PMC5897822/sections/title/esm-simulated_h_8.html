      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using a combination of historical simulations and idealized 1%/yr CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration increase experiments, it is possible to partition simulated historical
         warming in ESMs into CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced and non-CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced components. From a time-series of simulated warming under the 1%/yr experiments
         for a given ESM, it is possible to estimate the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming for a given level of cumulative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions. Comparisons with the estimate of the simulated warming in the historical
         simulations for the same level of cumulative emissions allows a quantification of
         the warming induced by CO
         <sub>2</sub> alone versus the warming from non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> anthropogenic and natural forcing components.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This method assumes a linear separability between CO
         <sub>2</sub> and non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> warming, and a perfect scenario independence of the relationship between cumulative
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions and CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming. While evidence exists for dependence of carbon-cycle feedbacks on
         the total warming within the climate system [
         <a>46</a>,
         <a>47</a>], as well as some scenario dependence of the response to cumulative emissions [
         <a>48</a>], to a first order these remain good assumptions to partition ESM-simulated historical
         warming into CO
         <sub>2</sub> and non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> contributions. An additional implicit assumption is that carbon-cycle feedbacks (which
         give rise to the relationship between warming and cumulative emissions in these experiments)
         estimated from the 1%/yr simulation are a good proxy for the carbon-cycle feedbacks
         over the historical period. For example, as the 1%/yr simulations have fixed preindustrial
         land-use forcing, unlike the historical simulation, some differences might be expected
         in the land carbon feedbacks between the two experiments for a single climate model.
         We provide a proxy test of the similarity between ESM carbon-cycle feedbacks in the
         two experiments using a simple climate carbon-cycle model in the electronic supplementary
         material. Based on this technique, we conclude that the difference in carbon-cycle
         feedbacks between the two experiments is unlikely to have a large effect on the diagnosed
         cumulative emissions over the historical integration, but could be expected to have
         a substantial effect under high future emission scenarios such as RCP8.5.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diagnosed cumulative emissions for a given atmospheric concentration evolution will
         also somewhat depend on the profile of other forcing agents, due to both non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> contributions to warming affecting natural carbon sinks and (in the case of aerosols)
         changes to the biogeochemical carbon-cycle feedback by direct impact on diffuse surface
         radiation. MacDougall 
         <span>et al.</span> [
         <a>49</a>] showed that in the UVic intermediate complexity model, the inclusion of non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> radiative forcing only caused a small reduction in diagnosed cumulative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions over the historical period. Similarly, the study of MacDougall &amp; Knutti
         [
         <a>50</a>] indicates only a fractionally small increase in long-lived warming associated with
         the effect of present-day methane emission rates on the efficacy of carbon sinks.
         Therefore, while the effects of both non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> forcing on carbon sinks, and possible difference between carbon-cycle feedbacks in
         the 1%/yr and historical integrations, add uncertainty to estimates of ESM CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming, the method used here can serve as a useful approximation over the
         historical period.
