  <span class="sup">18</span>O values of speleothems in northern Borneo (Carolin 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 2013) show a broad trend of dry climate well before the LGM, and no distinct difference during the LGM and late MIS 3. Notably, the Sunda shelf was largely exposed well before the LGM, and may have significantly impacted climate on these locations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). By contrast, records from locations disconnected from the exposed landmass, such as Palawan and Sulawesi, indicate a drying from at least 35 kyr BP with maximal drying during the LGM. Regional differences might be expected in this complex region. Annual mean 21k-0k precipitation difference for the HadCM3M2 –Ocean-Atmosphere experiment

  </span>. A significant period of drying is inferred from the cave guano values for much of the LGP, with maximal expression prior to the LGM, in our study area. This finding is similar to that found at a continental site at the north western side of the purported savanna corridor

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. The Saleh Cave guano record provides the first unambiguous terrestrial evidence from Borneo, at the equatorial end of the purported ‘savanna corridor’, that distinctly open-canopy vegetation occurred during the LGP. This record, in combination with those in northern Sundaland provides the strongest evidence yet of the existence of a ‘savanna corridor’
