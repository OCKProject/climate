 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional feature of the Saleh stable isotope records is that δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C profiles vary in concert with insolation at the equator during boreal summer (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). At this time, precessional forcing is strong, and indicates a sensitivity with vegetation. Prior to the early Holocene peak, July insolation is lowest at 33 kyr BP and highest at 25 kyr BP, which closely tracks vegetation change at Saleh cave as inferred from δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values. Vegetation sensitivity to insolation surrounding Saleh cave could be translated rapidly via vegetation feedbacks and SSTs in the IPWP as recorded in the Celebes Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. The Celebes Sea record also bears strong similarities to the savanna record at Saleh, where relatively cool (warm) SST in the Celebes Sea is closely associated with dry (wet) conditions in South Kalimantan, Indonesia (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This includes a period of cool SSTs from at least 40 to 27.5 cal kyr BP when the highest 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values of guano and HMW 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkanes occurred in the Saleh Cave record. An abrupt increase in SST occurred from c. 27.7 until 23 cal kyr, coeval with wetter conditions inferred from the Saleh Cave record (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Relatively cool SSTs returned during the LGM, coincident with a further expansion of open vegetation with a significant tropical grass component at Saleh Cave. Early Holocene SSTs gradually increased to the currently warm IPWP regime, and, although compromised by a loss of sample resolution (see methods), the Saleh record demonstrates that closed rainforest canopy was established during the Holocene. We find that increased SST in the IPWP, even under glacial conditions, is associated with a reduction in C
  <sub>4</sub> biomass in southern Borneo (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Although, analogies based on present-day ENSO dynamics fail to describe tropical climate change in the region during the LGM due to shelf exposure, it appears that there is a strong linkage between SSTs of the IPWP and vegetation during the LGP, not unlike those of today, with El Niño associated with reduced convection, particularly in southern Borneo as compared with the north

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Saleh Cave record adds to an emerging picture of significant climate heterogeneity in the region, with high sensitivity to glacial-interglacial forcing. A north-south savanna corridor from peninsular Malaysia, through central Sundaland during glacial periods would represent a ‘barrier’ for rainforest specialists as it imposed restrictions on east-west dispersal, thereby increasing local endemism in rainforest refugia east and west of the corridor

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. In contrast, the corridor provided a north-south ‘bridge’ facilitating dispersal for organisms that favor open habitats. The legacy of this corridor is evident in the genetic diversity and species distributions observed across island Southeast Asia today
