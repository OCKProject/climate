 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Briefly, guano samples were crushed using a mortar and pestle, and lipids were removed by sonicating in 2:1 (v/v) dichloromethane/ methanol 3 times, followed with one rinse in methanol. Solvent extracted guano (SEG) was then washed in 1 M NaOH at 100 °C for 30 minutes, neutralised using DI-water and subsequently washed for 3 hrs in 2 M HCl, and neutralized before freeze-drying again (SEG-BA). Carbon isotope composition was determined using an elemental analyzer (ECS 4010 CHNSO Analyzer; Costech Analytical Technologies INC, Valencia, CA, USA) fitted with a Costech Zero Blank Autosampler coupled via a ConFloIV to a Thermo Scientific Delta V
  <span class="sup">PLUS</span> using Continuous-Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (EA-IRMS) at the Advanced Analytical Centre, James Cook University, Cairns. Calibration curves for elemental abundances were determined for two in-house standards (Chitin and Taipan) and USGS-40 (L-glutamic acid) within the same analysis sequence, and reproducibility was better than ±5% of the value.

  <span class="sup">13</span>C values are reported as per mil (‰) deviations from the VPDB reference scale, using the same reference materials as for elemental abundances. Precisions (S.D.) on internal standards were better than ±0.1‰.

  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane fractions were extracted from guano using a CEM MARS (Microwave accelerated reaction system) with 2:1 DCM:MeOH (v/v). Filtered samples were further cleaned using silica gel flash chromatography. The compound-specific carbon isotope composition of 
  <span class="italic">n-</span>alkanes was measured with a Thermo Scientific Trace GC instrument connected to a Thermo Scientific Delta Plus XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GC-IRMS), equipped with a DB-5 MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The injector was set at 300 °C. The GC oven temperature was held at 50 °C for 1 min, then set to 220 °C at 10 °C/min (held 2 min), and then to 300 °C (2 °C/min), and finally to 310 °C (10 °C/min, held for 20 min). He was used as carrier gas (1.4 ml/min). The temperature of the combustion oven was 950 °C. Instrumental performance was verified before and after each sample run using an 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-alkane standard mixture with known 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values (
  <span class="italic">n</span>-C16–
  <span class="italic">n</span>-C30, Indiana University). The relative standard deviation for reference material was better than ±0.5‰, based on a minimum of two analyses. Results are reported as per mil (‰) deviations from the VPDB reference scale.
