 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saleh Cave (3.03220º S, 115.98386º E, 48 m) is located in a tropical karst tower along the eastern edge of South Kalimantan, Indonesia, approximately 25 (200) km from the modern (LGM) coast (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). It is a small shelter extending approximately 500 m into the karst with unidentified insectivorous bats presently inhabiting the cave, and two open chambers each containing a separate and large guano deposits. The nearest deposit to the entrance was very wet and pocketed by drip holes in the surface. We collected from the drier and larger chamber further from the entrance. Surface and ancient ‘rock guano’ (at depth) were collected from a pit excavated through accumulated guano to bedrock at 304 cm depth. Exposed sediments were sampled at 3–5 cm intervals, adjusted where necessary to ensure that sample intervals did not cross stratigraphic boundaries. Samples were irradiated to sterilize, then kept frozen until freeze-dried.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A chronology was established by AMS 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C measurements on solvent extracted guano using acid/base/acid treatment (see Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). A few samples were problematic, and these were repeated by isolating pyrogenic carbon using hydrogen pyrolysis and submitted for radiocarbon measurement (see Supplementary information). An age model was constructed using Bacon 2.2 which employs Bayesian analysis to reconstruct accumulation rates for depositional sequences, through combining radiocarbon dates with prior information such as accumulation rate and its variability. The output is a probability distribution of calibrated dates with depth (Blaauw and Christen, 2011). Calendar year as a function of depth was plotted using weighted mean age output (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Radiocarbon measurements indicate that guano miners removed much of the Holocene guano. Modern guano contribution to surface samples (down to 20 cm) was estimated via carbon abundances, and guano age to 25 cm was estimated via mass balance between contemporary guano and ancient guano, hence an apparent low accumulation rate above 20 cm.
