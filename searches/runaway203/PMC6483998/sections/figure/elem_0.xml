  <p>Current and projected LGM conditions surrounding equatorial Southeast Asia. Diamond showing location of Saleh cave (3.0322°S, 115.9839°E) used for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Other cave locations (dots), lake sediments (square), offshore terrestrial (triangles), and Sea Surface Temperature (star) records are indicated. Yellow symbols indicate open vegetation and green symbols indicate closed forest were interpreted for the LGM. (
