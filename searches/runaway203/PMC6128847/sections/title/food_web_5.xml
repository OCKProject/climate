 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Chinook salmon-southern resident killer whale food web of the Northeastern Pacific has several functional groups or species, including phytoplankton, three invertebrate groups, including zoobenthos, zooplankton and squids, fish groups, and marine mammal groups represented within an Ecopath with Ecosism (EwE) ecosystem model (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a> and Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>, Supplementary References). The diet composition matrix for species and functional groups represents the ecosystem’s food web, including apex marine predators such as resident and transient killer whales (see Supplementary Information).
