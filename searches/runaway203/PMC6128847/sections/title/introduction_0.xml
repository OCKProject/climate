 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To analyze the potential synergistic impacts of climate change on pollutant bioaccumulation, we simulated forward-looking scenarios for the bioaccumulation of MeHg and PCBs (i.e. as the sum of congeners, ∑PCB; please see Supplementary Information) in a regional marine food web in the Northeastern Pacific (Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a> and Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) by using the Ecotracer module in Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) (see Methods; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). The model accounts for the flow of biomasses and contaminants across 20 species groups in the ecosystem through their trophic interactions (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a> and Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>), and includes the mean temperature tolerance (MTT) in marine invertebrates and fish (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>) and contaminant input data (Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>), but it does not account for some pollutant biogeochemical processes such as PCB cycling and increased rates of mercury methylation in a warming environment. We hypothesize that bioaccumulation of organic pollutants, specifically MeHg and PCBs, can be amplified in the food web by climate change and that the level of bioamplification may vary between different pollutants.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interactions between biogeochemical climate change drivers and pollutants were modelled through deterministic simulations under climate change forcing scenarios, including Representative Concentrations Pathway (i.e. RCP 2.6-‘strong mitigation’/low CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions and RCP 8.5-‘business-as-usual’/high CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions), and compared against a reference baseline (control) scenario with no-climate change forcing, i.e. no changes in CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels and biogeochemical variables from the present conditions (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Our model represented the effects of the changes in sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen level and pH (i.e. ocean acidification) on the metabolic efficiency of functional groups, resulting in increased or decreased biological productivity (see Supplementary Information). Metabolic efficiency was determined by the ratio of consumption to production of each functional group that changed dynamically as trophic interactions were modified by the climatic forcing. Projected changes in primary production were represented by changing phytoplankton biomass (i.e. phytoplankton forcing function under either RCP 2.6 or RCP 8.5) in the ecosystem model (see Supplementary Information). Changes in ocean variables were based on outputs from the NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamic Laboratory Earth System Model 2M (NOAA-GFDL ESM2M) (see Methods; Supplementary Information; Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a> and

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We accounted for model uncertainties associated with the biases between observed and predicted contaminant levels as well as the internal variability of the projections (Supplementary Information; Tables

  <span class="italic">MB</span>
  <sub>

  <span class="italic">Orcinus orca</span> (SRKW hereafter), and Chinook salmon (
  <span class="italic">Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</span>) with Ecotracer, and empirical PCB data reported for these species (see Methods; Supplementary Information). This is done by comparing the simulated contaminant data to the empirical contaminant data observed in these species to test the performance of the modelling approach and reveal any underlying variations linked to contaminant concentrations and lipid content reported in the literature.
