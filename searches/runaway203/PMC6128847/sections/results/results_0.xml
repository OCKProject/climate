 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amongst the functional groups, MeHg bioaccumulation in Chinook salmon and SRKW (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1E,F</a>) is more sensitive to climate change (i.e. species-specific response to the effect of climate change forcing) relative to other lower trophic level groups (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1A–D</a>). While Chinook salmon showed high concentration pulses under RCP 8.5, SRKW exhibited an increasing, smooth trend in MeHg concentrations until reaching steady state toward the end of the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1F</a>). Although MeHg concentrations tend to reach steady state in plankton over time, the projections for other low trophic level species unveiled increasing concentrations at the very beginning of the simulation, followed by a rapid decline with temporal pulses in the long term (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1A–E</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to MeHg, although PCB concentrations were also projected to be amplified by climate change, the level of amplification was lower under the higher emission RCP 8.5 scenario (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3A–F</a>). Average PCB concentrations from 2070–2099 under the ‘strong mitigation’ (RCP 2.6) and ‘business-as-usual’ (RCP 8.5) scenarios were 40 and 20%, respectively, higher for all functional groups relative to the reference scenario (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4A</a>). However, except for killer whales, amplifications of bioaccumulation of PCBs in most other species groups were projected to be lower by 2090 under RCP 8.5 relative to RCP 2.6. For instance, from 2005–2099, the average (±95% CI) percent increases in PCBs under each scenario were 17.5% (±1.41%) and 10% (±0.84%) in Chinook salmon under RCP 2.6 an RCP 8.5 (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>), respectively. In contrast, PCBs concentration in SRKW increases by 0.35% (±0.23%) and 3.0% (±0.17%) in SRKW under the low and high emission scenarios, respectively (Fig.

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All functional groups of species have similar efficiency of MeHg bioaccumulation under RCP 8.5 relative to RCP 2.6 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Specifically, the significant contribution of MeHg of squid under RCP 8.5 is further compensated by the increased bioaccumulation of other functional groups (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) serving as prey items for Chinook salmon (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While projected PCB concentrations in phytoplankton, zooplankton, forage fish, and squid displayed large temporal variations under long-term climate signals (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) with positive trends towards the end of the century under changes in sea surface temperature and net primary production (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5; Supplementary Information), fluctuation in PCB concentrations were not projected (i.e. steady state) under the no climate change scenario, i.e. reference baseline (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3A–D</a>). Conversely, Chinook salmon (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3E</a>) exhibited an initial, moderate period of decreasing concentrations (i.e. over 2005–2010) followed by a slight increasing trend in PCB concentrations after 2050. Such non-linear trend is driven by an initial decrease in dietary intake of more PCB-contaminated forage fish and squid, both of which also exhibit relatively higher PCB concentrations over the 2050–2010 period (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3C,D</a>). In the long term, the simulations show increases in squid biomass (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>), and thus, in prey for Chinook salmon (i.e. the % of squid as prey increased from ~10% in 2005 to &gt;20–30% by 2100 under RCP 8.5) although the availability of forage fish continue to decrease (as % of prey, forage fish decreased from 33% in 2005 to &gt;20–30% by 2090–2100 under RCP 8.5; Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>). The percent of prey consumed by Chinook salmon under RCP 2.6 is relatively constant over the simulation period (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>) in comparison to the prey proportion under RCP 8.5 (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to Chinook salmon, the contribution of Chinook salmon as the major prey item of SRWK, through which most of PCBs and MeHg intake is from, is projected to decrease from 90% in 2005 to 86.7% by 2100 under RCP 2.6; however, Chinook salmon remains relatively constant as a prey (~90%) under RCP 8.5. For the secondary prey of SRKWs, chum salmon (
  <span class="italic">O. keta</span>) increases from 5% in 2005 for both RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 to 8% and 9.5% in 2100 for RCP 2.6 and 8.5, respectively. Conversely, Coho salmon (
  <span class="italic">O. kisutch</span>) decreases from 5% in 2005 to 1.0% by 2100 under RCP 8.5. These differences in prey percent can be illustrated in terms of the RCP 8.5/RCP 2.6 ratio of prey proportion for SRKW, as depicted in Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S8</a>. As an example, Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S8</a> (Supporting Information) shows that the RCP 8.5/RCP 2.6 ratio for Coho salmon dwindles from 1.0 at the initial time of simulation to 0.3 by 2100 (i.e. 70% reduction).

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trophic magnification factor (TMF; see Methods) was calculated as metric of biomagnification for PCBs and MeHg in the food web for the entire simulation period subject to climate change forcing. A significant increase in predicted log-PCB and log-MeHg concentrations correlated with trophic level for both RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5A–D</a>) was predicted. The TMF of PCB and MeHg under RCP 2.6, RCP 8.5 and the no climate change scenarios was significantly greater than one (TMF &gt; 1), i.e. 4.99–5.30 for PCBs; and, 52.4–53.1 for MeHg across the climate change scenarios (Supplementary Table

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the TMF values for MeHg were higher than those for PCBs (i.e. average MeHg-TMF/PCBs-TMF ratio ≈ 10), TMFs were basically similar under the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios as well as under the no climate change scenario for either PCBs or MeHg, as shown in Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S8</a>. These findings suggest the lack of attributable effects by climate change on TMFs in the simulations for this particular food web despite the increasing changes projected across most species groups, under the influence climate change forcing (Figs
