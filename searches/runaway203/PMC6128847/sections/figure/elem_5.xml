  <p>Historical projections of PCB concentrations (mg/kg lipid) in southern resident killer whales (SRKW) (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) and Chinook salmon (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) simulated with the Ecotracer routine of the EwE model and adjusted to different values of lipid content (%). Projected PCB concentrations of PCBs lipid normalized to relatively normal values of lipid content reproduce concentrations close to empirical data observed in both species, as reported elsewhere

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>. The open circles are the average PCB concentration observed in SRKW and Chinook salmon and error bars are 95% CI. By normalizing the PCB concentrations to low lipid fractions observed in killer whales (i.e. lipid content = 9.6%) and Chinook salmons (i.e. lipid content = 0.87%), the concentrations of PCBs are amplified in these species as an indication of a bioamplification process.
