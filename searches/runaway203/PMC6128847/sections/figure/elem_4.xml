  <p>Relationships between the logarithm (log
   <sub>10</sub>) of projected contaminant concentrations, simulated under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, and trophic level (TL) throughout the entire simulation period in the marine food web. (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) log PCBs vs TL under RCP 2.6; (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) log PCBs vs TL under RCP 8.5; (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) log MeHg vs TL under RCP 2.6; and, (
   <span class="bold">D</span>) log MeHg vs TL under RCP 8.5. Data points (solid circles) represent the overall log average ± log SD (error bars) concentrations calculated for the entire simulation period (2005–2100). For reference purposes, PCB data predicted for harbor seals (
   <span class="italic">Phoca vitulina</span>), Steller sea lions (
   <span class="italic">Eumetopias jubatus</span>), and transient killer whales (
   <span class="italic">O</span>. 
   <span class="italic">orca</span>) are also included as reference data points. The apparent trophic magnification factor (TMF) was calculated from the slopes of the relationships (see Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a> in Supplementary Information).
