 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extreme high-temperature events have continued to occur as global warming has continued in the last several decades; a significant increase in the number of extreme warm days has been observed on most continents, while the number of extreme cold days has remarkably decreased [

  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-02661">2</a>]. With the enhancement of global warming, the frequency and intensity of heat waves increase. These natural disasters can lead to illnesses and the deaths of people and animals and great economic losses [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Central Asia (CA) has a typical temperate continental climate that is characterized by sharp temperature ranges, intensive evaporation, and dry and rainless environments, which depend on the location and topography. As one of the world’s most arid areas, CA has an extremely fragile natural environment and ecological system, and thus is extremely sensitive to climate change [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-02661">5</a>]. The rate of the temperature increase is much higher than the global rate or that in the Northern Hemisphere [

  <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-02661">7</a>]. Recently, CA has received increasing interest from scientific communities, and many research projects have focused on the environmental and ecological variations in this region [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-02661">8</a>,
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-02661">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-16-02661">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-02661">11</a>]. However, information about the variations in climate extremes and their effects on ecological and social systems remains scarce. The extent of the impact of regional warming, which can be avoided by lowering the warming level, deserves special attention. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the changes of high-temperature events in CA under different climate scenarios.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Paris Agreement set a limit on the global mean surface air temperature (SAT) change of 2.0 °C and an aspirational limit of 1.5 °C relative to preindustrial levels [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-02661">12</a>,
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-02661">13</a>]. To achieve this goal, countries submitted national mitigation plans in the form of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC). As of May 2019, a total of 192 countries have reported their respective INDC mitigation targets to the United Nations, accounting for the current mitigation commitments negotiated by governments [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have an important impact on regional climate extremes in the next few decades. By considering the INDC emission scenarios and synthesizing national INDC mitigation targets, this bottom–up approach reflecting the willingness of each country to reduce their GHG emissions is more realistic, because it avoids the divergence of different countries from the distribution quota [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-16-02661">15</a>]. Nevertheless, few recent studies made use of the INDC scenarios and mainly focused on the global mean temperature responses [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-16-02661">16</a>,
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-02661">17</a>,
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-02661">18</a>,
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-02661">19</a>]. Few studies evaluated the possible changes of regional extreme high-temperature events under the INDC pledges, so that the socioeconomic system risks associated with the temperature-related extreme change in the next few decades are still unknown.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, the regional mean and extreme high-temperature changes in CA are examined in association with the INDC emission scenarios and compared with those based on the 2.0 °C/1.5 °C scenarios. The key questions are (a) how will the regional SAT change under the INDC scenario in different regions of CA, (b) how will the extreme high-temperature change under the INDC scenario, and (c) what impacts can be avoided in CA by lowering the warming level (e.g., 2.0 °C or 1.5 °C) compared with the INDC scenario? The multi-model ensemble of 32 global climate models (GCMs) from the Fifth Coupled Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) was used in this study.</p>
