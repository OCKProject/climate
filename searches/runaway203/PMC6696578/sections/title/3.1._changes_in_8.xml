 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CA will experience a remarkably higher warming rate than the global mean based on various scenarios. The regional mean SAT in CA will be 2.3 °C (1.8–2.7 °C, 25–75% interval range), 3.0 °C (2.5–3.5 °C), and 4.8 °C (4.2–5.3 °C) above the preindustrial level under the 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, and INDC scenarios, respectively. With respect to the spatial pattern, the warming will be stronger in high-latitude areas and in the Pamir Mountains in all scenarios. The differences between the INDC/2.0 °C (or 2.0 °C/1.5 °C) scenarios are also larger in these areas (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further analyzed the changes in the regional mean daily maximum and minimum SAT structures of the three scenarios compared with the present climatology (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02661-f003">Figure 3</a>). The high-temperature PR (e.g., higher than the 80th percentile of the present climatology) increases, while the low-temperature PR (e.g., lower than the 20th percentile of the present climatology) decreases. The extreme high-temperature PR increases much more than the mild high-temperature PR. With respect to the daily maximum temperatures higher than the 99th percentile of the present day in CA, the PR will be 4.5, 5.9, and 11.7 times that of the present day in the 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, and INDC scenarios, respectively. The increasing PR amplitudes of nighttime hot extremes are larger than those of daytime hot extremes. Similarly, the PR of the daily maximum temperatures higher than the 99th percentile of the present day in CA will be 5.3, 7.4, and 15.5, respectively. Among the countries in CA, the increases in the PRs of extremely high temperatures are strong in TJK and KGZ (
