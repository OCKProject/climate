 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High-temperature events can be defined using either relative or absolute thresholds. The six extreme high-temperature indices that were applied in this study are listed in 
  <a rid="ijerph-16-02661-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02661-t001">Table 1</a>. The indices three-day warm day event (TMX3day) and three-day warm night event (TNX3day) were used as representatives of the indices defined according to the intensity, denoting several continuous days/nights during which extremely warm temperatures are prevalent. There is no universal and rigorous definition of heat wave (HW) when considering high-temperature events despite various studies, because the research regions and methods applied in the past considerably vary [
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-16-02661">31</a>]. In this study, a HW index was defined as a consecutive period of at least three days during which the daily maximum temperature exceeded the 95th percentile of the baseline period. The percentile threshold was ≥30 °C, and HW represents the impact of the longest period of hot days. The advantage of the combination of relative and absolute thresholds is the wide applicability to diverse climatological regions [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, other widely used extreme temperature indices include a duration index (warm spell duration index, WSDI) and two frequency indices (warm days, TX90p, and warm nights, TN90p) [
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-16-02661">33</a>]. When calculating the percentile-based indices, a bootstrap procedure recommended by Zhang et al. (2005) [
  <a rid="B34-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-16-02661">34</a>] was used for the baseline period (1961–1990) to avoid inhomogeneity across the in-base and out-base periods.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding social impacts, the projected population distributions under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) [
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-16-02661">35</a>] were used to investigate the population-weighted changes of the extreme high-temperature indices. These SSPs describe five alternative outcomes for trends in demographics, economics, technological development, lifestyles, governance, and other societal factors. Projections of spatial population change are quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections for the SSPs and qualitatively consistent with assumptions in the SSP narratives regarding spatial development patterns. These projections are produced by a parameterized gravity-based downscaling model. In this paper, we only show the population-related results estimated from the population projected for the year 2100 under the SSP2 scenario. However, the population exposures based on projections under other SSP scenarios are qualitatively similar.
