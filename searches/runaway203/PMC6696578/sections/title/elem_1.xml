In this study, the 165 national NDC that were submitted as of May 2019 were analyzed; the European Union member states submitted one NDC target for the whole region. The reported national emission targets range from absolute to relative base year levels or represent emission reduction targets relative to the baseline emission scenarios. We calculated each country’s future quantified emissions targets using the normalization method. For additional information on the NDC dataset, please refer to the study of Wang et al. (2018) [

To extend the INDC scenario to the end of this century, we assume that countries continue the mitigation efforts pledged in the INDC, and that the global emissions follow a relatively constant decarbonization rate after 2030.

We selected scenarios in which the 2030 GHG emission level is consistent with the NDC (50–56 GtCO

The percentile threshold was ≥30 °C, and HW represents the impact of the longest period of hot days. The advantage of the combination of relative and absolute thresholds is the wide applicability to diverse climatological regions [

These SSPs describe five alternative outcomes for trends in demographics, economics, technological development, lifestyles, governance, and other societal factors. Projections of spatial population change are quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections for the SSPs and qualitatively consistent with assumptions in the SSP narratives regarding spatial development patterns. These projections are produced by a parameterized gravity-based downscaling model. In this paper, we only show the population-related results estimated from the population projected for the year 2100 under the SSP2 scenario. However, the population exposures based on projections under other SSP scenarios are qualitatively similar.
