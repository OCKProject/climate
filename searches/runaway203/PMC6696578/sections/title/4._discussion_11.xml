 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate warming in response to actual emission reductions within the framework of the Paris Agreement remains an ongoing interest. Most of the published studies are based on representative concentration pathways (RCP) or 2.0 °C/1.5 °C scenarios, which do not account for the current national mitigation commitments negotiated by governments. In this study, we quantified the regional climate change based on the self-determined emission reduction commitments made in climate negotiations as the starting point to assess the future climate response. Our results indicate that the climate warming under the INDC scenarios is projected to greatly exceed the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement of stabilizing the global mean temperature above the 2.0 °C or 1.5 °C level. Extreme high-temperature events in CA will become more intense, more frequent, and longer-lasting with the enhancement of global warming, and their responses to global warming are basically linear. If the global emission reductions are further strengthened to achieve the ambitious 2.0 °C/1.5 °C temperature target, the benefits with respect to the reduction of the regional risk associated with record-breaking high-temperature events are remarkable.</p>

The slight differences in the projected HWs between different studies could be explained by the definition of the HW and/or the dataset used. Furthermore, HWs should be defined based on a combination of temperature and humidity, which are more closely associated with human health [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies, which are based on the CMIP5 dataset, were not specifically designed for the assessment of the climate response under the Paris Agreement. The recent NCAR CESM Low-Warming [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-16-02661">40</a>] and HAPPI experiments [
  <a rid="B41-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-16-02661">41</a>], which aim to quantify the impacts on weather-related risks corresponding to a warming of 1.5 °C or 2.0 °C, are not specific to the INDC pledges, which are the focus of this study. Currently, the targeted experimental design concerning INDC emissions that are consistent with the Paris Agreement is still lacking. In addition, the resolutions of GCMs are too coarse to more precisely capture regional signals of climate extremes, while regional climate models (RCMs) with finer resolutions and more sophisticated processes have better abilities to reproduce the regional climate characteristics [
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-16-02661" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-16-02661">42</a>]. Thus, a targeted experiment associated with INDC emission pledges based on RCMs is needed to better project the changes in extreme high-temperatures at smaller regional scales in CA and provide policy makers with more precise information.
