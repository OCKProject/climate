  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CA will experience a remarkably higher warming rate than the global mean based on various scenarios. The regional mean SAT in CA will be 2.3 °C (1.8–2.7 °C, 25–75% interval range), 3.0 °C (2.5–3.5 °C), and 4.8 °C (4.2–5.3 °C) above the preindustrial level under the 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, and INDC scenarios, respectively. With respect to the spatial pattern, the warming will be stronger in high-latitude areas and in the Pamir Mountains in all scenarios. The differences between the INDC/2.0 °C (or 2.0 °C/1.5 °C) scenarios are also larger in these areas (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further analyzed the changes in the regional mean daily maximum and minimum SAT structures of the three scenarios compared with the present climatology (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02661-f003">Figure 3</a>). The high-temperature PR (e.g., higher than the 80th percentile of the present climatology) increases, while the low-temperature PR (e.g., lower than the 20th percentile of the present climatology) decreases. The extreme high-temperature PR increases much more than the mild high-temperature PR. With respect to the daily maximum temperatures higher than the 99th percentile of the present day in CA, the PR will be 4.5, 5.9, and 11.7 times that of the present day in the 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, and INDC scenarios, respectively. The increasing PR amplitudes of nighttime hot extremes are larger than those of daytime hot extremes. Similarly, the PR of the daily maximum temperatures higher than the 99th percentile of the present day in CA will be 5.3, 7.4, and 15.5, respectively. Among the countries in CA, the increases in the PRs of extremely high temperatures are strong in TJK and KGZ (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Changes in Extreme High-Temperature Events</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first focused on the changes in the intensity index (i.e., TMX3day and TNX3day). The increasing amplitude of the TMX3day and TNX3day are relatively uniform across CA under the three scenarios (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f004" href="#ijerph-16-02661-f004">Figure 4</a>). Considering the population density-weighted change, the increasing amplitudes of the TMX3day and TNX3day are in general relatively close to those of the annual mean SAT (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02661-f005">Figure 5</a>). In most countries, the impact of TMX3day is slightly more pronounced than that of TNX3day.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Record-breaking high-temperature events will be more frequent. To estimate the scope of the impact of record-breaking events under different scenarios, we first calculated the fraction of the population/area in CA for which the TNX3day record defined during the historical period (1961–2005) was broken in any given year, and then smoothed it by the 21-year running mean. Approximately 51%/52% (72%/71%) of the population/area in CA will break the historical TMX3day (TNX3day) record under the INDC scenario, respectively (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f006" href="#ijerph-16-02661-f006">Figure 6</a>). A comparison of regional changes reveals that the TKM and TJK will experience stronger changes (
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-02661" href="#app1-ijerph-16-02661">Figure S4</a>). An approximately linear increase in the population/area fraction with the global mean warming can be observed in all regions, and the increasing rates of record-breaking nighttime hot extremes (i.e., TNX3day) are larger than those of daytime hot extremes (i.e., TMX3day).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the uniform changes in TMX3day and TNX3day, the change magnitudes of HWs show regional differences, with larger magnitudes in the low-altitude areas (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f004" href="#ijerph-16-02661-f004">Figure 4</a>). A notable increase lasting more than seven days mainly occurs in the south of CA (except for the Pamir Mountains) under the INDC scenario. The population density-weighted average changes are more intense in UZB, TKM, and TJK (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02661-f005">Figure 5</a>). The spatial patterns are similar, but the changes in the HWs under the 2.0°C/1.5°C scenarios are less significant compared with the INDC scenario (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f004" href="#ijerph-16-02661-f004">Figure 4</a>). Record-breaking HW events will also remarkably increase (similar to TMX3day and TNX3day); approximately 55%/51% of the population/area in CA will break the historical record under the INDC-pledge scenario. The increased amount of record-breaking HW events will be more evident in TKM and UZB.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section, the changes of other extreme indices are considered. For extreme indices defined according to frequency, the changes of the daytime extremes (i.e., TX90p) are smaller than those of the nighttime extremes (i.e., TN90p) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02661-f005">Figure 5</a>). The spatial patterns of three percentile-based indices (TX90p, TN90p, and WSDI) are similar; that is, more intense increases are observed in the south than in the north (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. Impacts Avoided Based on Low Warming Scenarios</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the warming is limited to a lower level, the CA region is projected to benefit from robust reductions in extreme high-temperature events (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02661-f007" href="#ijerph-16-02661-f007">Figure 7</a>). Compared with the INDC scenario, the lower warming of the 2.0 °C/1.5 °C target scenarios will help to avoid approximately 44%/65% of the increase in the intensity of extreme high-temperature events (TMX3day and TNX3day), 53–61%/75–80% of the increase in the duration of extreme high-temperature events (HW and WSDI), and approximately 48–52%/69–72% of the increase in the frequency of extreme high-temperature events (TX90p and TN90p) in CA based on the population density-weighted average indices. All the subregions would experience such a significant impact reduction, although the magnitudes would slightly differ.
