 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model demonstrates how the social learning rate can strongly determine temperature trends. We first consider a null hypothesis where adaptive behaviour is removed from the model by forcing the proportion of mitigators in the population to remain constant. In this case of fixed behaviour, emissions saturate and the temperature anomaly increases indefinitely (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007000.s005" href="#pcbi.1007000.s005">S2 Fig</a>). However, once social learning is added and the proportion of mitigators is allowed to evolve dynamically as in our baseline model, the predicted average global temperature anomaly can peak anywhere from 2.2°C, near the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) limit [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref037">37</a>] (in the case of very rapid social learning) to 3.5°C (in the more realistic case where social learning unfolds on a generational timescale) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g001" href="#pcbi.1007000.g001">Fig 1a–1c</a>). Whether people discuss climate change more or less often can therefore strongly influence temperature trends. Because we model social norms as something that tends to reinforce majority behaviour and attitudes—whatever they might be—one might think that social norms act as a double-edged sword. In fact, they operate more like an unhelpful scimitar, as illustrated by comparing cases of low and high strength of social norms. Because the population starts off from a state of largely non-mitigating behaviour, increasing the strength of social norms suppresses the spread of mitigating behaviour for decades by entrenching non-mitigation as a norm, even when rising temperatures strongly justify an immediate shift (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g001" href="#pcbi.1007000.g001">Fig 1d–1f</a>). (This model dynamic echoes not only current climate norms reinforcing non-mitigation [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref020">20</a>] but also past social shifts occurring on decadal timescales, such as evolving social norms about when and where smoking is acceptable.) However, when mitigating behaviour eventually does become widespread, a higher strength of social norms does not significantly accelerate its spread. Rather, the two curves for cases of high and low social norm strength simply move in parallel to one another because by this time, the utility function that determines behaviour change is dominated by the large temperature anomaly (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g001" href="#pcbi.1007000.g001">Fig 1d</a>). In this parameter regime, social norms generate a perverse asymmetry, in contrast to findings from other socio-climate models that assume social norms can only support climate change mitigation [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model also shows how a reduction in net mitigation cost can significantly accelerate the onset of social change. For instance, a 67% reduction in the mitigation cost increases the percentage of mitigators by 2060 from 10% to 90% (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g001" href="#pcbi.1007000.g001">Fig 1g–1i</a>). Therefore, policies that reduce the cost of mitigation (through e.g. subsidies, tax cuts) will benefit from the accelerating effects of social learning and must be timed correctly.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our baseline model assumes that individuals’ perceived cost of climate change impacts depends on a linear extrapolation of the recent temperature anomaly over the previous ten years (
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">Methods</a>). If individuals instead base their decisions only on the current temperature anomaly, the simulated global temperature anomaly lies well above the 2°C target set by the IPCC, and exhibits wide variation in sensitivity analysis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g002" href="#pcbi.1007000.g002">Fig 2</a>). This contrasts with our baseline model where the population movement towards mitigative strategies ignites earlier, significantly reducing the global temperature anomaly. This predicted dynamic stems from the multi-decadal lag between GHG emissions and the consequent global temperature rise [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model predicts medium-term GHG emission trajectories (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g001" href="#pcbi.1007000.g001">Fig 1b, 1e and 1h</a>) that are qualitatively similar to those often assumed under various future emissions scenarios. This raises the question of how such models can be useful. The socio-climate model enables us to explore how socio-climate dynamics might respond to changes that are under the control of policymakers. For instance, it is possible to compare social and economic policy interventions by considering the effects of simultaneous parameter changes, instead of one at a time. This enables us to chart out the quickest pathways from highest to lowest temperature anomalies. The relative merits of increasing the social learning rate vs. reducing the net cost of mitigation are illustrated with a contour plot where the contours represent peak temperature anomaly as a function of the two parameters (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g003" href="#pcbi.1007000.g003">Fig 3</a>). Increasing the social learning rate (e.g. through media coverage and public fora devoted to climate change) is particularly effective when social learning is slow, but has saturating benefits, as indicated by the increasing vertical spacing of contour lines for at higher learning rates. In contrast, reducing the net mitigation cost (e.g. through tax breaks) drives a more linear response in peak temperature anomaly. Crucially, it should be noted that both a reduction of net mitigation cost and an increase in the social learning rate are required to achieve the IPCC target. The arrows in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g003" href="#pcbi.1007000.g003">Fig 3</a> show the ‘path of steepest descent’—the most efficient combination of the two measures. Starting from a situation of high projected temperature anomalies, the model predicts that increasing the social learning rate should first be prioritised, followed by a reduction in net mitigation cost once the benefits of social learning begin to saturate. This approach gets us to the region of parameter space corresponding to the IPCC target faster than alternative trajectories.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sensitivity analysis reveals the relative influence of each parameter on the peak temperature anomaly (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g004" href="#pcbi.1007000.g004">Fig 4</a>). The time horizon of individuals’ temperature projection, social learning rate and costs of mitigation are major factors, all of which may be influenced by appropriate intervention. The importance of social parameter uncertainties in determining climate predictions indicated by our model has also been predicted by other socio-climate models [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref021">21</a>]. Interestingly, the system is relatively insensitive to the initial proportion of mitigators, suggesting that the mediation of social processes, as opposed to the current social state, is key to guiding the socio-climate system to a trajectory of reduced emissions. Sensitivity analyses such as these can help investigators determine priorities for data collection: the parameters exhibiting the greatest influence on predictions should be targeted for data collection so we can best reduce model uncertainty.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A striking feature revealed by the sensitivity analysis is the asymmetry in many of the parameter dependencies. Consider the three parameters with highest impact on the peak temperature anomaly (concerning forecast horizon, learning rate and global warming costs). A decrease in these parameters is more detrimental than an increase is beneficial. For example, a forecast horizon 10 years above baseline value results in a 0.6 degree decrease in peak temperature anomaly, whereas a forecast horizon 10 years below baseline value results in a 1 degree increase. This imbalance is a manifestation of the nonlinear interactions between and within each of the social and climate system.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sensitivity analysis also reveals non-monotonic relationships between the peak temperature anomaly and the parameters. For example, both an increase and a decrease in solar flux results in a higher peak temperature anomaly. Interestingly, this is not the case if the climate subsystem is considered in isolation. For a fixed emissions scenario, a higher (lower) solar flux will always result in a higher (lower) peak temperature anomaly, since the solar flux is proportional to the net downward radiation absorbed by the planet’s surface. The coupling to social dynamics fundamentally alters this relationship. In the socio-climate system, a reduced solar flux results in a slower increase in surface temperature. As a consequence, individuals are less incentivised to mitigate, causing the social system to maintain a regime of non-mitigative behaviour. The accompanying high rate of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions quickly overcompensates for the reduced solar flux, yielding a higher peak temperature anomaly. Thus seemingly useful interventions to the physical system can actually end up doing more harm than good when there is strong coupling to a social system, as is the case for global warming.
