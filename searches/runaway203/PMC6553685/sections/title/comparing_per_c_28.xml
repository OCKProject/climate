 <div class="title">Comparing per capita CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions with global temperature changes.
 </div>
 <p>Temperature anomaly (solid line) above the 1850-1900 baseline value and CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions per capita (dashed line) are shown for the 1850-2014. Data was obtained from the CDIAC data repository [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref035">35</a>]. It is clear that despite exceeding a 1 degree temperature anomaly, the global emissions per capita of CO
  <sub>2</sub> show no obvious signs of decreasing. The current temperature anomaly is not yet high enough to spark a global decrease in emissions.
