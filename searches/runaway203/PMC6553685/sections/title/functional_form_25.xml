 <div class="title">Functional form for perceived costs associated with climate change.</div>
 <p>The incentive of individuals to mitigate is in part based on their perceived costs of climate change 
  <span class="italic">f</span> at some projected temperature 
  <span class="italic">T</span>. We adopt a sigmoidal response curve for 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">T</span>) with variable curvature 
  <span class="italic">Ï‰</span> and horizontal shift 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">c</span>
  </sub> (the explicit form of 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">T</span>) is provided in Methods). This form captures the expected non-linear increase in climate change impacts (cost) as temperature increases.
