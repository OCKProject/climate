 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Baseline climate parameters are obtained from the original Earth system model [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref025">25</a>] where they were fitted to obtain historical trends of temperature and carbon dynamics. Social parameters are more speculative and so are given wide upper and lower bounds. The relative cost of warming (
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">T</span>)) with respect to the net cost of mitigation (
  <span class="italic">Î²</span>) is chosen in accordance with the argument that the costs of preventative action will be far less than the cost implied otherwise by global warming [
  <a rid="pcbi.1007000.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1007000.ref036">36</a>]. For sensitivity analyses we draw parameters from triangular distributions that peak at baseline values and extend to upper and lower bounds (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007000.s003" href="#pcbi.1007000.s003">S2 Table</a>). Parameters are kept fixed preceding 2014 to retain historical trends in the simulations.
