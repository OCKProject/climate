 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The monthly model data were obtained from 38 historical (1900 to 2005) and RCP8.5 (2006 to 2100) simulations from 38 CMIP5 models

  </span>. These are bcc-csm1-1, CCSM4, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, GISS-E2-H, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and MPI-ESM-LR. The surface warming pattern and magnitude from 1970 to 1999 and from 2070 to 2099 are comparable between the 38-model ensemble mean and the 9-model ensemble mean, suggesting that the 9-model ensemble is a reasonable representation of the larger CMIP5 model ensemble. The recent mean annual cycles of the SIC and surface energy fluxes from the 9-model ensemble (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5a</a>) are comparable with the 38 CMIP5 models (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1b</a>) and ERA-40 reanalysis data

  </span> (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1a</a>). The SIC data were remapped onto a 1° grid, and all the other fields were remapped onto a 2.5° grid using a conservative mapping scheme. They were then averaged over the models (one simulation for each model) with equal weighting to create the ensemble mean, whose long-term changes were analyzed here to represent the response to future external forcing under the RCP8.5 scenario. Thus, the analyses presented here focus on the GHG-forced long-term response, not the short-term variations and decadal changes caused by internal climate variability that is a major component in recent observed changes

  </span>. Also, we did not examine the causes of sea-ice loss; but for the ensemble mean, the sea-ice retreat is primarily associated with GHG-induced surface warming: as the near-surface temperature increases to above the freezing point for a given month, sea ice starts to melt away (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). Thus, the warming triggered by the increasing GHGs and enhanced by water vapor and other feedbacks (including the warming due to sea-ice loss) is the main cause of the sea-ice loss.
