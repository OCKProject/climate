 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seasonal, temporal, inter-model, and spatial dependence of the AA on sea-ice loss presented above, coupled with the differences between the CESM1 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> and FixedIce runs, strongly suggests that the existence of sea ice and significant sea-ice loss is necessary for large AA to occur under GHG-induced warming, and that AA occurs primarily in the cold season due to the extra LW radiation and sensible and latent heat release from the newly opened waters, which are 10–30 °C warmer than sea-ice surfaces in Arctic winter

  </span> (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The results also suggest that water vapor and other feedbacks can only help maintain and enhance the AA triggered by sea-ice loss or indirectly contribute to AA by causing sea-ice melting, but they cannot produce large AA without sea-ice loss. Large AA cannot occur during the warm season because any extra heating will be absorbed by and stored in the upper Arctic Ocean, rather than being used to raise air temperature. We emphasize that enhanced downward LW radiation

  <sub>2</sub>, water vapor, and other greenhouse gases will lead to Arctic and global warming, which drives the decline of Arctic sea ice on interannual

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> would help the Arctic stay in a warmer state, contributing to sea-ice melting. The sea-ice loss in turn causes AA under a warming climate. From this perspective, any external forcing (e.g., CO
  <sub>2</sub> increases) or internal processes (e.g., water vapor feedback

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>) that can cause or enhance Arctic warming may contribute indirectly to AA through their impact on sea ice. However, without the LW, SH, LH, and other surface flux changes associated with the sea-ice loss (e.g., after the sea ice melts away as in past or future warm climates, or in a model with little sea-ice loss), Arctic warming rate under increasing GHGs would be similar to the global warming rate, leading to small AA.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. It is unclear whether sea-ice loss also plays such a central role for the AA induced by internal variability, although there is no reason to prevent the mechanism presented above from working under this case. Modeling studies

  </span> with fixed surface albedo still produced noticeable AA, in which LW_up, SH, and LH fluxes could still change as SIC declines. This further points to the key role of increased LW_up, SH, and LH fluxes associated with sea-ice loss, besides the albedo effect which occurs mainly in the warm season and thus cannot directly affect the AA, which occurs primarily in the cold season.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conclude that sea-ice loss is necessary for large AA to occur because it mainly results from the increased upward LW radiation and SH and LH fluxes during the cold season over the newly opened waters, while water vapor and other feedbacks can only enhance and maintain the surface warming triggered by sea-ice loss or indirectly contribute to AA by causing sea-ice melting. While increased downward LW radiation can contribute to Arctic warming, it cannot produce an 
  <span class="italic">amplified</span> warming over the Arctic compared with the rest of the world if there is no sea-ice loss. On the other hand, how important of the additional absorption of solar radiation (due to ice–albedo effect) during the warm season (red line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a, b</a>) is for the enhanced release of the LW, SH, and LH fluxes during the cold season and thus to the AA requires further investigation.
