 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonal sea-ice melting from May to September opens a large portion of the Arctic Ocean, allowing it to absorb sunlight during the warm season. Most of this energy is released to the atmosphere through longwave (LW) radiation, and latent and sensible heat fluxes during the cold season from October to April when the Arctic Ocean becomes a heat source to the atmosphere

  </span> (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Under greenhouse gas (GHG)-induced global warming, Arctic sea ice is expected to decrease greatly

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>, which increases the absorption of sunlight by the Arctic Ocean during the warm season and its subsequent release as more Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free, thereby amplifying Arctic warming in the cold season. This process involves the seasonal storage and release of the absorbed solar radiation, thus it differs from the ice–albedo feedback over land and is not the same as just altering the surface albedo in climate models

  </span> of the AA be explained by any of the proposed mechanisms?
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We address these questions here by analyzing the historical (1979–2016) and future (up to year 2300) changes in Arctic sea-ice cover (SIC), surface air temperature (Tas), and energy fluxes in ERA-Interim reanalysis data and CMIP5 model simulations (see Methods). We also perform and analyze two climate change simulations with 1%-per-year increase in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> with and without fixed SIC in calculating surface water and energy fluxes using a fully coupled climate model (namely, the CESM1, see Methods). These models realistically simulate the mean annual cycle of SIC, Tas, and surface energy fluxes (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>), as well as the SIC distributions (Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). In the CMIP5 simulations, Arctic sea-ice loss rate peaks around 2070; thereafter, both Arctic SIC and sea-ice loss diminish while global warming continues, albeit at a slower pace after the late 22nd century due to reduced GHG forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span> (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). This allows us to examine how the magnitude of the AA varies with changing SIC and sea-ice loss, and whether the existence of sea ice is necessary for large AA to occur. In the CESM1 simulations, a constant CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing with a 1%-per-year increase is applied for 235 years during which atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> level is doubled three times at year 70, 140, and 210. These simulations allow us to examine how the AA varies over time as the SIC changes under a constant external forcing, and the difference between the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run with fully interactive sea ice (denoted as 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run) and the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run with fixed SIC in calculating the surface fluxes (denoted as FixedIce run) would allow us to further quantifying the impact of sea-ice loss on AA through its impact on surface fluxes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that large AA occurs only from October to April and only over areas with significant sea-ice loss in both observations and model simulations. AA largely disappears when Arctic sea ice melts away or is held fixed for calculating surface fluxes. Periods with large AA are associated with large sea-ice loss in model simulations, and models with bigger sea-ice loss produce larger AA. Increased LW radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes from the newly exposed Arctic waters enhance surface and low-tropospheric warming and cause AA, whereas water vapor feedback, increased downward LW radiation, and other processes can only modulate the AA induced by sea-ice loss or indirectly contribute to AA by melting sea ice. Our results highlight the essential role of sea-ice loss in producing AA under GHG-induced global warming.</p>
