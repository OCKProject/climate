  </span> with the CAM4 option for its atmospheric component to make two multi-century simulations plus a 150-year pre-industrial control run. The CESM1 is a widely used fully coupled climate model that simulates the Arctic SIC and climate realistically (Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1c</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2c, d</a>). The CESM1 was run with grid spacing of 2.5° lon × ~2.0° lat for the atmospheric model, and ~1.0° lon × ~0.5° lat for the sea-ice and ocean models. The three simulations include a pre-industrial control (CTL) run with CO
  <sub>2</sub> fixed at 284.7 ppmv for 150 years, a standard 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run with fully coupled dynamic sea ice and a 1%-per-year increase in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> for 235 years reaching 10.36 times of the pre-industrial CO
  <sub>2</sub> level, and a fixed sea-ice (FixedIce) run. The FixedIce run is the same as the standard 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run except that all the internally calculated ice–atmosphere, ice–ocean, and ocean–atmosphere fluxes north of 30°N were applied to the sea-ice fractional areas temporally interpolated from the monthly climatology of the CTL run, in contrast to the standard 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run in which these fluxes were applied only to the ice faction existed at the time in the model. Over a small fraction of the Arctic sea-ice area north of 30°N (mainly along the sea-ice margins at lower latitudes, Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>), where sea ice melted away completely (mainly in the latter part of the simulation) and thus the ice model did not calculate these fluxes, the monthly climatology of these fluxes from the CTL run was temporally interpolated and applied to the CTL SIC fraction of these small areas, except for surface absorbed shortwave (SW) radiation which was calculated using the CTL albedo values and model-internally calculated downward SW radiation. The CTL ice-atmosphere fluxes (including LH, SH, evaporation, upward LW radiation, and surface stress) and ice-ocean fluxes (including heat, salt, freshwater, SW radiation, and stress fluxes) did not account for internal changes in surface temperatures and other fields, and therefore they could potentially suppress long-term changes in the Arctic if applied widely. For example, the upward LW radiation from the CTL run lacked the increasing trend associated with surface warming and therefore could weaken the Arctic warming in the lower troposphere. However, because the use of the CTL fluxes occurred only over a very small fraction of the total sea-ice area along the initial ice margins where SIC was low to start with (i.e., SIC was low in the CTL run for the small number of grid cells where the CTL fluxes were applied to the low SIC fraction; Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>), the effect of this deficiency is likely to be small. The difference between the standard 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> and FixedIce runs comes mainly from the application of the internally calculated fluxes over a fixed sea-ice cover from the control run in the FixedIce experiment.

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the FixedIce run, the coupler and the atmospheric and ocean components in the CESM1 only saw the fixed sea-ice cover interpolated from the CTL run north of the 30°N; the sea-ice fraction inside the sea-ice model was allowed to evolve dynamically with the fluxes returned from the coupler. Thus, the above changes made in the FixedIce run would also affect the rate of sea-ice loss through the modification to the surface fluxes.</p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our main intervention of the fully coupled system in the FixedIce run is the application of the internally calculated fluxes over a fixed sea-ice cover from the CTL run (instead of only over the ice cover existed at the time inside the sea-ice model). A secondary intervention was the use of CTL surface fluxes (instead of letting the coupler to calculate them for a water surface) over the low SIC fraction in a small number of the grid cells that initially contained sea-ice but the sea ice melted away completely. This use of the CTL fluxes was not ideal but necessary because (1) the sea-ice model did not calculate surface fluxes for grid cells without any ice, (2) the internally calculated surface temperature over these grid cells is for water surfaces and thus can’t be used directly as the surface temperature for ice surfaces; and (3) the calculations of surface fluxes over sea-ice were complicated.</p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CTL fluxes contained only an annual cycle and were seen by the atmosphere and ocean component models; they along should not cause any long-term trends and are balanced out on an annual mean sense when applied to the small areas where ice was melted away completely (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). That is, they should not violate the internal water and energy balance on an annual-mean basis, although they may slightly alter these balances on shorter time scales over the small number of grid cells (north of 30°N) where sea ice had melted away completely. This is much better than re-setting the ice cover to the CTL climatology after each time step, since that would provide an infinite source of ice for melting, leading to an infinite heat sink and freshwater source for the oceans. Our approach here focused on the effects on the climate (including sea ice itself) of a fixed sea-ice cover through its impact on surface fluxes; it differs from Deser et al.
