 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To verify that the imposed sea-ice and flux changes to the FixedIce run did not cause major artifacts in this simulation, here we examine and compare the TOA and surface energy flux changes in the CESM1 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> and FixedIce runs.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a> shows the time series of the global-mean and Arctic-mean changes in the TOA and surface net energy fluxes from the two simulations. Over the Arctic (67°–90°N), the TOA fluxes are very similar for the two runs, while the net surface flux into the Arctic Ocean is substantially smaller in the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run than in the FixedIce run (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10b</a>). This is expected because the use of the fixed sea-ice concentration (SIC) in the FixedIce run reduces the upward longwave (LW) radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7,</a>
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a> and Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">18</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">19</a>) and therefore should lead to a larger downward net flux in the FixedIce run. Thus, the Arctic surface flux difference shown in Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10b</a> is what we should expect physically from the change we imposed, whose impact on the Arctic TOA flux is negligible. Because of this, the small difference in the global-mean TOA flux between the two runs after year ~100 (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10a</a>) is likely due to other changes outside the Arctic region, rather than the direct effect of the imposed SIC change in the Arctic. Noticeable differences exist only after about year 100 in the global-mean fluxes between the two runs, and the TOA-minus-surface flux difference is similar between the two runs throughout the whole simulations (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10a</a>). Thus, the global-mean and Arctic-mean TOA and surface net fluxes from the two runs are reasonable.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the spatial patterns, we compare the change patterns between the two runs for the TOA and surface net energy fluxes in Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>, respectively. Again, the TOA flux changes are similar in the two runs, with noticeably higher downward TOA net fluxes over most of the Arctic Ocean in the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11e</a>) than in the FixedIce run (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11f</a>) at the time of the 3rd CO
  <sub>2</sub> doubling (mainly due to increased absorption of solar radiation in the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run), except over the areas with large SIC decreases in the FixedIce run by the 3rd CO
  <sub>2</sub> doubling (see Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11,</a>
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">13</a>). Examination of the changes in the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and TOA net shortwave (SW) radiation (not shown) revealed that the increase in the Arctic TOA net flux is mainly due to the large increase in the absorbed SW radiation that exceeds the increase in OLR in the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run, while it is mainly due to the reduced OLR (as surface upward LW radiation is reduced) as the albedo and thus SW changes are small in the FixedIce run. Thus, these TOA flux changes are expected physically based on the imposed the changes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the surface net energy flux (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>), the broad change patterns are similar between the two runs over most of the globe, except the Arctic where the fixed SIC in the FixedIce run is expected to reduce the absorbed SW radiation, upward LW radiation, and surface sensible (SH) and latent (LH) heat fluxes in comparison with the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run (see Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a> and Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">18</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">19</a>). These reductions in upward fluxes lead to higher downward net energy fluxes in the FiexedIce run than in the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> over the Arctic Ocean (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>). Further examination revealed that surface downward SW radiation is reduced over the Arctic due to increased cloudiness in both simulations (Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">14,</a>
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">15</a>); however, due to reduced sea-ice cover in the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">13</a>), surface absorbed SW radiation is actually increased despite the decreased downward SW radiation in this run (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">16a, b, e</a>). Because of the use of ice–albedo from fixed SIC in calculating the SW flux, the reduced downward SW radiation leads to decreased absorbed SW radiation in the FixedIce run (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">16b, d, f</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the fixed sea-ice cover reduces upward LW radiation, surface net LW radiative heating increases more in the FixedIce run than in the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run in the Arctic (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">17</a>). On the other hand, the surface LH (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">18</a>) and SH (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">19</a>) heat fluxes increase substantially only in the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run over the Arctic, and they partially offset the large increases in the absorbed SW radiation (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">16e</a>) and the moderate increase in the net LW radiative heating (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">17e</a>) over the Arctic in the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run, which results in only moderate changes in the net surface energy flux (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12e</a>). This differs from the FixedIce run, in which the changes in the LH and SH fluxes are small (Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">17f</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S18f</a>), and the net surface energy flux change (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12f</a>) results mainly from the reduced net SW (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">16f</a>) and greatly increased net LW (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">17f</a>) fluxes. These changes in the FixedIce run happened over most of the Arctic, not just over the sea-ice margins (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>) where the control-run fluxes might be used. Thus, these changes are mainly due to the use of the fixed SIC in calculating the surface fluxes, rather than due to the use of the control-run fluxes over a few areas around the original sea-ice margins. This further demonstrates that the use of the fixed SIC, rather than the use of the control-run fluxes, is the main reason behind these differences between the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> and FixedIce runs. These analyses of the TOA and surface fluxes also suggest that there are no major artifacts resulting from the imposed changes in the FixedIce run.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Please note that we have provided several lines of evidence, besides using the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> minus FixedIce difference, to support our conclusion that sea-ice loss is necessary for large AA to occur. These include the diminishing AA in the 23rd century in the CMIP5 models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) and in the CESM1 standard 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d</a>) when Arctic sea-ice melting becomes small. Another evidence is the strong correlation between Arctic sea-ice loss and the AA among the 38 CMIP5 models during the 21st century (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), and the spatial and seasonal relationship between Arctic warming and sea-ice loss (and the associated surface energy flux changes). Thus, while the results from the FixedIce experiment provide a strong confirmation of the essential role of sea-ice loss, they represent only one of the several lines of evidence presented in the paper.
