 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One concern with the extended CMIP5 simulations is that the mean climate in the 23rd century is much warmer than and likely very different from today’s climate and this may become an important factor for AA, although the seasonal, spatial, temporal, and inter-model dependence of the AA on sea-ice loss is seen during all time periods besides the 23rd century in the CMIP5 simulations. Another concern is that the external forcing and global warming rate change during the CMIP5 simulations, which may affect the AA. To address these concerns and to further isolate and quantify the effect from sea-ice loss, we performed two multi-century simulations with a constant forcing of 1%-per-year CO
  <sub>2</sub> increases using NCAR CESM1, a state-of-the art fully coupled climate model. The first simulation is the standard 1%/year CO
  <sub>2</sub> run with fully active sea ice (1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run), and the second run is the same except it uses fixed Arctic sea-ice cover in 
  <span class="italic">calculating</span> all the surface fluxes only (FixedIce run; see Methods). Thus, the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub>-minus-FixedIce difference represents the effect of Arctic sea-ice loss through its impact on surface fluxes, and a consistent dependence of the AA on sea-ice loss during these multi-century simulations would indicate a weak dependence of the AA on the mean climate state, as these simulations cover a wide range of atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> from 284.7 to 2950 ppm (and thus of the mean climate). Without the sea-ice loss-induced changes in surface fluxes, Arctic warming is greatly reduced while global warming weakens only slightly under the 1%-per-year CO
  <sub>2</sub> increase, and this results in negligible AA for annual-mean Tas during the entire simulation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). In fact, the Arctic-global Tas difference becomes negative after about year 160 in the FixedIce run (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). This strongly suggests that without the sea-ice loss-induced surface flux changes, no physical mechanisms can cause AA for annual-mean Tas.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the CMIP5 results (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), the large sea-ice loss in the CESM1 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run also starts mainly during the summer–early winter season (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a, b</a>), and then extends to the winter–spring season (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7c</a>) as the warming intensifies under increasing CO
  <sub>2</sub>. Again, the sea-ice loss and other changes do not cause large AA during the summer months throughout the simulation (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>), whereas large AA is seen during the cold season when the releases of LW, SH, and LH fluxes into the Arctic air increase (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a–c</a>). The changes over a moving 40-year period (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d</a>) also show strong negative correlation (r = −0.87) between the local SIC change and the Arctic-global Tas difference, again suggesting a vital role of the sea-ice loss for AA.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a constant sea-ice cover is used in computing the surface fluxes, Arctic sea-ice loss is greatly reduced (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a–c</a>) as a result of the reduced Arctic warming (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). The reduced sea-ice loss contributes to small changes in surface LW_up, SH, and LH fluxes and small AA even during the cold season throughout the simulation (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b,</a>
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>). The Arctic warming during the warm season is actually smaller than the global mean (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9e</a>), likely because the CO
  <sub>2</sub>-induced warming is lower over ocean water surfaces than over continents, and the Arctic Ocean is essentially ice-free during the summer months by the 3rd CO
  <sub>2</sub> doubling. As a result, the annual-mean Tas shows very little AA even by the time of the 3rd CO
  <sub>2</sub> doubling (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). With sea-ice loss in the 1% CO
  <sub>2</sub> run, warming in the lower troposphere is larger over the Arctic than the midlatitudes for the cold season and annual mean (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9a</a>, c), which would reduce meridional temperature gradients in the lower troposphere over the northern latitudes and therefore could potentially weaken midlatitudes westerlies and jet stream
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Such an effect is absent, however, in the FixedIce run (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9d–f</a>). Thus, sea-ice loss is necessary for GHG-induced warming to alter the meridional temperature gradient and thus affect the weather and climate at northern midlatitudes.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between local changes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8d</a>) in sea-ice loss and the Arctic-global Tas difference becomes weaker as their physical relationship is altered by the use of a constant SIC in calculating the surface fluxes in the FixedIce run. This weakened coupling between surface warming and sea-ice loss is also seen in the spatial correspondence (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10b</a>), in contrast to the fully coupled run (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10a</a>) and the CMIP5 simulations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), in which large releases of SH and LH fluxes are collocated with the large sea-ice loss and enhanced surface warming. Without the sea-ice loss-induced flux changes, surface warming is quite uniform spatially over the Arctic and comparable with that over the lower latitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10b</a>). This again implies an essential role of sea-ice loss through its impact on surface fluxes (mainly LW_up, SH, and LH) in producing a large AA.
