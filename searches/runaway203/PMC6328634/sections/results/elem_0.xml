  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1979–2016, Arctic SIC has decreased considerably in all months, especially during June–November, which leads to increased absorption of solar radiation by the Arctic from April to September (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). However, the largest AA (defined here as the ratio of Arctic vs. global-mean Tas change) occurs from October to April, while the AA is small during the warm season, especially in July–August (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). The extra absorbed solar radiation during the warm season occurs over and is stored in the newly opened Arctic waters with minimum enhancement of surface temperatures as reflected by the small changes in surface upward LW radiation (LW_up) and sensible (SH) and latent (LH) heat fluxes during the warm season (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). From October to April, LW_up and SH + LH fluxes have increased substantially, which indicates a warm ocean surface and extra heating to the air. This leads to enhanced atmospheric warming near the surface (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) and in the lower troposphere
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
   </span>. The November-minus-July difference in the LW_up (~4 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>/decade) and SH + LH (~1.7 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>/decade) fluxes in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> may be attributed to the amplified ocean surface warming (due to a combination of the extra solar absorption during the warm season and the opening of new water surfaces during the cold season). Clearly, the LW_up forcing of the air is more than twice the SH + LW change, which is also the case in the model simulations discussed below. This is expected because of the large (10–30 °C) temperature difference between typical water and ice surfaces in the winter Arctic
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
   </span> (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Such a scenario is also supported by the close spatial collocation of the largest surface warming and turbulent flux (and LW_up) increases with the largest sea-ice loss (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). These historical changes, including the seasonality and spatial patterns, are largely reproduced by the CMIP5 models (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>, 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). Because the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean represents mostly externally forced changes

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
   </span>, this result suggests that these historical Arctic changes are mostly forced by CO
   <sub>2</sub> and other external forcing. It also implies that the CMIP5 models may be capable of simulating the Arctic responses to CO
   <sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gas changes under future forcing scenarios.

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CMIP5 model-simulated Arctic warming and sea-ice loss vary greatly with month in the 21st and 22nd centuries, but not in the 23rd century when most of the sea ice is melted away (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). During the 21st century, large sea-ice loss (&gt;20% of the Arctic area) occurs from June to January, but large AA exists only from October to April, peaking in November–December (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). Reduced SIC allows the Arctic Ocean to absorb more sunlight from April to August (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), but this extra energy is stored in the upper Arctic Ocean without increasing the surface temperatures substantially due to the large heat capacity of the ocean mixed layer. This results in small changes in LW_up and SH + LH fluxes and negligible AA for the summer months, consistent with the recent changes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). This result suggests that when the Arctic Ocean is a heat sink from May to August (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5a</a>), all the surface and atmospheric changes (including increased LW heating from increased water vapor and clouds, Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>) cannot produce AA during those months. However, from October to March when the Arctic Ocean becomes a heat source to the atmosphere (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5a</a>), the extra energy stored in the ocean is released through surface upward LW radiation, LH and SH fluxes to heat the lower troposphere, thereby enhancing the Arctic warming during these months (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>), as LW radiation and SH directly warm the lower troposphere while LH increases water vapor and thus its greenhouse warming effect on the surface. This key role by surface LW, LH, and SH fluxes is consistent with that seen during the recent decades

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Clearly, whether an area is covered by sea ice during the cold season makes a huge difference for these surface fluxes, and this is why sea-ice loss can greatly enhance the warming induced by CO
   <sub>2</sub> and water vapor increases.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the end of the 21st century, Arctic sea ice is largely gone from July to October (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5b</a>). As a result, the largest sea-ice loss in the 22nd century occurs from December to June, and the largest increases in the absorbed SW radiation are from April to June (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). Again, this extra energy is stored in the Arctic Ocean with negligible amplification of surface warming during these months (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). As the Arctic sea ice continues to decline during the cold season (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), more ocean surfaces are ice-free and open to the atmosphere. Because the newly exposed ocean water is much warmer than the cold sea-ice surface existed previously
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
   </span>, this allows the ocean to release more LH and SH fluxes and LW radiation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>) to warm the lower troposphere from November to March, when the ocean is still a seasonal heat source to the atmosphere (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5b</a>). The largest release of the extra LW, LH, and SH is delayed to January–February by the end of 22nd century from November to December in the 21st century as the maximum sea-ice loss moves to latter months (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a, b</a>). This results in elevated Arctic warming and thus large AA from November to March, whereas the AA is small for the other months (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 23rd century, sea ice forms only over a small area (&lt;20%) of the Arctic Ocean even during the cold season (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5c, d</a>). Thus, there is no significant sea-ice loss for most of the months except for January–May when small (3–10%) losses still occur (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). Because of this, absorbed solar radiation changes little, as do the surface LH and SH fluxes; while the upward LW increases uniformly throughout the year due to the overall surface warming (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). Without the extra heating from the ocean (on top of the mean seasonal cycle, Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5c, d</a>), the Arctic warming during the 23rd century shows little seasonal variation, and it is only about 40–50% higher than the global warming rate for all the months (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>), which is comparable to the AA during the summer in previous centuries (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a, b</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further calculated the local change between two moving 20-yr periods for Arctic annual SIC, Arctic and global-mean annual Tas, and the Arctic-minus-global warming difference (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). Clearly, the elevated warming over the Arctic is strongly correlated with sea-ice loss (r = 0.95) for all the 40-yr periods within 1900–2300. As the Arctic sea-ice loss increases from the 1950s to the 2060 s, the Arctic-minus-global warming difference also increases; thereafter, the warming difference decreases as the sea-ice loss slows down due to reduced SIC (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). After year 2200, there is little sea-ice left to melt, and the warming difference is small between the Arctic and the globe. In contrast, from 1980–2020 when the global warming rate is similar to that of 2200–2280, the Arctic warms much faster than the global-mean as the sea-ice loss is much larger during 1980–2020 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also found a strong correlation (r = 0.84) between the Arctic sea-ice loss and Arctic-minus-global warming difference from 1979 to 1999 and from 2070 to 2099 among the 38 CMIP5 models we analyzed (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>); that is, models with a larger sea-ice loss tend to produce larger AA in the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Since the current SIC determines how much sea ice is available for future melting, this result suggests that the magnitude of a model-simulated Arctic warming and AA will depend on its mean bias in SIC (and thus also Tas) for the current climate, consistent with previous studies

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strong spatial pattern correlations were also found between Arctic sea-ice loss and surface warming and changes in surface energy fluxes (Fig.

   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), while the enhanced warming largely disappears in the 23rd century when the sea ice is gone (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). Without a central role of sea-ice loss, it would be difficult to think of any mechanism for reduced LW cooling due to a stable temperature profile

   </span>, or other processes to generate such a spatial pattern of surface warming that resembles that of sea-ice loss and then their effects disappear in the 23rd century when there is little sea-ice loss. While enhanced local warming can increase sea-ice loss and thus cause a negative correlation between the SIC and Tas change, the warming pattern itself cannot be easily explained by the LW- and heat transport-related mechanisms without a key role of the sea-ice loss. This is because the large-scale downward LW forcing (from increased CO
   <sub>2</sub>, water vapor, or clouds) should not be correlated spatially with SIC loss unless there exists a major role by the sea-ice loss to alter the surface warming and water vapor (and thus LW) change patterns. In other words, if SIC does not play a major role, then the warming pattern should be fairly uniform (as CO
   <sub>2</sub> and water vapor in the Arctic would be well mixed zonally by the large-scale circulation if local processes played a minimal role), or spatially correlated with cloudiness changes rather than with SIC loss. Thus, while increased downward LW radiation associated with increased CO
   <sub>2</sub> and water vapor may play a large role for overall Arctic

   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) suggests that the LW, latent and sensible heating due to sea-ice loss is essential for large AA to occur, while all the other processes can only modulate the sea-ice loss-induced amplification or indirectly contribute to AA by causing sea-ice melting, but they cannot cause large AA without sea-ice loss.

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One concern with the extended CMIP5 simulations is that the mean climate in the 23rd century is much warmer than and likely very different from today’s climate and this may become an important factor for AA, although the seasonal, spatial, temporal, and inter-model dependence of the AA on sea-ice loss is seen during all time periods besides the 23rd century in the CMIP5 simulations. Another concern is that the external forcing and global warming rate change during the CMIP5 simulations, which may affect the AA. To address these concerns and to further isolate and quantify the effect from sea-ice loss, we performed two multi-century simulations with a constant forcing of 1%-per-year CO
   <sub>2</sub> increases using NCAR CESM1, a state-of-the art fully coupled climate model. The first simulation is the standard 1%/year CO
   <sub>2</sub> run with fully active sea ice (1% CO
   <sub>2</sub> run), and the second run is the same except it uses fixed Arctic sea-ice cover in 
   <span class="italic">calculating</span> all the surface fluxes only (FixedIce run; see Methods). Thus, the 1% CO
   <sub>2</sub>-minus-FixedIce difference represents the effect of Arctic sea-ice loss through its impact on surface fluxes, and a consistent dependence of the AA on sea-ice loss during these multi-century simulations would indicate a weak dependence of the AA on the mean climate state, as these simulations cover a wide range of atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> from 284.7 to 2950 ppm (and thus of the mean climate). Without the sea-ice loss-induced changes in surface fluxes, Arctic warming is greatly reduced while global warming weakens only slightly under the 1%-per-year CO
   <sub>2</sub> increase, and this results in negligible AA for annual-mean Tas during the entire simulation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). In fact, the Arctic-global Tas difference becomes negative after about year 160 in the FixedIce run (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). This strongly suggests that without the sea-ice loss-induced surface flux changes, no physical mechanisms can cause AA for annual-mean Tas.

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the CMIP5 results (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), the large sea-ice loss in the CESM1 1% CO
   <sub>2</sub> run also starts mainly during the summer–early winter season (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a, b</a>), and then extends to the winter–spring season (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7c</a>) as the warming intensifies under increasing CO
   <sub>2</sub>. Again, the sea-ice loss and other changes do not cause large AA during the summer months throughout the simulation (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>, 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>), whereas large AA is seen during the cold season when the releases of LW, SH, and LH fluxes into the Arctic air increase (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a–c</a>). The changes over a moving 40-year period (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d</a>) also show strong negative correlation (r = −0.87) between the local SIC change and the Arctic-global Tas difference, again suggesting a vital role of the sea-ice loss for AA.

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a constant sea-ice cover is used in computing the surface fluxes, Arctic sea-ice loss is greatly reduced (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a–c</a>) as a result of the reduced Arctic warming (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). The reduced sea-ice loss contributes to small changes in surface LW_up, SH, and LH fluxes and small AA even during the cold season throughout the simulation (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b,</a>
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>). The Arctic warming during the warm season is actually smaller than the global mean (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c</a>, 
   <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9e</a>), likely because the CO
   <sub>2</sub>-induced warming is lower over ocean water surfaces than over continents, and the Arctic Ocean is essentially ice-free during the summer months by the 3rd CO
   <sub>2</sub> doubling. As a result, the annual-mean Tas shows very little AA even by the time of the 3rd CO
   <sub>2</sub> doubling (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). With sea-ice loss in the 1% CO
   <sub>2</sub> run, warming in the lower troposphere is larger over the Arctic than the midlatitudes for the cold season and annual mean (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9a</a>, c), which would reduce meridional temperature gradients in the lower troposphere over the northern latitudes and therefore could potentially weaken midlatitudes westerlies and jet stream
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>. Such an effect is absent, however, in the FixedIce run (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9d–f</a>). Thus, sea-ice loss is necessary for GHG-induced warming to alter the meridional temperature gradient and thus affect the weather and climate at northern midlatitudes.

  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between local changes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8d</a>) in sea-ice loss and the Arctic-global Tas difference becomes weaker as their physical relationship is altered by the use of a constant SIC in calculating the surface fluxes in the FixedIce run. This weakened coupling between surface warming and sea-ice loss is also seen in the spatial correspondence (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10b</a>), in contrast to the fully coupled run (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10a</a>) and the CMIP5 simulations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), in which large releases of SH and LH fluxes are collocated with the large sea-ice loss and enhanced surface warming. Without the sea-ice loss-induced flux changes, surface warming is quite uniform spatially over the Arctic and comparable with that over the lower latitudes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10b</a>). This again implies an essential role of sea-ice loss through its impact on surface fluxes (mainly LW_up, SH, and LH) in producing a large AA.
