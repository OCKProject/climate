  <p>Time series of CESM1-simulated changes in surface air temperature (Tas) and sea-ice over the Arctic (67°-90°N) and globe. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Standard 1% CO
   <sub>2</sub> run, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> FixedIce run, and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> their difference (panel 
   <span class="bold">a</span> minus panel 
   <span class="bold">b</span>). Shown are the annual (solid red), November–December (magenta), and June–July (green) mean Tas, and annual Arctic sea-ice concentration (blue, right y-axis, increase downward), together with the Arctic-minus-global annual Tas difference (black). The change is relative to the control-run climatology and five-year averaging is applied. Note that global Tas changes for November–December and June–July (not shown) are very similar to the annual change
