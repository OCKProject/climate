  <p>Spatial distributions of the linear trends during 1979–2016. For November–December mean surface air temperature (red contours, K/decade), sea-ice concentration (SIC, color shading, %/decade), and surface turbulent (sensible + latent) heat fluxes (yellow contours, W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>/decade, positive upward) based on 
   <span class="bold">a</span> the ERA-Interim reanalysis data and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> the ensemble mean of historical (for 1979–2005) and RCP8.5 (for 2006–2016) simulations averaged over 38 CMIP5 models. The SIC trends are similar to those based on NOAA satellite data from
