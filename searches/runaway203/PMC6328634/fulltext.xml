By analyzing data and model simulations, here we show that large AA occurs only from October to April and only over areas with significant sea-ice loss. AA largely disappears when Arctic sea ice is fixed or melts away. Periods with larger AA are associated with larger sea-ice loss, and models with bigger sea-ice loss produce larger AA. Increased outgoing longwave radiation and heat fluxes from the newly opened waters cause AA, whereas all other processes can only indirectly contribute to AA by melting sea-ice. We conclude that sea-ice loss is necessary for the existence of large AA and that models need to simulate Arctic sea ice realistically in order to correctly simulate Arctic warming under increasing CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The cause of Arctic amplification is still heavily debated.

However, their relative importance is still under debate. In particular, why the largest AA occurs in the cold season (when the ice&#x02013;albedo effect is small) and over areas with large sea-ice loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> has not been well explained by these mechanisms.</p><p id="Par4">Seasonal sea-ice melting from May to September opens a large portion of the Arctic Ocean, allowing it to absorb sunlight during the warm season. Most of this energy is released to the atmosphere through longwave (LW) radiation, and latent and sensible heat fluxes during the cold season from October to April when the Arctic Ocean becomes a heat source to the atmosphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Under greenhouse gas (GHG)-induced global warming, Arctic sea ice is expected to decrease greatly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, which increases the absorption of sunlight by the Arctic Ocean during the warm season and its subsequent release as more Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free, thereby amplifying Arctic warming in the cold season. This process involves the seasonal storage and release of the absorbed solar radiation, thus it differs from the ice&#x02013;albedo feedback over land and is not the same as just altering the surface albedo in climate models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, as noticed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. While this process has been recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and examined using recent reanalysis data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, its impact on the AA under increasing GHGs is not fully understood and needs further investigation. Furthermore, it is unclear whether and how the other processes mentioned above are related to sea-ice loss in producing the AA. Is sea-ice loss necessary for large AA to occur? Can the reduced LW cooling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> or the increased LW heating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> still produce large AA under GHG-induced global warming without significant sea-ice loss? Can the seasonal and spatial patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> of the AA be explained by any of the proposed mechanisms?</p><p id="Par5">We address these questions here by analyzing the historical (1979&#x02013;2016) and future (up to year 2300) changes in Arctic sea-ice cover (SIC), surface air temperature (Tas), and energy fluxes in ERA-Interim reanalysis data and CMIP5 model simulations (see Methods). We also perform and analyze two climate change simulations with 1%-per-year increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> with and without fixed SIC in calculating surface water and energy fluxes using a fully coupled climate model (namely, the CESM1, see Methods). These models realistically simulate the mean annual cycle of SIC, Tas, and surface energy fluxes (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), as well as the SIC distributions (Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In the CMIP5 simulations, Arctic sea-ice loss rate peaks around 2070; thereafter, both Arctic SIC and sea-ice loss diminish while global warming continues, albeit at a slower pace after the late 22nd century due to reduced GHG forcing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This allows us to examine how the magnitude of the AA varies with changing SIC and sea-ice loss, and whether the existence of sea ice is necessary for large AA to occur. In the CESM1 simulations, a constant CO<sub>2</sub> forcing with a 1%-per-year increase is applied for 235 years during which atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> level is doubled three times at year 70, 140, and 210. These simulations allow us to examine how the AA varies over time as the SIC changes under a constant external forcing, and the difference between the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run with fully interactive sea ice (denoted as 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run) and the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run with fixed SIC in calculating the surface fluxes (denoted as FixedIce run) would allow us to further quantifying the impact of sea-ice loss on AA through its impact on surface fluxes.</p><p id="Par6">We found that large AA occurs only from October to April and only over areas with significant sea-ice loss in both observations and model simulations. AA largely disappears when Arctic sea ice melts away or is held fixed for calculating surface fluxes. Periods with large AA are associated with large sea-ice loss in model simulations, and models with bigger sea-ice loss produce larger AA. Increased LW radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes from the newly exposed Arctic waters enhance surface and low-tropospheric warming and cause AA, whereas water vapor feedback, increased downward LW radiation, and other processes can only modulate the AA induced by sea-ice loss or indirectly contribute to AA by melting sea ice. Our results highlight the essential role of sea-ice loss in producing AA under GHG-induced global warming.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Historical changes</title><p id="Par7">From 1979&#x02013;2016, Arctic SIC has decreased considerably in all months, especially during June&#x02013;November, which leads to increased absorption of solar radiation by the Arctic from April to September (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). However, the largest AA (defined here as the ratio of Arctic vs. global-mean Tas change) occurs from October to April, while the AA is small during the warm season, especially in July&#x02013;August (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The extra absorbed solar radiation during the warm season occurs over and is stored in the newly opened Arctic waters with minimum enhancement of surface temperatures as reflected by the small changes in surface upward LW radiation (LW_up) and sensible (SH) and latent (LH) heat fluxes during the warm season (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). From October to April, LW_up and SH&#x02009;+&#x02009;LH fluxes have increased substantially, which indicates a warm ocean surface and extra heating to the air. This leads to enhanced atmospheric warming near the surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and in the lower troposphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The November-minus-July difference in the LW_up (~4&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup>/decade) and SH&#x02009;+&#x02009;LH (~1.7&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup>/decade) fluxes in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> may be attributed to the amplified ocean surface warming (due to a combination of the extra solar absorption during the warm season and the opening of new water surfaces during the cold season). Clearly, the LW_up forcing of the air is more than twice the SH&#x02009;+&#x02009;LW change, which is also the case in the model simulations discussed below. This is expected because of the large (10&#x02013;30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) temperature difference between typical water and ice surfaces in the winter Arctic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Such a scenario is also supported by the close spatial collocation of the largest surface warming and turbulent flux (and LW_up) increases with the largest sea-ice loss (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). These historical changes, including the seasonality and spatial patterns, are largely reproduced by the CMIP5 models (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Because the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean represents mostly externally forced changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, this result suggests that these historical Arctic changes are mostly forced by CO<sub>2</sub> and other external forcing. It also implies that the CMIP5 models may be capable of simulating the Arctic responses to CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gas changes under future forcing scenarios.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Seasonality of the historical (1979&#x02013;2016) trends in Arctic (67&#x000b0;&#x02013;90&#x000b0;N) sea-ice cover (SIC), Arctic amplification (AA), and Arctic energy fluxes. <bold>a</bold> from ERA-Interim reanalysis data and <bold>b</bold> from the ensemble mean of historical (for 1979&#x02013;2005) and RCP8.5 (for 2006&#x02013;2016) simulations averaged over 38 CMIP5 models.

During the 21st century, large sea-ice loss (&#x0003e;20% of the Arctic area) occurs from June to January, but large AA exists only from October to April, peaking in November&#x02013;December (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Reduced SIC allows the Arctic Ocean to absorb more sunlight from April to August (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), but this extra energy is stored in the upper Arctic Ocean without increasing the surface temperatures substantially due to the large heat capacity of the ocean mixed layer. This results in small changes in LW_up and SH&#x02009;+&#x02009;LH fluxes and negligible AA for the summer months, consistent with the recent changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This result suggests that when the Arctic Ocean is a heat sink from May to August (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>), all the surface and atmospheric changes (including increased LW heating from increased water vapor and clouds, Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>) cannot produce AA during those months. However, from October to March when the Arctic Ocean becomes a heat source to the atmosphere (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>), the extra energy stored in the ocean is released through surface upward LW radiation, LH and SH fluxes to heat the lower troposphere, thereby enhancing the Arctic warming during these months (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), as LW radiation and SH directly warm the lower troposphere while LH increases water vapor and thus its greenhouse warming effect on the surface.

The largest release of the extra LW, LH, and SH is delayed to January&#x02013;February by the end of 22nd century from November to December in the 21st century as the maximum sea-ice loss moves to latter months (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). This results in elevated Arctic warming and thus large AA from November to March, whereas the AA is small for the other months (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">During the 23rd century, sea ice forms only over a small area (&#x0003c;20%) of the Arctic Ocean even during the cold season (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c, d</xref>). Thus, there is no significant sea-ice loss for most of the months except for January&#x02013;May when small (3&#x02013;10%) losses still occur (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Because of this, absorbed solar radiation changes little, as do the surface LH and SH fluxes; while the upward LW increases uniformly throughout the year due to the overall surface warming (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Without the extra heating from the ocean (on top of the mean seasonal cycle, Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c, d</xref>), the Arctic warming during the 23rd century shows little seasonal variation, and it is only about 40&#x02013;50% higher than the global warming rate for all the months (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), which is comparable to the AA during the summer in previous centuries (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">We further calculated the local change between two moving 20-yr periods for Arctic annual SIC, Arctic and global-mean annual Tas, and the Arctic-minus-global warming difference (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Clearly, the elevated warming over the Arctic is strongly correlated with sea-ice loss (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.95) for all the 40-yr periods within 1900&#x02013;2300. As the Arctic sea-ice loss increases from the 1950s to the 2060&#x02009;s, the Arctic-minus-global warming difference also increases; thereafter, the warming difference decreases as the sea-ice loss slows down due to reduced SIC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). After year 2200, there is little sea-ice left to melt, and the warming difference is small between the Arctic and the globe. In contrast, from 1980&#x02013;2020 when the global warming rate is similar to that of 2200&#x02013;2280, the Arctic warms much faster than the global-mean as the sea-ice loss is much larger during 1980&#x02013;2020 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">We also found a strong correlation (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.84) between the Arctic sea-ice loss and Arctic-minus-global warming difference from 1979 to 1999 and from 2070 to 2099 among the 38 CMIP5 models we analyzed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>); that is, models with a larger sea-ice loss tend to produce larger AA in the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario.

While enhanced local warming can increase sea-ice loss and thus cause a negative correlation between the SIC and Tas change, the warming pattern itself cannot be easily explained by the LW- and heat transport-related mechanisms without a key role of the sea-ice loss. This is because the large-scale downward LW forcing (from increased CO<sub>2</sub>, water vapor, or clouds) should not be correlated spatially with SIC loss unless there exists a major role by the sea-ice loss to alter the surface warming and water vapor (and thus LW) change patterns. In other words, if SIC does not play a major role, then the warming pattern should be fairly uniform (as CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapor in the Arctic would be well mixed zonally by the large-scale circulation if local processes played a minimal role), or spatially correlated with cloudiness changes rather than with SIC loss.

Another concern is that the external forcing and global warming rate change during the CMIP5 simulations, which may affect the AA. To address these concerns and to further isolate and quantify the effect from sea-ice loss, we performed two multi-century simulations with a constant forcing of 1%-per-year CO<sub>2</sub> increases using NCAR CESM1, a state-of-the art fully coupled climate model. The first simulation is the standard 1%/year CO<sub>2</sub> run with fully active sea ice (1% CO<sub>2</sub> run), and the second run is the same except it uses fixed Arctic sea-ice cover in <italic>calculating</italic> all the surface fluxes only (FixedIce run; see Methods). Thus, the 1% CO<sub>2</sub>-minus-FixedIce difference represents the effect of Arctic sea-ice loss through its impact on surface fluxes, and a consistent dependence of the AA on sea-ice loss during these multi-century simulations would indicate a weak dependence of the AA on the mean climate state, as these simulations cover a wide range of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> from 284.7 to 2950 ppm (and thus of the mean climate). Without the sea-ice loss-induced changes in surface fluxes, Arctic warming is greatly reduced while global warming weakens only slightly under the 1%-per-year CO<sub>2</sub> increase, and this results in negligible AA for annual-mean Tas during the entire simulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In fact, the Arctic-global Tas difference becomes negative after about year 160 in the FixedIce run (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). This strongly suggests that without the sea-ice loss-induced surface flux changes, no physical mechanisms can cause AA for annual-mean Tas.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Time series of CESM1-simulated changes in surface air temperature (Tas) and sea-ice over the Arctic (67&#x000b0;-90&#x000b0;N) and globe. <bold>a</bold> Standard 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run, <bold>b</bold> FixedIce run, and <bold>c</bold> their difference (panel <bold>a</bold> minus panel <bold>b</bold>).

This further points to the key role of increased LW_up, SH, and LH fluxes associated with sea-ice loss, besides the albedo effect which occurs mainly in the warm season and thus cannot directly affect the AA, which occurs primarily in the cold season.</p><p id="Par21">We conclude that sea-ice loss is necessary for large AA to occur because it mainly results from the increased upward LW radiation and SH and LH fluxes during the cold season over the newly opened waters, while water vapor and other feedbacks can only enhance and maintain the surface warming triggered by sea-ice loss or indirectly contribute to AA by causing sea-ice melting. While increased downward LW radiation can contribute to Arctic warming, it cannot produce an <italic>amplified</italic> warming over the Arctic compared with the rest of the world if there is no sea-ice loss. On the other hand, how important of the additional absorption of solar radiation (due to ice&#x02013;albedo effect) during the warm season (red line in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>) is for the enhanced release of the LW, SH, and LH fluxes during the cold season and thus to the AA requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>CMIP5 simulations</title><p id="Par22">The monthly model data were obtained from 38 historical (1900 to 2005) and RCP8.5 (2006 to 2100) simulations from 38 CMIP5 models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/index.html">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/index.html</ext-link>). Only nine of the models had simulations extended to 2300 under the extended RCP8.5 scenario<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. These are bcc-csm1-1, CCSM4, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, GISS-E2-H, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and MPI-ESM-LR. The surface warming pattern and magnitude from 1970 to 1999 and from 2070 to 2099 are comparable between the 38-model ensemble mean and the 9-model ensemble mean, suggesting that the 9-model ensemble is a reasonable representation of the larger CMIP5 model ensemble. The recent mean annual cycles of the SIC and surface energy fluxes from the 9-model ensemble (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>) are comparable with the 38 CMIP5 models (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>) and ERA-40 reanalysis data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). The SIC data were remapped onto a 1&#x000b0; grid, and all the other fields were remapped onto a 2.5&#x000b0; grid using a conservative mapping scheme. They were then averaged over the models (one simulation for each model) with equal weighting to create the ensemble mean, whose long-term changes were analyzed here to represent the response to future external forcing under the RCP8.5 scenario. Thus, the analyses presented here focus on the GHG-forced long-term response, not the short-term variations and decadal changes caused by internal climate variability that is a major component in recent observed changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Also, we did not examine the causes of sea-ice loss; but for the ensemble mean, the sea-ice retreat is primarily associated with GHG-induced surface warming: as the near-surface temperature increases to above the freezing point for a given month, sea ice starts to melt away (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Thus, the warming triggered by the increasing GHGs and enhanced by water vapor and other feedbacks (including the warming due to sea-ice loss) is the main cause of the sea-ice loss.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>CESM1 simulations</title><p id="Par23">We used the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) from NCAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> with the CAM4 option for its atmospheric component to make two multi-century simulations plus a 150-year pre-industrial control run. The CESM1 is a widely used fully coupled climate model that simulates the Arctic SIC and climate realistically (Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c, d</xref>). The CESM1 was run with grid spacing of 2.5&#x000b0; lon&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;~2.0&#x000b0; lat for the atmospheric model, and ~1.0&#x000b0; lon &#x000d7; ~0.5&#x000b0; lat for the sea-ice and ocean models. The three simulations include a pre-industrial control (CTL) run with CO<sub>2</sub> fixed at 284.7&#x02009;ppmv for 150 years, a standard 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run with fully coupled dynamic sea ice and a 1%-per-year increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> for 235 years reaching 10.36 times of the pre-industrial CO<sub>2</sub> level, and a fixed sea-ice (FixedIce) run. The FixedIce run is the same as the standard 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run except that all the internally calculated ice&#x02013;atmosphere, ice&#x02013;ocean, and ocean&#x02013;atmosphere fluxes north of 30&#x000b0;N were applied to the sea-ice fractional areas temporally interpolated from the monthly climatology of the CTL run, in contrast to the standard 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run in which these fluxes were applied only to the ice faction existed at the time in the model. Over a small fraction of the Arctic sea-ice area north of 30&#x000b0;N (mainly along the sea-ice margins at lower latitudes, Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), where sea ice melted away completely (mainly in the latter part of the simulation) and thus the ice model did not calculate these fluxes, the monthly climatology of these fluxes from the CTL run was temporally interpolated and applied to the CTL SIC fraction of these small areas, except for surface absorbed shortwave (SW) radiation which was calculated using the CTL albedo values and model-internally calculated downward SW radiation. The CTL ice-atmosphere fluxes (including LH, SH, evaporation, upward LW radiation, and surface stress) and ice-ocean fluxes (including heat, salt, freshwater, SW radiation, and stress fluxes) did not account for internal changes in surface temperatures and other fields, and therefore they could potentially suppress long-term changes in the Arctic if applied widely. For example, the upward LW radiation from the CTL run lacked the increasing trend associated with surface warming and therefore could weaken the Arctic warming in the lower troposphere. However, because the use of the CTL fluxes occurred only over a very small fraction of the total sea-ice area along the initial ice margins where SIC was low to start with (i.e., SIC was low in the CTL run for the small number of grid cells where the CTL fluxes were applied to the low SIC fraction; Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), the effect of this deficiency is likely to be small. The difference between the standard 1% CO<sub>2</sub> and FixedIce runs comes mainly from the application of the internally calculated fluxes over a fixed sea-ice cover from the control run in the FixedIce experiment.</p><p id="Par24">In the FixedIce run, the coupler and the atmospheric and ocean components in the CESM1 only saw the fixed sea-ice cover interpolated from the CTL run north of the 30&#x000b0;N; the sea-ice fraction inside the sea-ice model was allowed to evolve dynamically with the fluxes returned from the coupler. Thus, the above changes made in the FixedIce run would also affect the rate of sea-ice loss through the modification to the surface fluxes.</p><p id="Par25">Our main intervention of the fully coupled system in the FixedIce run is the application of the internally calculated fluxes over a fixed sea-ice cover from the CTL run (instead of only over the ice cover existed at the time inside the sea-ice model). A secondary intervention was the use of CTL surface fluxes (instead of letting the coupler to calculate them for a water surface) over the low SIC fraction in a small number of the grid cells that initially contained sea-ice but the sea ice melted away completely. This use of the CTL fluxes was not ideal but necessary because (1) the sea-ice model did not calculate surface fluxes for grid cells without any ice, (2) the internally calculated surface temperature over these grid cells is for water surfaces and thus can&#x02019;t be used directly as the surface temperature for ice surfaces; and (3) the calculations of surface fluxes over sea-ice were complicated.</p><p id="Par26">The CTL fluxes contained only an annual cycle and were seen by the atmosphere and ocean component models; they along should not cause any long-term trends and are balanced out on an annual mean sense when applied to the small areas where ice was melted away completely (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). That is, they should not violate the internal water and energy balance on an annual-mean basis, although they may slightly alter these balances on shorter time scales over the small number of grid cells (north of 30&#x000b0;N) where sea ice had melted away completely. This is much better than re-setting the ice cover to the CTL climatology after each time step, since that would provide an infinite source of ice for melting, leading to an infinite heat sink and freshwater source for the oceans. Our approach here focused on the effects on the climate (including sea ice itself) of a fixed sea-ice cover through its impact on surface fluxes; it differs from Deser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, who used an artificial LW forcing to maintain a constant sea-ice cover in a warming experiment, and Blackport and Kushner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, who modified ice&#x02013;albedo to study the impact of sea-ice loss on the climate system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface energy fluxes in the CESM1 runs</title><p id="Par27">To verify that the imposed sea-ice and flux changes to the FixedIce run did not cause major artifacts in this simulation, here we examine and compare the TOA and surface energy flux changes in the CESM1 1% CO<sub>2</sub> and FixedIce runs.</p><p id="Par28">Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref> shows the time series of the global-mean and Arctic-mean changes in the TOA and surface net energy fluxes from the two simulations. Over the Arctic (67&#x000b0;&#x02013;90&#x000b0;N), the TOA fluxes are very similar for the two runs, while the net surface flux into the Arctic Ocean is substantially smaller in the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run than in the FixedIce run (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10b</xref>). This is expected because the use of the fixed sea-ice concentration (SIC) in the FixedIce run reduces the upward longwave (LW) radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7,</xref>
<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>) and therefore should lead to a larger downward net flux in the FixedIce run. Thus, the Arctic surface flux difference shown in Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10b</xref> is what we should expect physically from the change we imposed, whose impact on the Arctic TOA flux is negligible. Because of this, the small difference in the global-mean TOA flux between the two runs after year ~100 (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a</xref>) is likely due to other changes outside the Arctic region, rather than the direct effect of the imposed SIC change in the Arctic. Noticeable differences exist only after about year 100 in the global-mean fluxes between the two runs, and the TOA-minus-surface flux difference is similar between the two runs throughout the whole simulations (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a</xref>). Thus, the global-mean and Arctic-mean TOA and surface net fluxes from the two runs are reasonable.</p><p id="Par29">To examine the spatial patterns, we compare the change patterns between the two runs for the TOA and surface net energy fluxes in Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>, respectively. Again, the TOA flux changes are similar in the two runs, with noticeably higher downward TOA net fluxes over most of the Arctic Ocean in the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11e</xref>) than in the FixedIce run (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11f</xref>) at the time of the 3rd CO<sub>2</sub> doubling (mainly due to increased absorption of solar radiation in the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run), except over the areas with large SIC decreases in the FixedIce run by the 3rd CO<sub>2</sub> doubling (see Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11,</xref>
<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Examination of the changes in the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and TOA net shortwave (SW) radiation (not shown) revealed that the increase in the Arctic TOA net flux is mainly due to the large increase in the absorbed SW radiation that exceeds the increase in OLR in the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run, while it is mainly due to the reduced OLR (as surface upward LW radiation is reduced) as the albedo and thus SW changes are small in the FixedIce run. Thus, these TOA flux changes are expected physically based on the imposed the changes.</p><p id="Par30">For the surface net energy flux (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>), the broad change patterns are similar between the two runs over most of the globe, except the Arctic where the fixed SIC in the FixedIce run is expected to reduce the absorbed SW radiation, upward LW radiation, and surface sensible (SH) and latent (LH) heat fluxes in comparison with the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run (see Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>). These reductions in upward fluxes lead to higher downward net energy fluxes in the FiexedIce run than in the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> over the Arctic Ocean (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Further examination revealed that surface downward SW radiation is reduced over the Arctic due to increased cloudiness in both simulations (Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14,</xref>
<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>); however, due to reduced sea-ice cover in the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>), surface absorbed SW radiation is actually increased despite the decreased downward SW radiation in this run (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16a, b, e</xref>). Because of the use of ice&#x02013;albedo from fixed SIC in calculating the SW flux, the reduced downward SW radiation leads to decreased absorbed SW radiation in the FixedIce run (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16b, d, f</xref>).</p><p id="Par31">As the fixed sea-ice cover reduces upward LW radiation, surface net LW radiative heating increases more in the FixedIce run than in the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run in the Arctic (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>). On the other hand, the surface LH (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>) and SH (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>) heat fluxes increase substantially only in the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run over the Arctic, and they partially offset the large increases in the absorbed SW radiation (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16e</xref>) and the moderate increase in the net LW radiative heating (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17e</xref>) over the Arctic in the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run, which results in only moderate changes in the net surface energy flux (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12e</xref>). This differs from the FixedIce run, in which the changes in the LH and SH fluxes are small (Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17f</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S18f</xref>), and the net surface energy flux change (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12f</xref>) results mainly from the reduced net SW (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16f</xref>) and greatly increased net LW (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17f</xref>) fluxes. These changes in the FixedIce run happened over most of the Arctic, not just over the sea-ice margins (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>) where the control-run fluxes might be used. Thus, these changes are mainly due to the use of the fixed SIC in calculating the surface fluxes, rather than due to the use of the control-run fluxes over a few areas around the original sea-ice margins. This further demonstrates that the use of the fixed SIC, rather than the use of the control-run fluxes, is the main reason behind these differences between the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> and FixedIce runs. These analyses of the TOA and surface fluxes also suggest that there are no major artifacts resulting from the imposed changes in the FixedIce run.</p><p id="Par32">Please note that we have provided several lines of evidence, besides using the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> minus FixedIce difference, to support our conclusion that sea-ice loss is necessary for large AA to occur. These include the diminishing AA in the 23rd century in the CMIP5 models (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and in the CESM1 standard 1% CO<sub>2</sub> run (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>) when Arctic sea-ice melting becomes small. Another evidence is the strong correlation between Arctic sea-ice loss and the AA among the 38 CMIP5 models during the 21st century (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), and the spatial and seasonal relationship between Arctic warming and sea-ice loss (and the associated surface energy flux changes). Thus, while the results from the FixedIce experiment provide a strong confirmation of the essential role of sea-ice loss, they represent only one of the several lines of evidence presented in the paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>ERA-Interim reanalysis data</title><p id="Par33">For the historical changes from 1979 to 2016 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>), we used the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/archive-datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era-interim">ERA-Interim reanalysis data</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, which capture the historical SIC seasonal cycle and changes fairly realistically, although the mean SIC is somewhat lower than satellite observations from NOAA (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).
