  <p>Winter (Dec. 1–Feb. 28) average patterns of sea ice loss mode: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) sea ice (
   <span class="italic">shading</span>) and 2 m air temperature (

   <span class="bold">d</span>) downward longwave radiation, (

   <span class="italic">red curve</span>), projection based on the amplification curve (
   <span class="italic">blue dashed curve</span>). The red curve in (
   <span class="bold">h</span>) is obtained by multiplying the loading vector of sea ice concentration (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) averaged in the boxed area with the amplitude time series (
   <span class="bold">g</span>) according to equation (

   <span class="bold">b</span>–
   <span class="bold">f</span>) represent sea ice concentration in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>). The numbers in parenthesis are contour intervals and negative contours are dashed. Figures in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">f</span>) were created with GrADS 2.1.0 (
