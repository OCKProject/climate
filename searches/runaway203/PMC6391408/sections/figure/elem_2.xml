   <span class="bold">b</span> the GCAM integrated assessment model. In the LUH2 dataset, the SSP4-3.4 and SSP4-6.0 marker scenarios were contributed by the GCAM model, while the SSP1-2.6 scenario was contributed by IMAGE model, the SSP2-4.5 scenario by the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM model, the SSP3-7.0 scenario by the AIM model, and the SSP5-8.5 scenario by the REMIND-MAGPIE model
