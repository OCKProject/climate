  <p>The range of socioeconomic pathways considered here result in large differences in future nitrogen loading, both with and without concomitant changes to climate. Change in mean total nitrogen flux by the end-of-the-century (2071–2100) relative to the historical period (1976–2005) for the SSP1-2.6, SSP4-3.4, SSP2-4.5, SSP4-6.0, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios based on projected land use and fertilizer application rates, both without (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) and with (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) impact of concomitant changes in total annual and springtime extreme precipitation. Precipitation changes are based on RCP2.6 for SSP1-2.6 and SSP4-3.4, RCP4.5 for SSP2-4.5, RCP6.0 for SSP4-6.0, and RCP8.5 for SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> show projected change at HUC8 watershed scale, while 
   <span class="bold">c</span> shows percentage change, both without (top bar) and with (bottom bar) concomitant changes to precipitation, for the continental United States (CONUS), the Mississippi Atchafalaya River Basin (MARB), and the Northeast, with regions as outlined in 
   <span class="bold">a</span> and 
   <span class="bold">b</span>. Filled bars represent a robust change and error bars represent one standard deviation. Historical net anthropogenic nitrogen input was estimated based on the observational record, while future input was estimated using data from the LUH2 dataset
