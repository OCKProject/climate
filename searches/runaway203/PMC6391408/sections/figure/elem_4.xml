  <p>Highly populated regions in South, East, and Southeast Asia are at high risk of increased eutrophication due to large and robust projected increase in fertilizer application rates. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Fertilizer usage per unit area for the historical period (1976–2005) averaged across the 30 years. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Projected change in fertilizer usage per unit area by the end-of-the-century period (2071–2100) relative to the historical period, averaged across the 30 years and six scenarios and shown only for regions where at least five of the six scenarios agree on the direction of change from the historical to the end-of-the-century period. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Regions shown in white have no fertilizer usage; 
   <span class="bold">b</span> regions shown in white either have no fertilizer usage or do not have at least five scenarios with a consistent direction of change
