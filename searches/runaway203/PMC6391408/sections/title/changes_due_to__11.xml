 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of future changes in land use and land management on TN flux was estimated using land use (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) and NANI (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>) based on the six scenarios from the LUH2 dataset (as described below), and historical precipitation based on 21 CMIP5 models (see Section “Historical and future precipitation datasets”). The robustness of projected change in TN flux was assessed in a manner analogous to an earlier study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>, whereby a change is considered robust change if more than 50% of the models show a significant change, as assessed by a two-sided 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test at the 95% confidence level, and more than 80% of the models agree on the sign of change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>
  </span>. Because we are holding precipitation at historical levels, the only variability across the CMIP5 models for a given future land use and land management scenario therefore comes from how the historical precipitation patterns for a given CMIP5 model manifest themselves as TN loading in the framework of a given land use and land management scenario. In other words, a change in land use in a particular location of the country may have a different impact within the context of historical precipitation patterns as represented by one CMIP5 model vs. another.

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the future period, three of the NANI components (fertilizer nitrogen input, agricultural nitrogen fixation, and net food and feed import) were estimated based on the future LUH2 dataset for the six scenarios (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). The LUH2 dataset provides fertilizer application rates for five different crop types (C3 annual crops, C4 annual crops, C3 perennial crops, C4 perennial crops, and C3 nitrogen-fixing crops). Fertilizer usage was obtained by summing the area-weighted fertilizer application rate for all crop types. The fertilizer usage was scaled such that estimates from 1987 to 2012 period (obtained from LUH2 v2h) matched existing estimates of fertilizer usage

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span> for each HUC2 (first level of hydrologic unit) region (see Supplementary Figure

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>). Nitrogen fixation was obtained by multiplying the C3 nitrogen-fixing crop area with a constant nitrogen fixation rate of 14,300 kg N km

  <span class="sup">1</span>, which itself was estimated by multiplying the fraction of the C3 nitrogen-fixing crop area for 2007 from the LUH2 database by a fixed nitrogen fixation rate such that the TN fixation at the continental United States scale matched the 2007 nitrogen fixation estimates of 6.9 Tg N based on the NANI toolbox

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>
  </span>. Future food and feed import, which includes bioenergy production and consumption, was estimated using future fertilizer nitrogen input and agricultural nitrogen fixation for each HUC2 region under the assumption that the relationship between food and feed import and fertilizer input and agricultural nitrogen fixation will remain constant over time. The estimate was based on a multiple linear regression with historical food and feed import as the dependent variable, and historical fertilizer nitrogen input and historical agricultural nitrogen fixation as the independent variables (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). Data on historical values for all three variables for 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012 were obtained from the NANI toolbox
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>
  </span>. Future food and feed import is estimated as a function of fertilizer usage and agricultural nitrogen fixation; therefore, reductions in fertilizer usage resulting from either improvements in nitrogen use efficiency or reductions in cropland area will also impact the nitrogen embedded in net food and feed import. The fourth NANI component, atmospheric deposition was estimated based on existing future NOx deposition estimates

  </span> for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 emission scenarios, which are based on the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model, while the TN flux empirical model was developed by utilizing the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NLCD) NOx deposition estimates. The future NOx deposition estimates were therefore adjusted based on scaling factor between CMAQ model based NOx deposition (obtained from

The fifth NANI component, nonfood crop export, is an extremely small component of NANI and was held constant at the 2007 value (i.e., the approximate value at the end of the historical period) for all years after 2007.
