 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projected changes in land use and land management within the continental United States were based on the land use harmonization 2 (LUH2)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span> dataset prepared for the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The LUH2 dataset includes land use scenarios for 12 land use categories (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) and provides land management scenarios that include fertilizer application rate for five crop types for all global land grid cells at 1/4
  <span class="bold">°</span> spatial resolution and annual temporal resolution. The LUH2 dataset is available for two time periods, with the historical (LUH2 v2h) period covering 850–2015 and the future period (LUH2 v2f) covering 2015–2100. For the future time period, land use and land management scenarios are available for five Shared SSP, each of which is coupled with a corresponding representative concentration pathway (RCP) or climate outcome (SSP1 with RCP2.6, SSP2 with RCP4.5, SSP3 with RCP7.0, SSP4 with RCP3.4, SSP4 with RCP6.0, and SSP5 with RCP8.5), yielding six combined scenarios overall because the SSP4 pathway is coupled to two different RCPs. Although multiple IAMs generated scenarios for each pathway, the scenarios compiled in the LUH2 dataset are based on the marker IAM for each pathway (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Within the LUH2 database, the IAM outputs of various scenarios were harmonized such that the future projections for the six SSPs smoothly connect with the historical projections
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. This harmonization process results in a shift in the future scenario projections from the original IAM estimates for a portion of the future period.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SSPs describe prototypical trajectories for societal development that may occur in the future. The range of SSPs is intended to span the uncertainty associated with societal development, although outcomes outside of this range cannot be ruled out. Various assumptions regarding the SSP pathways
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span> and the IAM implementation of these pathways are described in earlier manuscripts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span> and a brief overview of these assumptions is included here. The SSP1-2.6 Sustainability scenario, contributed by the IMAGE model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>, assumes sustainable growth in the future that focuses on human well-being and respect for environmental boundaries
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. For the continental United States, cropland area and fertilizer usage are projected to increase slightly by the end-of-the-century, driven by an increase in energy crops. The SSP2-4.5 Middle of the Road scenario, contributed by the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span> assumes that future growth patterns will be similar to historical patterns, and is designed to cover the middle ground in terms of mitigation and adaptation challenges between more extreme SSPs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>. For the continental United States, cropland area is projected to remain unchanged while fertilizer usage is projected to decrease slightly. The SSP3-7.0 Regional rivalry scenario, contributed by the AIM model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>, represents a world with increased nationalism and regional rivalry and decreased globalization
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. For the continental United States, this scenario leads to increased deforestation associated with an increase in cropland area and fertilizer usage. The SSP4 Inequality pathway represents a world with increasing inequality both within and across countries
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. This pathway was combined with two climate outcomes, yielding the SSP4-3.4 and SSP4-6.0 scenarios, both based on the GCAM model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
  </span>. These two scenarios are based a common set of high-level assumptions about societal growth, but with different climate outcomes representing different degrees of climate mitigation. For the continental United States, for both the SSP4-3.4 and SSP4-6.0 scenarios, cropland area and fertilizer usage is projected to increase in the future, as a result of an increase in bioenergy crops and an increase in domestic food production. The increase in bioenergy production for the SSP4-3.4, however, is much larger than for the SSP-6.0 (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The SSP5-8.5 Fossil-fueled development scenario, contributed by the REMIND-MAGPIE model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>, represents a world with increased globalization and high economic growth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>. For the continental United States, cropland area remains largely unchanged, developed land areas increase slightly, and fertilizer usage decreases due to an increase in productivity.
