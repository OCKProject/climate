  </span>, socioeconomic development pathways were converted into quantitative projections of energy, land use, and emissions using several IAMs. A single-IAM implementation (a.k.a., marker scenario) was then selected for each scenario for inclusion in the LUH2 database and ultimately for use as part of the CMIP6 effort. The selection was based on the internal consistency of the full set of SSP markers, and the ability of the different models to represent distinct characteristics of the storylines

  </span>. Examining the implementations of scenarios by other IAMs, however, can provide insights into alternative interpretations of the same storylines. With this goal in mind, we compared the cropland area (results not shown) and fertilizer usage projections for the six scenarios in the LUH2 database with the cropland area projection for those scenarios as implemented by the GCAM model. Comparing the GCAM outputs provide insight into the differences across the scenarios, while the LUH2 outputs represent the differences across both the scenarios and the IAMs, because the scenarios in the LUH2 database are contributed by five different IAMs. By comparing GCAM and LUH2 projections for matching scenarios, one can therefore get insight into the role of intermodel differences.
