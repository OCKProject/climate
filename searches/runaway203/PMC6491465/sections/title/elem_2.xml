   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). This indicates that the wind stress and Niño3.4 are strongly coupled, and thus the results of this study are qualitatively the same if the Niño 3.4 index, instead of Pacific trade winds, is considered (see also Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). In general, acceleration (weakening) of the equatorial trade winds are associated with a decreased (increased) GMT with correlations of 0.31, 0.56 and 0.42 in the KCM, the CSIRO-Mk3L and the CESM1-CAM5 control runs, respectively (all significant at the 99% level; Supplementary Table

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify the regional impacts of the Pacific trade wind trends, we compute the correlation between low-frequency Pacific trade wind variations and local SAT anomalies in the control runs (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b–f</a>). The spatial structures exhibit similar patterns in all models. Weakened trade winds, i.e., eastward anomalies, are generally associated with warming in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, tropical and subtropical South America, and the western part of the Indian Ocean, whereas it is accompanied by cooling over the Northwest and Southwest Pacific and the eastern sector of North America. Over the Pacific basin, the pattern is somewhat symmetrical about the equator and reminiscent of the IPO
   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>. Eastward decadal anomalies in the Pacific trade winds are associated with a weakening of the equatorial Ekman divergence over the equatorial Pacific, which reduces poleward surface heat transport. Changes in the trade winds can also affect the Pacific mid-latitudes via atmospheric teleconnections forced by equatorial Pacific SST anomalies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
   </span>. Furthermore, the correlation in the North and South Pacific is large and of the same sign, indicating that decadal SAT anomalies in these regions evolve coherently to some extent. This is suggestive of a pacemaker role for the tropical Pacific in terms of broader scale climate variability over decadal and multi-decadal timescales
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span> (see also Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). However, the details of the spatial patterns vary across the models (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), which is not surprising given the different space-time resolutions, model physics (e.g., atmospheric convection, ocean mixing) and numerical schemes employed in the models.
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These internal fluctuations can result in large multi-decadal GMT trends (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>; see methods), the magnitude of which is model dependent. For example, 10, 20, and 30-year unforced trends on average can reach up to ±0.34, ±0.14, and ± 0.08 (°C/decade), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>), which can exceed expected externally forced trends on shorter timescales.

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We begin by estimating the uncertainty owing to internal variability in the 20-year climate hindcast by analyzing a large ensemble of simulations (CESM-Hind-Proj; 35 members) for the CESM1-CAM5 subject to historical radiative forcing (Methods). Owing to large uncertainty in pre-satellite data
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span>, we only consider the observed wind stress after 1979. The time series of the simulated annual mean trade winds (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) exhibits a large spread across the ensemble members over the entire period, resulting in a wide range of plausible trajectories in the tropical Pacific climate. Despite this large spread, the time series of observed trade winds (shown after 1979 in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) exceeds the envelope simulated by the CESM1-CAM5 ensemble members (particularly in 2011). Indeed, the observed 1992–2011 trend is clearly exceptional compared to the corresponding trends from the model (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). This discrepancy is common to other climate models

   </span>. However, the time series of observed SST over Niño3.4 region (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>), which is another proxy for tropical Pacific climate variability, is well within the range spanned by the model. In each ensemble member, the annual anomaly correlation coefficient between the wind stress and the Niño 3.4 index is statistically significant (99% confidence level) and higher than 0.89.
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to the globally averaged SAT (GMT; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), whereas the ensemble-mean captures its overall evolution, the spread across individual members is notable. The ensemble member trends can vary by ~±0.4 °C per 96-years (1920–2015) relative to the multi-model mean trend; a significant fraction of the ensemble-mean warming trend of ~0.9 °C over the same 96-year period. The uncertainty in the forced component of the trend becomes larger at shorter timescales. For instance, the 20-year trend over 1992–2011 in the simulated GMT varies from 0.14 to 0.38 °C/decade across the ensemble set (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>, Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) whereas the ensemble mean is ~0.26 °C/decade. This range is approximately equal to the range of internally driven 20-year trends in the corresponding control run (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The observed warming trend (0.2 °C/decade) lies within the simulated range (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>), although close to the lowest end of the ensemble set.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each ensemble member, the annual correlation between GMT and wind stress is statistically significant (at 99% confidence level) and varies from 0.32 to 0.66. For each ensemble member, a similar correlation is found between the GMT and Niño3.4 index (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). This implies using either the wind stress-based or SST-based indices (Niño3.4) yields very similar results for the tropical Pacific climate variability and its connection to GMT. Further, there is a clear relationship between the trend in GMT and trend in Pacific trade winds across the members from 1992 to 2011 (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.38, statistically significant at the 99% confidence level): ensemble members with stronger easterly (westerly) trade wind trend anomalies show reduced (enhanced) rates of global surface warming (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). Although the 20-year GMT trends always remain positive, the 20-year weakening and strengthening of the Pacific trade winds are about equally likely (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). Although strengthening of the trade winds is capable of temporarily slowing global surface warming, it is not sufficient to reverse the positive GMT trend, particularly if GHG concentrations are increasing rapidly
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. Even during the recent observed two-decade period of unprecedented intensified Pacific trade winds (1992–2011), the GMT trend remained positive
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
   </span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). The component of the trend that is related to internal variability is reduced when longer timescales are considered (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) and any forced signal becomes more dominant. For example, the range of GMT 30-year trends is nearly half of that related to 20-year trend (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). At longer timescales, we expect less ensemble spread and more predictable forced trend, as the forcing signal increases in magnitude relative to the size of internal variability.
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how the climate state differs in relation to intensifying/weakening equatorial Pacific winds, we composite 20-year periods when these wind trend anomalies exceed ± 1 standard deviation (selected based on Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). In the ensemble members with large westward 20-year trend in Pacific trade winds there is a cooling over the central and eastern tropical Pacific, the Australian continent, over East and Southeast Asia and the tropical and subtropical sector of South America along with warming over the Northwest and Southwest Pacific, and the eastern sector of North America (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). These changes are associated with enhanced (reduced) SLP in the eastern (western) Pacific. The spatial patterns are consistent with a strengthening of the PWC, increased equatorial upwelling and wind-driven Ekman divergence away from the equator, which cause anomalously large ocean heat uptake in the Pacific interior
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
   </span>. In fact these spatial patterns are similar to the observed trends over the 1992–2011 period (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>), and are reminiscent of the negative phase of the IPO
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
   </span>. On the other hand, largely mirrored changes in SAT and SLP are simulated in the ensemble members associated with 20-year weakening trend in Pacific trade winds (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). This model analysis demonstrates the large and sometimes contrasting impact that internal decadal variability can have on 20-year trends. It also indicates the key role of large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions in controlling the Pacific climate in the analyzed model. However, we cannot rule out remote influences from the Indian and Atlantic Oceans
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
   </span>. Moreover, internal variability adds large uncertainty in regional climate projections and can mask anthropogenic signals over the 20-year timescale

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
   </span>. For example, in most places the ensemble spread in 20-year trends in SLP (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5b</a>) exceeds the ensemble-mean trend (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5a</a>). In addition, the ratio of ensemble-mean trend to the ensemble spread, which defines the signal-to-noise ratio as a measure of the robustness of the forced trend, is in general smaller than 1.0 over the tropical region (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5c</a>), indicating the dominant impact of internal variability at this timescale

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>), again indicating the importance of internal variability on these timescales (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, d, g</a>). As with the historical analysis, there are statistically significant positive correlations between the zonal wind stress trends and GMT trends across ensemble members (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) with correlations of 0.57, 0.66, and 0.67 in the CESM-Hind-Proj, the KCM-ICs and Mk3L-ICs, respectively (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, d, g</a>). However, the regressions are different from model to model (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, d, g</a>), implying that the SST response to the tropical winds (i.e., the strength of the wind-SST feedback) is very different across the three models. Given the large relative uncertainty in the GMT 20-year trend in each ensemble (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>), there is inherently low predictability in the magnitude of the GMT increases on this timescale, unless the Pacific wind trends (and associated IPO phase) can themselves be predicted. In general, the rate of global warming in Mk3L is relatively low compared with that simulated in KCM and CESM1-CAM5 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, d, g</a>). It was previously shown that Mk3L has a lower transient climate response compared with other climate models, which is mainly owing to parametrization of key radiative feedback processes such as water vapor, lapse rate, snow, and ocean heat uptake in the model

   </span> suggests that the state of upper-ocean heat content can provide some predictability around phase transitions of the IPO. Here, we extend this work to examine the potential to improve the predictability of 20-year trends in two distinct model ensembles, given knowledge of the initial phase of the IPO. In particular, we examine climate trends from perturbed atmosphere ensembles starting from a positive and negative IPO state in the KCM and Mk3L models (termed KCM-IPO-Warm, KCM-IPO-Cold, and Mk3L-IPO-Warm, Mk3L-IPO-Cold, respectively).
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The connection between the Pacific trade winds and regional changes in temperature and circulation and with global surface warming in these IPO experiments is consistent with previous ensembles used in this study (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). Time series shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> are the GMT in each ensemble member. In each experiment, the GMT is computed relative to its average over the first 20-years. For the first few years, the ensemble spread in GMT in the simulations initiated during the peak of either a positive or negative IPO phase is smaller than that obtained from an ensemble initiated from random ocean states (i.e., KCM-ICs and Mk3L-ICs; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d, h</a>). On longer timescales, the ensemble spreads in the annually averaged GMT become very similar across the three ensembles for each model. The rapid increase in the spread of GMT is a result of various factors limiting the climate forecast skill in multi-year to decadal timescales, such as stochastic forcing and strongly nonlinear climate dynamics
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span>. The rate of global warming, indicated by the ensemble mean, differs across these ensembles (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d, h</a>). Namely, when the projections start from the negative phase of the IPO (i.e., KCM-IPO-Cold, Mk3L-IPO-Cold; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d, h</a>) the ensemble-mean warming is faster over the first decade than in the randomly initialized ensemble, for both models. The opposite is true for the ensembles started from the positive IPO state (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d, h</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). Indeed, the decadal trend (10-year) in the annual mean GMT in each ensemble derived from the forecast data show significant differences across the experiments. The trend in the ensemble mean of KCM-ICs, KCM-IPO-Cold, and KCM-IPO-Warm is 0.21 ± 0.17, 0.31 ± 0.14, and 0.03 ± 0.14 °C/decade, respectively. The corresponding trends in Mk3L-ICs, Mk3L-IPO-Cold, and Mk3L-IPO-Warm are 0.12 ± 0.08, 0.15 ± 0.04, and 0.08 ± 0.09 °C/decade, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). In both models, there is a significant difference (95% confidence interval) in the GMT decadal trends in the ensemble set initiated from the positive IPO and that initiated from the negative IPO. Computing a similar trend as above but starting from the second year of simulation in each ensemble mean (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>) leads to similar conclusion: KCM, Mk3L-IPO-warm experiments display reduced global warming compared with the KCM, Mk3L-IPO-Cold experiments. Thus, despite the presence of the rapidly varying atmospheric forcing and other predictability barriers over the tropical Pacific

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span>, GMT decadal prediction can be significantly improved by implementing the past climate trajectory in the model. This essentially demonstrates that knowledge of the oceanic initial conditions has the potential to improve the accuracy of near-term GMT projections over a decadal timescale.

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a 20-year timescale, the difference in the rate of global warming across model ensembles seems to be less consistent (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). For example, in the KCM ensembles, 20-year global warming in the ensemble set initialized from the positive IPO (KCM-IPO-Warm) is approximately the same as that for the randomly chosen ICs ensemble (KCM-ICs; ~0.43 °C) although faster warming is indeed simulated in the simulation initiated from the negative IPO (0.67 °C; Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). In contrast, Mk3L ensembles show almost the same distribution of warming over the first 20-years (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>) regardless of initial conditions. Thus, the state of the IPO affects predictions of GMT on a 10-year timescale, but shows weaker importance at longer timescales as greenhouse effect dominates.
  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why the IPO state could significantly affect GMT prediction might come down to the fact that the IPO is a quasi-steady process (i.e., stationary time series) with tendency to revert toward its climatological mean over a ~20-year timescale. As such, the subsequent 20-year trend after any maximum IPO phase is very likely to be negative. This basically leads to a tendency for decadal cooling over the tropical Pacific and a decline in GMT following the maximum positive IPO phase. The opposite is true after minimum IPO phases. This notion is supported by composite analysis based on IPO extremes ( ±1 SD) in the control runs (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). In general, 20-year trends in GMT after maximum IPO cold phases tend to be large and positive, while these trends tend to be large and negative after IPO warm phases (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10, b, e, h</a>). Indeed, the spatial structures of the SAT trend obtained from the composite analysis are very similar to the IPO patterns (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10,c,f,i</a>), further supporting this mechanism for drivers of decadal variability in GMT.
  </p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How the state of the IPO could lead to such decadal trends of GMT is not fully understood. As shown in previous studies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span>, IPO cycles have a critical role in redistribution of heat storage through changes in the equatorial Ekman divergence over the equatorial Pacific, which is accompanied by anomalous poleward surface heat transport to the mid and high latitudes. Another potential mechanism may be through altered incoming shortwave radiation, particularly since the GMT and globally averaged net shortwave radiation are strongly correlated
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
   </span>. Specifically it could be that incoming solar radiation is reduced following the IPO-Warm owing to increasing cloud cover, thus leading to decreased GMT. Preliminary analysis with the KCM control run shows that such tendency exists but somewhat weak (not shown). Further study is needed to clarify the pertinent mechanisms, which are beyond the scope of this paper.
  </p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial structures of ensemble-mean 20-year SAT trends are noticeably different across the different cases of initial conditions for each of the models (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a–c, e–g</a>). Compared with the ICs trends in both models IPO-Cold trends display larger warming over the central tropical and subtropical Pacific and adjacent continents, North America, Asia and relative cooling over the Northwestern Pacific (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). The opposite behavior is obtained in the IPO-Warm trends in both models (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Over large parts of the basin and adjacent continent, the difference between the KCM-IPO-Cold and the KCM-IPO-Warm is statistically significant (at 95% confidence level), which is similar to results obtained from the composite analysis based on IPO maxima and IPO minima in the control runs (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). These spatial structures are reminiscent of the positive phase of the IPO (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11a</a>). A similar structure, but smaller magnitude, is obtained from the difference between the Mk3L-IPO-Cold and the Mk3L-IPO-Warm ensemble sets (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11b</a>). In addition, most members, ~17 (14) out of 22, in the KCM-IPO-Cold (the Mk3L-IPO-Cold) ensemble set display an IPO-positive-like pattern in the first two decades of integration, whereas the IPO-positive-like and the IPO-negative-like patterns are rather equally likely in the KCM-ICs (the Mk3L-ICs; see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>-
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S18</a>). Roughly opposite patterns were simulated when the simulations started from the positive phase of the IPO (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">14</a>, 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S17</a>, 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S18</a>). Thus, on regional scales, the state of the IPO appears to have significant influences on the magnitude of 20-year SAT trends over large parts of the Pacific and adjacent continents.
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, our results suggest that taking into account the state of oceanic conditions associated with the IPO could hold the potential to narrow down uncertainty in multi-decadal regional SAT projections. However, owing to the nonlinear nature of the climate system and large exchanges of heat and momentum between the ocean and atmosphere, combined with the stochastic nature of the atmosphere, this uncertainty reduction might be strongly state-dependent. Future studies aiming to provide more precise estimates of the associated uncertainties would be beneficial to the climate prediction community. This will likely involve even larger ensembles than considered here, across a diverse but coordinated set of model experiments.</p>
  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarize, we have analyzed several ensembles of climate change simulations across three fully coupled climate models, subject to different external forcing and initial states. Our goal was to examine and quantify the uncertainty in estimates of forced globally averaged SAT trends in hindcast and projection simulations associated with internal variability and the associated regional signatures. In the presence of identical external forcing, a large spread in 20-year tropical and subtropical Pacific trends was found, in each model ensemble, arising from internal climate variability. We showed that in each ensemble set, the rate of global warming over a 20-year timescale is closely linked to tropical Pacific internal climate variability, whereby intensified trade winds, as a good representative of tropical Pacific climate, are associated with reduced globally averaged warming, and weaker trade winds with accelerated global warming (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). The range of GMT 20-year trends sometimes exceeds the ensemble-mean warming trend in each ensemble set. We further showed that, on decadal or even multi-decadal timescales, there is the potential to narrow this range if the observed ocean state is known and used to initialize the model forecasts (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). Furthermore, our findings indicate that when the model integration starts from a negative (positive) phase of the IPO, the subsequent decade is more likely to exhibit accelerated (reduced) global warming. This suggests that there is an increased likelihood of accelerated global warming in the coming decade since we have, in recent years, been in a strongly negative IPO state
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
   </span>. Our idealized experiments support the use of initialized climate model projections for making decadal predictions. Our findings nonetheless suggest that internal variability can potentially obscure the forced signal in the tropical Pacific sector and in the GMT on decadal timescales. However, the relative importance of this will decline as atmospheric GHG concentrations continue to increase into the future.
