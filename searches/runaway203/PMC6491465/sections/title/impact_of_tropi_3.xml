  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). This indicates that the wind stress and Niño3.4 are strongly coupled, and thus the results of this study are qualitatively the same if the Niño 3.4 index, instead of Pacific trade winds, is considered (see also Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). In general, acceleration (weakening) of the equatorial trade winds are associated with a decreased (increased) GMT with correlations of 0.31, 0.56 and 0.42 in the KCM, the CSIRO-Mk3L and the CESM1-CAM5 control runs, respectively (all significant at the 99% level; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>; see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). However, all models simulate certain periods when this wind-GMT relationship breaks down. This may be related to periods of only moderate trade wind variations, insufficient to lead to a sustained acceleration or deceleration of heat uptake in the subtropical overturning cells

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify the regional impacts of the Pacific trade wind trends, we compute the correlation between low-frequency Pacific trade wind variations and local SAT anomalies in the control runs (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b–f</a>). The spatial structures exhibit similar patterns in all models. Weakened trade winds, i.e., eastward anomalies, are generally associated with warming in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, tropical and subtropical South America, and the western part of the Indian Ocean, whereas it is accompanied by cooling over the Northwest and Southwest Pacific and the eastern sector of North America. Over the Pacific basin, the pattern is somewhat symmetrical about the equator and reminiscent of the IPO

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. Eastward decadal anomalies in the Pacific trade winds are associated with a weakening of the equatorial Ekman divergence over the equatorial Pacific, which reduces poleward surface heat transport. Changes in the trade winds can also affect the Pacific mid-latitudes via atmospheric teleconnections forced by equatorial Pacific SST anomalies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, the correlation in the North and South Pacific is large and of the same sign, indicating that decadal SAT anomalies in these regions evolve coherently to some extent. This is suggestive of a pacemaker role for the tropical Pacific in terms of broader scale climate variability over decadal and multi-decadal timescales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span> (see also Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). However, the details of the spatial patterns vary across the models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), which is not surprising given the different space-time resolutions, model physics (e.g., atmospheric convection, ocean mixing) and numerical schemes employed in the models.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These internal fluctuations can result in large multi-decadal GMT trends (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>; see methods), the magnitude of which is model dependent. For example, 10, 20, and 30-year unforced trends on average can reach up to ±0.34, ±0.14, and ± 0.08 (°C/decade), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>), which can exceed expected externally forced trends on shorter timescales.
