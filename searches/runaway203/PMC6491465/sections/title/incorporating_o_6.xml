  </span> suggests that the state of upper-ocean heat content can provide some predictability around phase transitions of the IPO. Here, we extend this work to examine the potential to improve the predictability of 20-year trends in two distinct model ensembles, given knowledge of the initial phase of the IPO. In particular, we examine climate trends from perturbed atmosphere ensembles starting from a positive and negative IPO state in the KCM and Mk3L models (termed KCM-IPO-Warm, KCM-IPO-Cold, and Mk3L-IPO-Warm, Mk3L-IPO-Cold, respectively).
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The connection between the Pacific trade winds and regional changes in temperature and circulation and with global surface warming in these IPO experiments is consistent with previous ensembles used in this study (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). Time series shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> are the GMT in each ensemble member. In each experiment, the GMT is computed relative to its average over the first 20-years. For the first few years, the ensemble spread in GMT in the simulations initiated during the peak of either a positive or negative IPO phase is smaller than that obtained from an ensemble initiated from random ocean states (i.e., KCM-ICs and Mk3L-ICs; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d, h</a>). On longer timescales, the ensemble spreads in the annually averaged GMT become very similar across the three ensembles for each model. The rapid increase in the spread of GMT is a result of various factors limiting the climate forecast skill in multi-year to decadal timescales, such as stochastic forcing and strongly nonlinear climate dynamics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. The rate of global warming, indicated by the ensemble mean, differs across these ensembles (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d, h</a>). Namely, when the projections start from the negative phase of the IPO (i.e., KCM-IPO-Cold, Mk3L-IPO-Cold; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d, h</a>) the ensemble-mean warming is faster over the first decade than in the randomly initialized ensemble, for both models. The opposite is true for the ensembles started from the positive IPO state (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d, h</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). Indeed, the decadal trend (10-year) in the annual mean GMT in each ensemble derived from the forecast data show significant differences across the experiments. The trend in the ensemble mean of KCM-ICs, KCM-IPO-Cold, and KCM-IPO-Warm is 0.21 ± 0.17, 0.31 ± 0.14, and 0.03 ± 0.14 °C/decade, respectively. The corresponding trends in Mk3L-ICs, Mk3L-IPO-Cold, and Mk3L-IPO-Warm are 0.12 ± 0.08, 0.15 ± 0.04, and 0.08 ± 0.09 °C/decade, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). In both models, there is a significant difference (95% confidence interval) in the GMT decadal trends in the ensemble set initiated from the positive IPO and that initiated from the negative IPO. Computing a similar trend as above but starting from the second year of simulation in each ensemble mean (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>) leads to similar conclusion: KCM, Mk3L-IPO-warm experiments display reduced global warming compared with the KCM, Mk3L-IPO-Cold experiments. Thus, despite the presence of the rapidly varying atmospheric forcing and other predictability barriers over the tropical Pacific

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>, GMT decadal prediction can be significantly improved by implementing the past climate trajectory in the model. This essentially demonstrates that knowledge of the oceanic initial conditions has the potential to improve the accuracy of near-term GMT projections over a decadal timescale.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a 20-year timescale, the difference in the rate of global warming across model ensembles seems to be less consistent (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). For example, in the KCM ensembles, 20-year global warming in the ensemble set initialized from the positive IPO (KCM-IPO-Warm) is approximately the same as that for the randomly chosen ICs ensemble (KCM-ICs; ~0.43 °C) although faster warming is indeed simulated in the simulation initiated from the negative IPO (0.67 °C; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). In contrast, Mk3L ensembles show almost the same distribution of warming over the first 20-years (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>) regardless of initial conditions. Thus, the state of the IPO affects predictions of GMT on a 10-year timescale, but shows weaker importance at longer timescales as greenhouse effect dominates.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why the IPO state could significantly affect GMT prediction might come down to the fact that the IPO is a quasi-steady process (i.e., stationary time series) with tendency to revert toward its climatological mean over a ~20-year timescale. As such, the subsequent 20-year trend after any maximum IPO phase is very likely to be negative. This basically leads to a tendency for decadal cooling over the tropical Pacific and a decline in GMT following the maximum positive IPO phase. The opposite is true after minimum IPO phases. This notion is supported by composite analysis based on IPO extremes ( ±1 SD) in the control runs (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). In general, 20-year trends in GMT after maximum IPO cold phases tend to be large and positive, while these trends tend to be large and negative after IPO warm phases (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10, b, e, h</a>). Indeed, the spatial structures of the SAT trend obtained from the composite analysis are very similar to the IPO patterns (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10,c,f,i</a>), further supporting this mechanism for drivers of decadal variability in GMT.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How the state of the IPO could lead to such decadal trends of GMT is not fully understood. As shown in previous studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, IPO cycles have a critical role in redistribution of heat storage through changes in the equatorial Ekman divergence over the equatorial Pacific, which is accompanied by anomalous poleward surface heat transport to the mid and high latitudes. Another potential mechanism may be through altered incoming shortwave radiation, particularly since the GMT and globally averaged net shortwave radiation are strongly correlated
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. Specifically it could be that incoming solar radiation is reduced following the IPO-Warm owing to increasing cloud cover, thus leading to decreased GMT. Preliminary analysis with the KCM control run shows that such tendency exists but somewhat weak (not shown). Further study is needed to clarify the pertinent mechanisms, which are beyond the scope of this paper.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial structures of ensemble-mean 20-year SAT trends are noticeably different across the different cases of initial conditions for each of the models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a–c, e–g</a>). Compared with the ICs trends in both models IPO-Cold trends display larger warming over the central tropical and subtropical Pacific and adjacent continents, North America, Asia and relative cooling over the Northwestern Pacific (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). The opposite behavior is obtained in the IPO-Warm trends in both models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Over large parts of the basin and adjacent continent, the difference between the KCM-IPO-Cold and the KCM-IPO-Warm is statistically significant (at 95% confidence level), which is similar to results obtained from the composite analysis based on IPO maxima and IPO minima in the control runs (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). These spatial structures are reminiscent of the positive phase of the IPO (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11a</a>). A similar structure, but smaller magnitude, is obtained from the difference between the Mk3L-IPO-Cold and the Mk3L-IPO-Warm ensemble sets (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11b</a>). In addition, most members, ~17 (14) out of 22, in the KCM-IPO-Cold (the Mk3L-IPO-Cold) ensemble set display an IPO-positive-like pattern in the first two decades of integration, whereas the IPO-positive-like and the IPO-negative-like patterns are rather equally likely in the KCM-ICs (the Mk3L-ICs; see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12</a>-
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S18</a>). Roughly opposite patterns were simulated when the simulations started from the positive phase of the IPO (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">14</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S17</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S18</a>). Thus, on regional scales, the state of the IPO appears to have significant influences on the magnitude of 20-year SAT trends over large parts of the Pacific and adjacent continents.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, our results suggest that taking into account the state of oceanic conditions associated with the IPO could hold the potential to narrow down uncertainty in multi-decadal regional SAT projections. However, owing to the nonlinear nature of the climate system and large exchanges of heat and momentum between the ocean and atmosphere, combined with the stochastic nature of the atmosphere, this uncertainty reduction might be strongly state-dependent. Future studies aiming to provide more precise estimates of the associated uncertainties would be beneficial to the climate prediction community. This will likely involve even larger ensembles than considered here, across a diverse but coordinated set of model experiments.</p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarize, we have analyzed several ensembles of climate change simulations across three fully coupled climate models, subject to different external forcing and initial states. Our goal was to examine and quantify the uncertainty in estimates of forced globally averaged SAT trends in hindcast and projection simulations associated with internal variability and the associated regional signatures. In the presence of identical external forcing, a large spread in 20-year tropical and subtropical Pacific trends was found, in each model ensemble, arising from internal climate variability. We showed that in each ensemble set, the rate of global warming over a 20-year timescale is closely linked to tropical Pacific internal climate variability, whereby intensified trade winds, as a good representative of tropical Pacific climate, are associated with reduced globally averaged warming, and weaker trade winds with accelerated global warming (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). The range of GMT 20-year trends sometimes exceeds the ensemble-mean warming trend in each ensemble set. We further showed that, on decadal or even multi-decadal timescales, there is the potential to narrow this range if the observed ocean state is known and used to initialize the model forecasts (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). Furthermore, our findings indicate that when the model integration starts from a negative (positive) phase of the IPO, the subsequent decade is more likely to exhibit accelerated (reduced) global warming. This suggests that there is an increased likelihood of accelerated global warming in the coming decade since we have, in recent years, been in a strongly negative IPO state
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Our idealized experiments support the use of initialized climate model projections for making decadal predictions. Our findings nonetheless suggest that internal variability can potentially obscure the forced signal in the tropical Pacific sector and in the GMT on decadal timescales. However, the relative importance of this will decline as atmospheric GHG concentrations continue to increase into the future.
