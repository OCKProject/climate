 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Uncertainty in projected (CESM-Hind-Proj) and idealized transient (KCM-ICs, and Mk3L-ICs ensembles; starting from different oceanic and atmospheric Initial Conditions; Methods) SAT is next examined using large ensembles from three models. As with the historical ensemble (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>) there is a large spread in 20-year trends in the Pacific trade winds and GMT across the ensemble members (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a–g</a>; Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Composites of 20-year trends in SAT, SLP, and wind stress based on ensemble members with large positive and negative equatorial wind stress trends (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) reveal large differences in the warming trend over regions where SATs are strongly correlated with equatorial winds (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Relative cooling over the central and eastern tropical Pacific and adjacent areas in South America, east Asia, Australia, the western Indian Ocean along with relative warming in the Northwest and the Southwest Pacific are displayed in those ensemble members in which the Pacific trade winds are intensified (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b, e, h</a>). The opposite occurs when the Pacific trade winds are reduced (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c, f, i</a>).

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each ensemble set, the range in the GMT trend is comparable with the ensemble-mean trend (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>), again indicating the importance of internal variability on these timescales (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, d, g</a>). As with the historical analysis, there are statistically significant positive correlations between the zonal wind stress trends and GMT trends across ensemble members (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) with correlations of 0.57, 0.66, and 0.67 in the CESM-Hind-Proj, the KCM-ICs and Mk3L-ICs, respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, d, g</a>). However, the regressions are different from model to model (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, d, g</a>), implying that the SST response to the tropical winds (i.e., the strength of the wind-SST feedback) is very different across the three models. Given the large relative uncertainty in the GMT 20-year trend in each ensemble (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>), there is inherently low predictability in the magnitude of the GMT increases on this timescale, unless the Pacific wind trends (and associated IPO phase) can themselves be predicted. In general, the rate of global warming in Mk3L is relatively low compared with that simulated in KCM and CESM1-CAM5 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, d, g</a>). It was previously shown that Mk3L has a lower transient climate response compared with other climate models, which is mainly owing to parametrization of key radiative feedback processes such as water vapor, lapse rate, snow, and ocean heat uptake in the model
