 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We begin by estimating the uncertainty owing to internal variability in the 20-year climate hindcast by analyzing a large ensemble of simulations (CESM-Hind-Proj; 35 members) for the CESM1-CAM5 subject to historical radiative forcing (Methods). Owing to large uncertainty in pre-satellite data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, we only consider the observed wind stress after 1979. The time series of the simulated annual mean trade winds (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) exhibits a large spread across the ensemble members over the entire period, resulting in a wide range of plausible trajectories in the tropical Pacific climate. Despite this large spread, the time series of observed trade winds (shown after 1979 in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) exceeds the envelope simulated by the CESM1-CAM5 ensemble members (particularly in 2011). Indeed, the observed 1992–2011 trend is clearly exceptional compared to the corresponding trends from the model (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). This discrepancy is common to other climate models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span> and could have a number of possible reasons. In particular, the magnitude of low-frequency variability may be systematically underestimated in models
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Also, the recent wind intensification may have been partly enhanced by changes in radiative forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>, and these may not be properly simulated by the model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. However, the time series of observed SST over Niño3.4 region (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>), which is another proxy for tropical Pacific climate variability, is well within the range spanned by the model. In each ensemble member, the annual anomaly correlation coefficient between the wind stress and the Niño 3.4 index is statistically significant (99% confidence level) and higher than 0.89.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to the globally averaged SAT (GMT; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), whereas the ensemble-mean captures its overall evolution, the spread across individual members is notable. The ensemble member trends can vary by ~±0.4 °C per 96-years (1920–2015) relative to the multi-model mean trend; a significant fraction of the ensemble-mean warming trend of ~0.9 °C over the same 96-year period. The uncertainty in the forced component of the trend becomes larger at shorter timescales. For instance, the 20-year trend over 1992–2011 in the simulated GMT varies from 0.14 to 0.38 °C/decade across the ensemble set (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) whereas the ensemble mean is ~0.26 °C/decade. This range is approximately equal to the range of internally driven 20-year trends in the corresponding control run (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The observed warming trend (0.2 °C/decade) lies within the simulated range (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>), although close to the lowest end of the ensemble set.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each ensemble member, the annual correlation between GMT and wind stress is statistically significant (at 99% confidence level) and varies from 0.32 to 0.66. For each ensemble member, a similar correlation is found between the GMT and Niño3.4 index (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). This implies using either the wind stress-based or SST-based indices (Niño3.4) yields very similar results for the tropical Pacific climate variability and its connection to GMT. Further, there is a clear relationship between the trend in GMT and trend in Pacific trade winds across the members from 1992 to 2011 (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.38, statistically significant at the 99% confidence level): ensemble members with stronger easterly (westerly) trade wind trend anomalies show reduced (enhanced) rates of global surface warming (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). Although the 20-year GMT trends always remain positive, the 20-year weakening and strengthening of the Pacific trade winds are about equally likely (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). Although strengthening of the trade winds is capable of temporarily slowing global surface warming, it is not sufficient to reverse the positive GMT trend, particularly if GHG concentrations are increasing rapidly
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Even during the recent observed two-decade period of unprecedented intensified Pacific trade winds (1992–2011), the GMT trend remained positive
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). The component of the trend that is related to internal variability is reduced when longer timescales are considered (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) and any forced signal becomes more dominant. For example, the range of GMT 30-year trends is nearly half of that related to 20-year trend (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). At longer timescales, we expect less ensemble spread and more predictable forced trend, as the forcing signal increases in magnitude relative to the size of internal variability.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how the climate state differs in relation to intensifying/weakening equatorial Pacific winds, we composite 20-year periods when these wind trend anomalies exceed ± 1 standard deviation (selected based on Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). In the ensemble members with large westward 20-year trend in Pacific trade winds there is a cooling over the central and eastern tropical Pacific, the Australian continent, over East and Southeast Asia and the tropical and subtropical sector of South America along with warming over the Northwest and Southwest Pacific, and the eastern sector of North America (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). These changes are associated with enhanced (reduced) SLP in the eastern (western) Pacific. The spatial patterns are consistent with a strengthening of the PWC, increased equatorial upwelling and wind-driven Ekman divergence away from the equator, which cause anomalously large ocean heat uptake in the Pacific interior
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. In fact these spatial patterns are similar to the observed trends over the 1992–2011 period (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>), and are reminiscent of the negative phase of the IPO
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. On the other hand, largely mirrored changes in SAT and SLP are simulated in the ensemble members associated with 20-year weakening trend in Pacific trade winds (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). This model analysis demonstrates the large and sometimes contrasting impact that internal decadal variability can have on 20-year trends. It also indicates the key role of large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions in controlling the Pacific climate in the analyzed model. However, we cannot rule out remote influences from the Indian and Atlantic Oceans
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Moreover, internal variability adds large uncertainty in regional climate projections and can mask anthropogenic signals over the 20-year timescale
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. For example, in most places the ensemble spread in 20-year trends in SLP (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5b</a>) exceeds the ensemble-mean trend (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5a</a>). In addition, the ratio of ensemble-mean trend to the ensemble spread, which defines the signal-to-noise ratio as a measure of the robustness of the forced trend, is in general smaller than 1.0 over the tropical region (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5c</a>), indicating the dominant impact of internal variability at this timescale
