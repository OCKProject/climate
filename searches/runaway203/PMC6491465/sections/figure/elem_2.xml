  <p>Composites of 20-year trends in SAT, SLP, and Pacific trade winds in the ensemble of climate hindcasts. Composites of 1992–2011 trends in SAT (shading; °C/decade), SLP (contours; hPa/decade) and wind stress (arrows; Nm
   <span class="sup">−2</span>/decade) from members from the CESM-Hind-Proj with large ( &gt;1 s.d.) associated strengthening (

   <span class="bold">b</span>) of the trade winds over the tropical Pacific (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). The corresponding ensemble mean SAT trend (1992–2011), our estimate of the forced trend, is subtracted at each grid point. Note that the wind vectors are only shown for tropical Pacific sector
