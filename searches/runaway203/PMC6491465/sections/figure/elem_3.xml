  <p>Composites of 20-year trends in SAT, SLP, and Pacific trade winds in three ensembles of a global warming simulation. 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">d</span>, 
   <span class="bold">g</span> Scatter plot of 20-year trends in equatorial Pacific zonal wind stress (Nm
   <span class="sup">−2</span>/decade) and globally averaged SAT (°C/decade) from individual ensemble members (left panels). The vertical solid lines indicate the mean ± Std of the trend in the wind stress and black solid lines denote the regression lines between GMT and wind stress trends. The correlation between the wind stress and GMT trends and the slope of the regression lines are shown with 
   <span class="italic">R</span> and 
   <span class="italic">a</span> in the left panels. Other panels show composites of 20-year trends in SAT (shading; °C/decade), SLP (contours; hPa/decade), and wind stress (arrows; Nm
   <span class="sup">−2</span>/decade) based on ensemble members with wind stress trends less than (

   <span class="bold">i</span>) ensemble of global warming simulations. 
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">c</span> The trend is computed for the period corresponding to 2016–2035, whereas in 
   <span class="bold">d</span>–
   <span class="bold">i</span> it is related to the first 20-year of the realizations. The corresponding ensemble mean SAT trend is subtracted from each grid point in 
   <span class="bold">b</span>–
