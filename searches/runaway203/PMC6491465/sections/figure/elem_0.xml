  <p>Time series of tropical Pacific zonal wind stress, globally averaged SAT, and the Tripole Index in the three climate models. Time series of low-frequency fluctuations (11-yr low passed filter) in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">c</span>, 
   <span class="bold">e</span>) zonal wind stress over western equatorial Pacific (red solid lines), globally averaged SAT (black solid lines), and the Tripole Index (TPI; blue solid lines) from 
   <span class="bold">a</span> KCM, 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Mk3L, and 
   <span class="bold">e</span> CESM-CAM5 control runs (all time series have been standardized). Blue (black) circles in 
   <span class="bold">a</span> and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> denote the initial year of the KCM-ICs (the KCM-IPO-Cold and the KCM-IPO-Warm) and the Mk3L-ICs (the Mk3L-IPO-Cold and the Mk3L-IPO-Warm) global warming simulations, respectively. 
   <span class="bold">b</span>, 
   <span class="bold">d</span>, 
   <span class="bold">f</span> panelsÂ display the corresponding correlation between low-frequency fluctuations in the equatorial zonal wind stress (11-yr low passed filter) and local SAT anomalies computed from the control runs. Boxes on 
   <span class="bold">d</span> indicate locations used for the calculation of the TPI. Hatching in 
   <span class="bold">b</span>, 
   <span class="bold">d</span>, 
   <span class="bold">f</span> show where the correlation is statistically significant at 99% confidence level (accounting for autocorrelation in the time series)
