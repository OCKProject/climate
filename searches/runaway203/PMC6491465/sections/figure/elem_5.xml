  <p>Schematic of the range in simulated global mean temperature trajectories due to tropical Pacific climate variability. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> The black curve refers to the observed GMT warming in response to increased radiative forcing. Blue (red) curves in 
   <span class="bold">a</span> denote the projected GMT when the observed oceanic state is used (not-used) to initialize the subsequent climate projections. Corresponding red and blue arrows in 
   <span class="bold">a</span> indicate the level of uncertainty for each case. Shown in 
   <span class="bold">b</span>â€“
   <span class="bold">c</span> are the scenarios wherein accelerated (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) and reduced (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) GMT warming is often associated with anomalous Pacific trade winds (and thus Walker Circulation strength) and corresponding anomalous heat fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere
