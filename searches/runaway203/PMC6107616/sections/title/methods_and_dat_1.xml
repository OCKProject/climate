 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an effort to improve understanding of Arctic sea-ice behaviour in the AR5 GCMs, we compare the daily satellite observations from 1978–2005 to the model output data with daily frequency for the same period. For parity in this comparison, we analyse the 21 AR5 models (shown in 
  <a rid="RSTA20170332TB1" ref-type="table" href="#RSTA20170332TB1">table 1</a>) with daily data in their historical runs, and use the first ensemble member from 11 of these and two from the remaining 10 models. To be consistent in our comparison of all the models and the satellite observations, a common latitude–longitude grid of 0.5° × 0.5° is used and we interpolate the sea-ice concentration (or sea-ice area fraction) from the original model/observation grid onto this common grid. As is done for the observations, the sea-ice extent obtained from the models is then converted to EIE.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, we remove the mean seasonal cycle (the mean EIE on each calendar day of the year) from the model output. Figures 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F1" href="#RSTA20170332F1">1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F2" href="#RSTA20170332F2">2</a> show the mean seasonal cycle for the Arctic sea-ice extent and the EIE for both the AR5 models and the observations. The inter-model variability is remarkable. It is noted in the IPCC report 
  <span class="italic">Evaluation of climate models</span> [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C2">2</a>] that models are tuned to match the observed climate system, which in turn helps to give skilful predictions. However, as is evident in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F2" href="#RSTA20170332F2">figure 2</a>, where although the models may be tuned to match the Arctic sea-ice extent (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F1" href="#RSTA20170332F1">figure 1</a>), if one calculates the EIE from the model output the variation from the observed seasonal cycle is substantial, not only in the magnitude of the mean seasonal cycle, but also in the qualitative shape of the curves. Namely, some models have a 
  <span class="italic">cycloidal structure</span>, with a plateau shaped region in winter and a deep well structure in summer. We emphasize again that the EIE not only mitigates the effects of land on the ice extent, but it also appropriately characterizes regional sea-ice characteristics. Thus, even if a model is able to faithfully reproduce the total ice extent, it is possible that regional differences between the models and the observations are large and summing these acts to minimize these differences [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C20">20</a>], thereby leading to specious conclusions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When viewing a time series as a temporal multifractal, there is no constraint on the number of allowable time scales present within the data. Thus, depending on the temporal resolution of the time series, one can extract all time scales corresponding to the physical processes governing the system. Kantelhardt 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C21">21</a>] developed a multifractal generalization of detrended fluctuation analysis (a modification of the rescaled range method used by Hurst [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C22">22</a>] to study the dynamics of river discharge) called multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). We use a new variant of MF-DFA called multifractal temporally weighted detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-TW-DFA), which exploits the intuition that points closer in time are more likely to be related than points distant in time, providing a clearer signature of long time scales present in a time series [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C23">23</a>]. The detailed algorithm for MF-TW-DFA can be found in ([
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C10">10</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C24">24</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C25">25</a>] and references therein) and this is the approach we use to analyse and compare the EIE (without a seasonal cycle) from AR5 models to that from the satellite observations. Because of the fact that there are no 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> assumptions made regarding the physical processes in the system, this method has also been used to explain the dynamics of Arctic sea-ice velocity fields [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C24">24</a>], and to detect exoplanets [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C25">25</a>] and their atmospheres [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C26">26</a>]. We note again that when the seasonal cycle is not removed from the sea-ice data multifractality is inhibited and hence all the time scales longer than annual are masked, which leads to erroneous interpretation of data or model output as obeying an AR-1 process.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fluctuations in a time series are quantified with respect to a smooth

  </div>For example, in a monofractal time series
