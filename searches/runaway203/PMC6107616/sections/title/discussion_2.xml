 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we compare the fluctuation functions from the AR5 models to the observations. The nature and number of figures are such that the majority of the results are presented in appendix A, and here we summarize the key features, which are (i) large inter-model variability in the crossover time scales extracted from the models, (ii) none of the models exhibit the decadal time scales found in the satellite observations, and (iii) only five (CNRM-CM5, MRI-CGCM3 , MRI-ESM1, FGOALS-g2, MIROC5 (second ensemble member)) of the 21 models exhibit the white noise structure (shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F3" href="#RSTA20170332F3">figure 3</a>) observed in the satellite record on annual to biannual time scales. Additionally, only four models exhibit time scales approaching decadal (7.2 years in BCC1-1, 4.8 years in FGOALS-g2, 7.9 years in NorESM1, 4.5 years in the second ensemble member of NorESM1 and 6 years in GFDL-ESM2G), whereas in all of the other models the longest time scale is of the order a year.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high-frequency processes governing shorter time scales are associated with the influence of synoptic systems, the intermediate time scales are seasonal and the longer—decadal—time scales are generally ascribed to climate processes [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C10">10</a>]. For example, Agarwal &amp; Wettlaufer [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C24">24</a>] demonstrated that on annual–biannual time scales, the sea-ice extent is largely controlled by the wind fields over the Arctic. By comparing the sea-ice volumes from the models with the PIOMAS [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C28">28</a>] dataset, Shu 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C29">29</a>] showed that the sea-ice thickness produced in the CMIP5 models is much less than what is observed. Therefore, although analysis of the Arctic sea-ice velocity fields from the CMIP5 models shows that most models reproduce the statistical characteristics of the observed velocity fields, if the sea ice produced by the models is too thin, the spectrum of its response to wind forcing will change. For example, Colony &amp; Thorndike [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C30">30</a>] showed that local low-frequency ice motion is linearly correlated with local synoptic wind forcing, but the local inertial motion is not, despite a high coherency between the inertial motion of the ice on the same length (approx. 100 km) scales. This highlights the role of mechanical interactions between ice floes on short time scales, which would not be captured in models producing thinner ice.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wang &amp; Overland [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C4">4</a>] analysed the sea-ice extent in the CMIP5 models and concluded that the Arctic would be ice-free in the next 14–36 years with a median of 28 years, based on the model spread. Massonnet 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C31">31</a>] tried to reduce the CMIP5 uncertainty for the Arctic to become ice-free, finding a spread of about 40–60 years. However, the absence of the longer time scales in the models that we have shown here provides a challenge for their predictive capability on decadal time scales. The origin of this lack of parity between satellite observations and the models will of course differ from model to model, but should provide an observational and statistical constraint for model physics, which has evidently not been met by the tuning and parametrization schema used thus far. Indeed, Swart 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C32">32</a>] showed how a deliberately-biased picking of short-term trends to predict the long-term behaviour of sea-ice extent can lead to false conclusions. Similarly, our study demonstrates both quantitatively and qualitatively the reason behind such high inter-model spread on decadal time scales and longer.
