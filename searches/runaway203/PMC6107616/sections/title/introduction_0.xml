 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polar amplification and the ice–albedo feedback focus scientific study on the fluctuations in the areal coverage of high latitude ice. By area, on average the Southern Hemisphere ice cover is dominated by the Antarctic ice sheet, whereas in the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic sea-ice cover dominates. Although we can observe the daily ice cover from space, the substantial changes in Arctic ice mass during recent decades are associated with an ostensibly unmeasurable (approx. 1 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) contribution to the surface energy balance [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C1">1</a>]. Hence, given this sensitivity, developing a quantitative understanding of the fluctuations in sea-ice cover is important. According to the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C2">2</a>], the most reliably measured characteristic of sea ice is the hemispheric sea-ice extent, to which models are tuned and parametrizations refined. To this end, we compare the statistical structure of satellite observations of ice extent to that from model output.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global climate models (GCMs) from the IPCC Assessment Report 5 (AR5) project the Arctic to be ice-free by the middle of this century, whereas the previous assessment projected this to occur at the end of the century. The AR5 models project the Arctic to be ice-free as early as 2030 to as late as 2100 ([
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C3">3</a>], fig. 1 in [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C4">4</a>]). The high inter-model variability and the parametrization schemes and tuning used (e.g. the sea-ice albedo, clouds, convective processes) [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C5">5</a>–
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C9">9</a>] constitute key aspects of their veracity at projecting the state of the ice cover.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify the fluctuations in the ice cover from days to decades we have analysed satellite passive microwave data using a multifractal methodology [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C10">10</a>]. We studied the Arctic equivalent sea-ice extent (EIE), where the EIE is defined as the total surface area, including land, north of the zonal-mean ice edge latitude and thus is proportional to the sine of the ice edge latitude [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C11">11</a>]. (By studying the EIE one minimizes coastal effects.) We find that the EIE is a multifractal in time [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C10">10</a>] and thus cannot be explained as an auto-regressive process with a single time scale (a so-called AR-1 process), as is commonly used to characterize Arctic sea ice in GCMs [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C12">12</a>–
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C14">14</a>]. An AR-1 process is inappropriate because (i) the existence of multiple time scales in the data cannot be treated in a quantitatively consistent manner with a single decay autocorrelation. (ii) The strength of the seasonal cycle is such that, if not appropriately removed, retrievals will always produce a single characteristic time of about a year; a time scale at which all moments converge. Hence, the upper bound on the persistence time in any study that assumes an AR-1 process will inevitably be approximately 1 year, as is indeed found for ice area [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C13">13</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C14">14</a>]. Separate studies with GCMs [
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C15">15</a>–
  <a rid="RSTA20170332C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170332C19">19</a>] also show that an upper bound exists on the predictability for the Arctic sea-ice cover and that predictability is 
  <span class="italic">skilful</span> only on the seasonal time scales. Therefore, our approach highlights the dangers of not carefully detrending the seasonality.
