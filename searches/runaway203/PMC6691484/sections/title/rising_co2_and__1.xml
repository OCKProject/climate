  <sub>2</sub> and photosynthesis
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We know that CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels are rising because our instruments tell us so, but plants directly sense these changes because they interact directly with CO
  <sub>2</sub> in their everyday business. Indeed, the easiest detectable impact on plants grown under high CO
  <sub>2</sub> is positive; an increase in photosynthesis caused by the fact that CO
  <sub>2</sub> is the primary substrate for photosynthetic carbon fixation. Thus, plants artificially exposed to higher CO
  <sub>2</sub> initially tend to photosynthesize faster, but over subsequent hours, months and years they reduce the entry of CO
  <sub>2</sub> into their leaves, restoring a conservative ratio of leaf internal to external CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration (

   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2014
  </a>). This reduced entry to CO
  <sub>2</sub> occurs because plants apparently sense CO
  <sub>2</sub> directly, actively lowering the porosity of their leaves when CO
  <sub>2</sub> rises, limiting the rate of CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake and transpiration in leaves (

   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2016
  </a>). Long-term acclimation to CO
  <sub>2</sub> has thus been linked to an increase in the efficiency of water use in photosynthesis of tree species over the past century (

  <a rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref30">Pe√±uelas

  </a>; 
  <a rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref22">Frank 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2015
  </a>). Such improved conditions for efficient photosynthesis and water use at high atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> in the geological past are believed to have produced negative feedbacks that acted to stabilize atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels over time. Similarly there are signs that this photosynthetic buffering of CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels is also in play under the contemporary anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> perturbation (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Improved photosynthetic conditions constitute a subtle silver lining to the current age of anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> inundation. However, the dark cloud in this modern global CO
  <sub>2</sub> experiment exists in the form of an associated rise in atmospheric temperature. This review will explain why a continuing temperature rise holds potentially catastrophic dangers for plant species in terms of accelerated failure of the plant vascular system during drought. We will discuss the physiology of plant failure, methods of quantifying species vulnerability and the potential to move beyond niche modelling as a means of predicting when, where and which species are in danger of mortality.
