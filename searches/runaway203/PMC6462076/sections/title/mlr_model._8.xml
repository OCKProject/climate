 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We regress lagged solar cycle signals out of annual time series with an MLR model that isolates the linear contribution of four forcings (
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>), namely (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) 11-y solar cycle described by TSI variations filtered out of multidecadal changes, (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) GHG warming described by the CO
  <sub>2</sub> equivalent concentration of all major GHGs, (
  <span class="italic">iii</span>) major volcanic eruptions described by the aerosol optical depth at 550 nm, and (
  <span class="italic">iv</span>) interannual effects of the ENSO phenomenon described by a high-pass filtered (using a Lanczos filter with 8-y cutoff) Niño-3.4 index to account for the ENSO preferred timescale. Time lags in SC signals are inferred by lagging the solar predictor backward/forward in time (−5 to 5 y, step 1 y) with respect to the fitted variable. Lag zero describes changes in phase with SC, whereas delayed signals are indicated in positive lags. The SC regression coefficients are scaled to a 1-W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> increase of TSI that is “typical” for solar cycles in the last 50 y (e.g., solar cycle 22). Residuals are tested for autocorrelation with a Durbin–Watson test postulating zero autocorrelation and when rejected, regression coefficients and SEs are modified following the Cochrane–Orcutt iterative method. The null hypothesis of zero regression coefficients is rejected with 
  <span class="italic">P</span> value &lt; 0.1 using a two-tailed 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test with degrees of freedom 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-K-1, where 
  <span class="italic">N</span> is the length of time series reduced by the K number of regressors plus the intercept. The 
  <span class="italic">P</span> values have been adjusted for the false detection rate following the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Finally, the Ljung–Box test identifies insignificant correlations at higher lags in the areas of interest.
