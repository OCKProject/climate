  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We carry out model simulations with the middle atmosphere version of ECHAM5, as implemented in the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) framework (
   <a rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" href="#r37">37</a>), with and without interactive ocean coupling. An ensemble of six runs (AMIP) from 1940 to 2013 (10-y spin-up) with the atmosphere-only configuration of the model (AGCM) forced only at the lower boundary by the monthly mean AMIP2 SST and sea ice concentrations. All AMIP integrations have been carried out with constant solar irradiance and present-day GHGs, while neglecting volcanic aerosol forcing. Individual model runs branch off from a long control model simulation with climatological boundary. A twin AGCM ensemble of six members (AMIP-ZM) forced at the bottom boundary by zonally averaged AMIP2 SSTs is additionally carried out to isolate the zonally symmetric part of the SST contribution. The AMIP-ZM SSTs is constructed by adding to the monthly climatology (1950–2013) deseasonalized zonal mean SST anomalies. A third ensemble (SOLAR) of four realizations with ECHAM5 interactively coupled to the Max Planck Institute ocean model (MPIOM) is simulated to analyze surface responses to the SC variability specified following the ideal approach of repeating the SC22 (September 1986 to August 1996) 10 times (

   </span>). Total and spectral irradiances for the SC 22 are taken by the Naval Research Laboratory SSI model v1. Ozone is prescribed as a time-independent climatology, and no other external forcing is considered. SOLAR runs have been initiated from a long control coupled atmosphere–ocean simulation with constant forcings. The analysis covers 100 model years following a spin-up period of 25 y (125 y in total). ECHAM5 has a spectral dynamical core with a triangular truncation at wavenumber 42 (T42) and with 47 levels in the vertical up to 0.01 hPa. The MPIOM model is configured in a GR15 grid (∼1.5° horizontal resolution) with 40 depth levels.

Time lags in SC signals are inferred by lagging the solar predictor backward/forward in time (−5 to 5 y, step 1 y) with respect to the fitted variable. Lag zero describes changes in phase with SC, whereas delayed signals are indicated in positive lags. The SC regression coefficients are scaled to a 1-W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> increase of TSI that is “typical” for solar cycles in the last 50 y (e.g., solar cycle 22). Residuals are tested for autocorrelation with a Durbin–Watson test postulating zero autocorrelation and when rejected, regression coefficients and SEs are modified following the Cochrane–Orcutt iterative method. The null hypothesis of zero regression coefficients is rejected with 
   <span class="italic">P</span> value &lt; 0.1 using a two-tailed 
   <span class="italic">t</span> test with degrees of freedom
