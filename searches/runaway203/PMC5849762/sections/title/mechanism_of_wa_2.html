      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When dust is completely removed, annual mean surface temperature over northern Africa,
         Arabia and Iran is increased significantly, by as much as 2.5 °C, and that over the
         tropical North Atlantic is increased by ~0.5 °C for both the MH and EH climate (Fig. 
         <a>2b,c</a>). These regions (focusing on the MH climate first) are under direct effect of dust
         removal, and are warmed mainly by the increased shortwave forcing (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>3a</a>). The longwave forcing at the top of atmosphere (TOA) over these regions is negative
         (i.e. more is going out) but of smaller magnitude (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>). The change of the net radiative fluxes at TOA is decomposed into the instantaneous
         radiative effect of the dust and radiative feedbacks consisting of the water vapor,
         cloud, albedo, and temperature feedbacks
         <span><a>25</a>,
            <a>26</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). The TOA radiative kernels of Shell 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>27</a></span>, created from the NCAR CAM3, are used here. The analyses show that the increased
         shortwave forcing is primarily due to reduced scattering of dust (Fig. 
         <a>3a</a>). Averaged globally, the direct radiative forcing of dust removal for the MH climate
         is 0.68 W m
         <span>−2</span>. This value is similar to total direct forcing (0.60 W m
         <span>−2</span>) for the present-day climate in a more advanced version of CCSM3 that calculates
         the longwave radiative effect of dust, diagnosed by Yoshioka 
         <span>et al</span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The positive feedback due to water vapor, 0.58 W m
         <span>−2</span> (Fig. 
         <a>3b,e</a>), is of almost the same magnitude as the direct forcing of the dust. The response
         of cloud in this model generates a net negative forcing of −0.20 W m
         <span>−2</span> (Fig. 
         <a>3c,f</a>). The change of longwave forcing corresponds well to the change of high cloud, while
         the shortwave forcing corresponds mostly to the change of middle cloud in the tropical
         region and to the change of low cloud in the extratropics (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). The heat transports in the atmosphere and ocean tend to compensate with each other
         in the mid- to high latitude
         <span><a>29</a></span>, but they both transport heat away from the northern tropical region where the most
         of the dust is removed (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). The equivalent radiative forcing of heat transport averaged over the southern hemisphere
         (90–30°S) is 0.23 W m
         <span>−2</span>, much larger than the direct forcing of dust (0.08 W m
         <span>−2</span>) there. This heat transport is mainly achieved by the atmosphere (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>5a</a>). The heat transport enhances sea-ice melting in both polar regions, which induces
         a further positive feedback by reducing surface albedo (Fig. 
         <a>3d</a>). When averaged over the globe, this generates a small positive forcing of 0.06 W m
         <span>−2</span>. The positive forcings above are approximately balanced by the increased emission
         of longwave radiation due to increased surface and air temperature (Fig. 
         <a>3g</a>; see all the numbers in Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). As a result, the global mean surface temperature increases by 0.30 °C. The cooling
         in the Nordic seas (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>) is caused by slight weakening of the Atlantic meridional ocean circulation (AMOC).
         If a slab ocean of 50 m thick instead of a dynamical ocean was used in the model,
         the surface temperature would increase almost everywhere when dust is removed (Supplementary
         Fig. 
         <a>6</a>). The change of global mean surface temperature is 0.31 °C, almost the same as that
         in the coupled model. Therefore, the major role of the ocean dynamics is to distribute
         heat differently, most notably in the northern North Atlantic (compare Supplementary
         Fig. 
         <a>6</a> with Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the EH, removal of dust induced a global warming of 0.23 °C, less than that for
         the MH, mainly due to more negative cloud forcing and smaller water vapor feedback
         (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>7</a>). Because the instantaneous direct forcing of dust is diagnosed to be the same between
         EH and MH (compare Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>7a</a> and Fig. 
         <a>3a</a>), this indicates dependence of dust effect on the background climate state rather
         than on the variation of seasonal insolation.
