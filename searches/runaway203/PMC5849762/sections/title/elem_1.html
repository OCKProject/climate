         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When dust is completely removed, annual mean surface temperature over northern Africa,
            Arabia and Iran is increased significantly, by as much as 2.5 °C, and that over the
            tropical North Atlantic is increased by ~0.5 °C for both the MH and EH climate (Fig. 
            <a>2b,c</a>). These regions (focusing on the MH climate first) are under direct effect of dust
            removal, and are warmed mainly by the increased shortwave forcing (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>3a</a>). The longwave forcing at the top of atmosphere (TOA) over these regions is negative
            (i.e. more is going out) but of smaller magnitude (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>3b</a>). The change of the net radiative fluxes at TOA is decomposed into the instantaneous
            radiative effect of the dust and radiative feedbacks consisting of the water vapor,
            cloud, albedo, and temperature feedbacks
            <span><a>25</a>,
               <a>26</a></span> (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). The TOA radiative kernels of Shell 
            <span>et al</span>.
            <span><a>27</a></span>, created from the NCAR CAM3, are used here. The analyses show that the increased
            shortwave forcing is primarily due to reduced scattering of dust (Fig. 
            <a>3a</a>). Averaged globally, the direct radiative forcing of dust removal for the MH climate
            is 0.68 W m
            <span>−2</span>. This value is similar to total direct forcing (0.60 W m
            <span>−2</span>) for the present-day climate in a more advanced version of CCSM3 that calculates
            the longwave radiative effect of dust, diagnosed by Yoshioka

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The positive feedback due to water vapor, 0.58 W m
            <span>−2</span> (Fig. 
            <a>3b,e</a>), is of almost the same magnitude as the direct forcing of the dust. The response
            of cloud in this model generates a net negative forcing of −0.20 W m
            <span>−2</span> (Fig. 
            <a>3c,f</a>). The change of longwave forcing corresponds well to the change of high cloud, while
            the shortwave forcing corresponds mostly to the change of middle cloud in the tropical
            region and to the change of low cloud in the extratropics (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). The heat transports in the atmosphere and ocean tend to compensate with each other
            in the mid- to high latitude
            <span><a>29</a></span>, but they both transport heat away from the northern tropical region where the most
            of the dust is removed (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>5</a>). The equivalent radiative forcing of heat transport averaged over the southern hemisphere
            (90–30°S) is 0.23 W m
            <span>−2</span>, much larger than the direct forcing of dust (0.08 W m
            <span>−2</span>) there. This heat transport is mainly achieved by the atmosphere (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>5a</a>). The heat transport enhances sea-ice melting in both polar regions, which induces
            a further positive feedback by reducing surface albedo (Fig. 
            <a>3d</a>). When averaged over the globe, this generates a small positive forcing of 0.06 W m
            <span>−2</span>. The positive forcings above are approximately balanced by the increased emission
            of longwave radiation due to increased surface and air temperature (Fig. 
            <a>3g</a>; see all the numbers in Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). As a result, the global mean surface temperature increases by 0.30 °C. The cooling
            in the Nordic seas (Fig. 
            <a>2b</a>) is caused by slight weakening of the Atlantic meridional ocean circulation (AMOC).
            If a slab ocean of 50 m thick instead of a dynamical ocean was used in the model,
            the surface temperature would increase almost everywhere when dust is removed (Supplementary
            Fig. 
            <a>6</a>). The change of global mean surface temperature is 0.31 °C, almost the same as that
            in the coupled model. Therefore, the major role of the ocean dynamics is to distribute
            heat differently, most notably in the northern North Atlantic (compare Supplementary
            Fig. 
            <a>6</a> with Fig. 
            <a>2b</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the EH, removal of dust induced a global warming of 0.23 °C, less than that for
            the MH, mainly due to more negative cloud forcing and smaller water vapor feedback
            (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>7</a>). Because the instantaneous direct forcing of dust is diagnosed to be the same between
            EH and MH (compare Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>7a</a> and Fig. 
            <a>3a</a>), this indicates dependence of dust effect on the background climate state rather
            than on the variation of seasonal insolation.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Towards reconciling model-data discrepancy</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model derived warming due to dust removal can be used to estimate the potential
            contribution of the dust effect on model-data discrepancy. In particular, since the
            model employed here is the same as that used in the CCSM3 transient simulation in
            Liu 
            <span>et al</span>.
            <span><a>2</a></span>, our results can be considered as a direct correction to the CCSM3 transient simulation
            there with the dust effect. Our model estimation indicates that the model-data discrepancy
            may be significantly reduced had the reduction of dust emission during AHP been considered
            in their simulations. For the extreme case of a complete removal of dust, the increase
            of MH annual temperature (seasonally-biased site stack) is 0.10 °C (0.26 °C), 0.33 °C
            (0.32 °C) and 0.15 °C (0.15 °C) averaged over the northern hemisphere (30–90°N), tropics
            (30°S–30°N) and southern hemisphere (90–30°S), respectively. This magnitude of warming
            almost compensates the model discrepancy at 6ka, if the summer bias on proxy data
            is considered, for the northern hemisphere and tropics, and in turn global mean (red
            stars, Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). The improvement in the southern hemisphere, where the model-observation discrepancy
            could not be explained by seasonal bias of the proxy data at all, is also obvious,
            although the data-model discrepancy remains large (Fig. 
            <a>1d</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the EH, the model-data discrepancy is similarly reduced in terms of global mean
            when dust is removed (Fig. 
            <a>1</a> and Supplementary Table 
            <a>1</a>). Regionally, the temperature over the tropical region is over-corrected (Fig. 
            <a>1c</a>), while the southern hemisphere under-corrected (Fig. 
            <a>1d</a>). However, the snapshot simulation for the early Holocene done here may be less appropriate
            than for the mid Holocene because the climate has significant transient evolution
            during the early Holocene (black lines in Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). The response of southern ocean to dust reduction in a transient simulation may
            differ from that simulated here; it may transport more heat to the polar region when
            dust is removed, rather than less heat as simulated here (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>5b</a>). Of course the large model-data discrepancy in the southern ocean (Fig. 
            <a>1d</a>) could as well be due to insufficient knowledge about the evolution of the Antarctic
            ice sheet during the last deglaciation; the freshwater forcing in the southern hemisphere
            applied in the CCSM3 simulation of Liu 
            <span>et al</span>.
            <span><a>2</a></span> (see Fig. 25a of He
            <span><a>30</a></span>) is much different from the time series of iceberg discharge from Weddell Sea reconstructed
            more recently
            <span><a>31</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change of global-mean annual surface temperature is smaller when only a fraction
            of dust loading is removed. It increases linearly by 0.030 °C (0.023 °C) per 10 percent
            of dust removal with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 (0.99) for the MH (EH) (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). The site-stacked global-mean temperature also scales linearly because the patterns
            of temperature change are similar for different dust reductions (not shown). Therefore,
            if the dust loading in the atmosphere was reduced by ~60% as estimated in ref.
            <span><a>18</a></span> (see the Introduction section) instead of 100%, during the AHP, the global-mean surface
            temperature increases by 0.18 °C (0.17 °C for the seasonally-biased site-stack). The
            warming effect for the 50% dust reduction in the MH appears anomalous because it is
            the only experiment that deviates from the overall linear relationship in both MH
            and EH (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). Because of this, an additional CCSM3 simulation was carried out to determine the
            warming effect of a 60% dust reduction more precisely, which gave a result of 0.14 °C.
            The ensemble mean of PMIP2 and PMIP3 snapshot experiments produced an MH climate that
            is 0.16 °C (seasonally-biased site-stack) warmer than the PI (the red pentacle in
            Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). If we take the model-data discrepancy to be 0.50–0.16 = 0.34 °C, a 60% reduction
            of dust loading can therefore still account for about half of the remaining model-data
            discrepancy.
