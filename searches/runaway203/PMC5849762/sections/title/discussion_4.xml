 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that the Holocene conundrum can be contributed significantly by biases in both data and model. Some temperature proxies have summer biases, while the models may have neglected the reduced mineral dust in the early to mid-Holocene. Our study remains preliminary. One large uncertainty in our study is the neglect of the indirect radiative effect of mineral dust aerosol. Part of the reason we didn’t include this is that the indirect effect has a very large uncertainty in current estimations

  </span>. Nevertheless, if we use an additional warming effect of 0.30 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> (the difference in Net Effective Radiative Forcing between the two LD cases in Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> of Sagoo and Storelvmo
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>) due to indirect dust radiative forcing for a 90% reduction of dust loading (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> of Sagoo and Storelvmo
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>), and assume it scales linearly with different fractions of dust reduction, the MH climate could warm by an additional 0.09 °C with a 60% dust reduction. This number is obtained based on the assumption that a 0.68 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> forcing causes a global warming of 0.3 °C as described above. Therefore, the total warming would be 0.27 °C (or 0.23 °C if the more precise value for the 60% dust reduction is used, see the paragraph above) even with a 60% reduction of dust. Note that the estimated dust indirect radiative effect in Sagoo and Storelvmo
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span> extends in a certain range, which is attributed to the subtleties in ice cloud formation scheme and cloud feedbacks on climate in the global model (e.g., Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a> of Sagoo and Storelvmo
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>). The effect is too complicated to discuss here, but is of significance for future studies.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, for clarity, we only focused on the dust effect alone; the change of vegetation and lake levels are not considered. In experiments in which the North Africa is changed to grassland, the change of global-mean surface temperature of MH (EH) due to complete removal of dust is 0.26 °C (0.23 °C), almost the same as in the dust-only experiments described above, with also similar response pattern (see Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). Therefore, the vegetation effect itself appears to be not significant relative to the associated dust effect in this model.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, models have biases and uncertainties, and uncertainty in the radiative effect of dust is not small
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Especially, a recent study argued that the direct radiative forcing of dust should be lower than previously expected
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. But it is possible that their results were biased due to their assumptions of spherical shape, constant mixing state and optical properties of dust
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Therefore, much work is awaited to determine the radiative effect of dust. A multi-model experiments will also be needed in the future to assess the robustness of the dust effect on the HTM climate. Overall, our study highlights the dust effect as a potentially important factor for understanding climate changes in the past and future. The identification of the model-data discrepancy is improving our understanding of both the model and data.
