  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When dust is completely removed, annual mean surface temperature over northern Africa, Arabia and Iran is increased significantly, by as much as 2.5 °C, and that over the tropical North Atlantic is increased by ~0.5 °C for both the MH and EH climate (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b,c</a>). These regions (focusing on the MH climate first) are under direct effect of dust removal, and are warmed mainly by the increased shortwave forcing (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3a</a>). The longwave forcing at the top of atmosphere (TOA) over these regions is negative (i.e. more is going out) but of smaller magnitude (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3b</a>). The change of the net radiative fluxes at TOA is decomposed into the instantaneous radiative effect of the dust and radiative feedbacks consisting of the water vapor, cloud, albedo, and temperature feedbacks

   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). Averaged globally, the direct radiative forcing of dust removal for the MH climate is 0.68 W m

   <span class="sup">−2</span>) for the present-day climate in a more advanced version of CCSM3 that calculates the longwave radiative effect of dust, diagnosed by Yoshioka

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The positive feedback due to water vapor, 0.58 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,e</a>), is of almost the same magnitude as the direct forcing of the dust. The response of cloud in this model generates a net negative forcing of −0.20 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c,f</a>). The change of longwave forcing corresponds well to the change of high cloud, while the shortwave forcing corresponds mostly to the change of middle cloud in the tropical region and to the change of low cloud in the extratropics (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). The heat transports in the atmosphere and ocean tend to compensate with each other in the mid- to high latitude
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
   </span>, but they both transport heat away from the northern tropical region where the most of the dust is removed (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The equivalent radiative forcing of heat transport averaged over the southern hemisphere (90–30°S) is 0.23 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, much larger than the direct forcing of dust (0.08 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>) there. This heat transport is mainly achieved by the atmosphere (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5a</a>). The heat transport enhances sea-ice melting in both polar regions, which induces a further positive feedback by reducing surface albedo (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). When averaged over the globe, this generates a small positive forcing of 0.06 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>. The positive forcings above are approximately balanced by the increased emission of longwave radiation due to increased surface and air temperature (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3g</a>; see all the numbers in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). As a result, the global mean surface temperature increases by 0.30 °C. The cooling in the Nordic seas (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) is caused by slight weakening of the Atlantic meridional ocean circulation (AMOC). If a slab ocean of 50 m thick instead of a dynamical ocean was used in the model, the surface temperature would increase almost everywhere when dust is removed (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). The change of global mean surface temperature is 0.31 °C, almost the same as that in the coupled model. Therefore, the major role of the ocean dynamics is to distribute heat differently, most notably in the northern North Atlantic (compare Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a> with Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the EH, removal of dust induced a global warming of 0.23 °C, less than that for the MH, mainly due to more negative cloud forcing and smaller water vapor feedback (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). Because the instantaneous direct forcing of dust is diagnosed to be the same between EH and MH (compare Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7a</a> and Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), this indicates dependence of dust effect on the background climate state rather than on the variation of seasonal insolation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Towards reconciling model-data discrepancy</div>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model derived warming due to dust removal can be used to estimate the potential contribution of the dust effect on model-data discrepancy. In particular, since the model employed here is the same as that used in the CCSM3 transient simulation in Liu 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span>, our results can be considered as a direct correction to the CCSM3 transient simulation there with the dust effect. Our model estimation indicates that the model-data discrepancy may be significantly reduced had the reduction of dust emission during AHP been considered in their simulations. For the extreme case of a complete removal of dust, the increase of MH annual temperature (seasonally-biased site stack) is 0.10 °C (0.26 °C), 0.33 °C (0.32 °C) and 0.15 °C (0.15 °C) averaged over the northern hemisphere (30–90°N), tropics (30°S–30°N) and southern hemisphere (90–30°S), respectively. This magnitude of warming almost compensates the model discrepancy at 6ka, if the summer bias on proxy data is considered, for the northern hemisphere and tropics, and in turn global mean (red stars, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The improvement in the southern hemisphere, where the model-observation discrepancy could not be explained by seasonal bias of the proxy data at all, is also obvious, although the data-model discrepancy remains large (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the EH, the model-data discrepancy is similarly reduced in terms of global mean when dust is removed (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Regionally, the temperature over the tropical region is over-corrected (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), while the southern hemisphere under-corrected (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>). However, the snapshot simulation for the early Holocene done here may be less appropriate than for the mid Holocene because the climate has significant transient evolution during the early Holocene (black lines in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The response of southern ocean to dust reduction in a transient simulation may differ from that simulated here; it may transport more heat to the polar region when dust is removed, rather than less heat as simulated here (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5b</a>). Of course the large model-data discrepancy in the southern ocean (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>) could as well be due to insufficient knowledge about the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet during the last deglaciation; the freshwater forcing in the southern hemisphere applied in the CCSM3 simulation of Liu 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change of global-mean annual surface temperature is smaller when only a fraction of dust loading is removed. It increases linearly by 0.030 °C (0.023 °C) per 10 percent of dust removal with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 (0.99) for the MH (EH) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The site-stacked global-mean temperature also scales linearly because the patterns of temperature change are similar for different dust reductions (not shown). Therefore, if the dust loading in the atmosphere was reduced by ~60% as estimated in ref.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span> (see the Introduction section) instead of 100%, during the AHP, the global-mean surface temperature increases by 0.18 °C (0.17 °C for the seasonally-biased site-stack). The warming effect for the 50% dust reduction in the MH appears anomalous because it is the only experiment that deviates from the overall linear relationship in both MH and EH (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Because of this, an additional CCSM3 simulation was carried out to determine the warming effect of a 60% dust reduction more precisely, which gave a result of 0.14 °C. The ensemble mean of PMIP2 and PMIP3 snapshot experiments produced an MH climate that is 0.16 °C (seasonally-biased site-stack) warmer than the PI (the red pentacle in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). If we take the model-data discrepancy to be 0.50–0.16 = 0.34 °C, a 60% reduction of dust loading can therefore still account for about half of the remaining model-data discrepancy.
