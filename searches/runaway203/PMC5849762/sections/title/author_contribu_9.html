      <p>Y.L. and Z.L. designed the study. M.Z. and Y.L. carried out all the simulations and
         did most of the analyses. Y.X. and Y.H did the analyses on radiative feedbacks. J.Z.
         helped calculating the biased stack and making FigureÂ 1. Y.L. and Z.L. wrote the paper
         with input from all authors, especially Y.P. on the radiative effect of dust.
