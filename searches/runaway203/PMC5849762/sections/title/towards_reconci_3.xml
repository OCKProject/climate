 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model derived warming due to dust removal can be used to estimate the potential contribution of the dust effect on model-data discrepancy. In particular, since the model employed here is the same as that used in the CCSM3 transient simulation in Liu 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>, our results can be considered as a direct correction to the CCSM3 transient simulation there with the dust effect. Our model estimation indicates that the model-data discrepancy may be significantly reduced had the reduction of dust emission during AHP been considered in their simulations. For the extreme case of a complete removal of dust, the increase of MH annual temperature (seasonally-biased site stack) is 0.10 °C (0.26 °C), 0.33 °C (0.32 °C) and 0.15 °C (0.15 °C) averaged over the northern hemisphere (30–90°N), tropics (30°S–30°N) and southern hemisphere (90–30°S), respectively. This magnitude of warming almost compensates the model discrepancy at 6ka, if the summer bias on proxy data is considered, for the northern hemisphere and tropics, and in turn global mean (red stars, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The improvement in the southern hemisphere, where the model-observation discrepancy could not be explained by seasonal bias of the proxy data at all, is also obvious, although the data-model discrepancy remains large (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the EH, the model-data discrepancy is similarly reduced in terms of global mean when dust is removed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Regionally, the temperature over the tropical region is over-corrected (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), while the southern hemisphere under-corrected (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>). However, the snapshot simulation for the early Holocene done here may be less appropriate than for the mid Holocene because the climate has significant transient evolution during the early Holocene (black lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The response of southern ocean to dust reduction in a transient simulation may differ from that simulated here; it may transport more heat to the polar region when dust is removed, rather than less heat as simulated here (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5b</a>). Of course the large model-data discrepancy in the southern ocean (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>) could as well be due to insufficient knowledge about the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet during the last deglaciation; the freshwater forcing in the southern hemisphere applied in the CCSM3 simulation of Liu 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change of global-mean annual surface temperature is smaller when only a fraction of dust loading is removed. It increases linearly by 0.030 °C (0.023 °C) per 10 percent of dust removal with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 (0.99) for the MH (EH) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The site-stacked global-mean temperature also scales linearly because the patterns of temperature change are similar for different dust reductions (not shown). Therefore, if the dust loading in the atmosphere was reduced by ~60% as estimated in ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> (see the Introduction section) instead of 100%, during the AHP, the global-mean surface temperature increases by 0.18 °C (0.17 °C for the seasonally-biased site-stack). The warming effect for the 50% dust reduction in the MH appears anomalous because it is the only experiment that deviates from the overall linear relationship in both MH and EH (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Because of this, an additional CCSM3 simulation was carried out to determine the warming effect of a 60% dust reduction more precisely, which gave a result of 0.14 °C. The ensemble mean of PMIP2 and PMIP3 snapshot experiments produced an MH climate that is 0.16 °C (seasonally-biased site-stack) warmer than the PI (the red pentacle in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). If we take the model-data discrepancy to be 0.50–0.16 = 0.34 °C, a 60% reduction of dust loading can therefore still account for about half of the remaining model-data discrepancy.
