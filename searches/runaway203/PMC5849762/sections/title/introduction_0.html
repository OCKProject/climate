      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent reconstruction of global annual mean surface temperature in the Holocene
         shows a cooling trend from the peak warming of ~0.5 °C in the Holocene Thermal Maximum
         (HTM) (~10–6 thousand years ago; ~10–6 ka) towards the pre-industrial (PI)
         <span><a>1</a></span>. This cooling trend is opposite to current transient climate simulations, which show
         a robust warming trend forced mainly by the retreat of the residual ice sheet and
         the increase of greenhouse gases (GHG)
         <span><a>2</a></span>. Moreover, snapshot experiments of the 6 ka climate by 31 atmosphere-ocean general
         circulation models (AOGCMs) participated in the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison
         Project phase II (PMIP2) and phase III (PMIP3) mostly produced a cooler or negligibly
         warmer climate than the PI (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). The cause of this apparent model-data inconsistency, termed the Holocene temperature
         conundrum
         <span><a>2</a></span>, has remained elusive. Here, we propose that the neglect of mineral dust response
         in climate models could contribute significantly to this discrepancy. Using a climate
         model, we show that the reduced atmospheric dust loading, which can be generated mainly
         by an enhanced monsoon and in turn vegetation cover in the North Africa during the
         mid-Holocene, could generate a global annual mean warming up to 0.3 °C. This model
         bias, when combined with the potential seasonal bias of the proxy record, can reduce
         the model-data discrepancy significantly.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been suggested that one potential cause of the model-data discrepancy is the
         summer bias in some temperature proxies
         <span><a>3</a></span>. This bias can contribute to a warming in HTM period due to the increased summer
         insolation in the Northern Hemisphere
         <span><a>2</a></span>. Taking into account of the summer bias in proxy records, transient climate modeling
         can indeed generate a global cooling trend as in the reconstruction, especially in
         the Northern Hemisphere (red lines in Fig. 
         <a>1a,b</a>). However, summer bias in the proxy data cannot account for all the discrepancies.
         First, even with this summer bias, models still underestimate the warming during the
         HTM period, both in the transient simulations (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>) and in the snapshot simulations of PMIP models (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>). Second, summer bias cannot explain the observed warming in the Southern Hemisphere
         (Fig. 
         <a>1d</a>). Indeed, an austral summer bias would lead to a cooling in the HTM period in the
         SH because of the reduced summer insolation there, leading to an even greater model-data
         discrepancy. It should also be noted that, since most of the data here
         <span><a>1</a></span> are reconstructions of the sea surface temeprtures, the model-data discrepancy over
         the proxy sites can’t be reconciled as in the land-based proxy reconstruction from
         North America and Europe
         <span><a>4</a></span>. Therefore, additional mechanisms are needed to reconcile the model-data discrepancy.
         One potential mechanism is the model bias associated with the changing mineral dust,
         which has been neglected in previous transient model simulations that were used in
         the study of the Holocene conundrum

                  (black and red curves). The simulation results shown here are the ensemble mean of
                  three models: CCSM3, LOVECLIM and FAMOUS, with both the site-stacked annual mean (black)
                  and site-stacked seasonally biased (red). (

                  mean, and Southern Hemisphere (90–30° S) mean, respectively. The reference climate
                  is the average between 1.5 ka and 0.5 ka. The change of surface temperature due to
                  dust removal at 6 ka and 9 ka are indicated by pentacles.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the HTM period, the stronger boreal summer insolation leads to a significant enhancement
         of monsoon and, in turn, vegetation cover in the Northern Hemisphere
         <span><a>5</a>,
            <a>6</a></span>. Especially over North Africa, during the African Humid Period (AHP; 14.8–5.5 ka)
         <span><a>7</a>–
            <a>10</a></span>, shrub and grassland expanded greatly over the Saharan desert
         <span><a>11</a>,
            <a>12</a></span>, which should lead to a great reduction of dust emission and, in turn, dust loading
         in the atmosphere.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marine sediment records along the northwest African coast in the Atlantic all show
         substantial decrease of dust output from Africa during AHP
         <span><a>13</a>–
            <a>16</a></span>. A few modeling studies have attempted to simulate the dust cycles during the mid-Holocene
         using general circulation models
         <span><a>17</a>–
            <a>20</a></span>. There is still large uncertainty in modeling the dust cycle
         <span><a>21</a></span>. For example, the global dust loading at 6 ka simulated by Albani 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>17</a></span> using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) was only ~25% weaker than that during
         the preindustrial, although it has been recognized that this dust emission from the
         North Africa seems to be overestimated compared to sedimentary records
         <span><a>17</a></span>. The dust deposition flux simulated by Egerer 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>18</a></span> seemed to fit the sedimentary cores well, their study suggested that the dust emission
         flux from North Africa during mid-Holocene was 27% of the preindustrial and the global
         dust loading was ~38% of the preindustrial.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate modeling indicates that the Atlantic ocean temperature is sensitive to local
         change of dust aerosol, and dust reduction may be able to explain 69% of the upward
         trend observed between 1982–2007
         <span><a>22</a></span>. By reducing the dust loading over tropical North Atlantic region by 50% (while keeping
         the loading elsewhere), Williams 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>15</a></span> showed that the same region would warm by a fraction of a degree under present-day
         climate condition. There have also been studies on the dust effect in the Holocene,
         mostly on the regional response in African monsoon and nearby region monsoon
         <span><a>23</a></span> or ENSO
         <span><a>24</a></span>. There has, however, been no systematic study on the effect of dust reduction on
         global surface temperature in the Holocene.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we use a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, CCSM3, to
         test the influence of dust reduction on the early Holocene (9 ka; EH) and mid-Holocene
         (6 ka; MH) climate. The atmospheric dust loading is reduced by different amounts in
         a series of simulations. The model version and resolution are chosen to be the same
         as that used by Liu 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>2</a></span> in simulating the transient climate evolution from LGM to PI. Therefore, the response
         of global surface temperature to dust reduction obtained here may serve as a correction
         to that obtained in Liu 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>2</a></span>, to see whether it helps to resolve the Holocene temperature conundrum.
