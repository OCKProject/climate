 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When dust is completely removed, annual mean surface temperature over northern Africa, Arabia and Iran is increased significantly, by as much as 2.5 °C, and that over the tropical North Atlantic is increased by ~0.5 °C for both the MH and EH climate (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b,c</a>). These regions (focusing on the MH climate first) are under direct effect of dust removal, and are warmed mainly by the increased shortwave forcing (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3a</a>). The longwave forcing at the top of atmosphere (TOA) over these regions is negative (i.e. more is going out) but of smaller magnitude (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3b</a>). The change of the net radiative fluxes at TOA is decomposed into the instantaneous radiative effect of the dust and radiative feedbacks consisting of the water vapor, cloud, albedo, and temperature feedbacks

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). Averaged globally, the direct radiative forcing of dust removal for the MH climate is 0.68 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. This value is similar to total direct forcing (0.60 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) for the present-day climate in a more advanced version of CCSM3 that calculates the longwave radiative effect of dust, diagnosed by Yoshioka 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The positive feedback due to water vapor, 0.58 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,e</a>), is of almost the same magnitude as the direct forcing of the dust. The response of cloud in this model generates a net negative forcing of −0.20 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c,f</a>). The change of longwave forcing corresponds well to the change of high cloud, while the shortwave forcing corresponds mostly to the change of middle cloud in the tropical region and to the change of low cloud in the extratropics (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). The heat transports in the atmosphere and ocean tend to compensate with each other in the mid- to high latitude
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>, but they both transport heat away from the northern tropical region where the most of the dust is removed (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The equivalent radiative forcing of heat transport averaged over the southern hemisphere (90–30°S) is 0.23 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, much larger than the direct forcing of dust (0.08 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) there. This heat transport is mainly achieved by the atmosphere (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5a</a>). The heat transport enhances sea-ice melting in both polar regions, which induces a further positive feedback by reducing surface albedo (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). When averaged over the globe, this generates a small positive forcing of 0.06 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. The positive forcings above are approximately balanced by the increased emission of longwave radiation due to increased surface and air temperature (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3g</a>; see all the numbers in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). As a result, the global mean surface temperature increases by 0.30 °C. The cooling in the Nordic seas (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) is caused by slight weakening of the Atlantic meridional ocean circulation (AMOC). If a slab ocean of 50 m thick instead of a dynamical ocean was used in the model, the surface temperature would increase almost everywhere when dust is removed (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). The change of global mean surface temperature is 0.31 °C, almost the same as that in the coupled model. Therefore, the major role of the ocean dynamics is to distribute heat differently, most notably in the northern North Atlantic (compare Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a> with Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the EH, removal of dust induced a global warming of 0.23 °C, less than that for the MH, mainly due to more negative cloud forcing and smaller water vapor feedback (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). Because the instantaneous direct forcing of dust is diagnosed to be the same between EH and MH (compare Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7a</a> and Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), this indicates dependence of dust effect on the background climate state rather than on the variation of seasonal insolation.
