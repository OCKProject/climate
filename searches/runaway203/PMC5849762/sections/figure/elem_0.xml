The simulation results shown here are the ensemble mean of three models: CCSM3, LOVECLIM and FAMOUS, with both the site-stacked annual mean (black) and site-stacked seasonally biased (red). (
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">d</span>) are the global mean, Northern Hemisphere (30–90° N) mean, tropical (30° S–30° N) mean, and Southern Hemisphere (90–30° S) mean, respectively. The reference climate is the average between 1.5 ka and 0.5 ka. The change of surface temperature due to dust removal at 6 ka and 9 ka are indicated by pentacles.
