            <span><a>1</a></span> and similarly stacked global and regional mean temperatures from transient simulations
            (black and red curves). The simulation results shown here are the ensemble mean of
            three models: CCSM3, LOVECLIM and FAMOUS, with both the site-stacked annual mean (black)
            and site-stacked seasonally biased (red). (
            <span>a</span>–
            <span>d</span>) are the global mean, Northern Hemisphere (30–90° N) mean, tropical (30° S–30° N)
            mean, and Southern Hemisphere (90–30° S) mean, respectively. The reference climate
            is the average between 1.5 ka and 0.5 ka. The change of surface temperature due to
            dust removal at 6 ka and 9 ka are indicated by pentacles.
