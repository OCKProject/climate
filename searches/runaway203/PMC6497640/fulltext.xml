For perspective, the 2018 forcing was 3.6 times the annual energy output of the Grand Coulee Dam (the largest energy producing dam in the U.S.), and sufficient energy to melt 1.4 billion m<sup>3</sup> (1.1 million acre-feet) of ripe (i.e., isothermal at 0&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) snowpack. Since 1984, however, 56% of forest area burned in the western seasonal snow zone occurred in the Columbia River Basin, the largest river by volume flowing into the Pacific Ocean from the western hemisphere, and the fourth largest river by volume in the U.S.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Total daily 2018 post-fire radiative forcing on January 15 across the Columbia River Basin alone was sufficient to melt 0.82 billion m<sup>3</sup> (0.66 million acre-feet) of ripe snowpack, equivalent to 213% of the daily discharge on 15 January or 0.35% of annual Columbia River discharge (average discharge at Vancouver, WA from 2007 to 2017). Although substantial, these estimates of total post-fire radiative forcing on snow are conservative because they were calculated on January 15 to correspond with maximum snow-cover extent but when insolation is low.

Within the perimeters of burned areas, we evaluated changes in burned forested area in the seasonal snow zone. Forested area was defined by tree density &#x0003e;20% in the LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC) product<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The seasonal snow zone was determined using the MOD10A1 8-day snow-covered area product from MODIS as regions where snow was present in &#x0003e;25% of images centered on January 15 (2000&#x02013;2017)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">We evaluated the difference in SDD before and after forest fire for all forests burned between 2004 to 2010 in the western seasonal snow zone included in the MTBS database.

To account for year-to-year changes in SDD resulting from meteorologic and geographic variability, we compared the SDD in forested areas inside each burn perimeter (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;841) with that in a surrounding 2&#x02009;km buffer. This difference in burned and unburned SDD (dSDD) was computed from 2000 to 2016 for all areas that burned between 2004 and 2010 to obtain at least five pre- and post-fire years. The pre-fire average dSDD was subtracted from each annual value to determine the change in dSDD before and after fire (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To account for inter-annual variability in forest cover, climate, and snowfall as well as satellite retrievals, we compared snowmelt in the burned forest to the surrounding unburned forest for 10 years of pre-fire conditions and found essentially no difference. This suggests that this approach to determining changes in SDD was valid, although we acknowledge potential biases in estimating snow cover from satellite imagery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

We made the spectral albedo measurements relative to a Spectralon&#x000ae; white reference target for every 10&#x02009;cm section of each snow sample.

SNICAR uses a two-stream radiative transfer solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> to calculate snow albedo with known concentrations of BC and dust, snow-grain size, and incident-solar-flux characteristics. To isolate the impacts of LAI variability on radiative forcing from geographic location (e.g., slope, aspect, and latitude), we calculated the snow albedo for LAI-impacted and pristine snow using consistent parameters in SNICAR (i.e., direct radiation, effective grain size of 1500&#x02009;&#x000b5;m, snowpack density of 300&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, average solar conditions for 15 January at 40&#x000b0;N latitude, including 4.225&#x02009;MW&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> per day, solar zenith angle of 61&#x000b0;). The largest snow-grain size in SNICAR was selected to represent the isothermal at 0&#x02009;&#x000b0;C snowpack consistent with field observations. We used optical parameters for hydrophobic BC in SNICAR based on the assumption that the BC was relatively recently emitted and deposited within or a short distance from the burned forest. Because the radiative properties of larger LAI particles (e.g., micro-charcoal, burned woody debris) are not well understood and therefore not included in the SNICAR model, we also used direct spectral albedo measurements to estimate radiative forcing on snow.</p><p id="Par20">Post-fire radiative forcing was calculated as the modeled difference in net snowpack shortwave radiation between the dirty (LAI-impacted) snow albedo values (both SNICAR-modeled and directly measured) and an equivalent clean snow albedo (with background levels of LAI concentrations). Background BC concentrations of 1&#x02009;ng&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> used in clean snow scenarios were derived from BC measurements in snow from the oldest (15-year old) fire, and were similar to pre-industrial background levels of BC in snow measured in ice dated from 1750 to 1850 from the Upper Fremont Glacier, Wyoming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. No background dust concentration was used in the clean snow scenarios because of the broad spatial variability in dust and that dust concentrations at each site were assumed to be unaffected by fire. A burned forest canopy with full snow surface irradiance was used for the LAI-impacted simulations. For the pristine snow simulations, we used an unburned forest canopy with a 60% reduction from full snow surface irradiance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Post-fire radiative forcing on snow coefficients were developed using a logistical regression of the SNICAR-modeled and measured albedo, and associated post-fire radiative forcing values during the 15 years following fire.
