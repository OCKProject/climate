  <p>Total daily post-fire radiative forcing on snow (PFRFS) in the western U.S. for 15 January 2018 based on measured albedo values from 2017 chronosequence of burned forests, and change from 1999 through 2018 based on SNICAR-modeled (red dots) and measured (red stars) albedo values (inset). A 372% (modeled) to 443% (measured) increase in post-fire radiative forcing on snow occurred since 1999, and currently over 11% of all forests in the seasonal snow zone are experiencing enhanced radiative forcing due to forest fire occurrence within the last 15 years</p>
