  <p>Locations of forest fires in the western seasonal snow zone (SSZ) and total area burned (inset) from 1984 to 2017. Area burned determined from Landsat imagery has increased at an average rate of up to 9% per year in recent decades as a result of climate warming and a legacy of fire suppression. Also shown are 2017 snow sample collection sites located in seven recently burned forests (burned 1â€“15 years prior to snow sampling)</p>
