  </span> to calculate snow albedo with known concentrations of BC and dust, snow-grain size, and incident-solar-flux characteristics. To isolate the impacts of LAI variability on radiative forcing from geographic location (e.g., slope, aspect, and latitude), we calculated the snow albedo for LAI-impacted and pristine snow using consistent parameters in SNICAR (i.e., direct radiation, effective grain size of 1500 µm, snowpack density of 300 kg m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, average solar conditions for 15 January at 40°N latitude, including 4.225 MW m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> per day, solar zenith angle of 61°). The largest snow-grain size in SNICAR was selected to represent the isothermal at 0 °C snowpack consistent with field observations. We used optical parameters for hydrophobic BC in SNICAR based on the assumption that the BC was relatively recently emitted and deposited within or a short distance from the burned forest. Because the radiative properties of larger LAI particles (e.g., micro-charcoal, burned woody debris) are not well understood and therefore not included in the SNICAR model, we also used direct spectral albedo measurements to estimate radiative forcing on snow.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Post-fire radiative forcing was calculated as the modeled difference in net snowpack shortwave radiation between the dirty (LAI-impacted) snow albedo values (both SNICAR-modeled and directly measured) and an equivalent clean snow albedo (with background levels of LAI concentrations). Background BC concentrations of 1 ng g
  <span class="sup">−1</span> used in clean snow scenarios were derived from BC measurements in snow from the oldest (15-year old) fire, and were similar to pre-industrial background levels of BC in snow measured in ice dated from 1750 to 1850 from the Upper Fremont Glacier, Wyoming
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. No background dust concentration was used in the clean snow scenarios because of the broad spatial variability in dust and that dust concentrations at each site were assumed to be unaffected by fire. A burned forest canopy with full snow surface irradiance was used for the LAI-impacted simulations. For the pristine snow simulations, we used an unburned forest canopy with a 60% reduction from full snow surface irradiance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. We assumed that the increase in incoming solar radiation as a result of the more open canopy was constant throughout the 15-year period of our analysis.
