  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>, with mountain snowpacks serving as water reservoirs that recharge aquifers and sustain streamflow into drier summer months

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Snow is a particularly important water resource in the Intermountain West where 50–70% of precipitation is seasonally stored as snowpack. Rising air temperatures have reduced recent snowpack volume and associated seasonal snow-water storage, resulting in accelerated snowmelt and earlier springtime meltwater release

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>, which ultimately threatens the timing and volume of downstream water resource availability

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Earlier snowmelt extends the growing season resulting in amplified late summer drought
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>, reduces forest productivity limiting carbon sequestration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, and shifts phenological synchronicity with impacts to the reproductive success of many plants, pollinators, birds, and fish

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Another consequence of climate warming and earlier snowmelt has been an increase in forest fire intensity, duration, extent, and frequency

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>, with total area burned likely to continue increasing across the West

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. The headwater regions of the Rocky Mountains are especially vulnerable, with an anticipated 300–700% increase in burned area for every 1 °C increase in global average temperature

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The vast majority of western forest fires occur in the seasonal snow zone, and such fires result in spatial and temporal changes in snow accumulation, ablation, and melt
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Removal of the canopy by fire results in reduced interception and enhanced snow accumulation

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>, but the more open canopy also results in more incident sunlight on the snowpack surface
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>, as well as changes in longwave radiation and turbulent energy fluxes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. In addition, increased deposition of light absorbing impurities (LAI) from the charred canopy results in reduced snow albedo
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. As a result of these changes collectively referred to here as post-fire radiative forcing on snow, forest fires lead to mid-winter loss of snowpack volume
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>, accelerated snowmelt, and earlier snowpack disappearance

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The magnitude and persistence of LAI-related albedo changes, as well as their associated radiative impacts on snow-water resources over broad scales, are presented in the current study. The extent of burned forests in the seasonal snow zone has dramatically increased across the West. While in these burned forests, 5 day earlier snow disappearance persists for &gt;10 years following fire. Fire-related impurities, specifically black carbon and burned woody debris, darkens snowpack and lowers snow albedo for 15 winters following fire. A four-fold increase in the solar forcing on snow in western burned forests occurred from 1999 to 2018. Future increases in forest fires under a warming climate and associated radiative forcing potentially will have vast implications for the volume and timing of western streamflow and therefore water resource management
