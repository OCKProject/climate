 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite-based observations from 1984 to 2017 document a marked change in the forested area burned in the seasonal snow zone, increasing at an average rate of up to 9% per year (

  </span>, potentially resulting in a small overestimation in the trend. To assess the large-scale impacts of post-fire radiative forcing on snow, we used 2000–2016 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite measurements of snow covered area across the American West to determine relative changes in snow disappearance date (SDD) before and after fire. This analysis (Methods) showed that for all studied fires in the seasonal snow zone throughout the West (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 841), snow disappeared on average 5 days earlier as a result of post-fire radiative forcing (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The change in relative SDD was both immediate and persistent, with the relative disappearance date remaining constant for the first seven to eight years following fire but still significantly different from pre-fire conditions even after 10 years when our analysis ended.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change in SDD (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) suggests that forest fires impact the snow-dominated hydrology consistently throughout the American West for at least 10 years following fire. To assess the underlying causes of this persistence, we characterized the composition, magnitude, and duration of LAI in snow samples collected in early spring 2017 from a chronosequence of seven high-severity, pine-dominated burned forests (burned from 1 to 15 years prior to sampling) located in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado, within the headwaters for the major rivers of the American West (i.e., Columbia, Missouri, Colorado, and Rio Grande; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>; Supplementary Table

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span> to measure organic and inorganic debris (&gt;0.7 µm) concentrations in the snow samples. We then simulated the impact of measured LAI concentrations on snow albedo using the Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiation (SNICAR) model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. We also measured the spectral albedo directly on the snow samples. Post-fire radiative forcing on snow was calculated as the modeled difference in sunlight energy absorbed by an LAI-impacted (both SNICAR-modeled and directly measured albedo) and clean snowpack (with background levels of LAI concentrations), with the former assuming full snow surface irradiance and the latter with an assumed 60% reduction from full snow surface irradiance (Methods).
