  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite-based observations from 1984 to 2017 document a marked change in the forested area burned in the seasonal snow zone, increasing at an average rate of up to 9% per year (

   </span>, potentially resulting in a small overestimation in the trend. To assess the large-scale impacts of post-fire radiative forcing on snow, we used 2000–2016 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite measurements of snow covered area across the American West to determine relative changes in snow disappearance date (SDD) before and after fire. This analysis (Methods) showed that for all studied fires in the seasonal snow zone throughout the West (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 841), snow disappeared on average 5 days earlier as a result of post-fire radiative forcing (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The change in relative SDD was both immediate and persistent, with the relative disappearance date remaining constant for the first seven to eight years following fire but still significantly different from pre-fire conditions even after 10 years when our analysis ended.

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change in SDD (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) suggests that forest fires impact the snow-dominated hydrology consistently throughout the American West for at least 10 years following fire. To assess the underlying causes of this persistence, we characterized the composition, magnitude, and duration of LAI in snow samples collected in early spring 2017 from a chronosequence of seven high-severity, pine-dominated burned forests (burned from 1 to 15 years prior to sampling) located in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado, within the headwaters for the major rivers of the American West (i.e., Columbia, Missouri, Colorado, and Rio Grande; Fig.

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>. We also measured the spectral albedo directly on the snow samples. Post-fire radiative forcing on snow was calculated as the modeled difference in sunlight energy absorbed by an LAI-impacted (both SNICAR-modeled and directly measured albedo) and clean snowpack (with background levels of LAI concentrations), with the former assuming full snow surface irradiance and the latter with an assumed 60% reduction from full snow surface irradiance (Methods).

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both SNICAR-modeled and measured albedo were lowest during the first year following fire and increased during the 15-year chronosequence (Fig.

We attribute the majority of SNICAR-modeled albedo change to BC concentrations (81% one winter following fire; 59% 15 winters following fire). Measured snow albedo incorporating impacts of both fine-grained (BC and dust) and course-grained (organic and inorganic) impurities showed greater changes than SNICAR-modeled snow albedo that included only fine-grained (BC and dust) impurities (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). The difference between measured and simulated snow albedo values suggests that, in addition to BC and dust, larger impurities (e.g., micro-charcoal and burned woody debris) also make critical contributions to the snowpack energy balance and ultimately snowmelt.

   <span class="sup">3</span> GW in 2018. For perspective, the 2018 forcing was 3.6 times the annual energy output of the Grand Coulee Dam (the largest energy producing dam in the U.S.), and sufficient energy to melt 1.4 billion m
   <span class="sup">3</span> (1.1 million acre-feet) of ripe (i.e., isothermal at 0 °C) snowpack. Since 1984, however, 56% of forest area burned in the western seasonal snow zone occurred in the Columbia River Basin, the largest river by volume flowing into the Pacific Ocean from the western hemisphere, and the fourth largest river by volume in the U.S.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
   </span>. Total daily 2018 post-fire radiative forcing on January 15 across the Columbia River Basin alone was sufficient to melt 0.82 billion m
   <span class="sup">3</span> (0.66 million acre-feet) of ripe snowpack, equivalent to 213% of the daily discharge on 15 January or 0.35% of annual Columbia River discharge (average discharge at Vancouver, WA from 2007 to 2017). Although substantial, these estimates of total post-fire radiative forcing on snow are conservative because they were calculated on January 15 to correspond with maximum snow-cover extent but when insolation is low. The majority of seasonal snow melts later in spring when insolation and thus the magnitude of post-fire radiative forcing are larger.

A 372% (modeled) to 443% (measured) increase in post-fire radiative forcing on snow occurred since 1999, and currently over 11% of all forests in the seasonal snow zone are experiencing enhanced radiative forcing due to forest fire occurrence within the last 15 years</p>
