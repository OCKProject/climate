  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.83, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01). Conversely, dust including insoluble particles and inorganic debris showed no significant changes. BC and organic debris concentrations were most variable between sites on snowpacks from more recently burned forests, and BC concentrations measured in the burned forest 15 years after fire were similar to remote pre-industrial background levels of 0.5–5 ng g
