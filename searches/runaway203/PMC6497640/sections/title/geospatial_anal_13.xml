 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate temporal variability in the maximum impact of forest fire effects to snowpack across the West for the period 1984–2017, we determined the radiative forcing each year for January 15th which is the average date of maximum North American seasonal snow cover extent

  </span>. Post-fire radiative forcing on snow coefficients were developed using a logistical regression of the SNICAR-modeled and measured albedo, and associated post-fire radiative forcing values during the 15 years following fire. The annual total daily post-fire radiative forcing on snow each year was calculated using the SNICAR-modeled and measured radiative forcing coefficients for the 15 years following fire (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), applied cumulatively for the total forested area burned in seasonal snow (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) within 15 years following fire. The spatial distribution of the post-fire radiative forcing on snow was evaluated for 2018 by integrating the radiative forcing on snow in forests burned within 15 years for each HUC 6 basin in the American West (Fig.
