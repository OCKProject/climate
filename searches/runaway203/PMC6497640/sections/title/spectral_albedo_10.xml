 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to chemical and other analyses, we decontaminated the snow samples by removing the outer 1 cm of snow on all sides as well as scraped the tops and bottoms using a pre-cleaned ceramic knife. In our cold laboratory (−15 °C), we measured spectral albedo for each 1 nm band throughout the range from 350 to 2500 nm using an Analytical Spectral Devices® Full-Range Field Spectrometer (ASD-FR) with a contact probe mounted in an opaque Teflon
  <span class="sup">™</span> light exclusion chamber that held the probe 1 mm above the snow sample. We made the spectral albedo measurements relative to a Spectralon® white reference target for every 10 cm section of each snow sample. A spectral correction was applied to the original measurements to correct for the observed offset as a result of an imperfect white reference. We then integrated the spectral albedo measurements across the spectral range and normalized by the illumination spectrum for each snow-surface sample.
