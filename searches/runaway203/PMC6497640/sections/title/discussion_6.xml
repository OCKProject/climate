 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that forest fires in the seasonal snow zone have immediate and profound impacts on snowmelt throughout burned forests in the American West, resulting in accelerated snow disappearance, earlier springtime meltwater release, and likely lower stream flows during drier summer months. Under climate warming, snowpack and associated water resource vulnerability will increase as forest fires become more frequent and extensive across the landscape

  </span>. As more snow falls as rain and less water is stored in warmer snowpacks, local forest fire effects related to earlier snowmelt also are likely to increase because, shallower snowpacks require less energy to melt, snow grain size is larger in warmer snowpacks which absorbs more sunlight energy, and shallower snowpacks accumulate greater impurity concentrations assuming no change in dry deposition of black carbon and burned organic debris. Human effects also contribute to snow-water resource vulnerability on a global scale, directly through aerosol emission/deposition of black carbon and dust on snowpack, and indirectly though greenhouse gas emissions, while simultaneously water resource demands are increasing for forest, agriculture, and urban use

  </span>. Forest fire effects to snow water resources are a concern for land managers and policy makers who have the common objective of optimizing consumption of natural resources while preserving the integrity of the landscape. Operational water models must include forest fire disturbance effects on snowpack if they are to accurately predict flood risks, drought potential, and downstream water resource availability.
