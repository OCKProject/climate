 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We sampled snow from a chronosequence of seven winter-accessible pine-dominated forests in the western seasonal snow zone that burned severely over 20 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> within the past 15 years. These sites were located in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado—within the headwaters of the largest volume rivers in the West including the Columbia, Colorado, and Rio Grande Rivers (Supplementary Table

  </span>. We collected the top 3 cm from a 0.5 m × 1 m plot on the snowpack surface using sterile scoops and Whirl-Pak® bags. Snow samples were kept frozen until analyzed in the laboratory. At each snow sampling location, we measured SWE using a federal snow sampler, and snow depth using a depth probe at nine randomly selected locations within a 50 m radius of each snow sample location to obtain a local average.
