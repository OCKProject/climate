After that, we show how the model learned captures the main properties of the Pleistocene dynamics. Then we use the model for analyzing influences of different factors such as trends and forcings, as well as for studying the mechanism underlying the observed response.

This signal is affected primarily by three astronomical parameters: precession of both the Earth’s axis and orbit yielding together 19 and 23 kyr spectral peaks, obliquity oscillations with the 41 kyr dominating period, and less-powerful variations of the Earth’s orbit eccentricity contributing to time scales around 100 kyrs (see power spectra of the insolation in Fig.

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To study the role of the random fluctuations (noise) in the model, which represent the sub-grid millennial and centennial climate variability, we compare outputs of the model in three variants: (i) the full model containing all the forcings, (ii) the model without the insolation forcing, in which both forcing time series entering 
   <span class="bold">q</span> are set to their mean values, and (iii) the noise-free model with 
   <span class="italic">g</span> = 0. We find that the stochastic forcing is a crucial factor for the frequency-band change associated with the MPT: the transition to the 100 kyr scale occurs in the same way in the model without any insolation signal, whereas the model with insolation forcing only and no noise only exhibits a response to the obliquity 41 kyr oscillations through the entire Pleistocene (Fig.

   <span class="bold">q</span> at the input of the model Eq. 
   <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a> are comprised of two distinct time series, we found that the optimal models only depend on a particular combination of these factors that is close to the difference between the tropical and sub-polar insolation inputs (see SI). Thus, in accordance with our analysis, the only insolation forcing that matters in the Pleistocene climate is the meridional gradient of the insolation mainly affected by the obliquity oscillations (see Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). All the harmonics related to the precession and eccentricity forcings nearly disappeared in the gradient and thereby cannot contribute to the observed dynamics. The insolation gradient was regarded as a main driver for the 41 kyr climate cycles in the pre-MPT epoch (from 3 Ma to 0.8 Ma), through its modulation of the atmospheric meridional heat and moisture fluxes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>. Our results indeed provide further direct empirical evidence from the LR04 stack that such a forcing remains dominant through the rest of the Pleistocene too.
  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In spite of the fact that the insolation forcing is not responsible for the MPT onset, it contributes significantly to post-MPT most powerful glacial-interglacial cycles via the phase-locking mechanism through which the origins of the major deglaciations follow the maxima of the insolation gradient time series. To illustrate this, we considered an ensemble of major deglaciations with 1 per mil 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">18</span>O decrease per 20 kyr or faster in the model behavior, collected from 10,000 model time series over the considered time interval from 2.6 Ma to present. For each event from this ensemble we calculated the time to the closest insolation gradient maximum as well as the time to the next deglaciation from the ensemble. A joint distribution density of these values shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(C)</a> indicates that the major deglaciations occur, on average, 10 kyr after the insolation gradient maxima and, consequently, the periods of glacial-interglacial cycles are close to multiples of the obliquity period 41 kyr. Moreover, most of the periods are distributed around the doubled and tripled obliquity period; this results in the near 100 kyr line in the mean model wavelet spectrum (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1(C)</a>). The corresponding 10 major deglaciations from the LR04 stack are marked by circles in both 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>

   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3(B)</a> shows the time evolution of the steady states at different insolation gradient levels, representing a “skeleton” of the obtained model’s dynamics. While at the low insolation gradient values, corresponding to warmer climate, the model is stable, the stability of the steady state decreases with the insolation gradient, and eventually, it becomes unstable at high insolation gradient levels. Nevertheless, the deterministic model under the quasi-periodical insolation gradient always lives near the “warm” stable state: the relatively short period of the forcing prevents it from going far from it in spite of the epochs of the model’s instability. Instead, the model state just slightly moves along with the insolation gradient oscillations. This is why the model demonstrates the 41 kyr response plotted in Figs

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The behavior changes essentially if the millennial processes are switched on. Due to the trend in the model, the steady states corresponding to stable and unstable epochs of climate converge with time (as seen e.g. from Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3(B)</a>); simultaneously, the stability of the warm climate states decreases and the amplitude of the millennial noise increases (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3(A)</a>). Eventually, starting from the middle Pleistocene, the noise is able to push out the model farther from the steady state to the area where the response of the model is essentially nonlinear: fast relaxations from the cold to warm climate and slower backward motions occur. The result is that in the full model with both millennial and insolation forcings we see the onset of the regime with noise-induced sawtooth oscillations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(B)</a>) associated with the MPT.

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the insolation forcing is not necessary for the MPT: the decreased stability of the warm steady state allows the noise to provide the transition starting from the average insolation gradient level (see e.g. Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1(D)</a>). However, the insolation gradient paces the glacial-interglacial cycles in the following way. The fastest stages of the glacial-interglacial oscillations (i.e., the rapid deglaciations) tend to occur when the climate is cold enough (high 
   <span class="italic">δ</span>
   <span class="sup">18</span>O level) and, at the same time, the insolation gradient has passed the maximal phase approaching the average. Under such conditions, the glacial climate is forced to go rapidly toward the warm steady state which appears in the model at the average insolation gradient level. Both these conditions determine the phase locking of the major deglaciations and the obliquity signal, which we observe in the model dynamics as well as in the LR04 time series (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(C)</a>). This mechanism is further explained in SI (the text and Figs

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, let us look what the obtained model predicts, being simply extrapolated into future, under the assumption that the detected trend stays the same. Note that this assumption may not be realistic, since there is no clear evidence of the ongoing long-term cooling even in the late Pleistocene
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
   </span>. It is even more suspect today, when the anthropogenic warming contributes to shifting the climatic means. Still, if such a trend held steady in future, the large glaciations in the model would still occur, since warm and glacial states would continue to converge as Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a> indicates. While the amplitude of “future” climate variability is almost unchanged in time, an additional short-scale (around 20 kyr period) cycle appears in the model time series independently of the insolation forcing (see WT for the model extrapolations with and without the insolation forcing in Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>).
