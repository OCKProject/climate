 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify a mechanism underlying the model’s behavior described above, let us first look at the steady states of the deterministic part of the model

  <span class="bold">q</span>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3(B)</a> shows the time evolution of the steady states at different insolation gradient levels, representing a “skeleton” of the obtained model’s dynamics. While at the low insolation gradient values, corresponding to warmer climate, the model is stable, the stability of the steady state decreases with the insolation gradient, and eventually, it becomes unstable at high insolation gradient levels. Nevertheless, the deterministic model under the quasi-periodical insolation gradient always lives near the “warm” stable state: the relatively short period of the forcing prevents it from going far from it in spite of the epochs of the model’s instability. Instead, the model state just slightly moves along with the insolation gradient oscillations. This is why the model demonstrates the 41 kyr response plotted in Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1(E)</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(A)</a> during the whole Pleistocene in the absence of the stochastic part.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The behavior changes essentially if the millennial processes are switched on. Due to the trend in the model, the steady states corresponding to stable and unstable epochs of climate converge with time (as seen e.g. from Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3(B)</a>); simultaneously, the stability of the warm climate states decreases and the amplitude of the millennial noise increases (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3(A)</a>). Eventually, starting from the middle Pleistocene, the noise is able to push out the model farther from the steady state to the area where the response of the model is essentially nonlinear: fast relaxations from the cold to warm climate and slower backward motions occur. The result is that in the full model with both millennial and insolation forcings we see the onset of the regime with noise-induced sawtooth oscillations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(B)</a>) associated with the MPT.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the insolation forcing is not necessary for the MPT: the decreased stability of the warm steady state allows the noise to provide the transition starting from the average insolation gradient level (see e.g. Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1(D)</a>). However, the insolation gradient paces the glacial-interglacial cycles in the following way. The fastest stages of the glacial-interglacial oscillations (i.e., the rapid deglaciations) tend to occur when the climate is cold enough (high 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">18</span>O level) and, at the same time, the insolation gradient has passed the maximal phase approaching the average. Under such conditions, the glacial climate is forced to go rapidly toward the warm steady state which appears in the model at the average insolation gradient level. Both these conditions determine the phase locking of the major deglaciations and the obliquity signal, which we observe in the model dynamics as well as in the LR04 time series (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(C)</a>). This mechanism is further explained in SI (the text and Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>).
