 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pronounced change in the glacial-interglacial regime that occurred about 1 million years ago – the so-called Middle Pleistocene transition (MPT) – is widely regarded as an apparent manifestation of climate system’s nonlinearity. The MPT is observed in various proxy records as a shift in glaciation periodicity (from 41 kyr to approximately 100 kyr) accompanied by both an increase of the ice/temperature oscillation amplitude and a change of the characteristic shape of the oscillations from almost symmetrical to a saw-tooth shape with gradual coolings and rapid deglaciations (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1(A,B)</a> and refs

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>). The most significant external forcing of climate – the insolation variations affected by the Earth’s orbital parameters (the Milankovitch forcing) – remained unchanged during the Pleistocene. Hence, it is clear that the MPT is closely connected with the internal properties of climate and their possible response to large-scale changes of the environment. Currently, there are ongoing discussions concerning the mechanisms of the MPT and the roles of different orbital parameters and the natural climate variability in it. The problem is that the climate is a complex high-dimensional system with various nonlinear feedbacks; therefore, to identify the mechanisms one should distinguish the most important subsystems driving such changes. The latter is indeed a very problematic task due to difficulties with the verification of different models. Existing theories of the Pleistocene dynamics regard various internal factors for an explanation of MPT causes, such as the ice-albedo, precipitation-temperature and sea level feedbacks, atmospheric and ocean circulation, CO
  <sub>2</sub> cycle, dust accumulation, etc. (cf. refs

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>). Many dynamical mechanisms of glacial cycles have been suggested based on different conceptual models derived from simplified physical considerations. In particular, they include relaxation oscillations arising under long-term trends in parameters (see the review
  <span class="sup">

  </span>, etc. Several of the suggested models provide a good fit to the observed proxy records, but the ability of a model to reproduce data is certainly not sufficient for the verification of a theory. Tziperman

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> argue that the nonlinear phase-locking mechanism common for many nonlinear dynamical models can easily provide the correct output through synchronization of a model with the Milankovitch forcing, but the physical mechanism put in the model does not have to be necessarily correct.

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To overcome this challenging puzzle, we here intend to explore the Pleistocene glacial cycles by Bayesian data analysis revealing the model that is minimal but sufficient for describing data. Mathematically, such a model provides the highest probability to produce the proxy records we have, and hence, yields statistically justified inferences. The advantages of the Bayesian methodology in selecting the proper scenario underlying the paleoclimate observations were discussed, e.g. in ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Here we show how the data-driven model of the Pleistocene dynamics obtained from the Bayesian principles can be used for supporting or rejecting existing climatological theories.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We infer that nonlinear feedbacks in the climate system are principal factors for the MPT, whereas external forcing – the gradient of insolation – only paces the major deglaciations in the post-MPT climate. Thus, our objective analysis supports those theories bringing internal climate variability to the forefront, while those regarding the orbital oscillations as a main driver of the 100 kyr glacial-interglacial cycles are essentially rejected.</p>
