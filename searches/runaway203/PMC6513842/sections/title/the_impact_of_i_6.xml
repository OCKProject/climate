 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the insolation signals 
  <span class="bold">q</span> at the input of the model Eq. 
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a> are comprised of two distinct time series, we found that the optimal models only depend on a particular combination of these factors that is close to the difference between the tropical and sub-polar insolation inputs (see SI). Thus, in accordance with our analysis, the only insolation forcing that matters in the Pleistocene climate is the meridional gradient of the insolation mainly affected by the obliquity oscillations (see Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). All the harmonics related to the precession and eccentricity forcings nearly disappeared in the gradient and thereby cannot contribute to the observed dynamics. The insolation gradient was regarded as a main driver for the 41 kyr climate cycles in the pre-MPT epoch (from 3 Ma to 0.8 Ma), through its modulation of the atmospheric meridional heat and moisture fluxes

  </span>. Our results indeed provide further direct empirical evidence from the LR04 stack that such a forcing remains dominant through the rest of the Pleistocene too.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In spite of the fact that the insolation forcing is not responsible for the MPT onset, it contributes significantly to post-MPT most powerful glacial-interglacial cycles via the phase-locking mechanism through which the origins of the major deglaciations follow the maxima of the insolation gradient time series. To illustrate this, we considered an ensemble of major deglaciations with 1 per mil 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">18</span>O decrease per 20 kyr or faster in the model behavior, collected from 10,000 model time series over the considered time interval from 2.6 Ma to present. For each event from this ensemble we calculated the time to the closest insolation gradient maximum as well as the time to the next deglaciation from the ensemble. A joint distribution density of these values shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(C)</a> indicates that the major deglaciations occur, on average, 10 kyr after the insolation gradient maxima and, consequently, the periods of glacial-interglacial cycles are close to multiples of the obliquity period 41 kyr. Moreover, most of the periods are distributed around the doubled and tripled obliquity period; this results in the near 100 kyr line in the mean model wavelet spectrum (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1(C)</a>). The corresponding 10 major deglaciations from the LR04 stack are marked by circles in both 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">18</span>O time series (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1(A)</a>) and the density plot in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(C)</a>: they fall well within the model statistics of deglaciation times.
