 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model Eq. 
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a> is the stochastic dynamical system, hence its output depends on the random variable 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span> and can differ from run to run. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1(C)</a> shows the wavelet transform (WT) of the model averaged over an ensemble of 10,000 model runs with different noise realizations, as compared to the WT of the single LR04 data (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1(B)</a>). Due to averaging effects, WT of the model looks more “homogeneous” than that of the data (and that of individual model time series; see an example in Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) and allows a clear identification of the MPT onset in the model behavior. It is seen that the model reproduce the 41 kyr spectral line during the entire Pleistocene associated with the linear response to the obliquity signal as well as the moving of the substantial part of the spectral power to lower frequencies that culminates in the interval from 1.3 to 1 Ma – the main manifestation of the MPT. Beyond that, the model reproduces correctly the changing characteristic shape of the climate cycles, as shown in Fig.
