 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, let us look what the obtained model predicts, being simply extrapolated into future, under the assumption that the detected trend stays the same. Note that this assumption may not be realistic, since there is no clear evidence of the ongoing long-term cooling even in the late Pleistocene

  </span>. It is even more suspect today, when the anthropogenic warming contributes to shifting the climatic means. Still, if such a trend held steady in future, the large glaciations in the model would still occur, since warm and glacial states would continue to converge as Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a> indicates. While the amplitude of “future” climate variability is almost unchanged in time, an additional short-scale (around 20 kyr period) cycle appears in the model time series independently of the insolation forcing (see WT for the model extrapolations with and without the insolation forcing in Fig.
