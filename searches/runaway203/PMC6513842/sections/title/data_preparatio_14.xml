 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The original LR04 stack is sampled with non-constant time step ranging from 1 kyr to 2.5 kyr for the time period [2.6 Ma, 0 Ma]. Each point of these series represents the average value of 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <span class="sup">18</span>O on the corresponding time interval. Thus, we can consider the stack as a set of such time intervals. In order to construct the model described above, we resampled the LR04 stack with the constant time step 2.5 kyr and applied a smoothing window with the size 
  <span class="italic">w</span> = 5 kyr simultaneously by the following procedure. For each time instance 
  <span class="italic">t</span> of the new time series we took all time intervals of the original LR04 stack which intersect with or lie in [
  <span class="italic">t</span> − 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/2, 
  <span class="italic">t</span> + 
  <span class="italic">w</span>/2]; the values from these intervals were averaged with the weights proportional to the sizes of the corresponding intersections and the resulting average value was taken as the new value at the time 
  <span class="italic">t</span>.
