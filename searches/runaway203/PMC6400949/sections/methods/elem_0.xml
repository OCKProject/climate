  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used MIROC5, NorESM, CanAM4, and CAM4 models and three sets of scenarios, namely, a historical scenario (for the 2006–2015 period) and 1.5 °C and 2 °C equilibrium warming scenarios (for a 10-year period in the beginning of 22nd century. Hypothetically for the 2106–2115 period). ALL scenario is forced by observations. Forcing and boundary conditions of the 1.5 °C warming scenario corresponds to those of the year 2095 of the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 of Coupled Model Intercomparison project Phase 5

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We derived the “event-to-event hydrological intensification index” (E2E) as follows. First, wet and dry days were demarcated by using the precipitation threshold 1 mm/day. We defined each consecutive wet spell and dry spell as a single event (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). The number of these events can change temporally and can represent intra-annual conditions, which will reflect the event-to-event intensification. For each event, we calculate the dry spell length (DSL) as the consecutive number of dry days and the total daily precipitation during the wet spell, which is called the “aggregated precipitation intensity” (API) throughout this study. The E2E is the event-to-event intensification index. The DSL and API values were normalized by their 10 year historical (i.e., the ALL simulation) annual average before calculating the E2E (Eq. 
   <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>). The mean of the API can be computed by Eq. 
   <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">2</a>. Here, P is the annual total precipitation during wet days and n
   <sub>w</sub> is the number of wet spells, which is equal (or different by 1) to the number of events (number of dry spells).

   </div>In Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>, we demonstrate the derivation of the event-wise E2E by combining spell 1 with 2, 3 with 4, and so on. We further checked the sensitivity of the E2E by shifting the position of one spell, i.e., by combining 2 with 3, 4 with 5, and so on (will use the term E2E#2 for this from hereon). By using the global GPCP-1DD daily precipitation data set
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
   </span> for the period 1 October 2006–1 October 2015, we derived the observed DSL, API, E2E, and E2E#2. Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> shows the E2E and E2E#2 results, which indicate that for a 10 year period, they will give similar results for the mean conditions.
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily precipitation output from 100 ensemble members per scenario of each model was used. Initially, the event-wise DSL, API, and E2E were calculated for each ensemble (i.e., for 10 years) in their original model resolution. For the analysis of the extreme cases of hydroclimatic intensity, the 99th percentile (P99) of E2E was then obtained along with the DSL and API components of that event. This resulted in 100 values for each parameter (i.e., P99 of E2E, etc.) per model per experiment (ALL, 1.5 °C, and 2 °C). Before combining these parameters for the multi-model analysis, results were regridded into a 1-degree resolution and concatenated to calculate the multi-model data (i.e., 400 values per experiment for each grid). When deriving the probability density distributions, to remove the model inherent biases for each experiment of each model, the ensemble mean value of the ALL experiment was removed before regridding and concatenating. For instance, in the P99 E2E values of the ALL, 1.5 °C, and 2 °C experiments with the MIROC model, the ensemble mean of ALL from the same model was deducted from all values. Afterward, the anomalies were obtained. Comparison between modeled and observed variables are shown in Fig.

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total change in the wet day precipitation (total dry days) during each decade of each ensemble was investigated in the context of the frequency and intensity of the wet (dry) events. Here, the frequency is the number of wet/dry spells and the intensity is the API (DSL) for wet (dry) spells. For wet spells, frequency–intensity decomposition is as follows. If the total precipitation (P) can be represented as a combination of the mean precipitation intensity (I, that is the mean API for wet spells) and mean frequency (n), i.e., as P = n.I, then change in the total precipitation from 1.5 °C to 2 °C warming can be decomposed as follows:

For dry spells, we can replace P with the total dry days (D) and I is equal to the mean DSL. We found that the covariance term was negligible during our analysis (Fig.
