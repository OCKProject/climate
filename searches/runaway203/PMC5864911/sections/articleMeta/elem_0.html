         <p>The notion that small changes can have large consequences in the climate or ecosystems
            has become popular as the concept of tipping points. Typically, tipping points are
            thought to arise from a loss of stability of an equilibrium when external conditions
            are slowly varied. However, this appealingly simple view puts us on the wrong foot
            for understanding a range of abrupt transitions in the climate or ecosystems because
            complex environmental systems are never in equilibrium. In particular, they are forced
            by diurnal variations, the seasons, Milankovitch cycles and internal climate oscillations.
            Here we show how abrupt and sometimes even irreversible change may be evoked by even
            small shifts in the amplitude or time scale of such environmental oscillations. By
            using model simulations and reconciling evidence from previous studies we illustrate
            how these phenomena can be relevant for ecosystems and elements of the climate system
            including terrestrial ecosystems, Arctic sea ice and monsoons. Although the systems
            we address are very different and span a broad range of time scales, the phenomena
            can be understood in a common framework that can help clarify and unify the interpretation
            of abrupt shifts in the Earth system.
