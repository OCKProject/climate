      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monsoon systems cover a large part of the subtropical land areas and supply many people
         with water. The most important monsoons occur in India, East Asia, West Africa, Australia
         and North and South America. The classical view of monsoon systems is that subtropical
         heat lows in summer induce a low-level circulation from the tropical ocean towards
         higher latitudes that supplies the subtropical land with moisture
         <span><a>41</a></span>. Due to geographical differences between the monsoon regions, each monsoon system
         is usually studied on its own. However, observations from several monsoon systems
         show an intriguing asymmetry in the annual cycle of precipitation: while the onset
         of the monsoon rainfall in spring tends to occur rather abruptly, its retreat in autumn
         occurs much more gradually. Abrupt monsoon onsets have been observed in West Africa
         <span><a>42</a></span>, the southwest Indian coast
         <span><a>43</a></span>, and in East Asia, where several abrupt stages of monsoon onset have been identified
         <span><a>44</a></span>. This behavior stands in contrast to the gradual and symmetric annual cycle of solar
         isolation that drives the monsoon evolution.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many potential reasons for abrupt monsoon onsets. First, meteorological
         theory predicts that switches from a zonal to a meridional flow can occur due to hydrodynamic
         instabilities when the atmosphere is sufficiently heated away from the equator
         <span><a>45</a>,
            <a>46</a></span>. In particular, the mechanism has been found to operate in a regional model of West
         African monsoon climate
         <span><a>47</a></span> and is supported by observations
         <span><a>48</a></span>. Second, air-sea interactions involving wind, evaporation, clouds and moisture advection
         can provide positive feedbacks which can rapidly enhance the monsoon after its onset
         <span><a>49</a>,
            <a>50</a></span>. One important positive feedback results from the advection of moisture by the low-level
         monsoon flow. When this moisture condenses over land, the latent heat release further
         enhances the circulation. This feedback is at the heart of the monsoon model by
         <span><a>51</a></span> that produces abrupt monsoon shifts, and whose simplified version
         <span><a>8</a></span> we will apply below. Third, the distribution of land surface properties such as albedo
         and orography modulate the monsoon onset
         <span><a>52</a>–
            <a>54</a></span>. Fourth, the seasonal cycle is superimposed by faster oscillations, causing periods
         of rapid change
         <span><a>42</a>,
            <a>55</a></span>. Such oscillations can make the monsoon onset more abrupt because they tend to be
         phase-locked to the annual cycle
         <span><a>56</a>,
            <a>57</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the complexity and geographical differences between the monsoon systems, the
         widespread existence of sudden monsoon onsets invites describing them within the common
         concept of tipping points. In addition, the annual cycle of solar insolation is a
         cyclic driver of these systems. One could therefore speculate that monsoons are periodically
         driven bistable systems. As the monsoon circulation adjusts very quickly to its boundary
         conditions it would be best described as a system with a very small ratio 
         <span>τ</span>/
         <span>T</span>, similar to the example system in Fig. 
         <a>2d and g</a>. One could therefore think of a typical annual cycle as a complete loop over both
         branches of the bistable system (the large amplitude solutions in Fig. 
         <a>2d</a>). It then follows that a small shift in external conditions could bring the system
         into a regime where the bifurcation point of the monsoon onset is not reached anymore
         in a particular year. Indeed, past abrupt transitions between episodes of strong and
         weakened (“failed”) East Asian monsoon have been identified in Chinese cave records
         <span><a>13</a></span>. These switches occur due to the oscillations of the Earth’s orbit that modulate
         summer insolation on the northern hemisphere. In this regard, the behavior of monsoons
         within a year and on timescales of hundred thousands of years is remarkably similar.
