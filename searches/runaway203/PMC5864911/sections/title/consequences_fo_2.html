      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mathematically, bifurcations in time-independent and periodically forced systems are
         equivalent
         <span><a>20</a></span>. However, transitions that are triggered by changes in periodic forcing have not
         been explicitly included in the concept of climate tipping points which usually build
         on the simple paradigm of stable equilibria (and their loss of stability at a tipping
         point)
         <span><a>1</a>,
            <a>21</a></span>. This stands in contrast to the fact that the climate system is interspersed with
         a number of internal and external oscillations that may cause such transitions on
         a vast range of time scales. This seems plausible because hardly any oscillation remains
         the same over time. For example, the seasonal cycle of solar insolation varies due
         to the Earth’s precession, which in turn is modulated by eccentricity. Similarly,
         the diurnal insolation cycle depends on the seasons, the Earth’s orbital parameters
         and its rotation rate. Moreover, modes of internal climate variability often have
         a distinct range of frequencies, and affect ecosystems and other components of the
         climate system. Besides these naturally occurring phenomena, the human interference
         with the climate system is another reason why such oscillations might change. For
         example, a human impact on the amplitude and frequency of ENSO can be expected
         <span><a>22</a></span>. Even the amplitude and timing of the annual cycle can change in many variables when
         the balance of climate feedbacks shifts under increased greenhouse gas concentrations,
         for example associated with changes in Arctic cloud cover, or the loss of sea ice
         <span><a>23</a></span>. Figure 
         <a>3</a> gives a non-exhaustive overview of (quasi-) periodic oscillations and the nonlinear
         systems they affect. The possibility of tipping points induced by quasi-periodic drivers
         emerges from a large body of literature on these systems, but is hardly discussed
         in such process-based studies or in review articles on tipping points.

               <p>Oscillations in the Earth system that can modulate their amplitude or period, and
                  potentially multistable systems affected by such change. Forcings that are not truly
                  periodic but that have modes of variability on specific time scales are shown in italic

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Starting our overview with small scales, tipping point phenomena have a long tradition
         in the nonlinear world of fluid dynamics
         <span><a>24</a>,
            <a>25</a></span>. For example, it has lately been found that the structure of the nocturnal atmospheric
         boundary layer over land can show two alternative regimes
         <span><a>26</a>,
            <a>27</a></span>. The question which regime will be established can crucially depend on the conditions
         during the evening
         <span><a>28</a></span>. On a much larger scale, marine boundary layer clouds show distinct regimes in observations
         and multiple equilibria in specific models
         <span><a>29</a>,
            <a>30</a></span>. It therefore seems rewarding to study how the diurnal cycle of solar insolation
         <span><a>31</a>,
            <a>32</a></span> or the annual cycle of sea surface temperatures can affect the long-term structure
         of the lower atmosphere.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Particularly important for the lives of many people are the abrupt shifts in monsoon
         systems occurring within the seasonal and orbital cycles. Similarly, the current loss
         of summer sea ice reminds us that sea ice is nonlinear system that is subject to a
         marked seasonal cycle. Moreover, multiple equilibria are supposed to exist in several
         marine and terrestrial ecosystems including lakes
         <span><a>33</a></span>, marine sea-grass ecosystems
         <span><a>34</a></span>, tropical forests, and drylands
         <span><a>35</a></span>. In terrestrial ecosystems, rainfall is often the most important environmental driver,
         and the longevity and severance of droughts has long-term consequences. We will discuss
         the cases of monsoons, sea ice and terrestrial ecosystems in more detail below.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, an iconic example of a tipping point is the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
         Circulation (AMOC) which can show multiple states in models of different complexity
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>36</a></span>. Probably related to the AMOC are the quasi-regular Dansgaard-Oeschger events which
         have been argued to be caused by a regular driver
         <span><a>37</a></span>. A subject where the role of periodic drivers has been discussed explicitly are glacial-interglacial
         cycles. In particular, it has been shown that they can conceptually be understood
         as forced shifts in a multi-stable landscape
         <span><a>38</a></span>. Due to the inertia of the cryosphere and lithosphere, the climate is not in equilibrium
         with the orbital forcing. Small insolation differences from one orbital cycle to the
         next can thus cause very different climates
         <span><a>39</a>,
            <a>40</a></span>. Such a conceptual view can also be beneficial for understanding other components
         of the Earth system and can inspire research questions. We will illustrate this by
         focusing on three example cases.
