      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate and ecosystems usually respond rather linearly to changes in external
         conditions. However, there are also occasions when at some point a sudden and large
         shift to a very different state occurs. An important cause of such behavior can be
         a positive feedback which leads to a self-amplifying change, making the system very
         sensitive to external conditions. Such feedback-induced threshold behavior is often
         referred to as a tipping point
         <span><a>1</a></span>. If the feedback is very strong, alternative stable states can exist under the same
         external conditions (Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>). In models, the parameter values at which the system’s dynamics suddenly changes
         are called bifurcation points. For example, when the system is driven over a bifurcation
         point where a current equilibrium ceases to exist, an abrupt and irreversible shift
         toward a different equilibrium can occur. Tipping points and alternative states exist
         in many simple models, for example representing ocean circulation
         <span><a>2</a></span>, global ice coverage
         <span><a>3</a>,
            <a>4</a></span>, Arctic sea ice
         <span><a>5</a></span>, vegetation-atmosphere interaction
         <span><a>6</a></span>, terrestrial ecosystems
         <span><a>7</a></span>, and the East Asian and Indian monsoons
         <span><a>8</a>,
            <a>9</a></span>. Moreover, there are sometimes also observational indications that multiple states
         exist in reality
         <span><a>10</a></span>, and there is evidence that abrupt shifts have occurred in the past
         <span><a>11</a>–
            <a>13</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the conventional illustration of a tipping point it is assumed that the driver
         (representing external conditions), varies monotonically and gradually, so that the
         system stays close to a stable equilibrium (black curve in Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>). However, many environmental conditions change so rapidly that the system’s state
         cannot catch up with the changing equilibrium. For example, global warming can drive
         the Greenland ice sheet into a regime where it is not sustainable anymore
         <span><a>14</a></span>. However, the ice sheet can take millennia to melt completely, which gives us a window
         of “borrowed time”
         <span><a>15</a></span> in which we could save the ice-sheet should the temperature decrease again in time
         <span><a>14</a></span>. Figure 
         <a>1</a> illustrates the two possibilities of a saved (blue) and a collapsing system (red).
         As the excursion beyond the threshold takes more time for the red trajectory, the
         system shifts to the realm of the lower stable branch, while the blue trajectory returns
         toward its old state.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As natural systems are permanently exposed to environmental change, they are usually
         not in equilibrium. The external fluctuations that drive them are usually simplified
         as stochastic, but in reality there often is a dominant timescale as well. This is
         particularly obvious if the change in external conditions consists in a periodic oscillation,
         for example the very regular annual and diurnal cycles of solar insolation, and the
         quasi-periodic changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters. Also, the climate system’s
         internal variability shows modes with specific frequency ranges, most importantly
         the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
         <span><a>16</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such oscillations will affect parts of the climate system or ecosystems that have
         intrinsic thresholds or bifurcations: a gradual change in the mean, amplitude or frequency
         of periodic drivers can trigger abrupt change in these systems. In the following,
         we first illustrate these phenomena with a simple mathematical system. Subsequently,
         we point out how models and observations indicate the existence of these phenomena
         in many elements of the Earth system, spanning a vast range of time scales. We illustrate
         some consequences of this view for monsoon systems, sea ice and terrestrial ecosystems,
         and argue how a general view on tipping points can contribute to a conceptual understanding
         of different tipping elements in the Earth system.
