  </span>, tropical forests, and drylands
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. As an example we consider the bistability of tropical forest versus savannah. For instance, satellite observations across continents show a multimodality in the probability distribution of tree cover under the same precipitation regime
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>
  </span>. The likely cause is the competition between tropical grasses and trees and their different vulnerability to fire
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>
  </span>: in a savannah ecosystem, fire occurs frequently and as grasses can quickly re-establish burned areas they outcompete the slower-growing tree saplings. In contrast, where a forest has established, fire is less likely to occur and the high tree cover can persist at the expense of grasses. Dynamic vegetation models indeed indicate that large subtropical land areas fall into a precipitation regime where several stable states are possible

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, precipitation is not constant but varies on multi-annual time scales. In the tropics, rainfall over land is often controlled by the magnitude and distribution of sea surface temperature (SST). Tropical SSTs show characteristic modes of variability like the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) which affect tropical rainfall. For example, high Atlantic SSTs can lead to severe droughts in the Amazon like those observed in recent years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>
  </span>, and changes in ENSO activity strongly affect Amazon rainfall and vegetation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>
  </span>. Proxy-based reconstructions suggest that ENSO amplitude was low during the mid-Holocene, and relatively high in recent decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
  </span>. Moreover, tree rings indicate that ENSO amplitude and frequency have changed substantially on decadal to centennial time scales during the last 1,000 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>
  </span>. The time scales of such changes are on the same order of magnitude than the time scale of tree growth which suggests the possibility that terrestrial tipping points can be triggered by changes in ENSO variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>
  </span>. It is important in this context that a dieback caused by a large-scale drought can occur within a much shorter time than regrowth – in contrast to our example model above, the system is not symmetric. This time scale asymmetry suggests that forests are not safe from a drought-induced collapse even if the long-term mean rainfall is very large.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, precipitation is not strictly external, but interacts with vegetation. Such atmosphere-vegetation interaction is believed to be particularly large in Northern Africa due to positive surface-albedo and water cycle feedbacks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>
  </span>. It has therefore been investigated if these feedbacks can give rise to multiple equilibria and whether the end of the Green Sahara some 5,500 years ago can be interpreted as a tipping point
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>
  </span>. Moreover, rainfall in Northern Africa shows large decadal variations. Climate models show that these variations are caused by SST changes in several ocean basins and that the Sahel drought of the 1970s and early 1980s was caused by such modes of natural climate variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>
  </span>. The time scale of these inter-annual fluctuations is of similar magnitude than the time scale of responses in grass coverage in such drylands. It is therefore plausible that rainfall fluctuations can lead to locally amplified shifts between a desert and a grass-covered state (representing a case like Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c and f</a>).

  </span> showed such abrupt shifts in a vegetation model with oscillating precipitation forcing. We reproduce their result in our Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a> as another explicit model example (see Supplementary Information for model description). Despite the model differences, the results are directly comparable to our conceptual model above (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c,d</a>). At small amplitude, two alternative vegetation states exist. As soon as the amplitude becomes large enough, a bifurcation occurs, leading to an irreversible vegetation increase when starting from a desert state as an initial condition. At even larger amplitude, the rainfall variations now cover both equilibria and the mean vegetation cover drops to an intermediate average state while having much larger amplitude. Hence, a small change in the amplitude of rainfall fluctuations can result in a vegetation collapse or increase. As in the generic conceptual model above, the abruptness of the second (reversible) type of the transition depends on the timescale of the forcing relative to the relaxation time of the system (top versus bottom panel).
