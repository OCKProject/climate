      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple equilibria are thought to exist in several marine and terrestrial ecosystems
         including lakes
         <span><a>33</a></span>, marine sea grass ecosystems
         <span><a>34</a></span>, tropical forests, and drylands
         <span><a>35</a></span>. As an example we consider the bistability of tropical forest versus savannah. For
         instance, satellite observations across continents show a multimodality in the probability
         distribution of tree cover under the same precipitation regime
         <span><a>10</a>,
            <a>72</a></span>. The likely cause is the competition between tropical grasses and trees and their
         different vulnerability to fire
         <span><a>73</a>,
            <a>74</a></span>: in a savannah ecosystem, fire occurs frequently and as grasses can quickly re-establish
         burned areas they outcompete the slower-growing tree saplings. In contrast, where
         a forest has established, fire is less likely to occur and the high tree cover can
         persist at the expense of grasses. Dynamic vegetation models indeed indicate that
         large subtropical land areas fall into a precipitation regime where several stable
         states are possible
         <span><a>75</a>,
            <a>76</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, precipitation is not constant but varies on multi-annual time scales. In
         the tropics, rainfall over land is often controlled by the magnitude and distribution
         of sea surface temperature (SST). Tropical SSTs show characteristic modes of variability
         like the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and
         Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) which affect tropical rainfall. For example,
         high Atlantic SSTs can lead to severe droughts in the Amazon like those observed in
         recent years
         <span><a>77</a></span>, and changes in ENSO activity strongly affect Amazon rainfall and vegetation
         <span><a>78</a></span>. Proxy-based reconstructions suggest that ENSO amplitude was low during the mid-Holocene,
         and relatively high in recent decades
         <span><a>79</a></span>. Moreover, tree rings indicate that ENSO amplitude and frequency have changed substantially
         on decadal to centennial time scales during the last 1,000 years
         <span><a>16</a>,
            <a>80</a></span>. The time scales of such changes are on the same order of magnitude than the time
         scale of tree growth which suggests the possibility that terrestrial tipping points
         can be triggered by changes in ENSO variability
         <span><a>81</a></span>. It is important in this context that a dieback caused by a large-scale drought can
         occur within a much shorter time than regrowth – in contrast to our example model
         above, the system is not symmetric. This time scale asymmetry suggests that forests
         are not safe from a drought-induced collapse even if the long-term mean rainfall is
         very large.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, precipitation is not strictly external, but interacts with vegetation. Such
         atmosphere-vegetation interaction is believed to be particularly large in Northern
         Africa due to positive surface-albedo and water cycle feedbacks
         <span><a>82</a>,
            <a>83</a></span>. It has therefore been investigated if these feedbacks can give rise to multiple
         equilibria and whether the end of the Green Sahara some 5,500 years ago can be interpreted
         as a tipping point
         <span><a>6</a>,
            <a>12</a>,
            <a>84</a></span>. Moreover, rainfall in Northern Africa shows large decadal variations. Climate models
         show that these variations are caused by SST changes in several ocean basins and that
         the Sahel drought of the 1970s and early 1980s was caused by such modes of natural
         climate variability
         <span><a>85</a>,
            <a>86</a></span>. The time scale of these inter-annual fluctuations is of similar magnitude than the
         time scale of responses in grass coverage in such drylands. It is therefore plausible
         that rainfall fluctuations can lead to locally amplified shifts between a desert and
         a grass-covered state (representing a case like Fig. 
         <a>2c and f</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Building on a conceptual model by Brovkin, 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>6</a></span>, Zeng, 
         <span>et al</span>.
         <span><a>87</a></span> showed such abrupt shifts in a vegetation model with oscillating precipitation forcing.
         We reproduce their result in our Fig. 
         <a>S4</a> as another explicit model example (see Supplementary Information for model description).
         Despite the model differences, the results are directly comparable to our conceptual
         model above (Fig. 
         <a>2c,d</a>). At small amplitude, two alternative vegetation states exist. As soon as the amplitude
         becomes large enough, a bifurcation occurs, leading to an irreversible vegetation
         increase when starting from a desert state as an initial condition. At even larger
         amplitude, the rainfall variations now cover both equilibria and the mean vegetation
         cover drops to an intermediate average state while having much larger amplitude. Hence,
         a small change in the amplitude of rainfall fluctuations can result in a vegetation
         collapse or increase. As in the generic conceptual model above, the abruptness of
         the second (reversible) type of the transition depends on the timescale of the forcing
         relative to the relaxation time of the system (top versus bottom panel).
