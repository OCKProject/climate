 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mathematically, bifurcations in time-independent and periodically forced systems are equivalent
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. However, transitions that are triggered by changes in periodic forcing have not been explicitly included in the concept of climate tipping points which usually build on the simple paradigm of stable equilibria (and their loss of stability at a tipping point)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. This stands in contrast to the fact that the climate system is interspersed with a number of internal and external oscillations that may cause such transitions on a vast range of time scales. This seems plausible because hardly any oscillation remains the same over time. For example, the seasonal cycle of solar insolation varies due to the Earth’s precession, which in turn is modulated by eccentricity. Similarly, the diurnal insolation cycle depends on the seasons, the Earth’s orbital parameters and its rotation rate. Moreover, modes of internal climate variability often have a distinct range of frequencies, and affect ecosystems and other components of the climate system. Besides these naturally occurring phenomena, the human interference with the climate system is another reason why such oscillations might change. For example, a human impact on the amplitude and frequency of ENSO can be expected
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Even the amplitude and timing of the annual cycle can change in many variables when the balance of climate feedbacks shifts under increased greenhouse gas concentrations, for example associated with changes in Arctic cloud cover, or the loss of sea ice
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> gives a non-exhaustive overview of (quasi-) periodic oscillations and the nonlinear systems they affect. The possibility of tipping points induced by quasi-periodic drivers emerges from a large body of literature on these systems, but is hardly discussed in such process-based studies or in review articles on tipping points.

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Starting our overview with small scales, tipping point phenomena have a long tradition in the nonlinear world of fluid dynamics

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> or the annual cycle of sea surface temperatures can affect the long-term structure of the lower atmosphere.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Particularly important for the lives of many people are the abrupt shifts in monsoon systems occurring within the seasonal and orbital cycles. Similarly, the current loss of summer sea ice reminds us that sea ice is nonlinear system that is subject to a marked seasonal cycle. Moreover, multiple equilibria are supposed to exist in several marine and terrestrial ecosystems including lakes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>, marine sea-grass ecosystems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>, tropical forests, and drylands
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. In terrestrial ecosystems, rainfall is often the most important environmental driver, and the longevity and severance of droughts has long-term consequences. We will discuss the cases of monsoons, sea ice and terrestrial ecosystems in more detail below.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, an iconic example of a tipping point is the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) which can show multiple states in models of different complexity

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Probably related to the AMOC are the quasi-regular Dansgaard-Oeschger events which have been argued to be caused by a regular driver
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. A subject where the role of periodic drivers has been discussed explicitly are glacial-interglacial cycles. In particular, it has been shown that they can conceptually be understood as forced shifts in a multi-stable landscape
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. Due to the inertia of the cryosphere and lithosphere, the climate is not in equilibrium with the orbital forcing. Small insolation differences from one orbital cycle to the next can thus cause very different climates

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Such a conceptual view can also be beneficial for understanding other components of the Earth system and can inspire research questions. We will illustrate this by focusing on three example cases.
