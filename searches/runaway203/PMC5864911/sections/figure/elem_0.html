         <p>Stable states and trajectories in the example system (Eq.Â 
            <a>1</a>). (
            <span>a</span>) The equilibria of state x for constant driver D are shown as black lines (continuous:
            stable; dashed: unstable). The flow towards a stable state is shown as dashed orange
            arrows; B
            <sub>1</sub> and B
            <sub>2</sub> indicate the bifurcation points. (
            <span>b</span>) Time evolution of driver D for two pulses, the red one having a longer period than
            the blue one. The trajectories of the system that result from these forcings are shown
            as red and blue curves in (
