  <p>Stable states and trajectories in the example system (Eq.Â 
   <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>). (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) The equilibria of state x for constant driver D are shown as black lines (continuous: stable; dashed: unstable). The flow towards a stable state is shown as dashed orange arrows; B
   <sub>1</sub> and B
   <sub>2</sub> indicate the bifurcation points. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Time evolution of driver D for two pulses, the red one having a longer period than the blue one. The trajectories of the system that result from these forcings are shown as red and blue curves in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>). See Supplementary Information for details on the parameter choices.
