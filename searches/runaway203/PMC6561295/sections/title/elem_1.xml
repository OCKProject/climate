  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a> shows the probability density functions (PDFs) for both temperature trajectory scenarios for the combined ice sheet contributions, assuming some dependencies exist between ice sheet processes, as elicited from the expert group (

  </span>. They display similar characteristics to 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>. The PDFs were generated using Monte Carlo sampling from the intrinsic range obtained from the expert responses (
  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>). All PDFs are non-Gaussian and exhibit an extended upper tail, especially for the H temperature scenario. We believe this reflects the experts’ joint view that large amplitude, nonlinear instabilities could be triggered at this higher temperature, even by 2050. For example, for 2050, the median [and likely range, defined as the 17–83% probability range, as in the AR5 (
  <a rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" href="#r25">25</a>)] of the ice sheet contributions are 10 cm (5–18 cm) for the L scenario and 12 cm (6–24 cm) for the H scenario. The tail behavior is discussed further in

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Note 1.1

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative contribution of each ice sheet to total SLR (used here to refer to the sum of the three ice sheet contributions) depends on the temperature scenario. To demonstrate this, we compare the mean projections for the three ice sheets for the overall 2100 H distribution, for the same distribution conditional on the total contribution being above the median total projection (&gt;51 cm), and the same distribution conditional on the total being above the 90th percentile (&gt;141 cm). In the unconditional distribution, GrIS dominates the mean projection, contributing 33 cm (49%) of the 67-cm total, compared with 27 cm for WAIS and 6 cm for EAIS: proportions that approximately mirror the present-day contributions (
  <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>). The GrIS share declines for larger total contributions. For the mean of the upper half of total SLR projections, GrIS contributes 49 cm (46%) of 106 cm total compared with 44 cm for WAIS and 13 cm for EAIS; for the mean of the top decile, GrIS contributes 60 cm (30%) of the 194-cm total compared with 95 cm for WAIS and 39 cm for EAIS.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistically, the declining GrIS share and declining GrIS/AIS ratio reflect a higher mean estimate but slightly less skewed distribution for GrIS than for WAIS, and a long tail for EAIS (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>), as well as the assessed dependence structure between different terms. Physically, this is likely a result of the role of highly nonlinear dynamic processes coming into play for marine sectors of the AIS that are needed to achieve the higher values of total SLR, whereas at lower total SLR values, more linear processes dominate. It is also noteworthy that the fifth percentiles for both temperature scenarios and for all epochs are less than their current values, suggesting a scenario in which increased snowfall, primarily over the AIS (
  <a rid="t01" ref-type="table" href="#t01">Table 1</a>), plausibly compensates for any changes in ice dynamics and enhanced melting over the GrIS.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Direct comparison with the AR5 is complicated by the use of different external forcings. Our L scenario is slightly warmer than the median projection for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, and cooler than the median projection for RCP 4.5 at 2100 (2081–2100 global mean warming of +1.9 °C compared with medians of +1.6 °C and +2.4 °C, for RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5, respectively), whereas our H scenario is roughly comparable to the median projection for RCP8.5 (2081–2100 global mean warming of +4.5 °C compared with a median of +4.3 °C for RCP 8.5), although with different trajectories (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817205116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S1
  </span>). Our two temperature scenarios were chosen to assess the potential consequences, in terms of SLR, of the goal of the COP21 Paris agreement to keep global temperatures below +2 °C above preindustrial and of a scenario closer to business as usual, as opposed to matching a specific RCP. For comparison, the AR5 likely range ice sheet SLR contribution for RCP8.5 at 2100 is 6–35 cm, with a median of 19 cm (
  <a rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" href="#r7">7</a>) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>). As mentioned, comparing our findings with those from the AR5 requires transforming temperatures and percentiles to match those used in the AR5. Nonetheless, given these caveats, it is clear the SEJ median and upper value of the likely range (83rd percentile) are statistically significantly larger than the corresponding AR5 values (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>). Our likely range upper bound is almost three times the AR5 value for RCP 8.5 (94 vs. 35 cm, estimated by summing the individual components considered in the AR5 and, hence, assuming perfect dependence). This is driven, primarily, by larger uncertainty ranges for the WAIS and GrIS contributions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>), possibly resulting from experts’ consideration of the aforementioned nonlinear processes. We note also that the uncertainties have grown substantially in comparison with BA13, where the elicited temperature increase above preindustrial was +3.5 °C (indicated by the orange line in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>). In comparison, our current findings result in a larger uncertainty range at a lower temperature increase (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>). There has been recent consideration of the benefits of limiting warming to +1.5 °C (
  <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>) and what difference this would make compared with the Paris Agreement +2 °C. The reduction in the sea-level contribution from the ice sheets at this lower temperature for our study is broadly in line with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on 1.5 °C, which obtained a value of 10 cm reduction in global mean sea level from all sources (
  <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another important point is the positive skews of the distributions, which result in long upper tails that are less apparent in the AR5 values (limited to the likely range). For example, the median values obtained here and in the AR5 for RCP2.6 differ by 8 cm (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>), but the 83rd percentile from the SEJ is about 100% larger (51 vs. 25 cm). This becomes even more important if considering probabilities beyond the likely range defined in the AR5, such as the very likely range (the 90th percentile confidence interval). This is apparent from the values in 
  <a rid="t01" ref-type="table" href="#t01">Table 1</a>. Kurtosis provides a quantitative measure of tail behavior and is discussed in

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a> illustrates the PDFs for 2100 L and H temperature trajectories for each ice sheet. The 90% credible intervals for the GrIS and WAIS (approximately equivalent to the very likely range in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change terminology) are broadly similar to one another in both scenarios (c.f. the 90% credible interval bars in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3 
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>). For the 2100 L and H scenarios, the EAIS uncertainty ranges are about a factor of three and two smaller, respectively. Median values for the GrIS and WAIS are broadly comparable (13/8 cm for L and 23/18 cm for H), whereas the EAIS median values are 0 and 2 cm for L and H, respectively. Both the WAIS and GrIS show a strong skew with a long positive tail, which is absent for the EAIS for 2100 L but begins to emerge for 2100 H. There is, consequently, a substantial difference between the high-end, 95th percentile values considered here versus the 83rd percentile value presented in the AR5, which is far more pronounced than differences between the fifth and 17th percentiles (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). For WAIS under 2100 H, the difference between the 83rd and 95th percentile is a factor two (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a> and 
  <a rid="t01" ref-type="table" href="#t01">Table 1</a>), and a factor four for the EAIS. This is also seen when considering the total SLR from the ice sheets. For 2200 H, the 83rd and 95th percentiles are 251 and 750 cm, respectively (
  <a rid="t01" ref-type="table" href="#t01">Table 1</a>). By limiting consideration only to the likely range, the AR5 results miss this tail behavior, which is a critical component of risk management.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present SEJ demonstrates a shift in expert opinion since BA13 (i.e., in 2012), when it was found that the GrIS had the narrowest 90% credible range but the largest median SLR rate (
  <a rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" href="#r13">13</a>). Here, the GrIS still has the largest median value (for both L and H), but the upper tail of the distribution is now comparable to that of the WAIS (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>). It is difficult to determine the basis for this, but we note that the experts overwhelmingly believe that the recent (last 2 decades) acceleration in mass loss from the GrIS is predominantly a result of external forcing, rather than internal variability. Of the 22 experts, 18 judge the acceleration is largely or entirely a result of external forcing (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1817205116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S9
   <span class="italic">A</span> and Table S6
  </span>). This is an important and statistically significant shift from the findings in BA13. In contrast, for the WAIS, opinion remains divided, with seven experts indicating their view that it is largely a result of internal variability, seven placing more weight on external forcing, and eight giving equal weights to each. This reflects the earlier conclusions of BA13.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The findings of SEJ2018 cannot be directly compared with BA13 because the target questions differ, as do the temperature scenarios. The closest comparison that can be made between SEJ2018 and BA13 is for the latter’s cumulative 5/50/95% SLR values of 10/29/84 cm for 2010–2100, which comprised two-thirds from GrIS, one-third from WAIS, and a negligible amount from EAIS, for a temperature increase based on experts’ judgement of +3.5 °C (
  <a rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" href="#r13">13</a>). For SEJ2018, we obtain −5/18/73 cm for +2 °C rise and −1/43/170 cm for +5 °C rise (integrated over 2000–2100). 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> compares the likely range in BA13 and the various temperature markers used here and in the AR5. It is evident that opinion has shifted toward a stronger ice sheet response and a larger credible range, for a given temperature change, than was considered plausible by the experts 6 y ago.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rather high median and 95% values for 2100 SLR (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> and 
  <a rid="t01" ref-type="table" href="#t01">Table 1</a>), found here, likely reflect recent studies that have explored, in particular, AIS sensitivity to CO

  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>,

  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>) has used an emulator approach to reexamine the potential role of the Marine Ice Cliff Instability in explaining past sea level and how this affects projections, and we can compare our AIS results with the projections reported in ref. 
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>. Our results lie between the emulation with Marine Ice Cliff Instability and without, lying closer to the latter for the median values (

  </span>). Uncertainties for the H temperature scenario grow rapidly beyond 2100, with 90th percentile credible ranges of −10 to 740 cm and −9 to 970 cm for 2200 and 2300, respectively. Limiting projections to the likely range largely obscures the real, and potentially critical, extent of the deep uncertainties evident in this study.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To place these results in the context of total SLR projections, including contributions from ocean thermal expansion, glaciers, and land-water storage, we use a probabilistic SLR projection framework (
   <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>). Specifically, we substitute Monte Carlo samples from the PW01 joint probability distribution in SEJ2018 for the ice sheet values used in Kopp et al. (
   <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>), while keeping the remaining projections for other components of SLR. For thermal expansion and glaciers, these projections are driven by CMIP5 model projections, using an approach similar to that of AR5. For land-water storage, the projections are based on semiempirical relationships among population, dam construction, and groundwater withdrawal (
   <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>). We combine the L scenario ice sheet projections with the other components from the +2.0 °C scenario developed by Rasmussen et al. (
   <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>), and for the H scenario with those for RCP 8.5 from Kopp et al. (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared with other SLR projections for 2050 developed over the last 6 y (
   <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>), the 2050 L projections are broadly comparable (very likely range of 16–49 cm), whereas the 2050 H projections are somewhat fatter tailed, with the very likely range extending up to 61 cm (
   <a rid="t02" ref-type="table" href="#t02">Table 2</a>). This compares with the 20 studies compiled by Horton et al. (
   <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>), which spanned from 12 cm at the low end of fifth percentile projections to 48 cm at the high end of 95th percentile projections. There are relatively few +2 °C studies to compare with our 2100 L projections, but those that are compiled in Horton et al. (
   <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>) range from 0.2 m at the low end of fifth percentile projections to 1.1 m at the high end of the 95th percentile projections.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study suggests that experts’ judgments of uncertainties in projections of the ice sheet contribution to SLR have grown during the last 6 y and since publication of the AR5. This is likely a consequence of a focused effort by the glaciological community to refine process understanding and improve process representation in numerical ice sheet models. It may also be related to the observational record, which indicates continued increase in mass loss from both the AIS and GrIS during this time. This negative learning (
   <a rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" href="#r36">36</a>, 
   <a rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" href="#r37">37</a>) may appear a counter intuitive conclusion, but is not an uncommon outcome: as understanding of the complexity of a problem improves, so can uncertainty bounds grow. We note that for risk management applications, consideration of the upper tail behavior of our SLR estimates is crucial for robust decision making. Limiting attention to the likely range, as was the case in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR5, may be misleading and will likely lead to a poor evaluation of the true risks. We find it plausible that SLR could exceed 2 m by 2100 for our high-temperature scenario, roughly equivalent to business as usual. This could result in land loss of 1.79 M km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, including critical regions of food production, and displacement of up to 187 million people (
   <a rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" href="#r38">38</a>). A SLR of this magnitude would clearly have profound consequences for humanity.
