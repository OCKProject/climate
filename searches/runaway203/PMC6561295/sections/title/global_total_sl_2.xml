 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To place these results in the context of total SLR projections, including contributions from ocean thermal expansion, glaciers, and land-water storage, we use a probabilistic SLR projection framework (
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>). Specifically, we substitute Monte Carlo samples from the PW01 joint probability distribution in SEJ2018 for the ice sheet values used in Kopp et al. (
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>), while keeping the remaining projections for other components of SLR. For thermal expansion and glaciers, these projections are driven by CMIP5 model projections, using an approach similar to that of AR5. For land-water storage, the projections are based on semiempirical relationships among population, dam construction, and groundwater withdrawal (
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>). We combine the L scenario ice sheet projections with the other components from the +2.0 °C scenario developed by Rasmussen et al. (
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>), and for the H scenario with those for RCP 8.5 from Kopp et al. (
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared with other SLR projections for 2050 developed over the last 6 y (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>), the 2050 L projections are broadly comparable (very likely range of 16–49 cm), whereas the 2050 H projections are somewhat fatter tailed, with the very likely range extending up to 61 cm (
  <a rid="t02" ref-type="table" href="#t02">Table 2</a>). This compares with the 20 studies compiled by Horton et al. (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>), which spanned from 12 cm at the low end of fifth percentile projections to 48 cm at the high end of 95th percentile projections. There are relatively few +2 °C studies to compare with our 2100 L projections, but those that are compiled in Horton et al. (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>) range from 0.2 m at the low end of fifth percentile projections to 1.1 m at the high end of the 95th percentile projections. The SEJ2018 distributions fall on the high side of this range, with a median projection of 0.7 m and a 90th percentile range of 0.4–1.3 m.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 2100 H projections fall within the existing range of RCP 8.5 projections, which have extended upward in recent years, substantially beyond the AR5 range. The 2100 H median projection of 1.1 m falls midway between the AR5 projection of 0.7 m and the 1.5 m that Kopp et al. (
  <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>) projected using the Antarctic ice sheet projections of DeConto and Pollard (
  <a rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" href="#r19">19</a>), which provided an initial attempt at explicit, continental-scale physical modeling of ice shelf hydrofracturing and marine ice cliff instability. The very likely range of 0.6–2.4 m falls within the 0.4–2.4-m low-fifth percentile to high-95th percentile range in the compilation of Horton et al. (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>). This comparison emphasizes the skewness of the expert distribution: although the median projection falls in the middle of recently published projections, the 95th percentile tracks the high end of published projections. Although none of these studies is entirely independent of the others, taken together, they provide strong support for recent coastal planning scenarios that anticipate SLR well above the AR5 range (
