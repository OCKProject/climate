         <p>West Antarctic climate variability over the last 200 years. 
            <span>a</span> Mean-annual temperature data at the Byrd weather station. 
            <span>b</span> Oxygen isotope (Î´
            <span>18</span>O) data from a collection of ice cores from the West Antarctic ice sheet. Gray shading
            shows decadal average with uncertainties. Vertical lines show the earliest year for
            which surface climate observations (red, 1957), climate reanalysis products (green,
            1979) and spatially-complete geophysical ice-sheet observations (blue, ~1990) are
            available. Figure modified from Steig et al.
