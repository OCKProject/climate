  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> were mostly influenced by current velocity, bathymetry and temperature, respectively. Nutrient uptake in coral reefs is directly affected by current speeds [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref103" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref103">103</a>], which shape their distribution in both shallow and deep waters [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref104" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref104">104</a>]. The 
  <span class="bold">M</span> area is under the influence of the Brazilian and the North Brazilian Current [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref105" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref105">105</a>]. Studies on genetic connectivity with the genus 
  <span class="italic">Mussismilia</span> (
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">hispida</span>) showed that these currents may consist in a barrier to coral dispersal [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref106" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref106">106</a>]. In shallow reefs, currents cause constant sediment resuspension, which influences the coverage and composition of benthic organisms [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref107" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref107">107</a>], changing the visibility of water [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref108" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref108">108</a>], influencing the microbial community of corals [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref109" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref109">109</a>] and the behavior of the coral larvae during the nesting phase [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref110" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref110">110</a>]. Considering that most records of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> result from shallow reefs, it is expected that the species is rather influenced by sediment resuspension. Despite Brazilian corals as a whole are resistant to the input of terrigenous sediments and to relatively turbid waters 101], 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> has preference for clear waters, in which it is more abundant [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature, salinity and light have major effects on where reef-building corals grow [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref112" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref112">112</a>]. Despite the temperature showed the lowest contribution for the CPH, it is undoubtedly determinant for the future persistence of coral species, as 50% of these corals are threatened by climate changes [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref012">12</a>]. Our results also show the importance of temperature in the FPH for 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span>. This species suffers thermal stress in temperatures higher than 31.0°C, leading to long-term damage or death [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref113" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref113">113</a>]. In fact, a recent study reported massive coral bleaching events in temperatures above 27° in Abrolhos reefs [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref114" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref114">114</a>], which concentrate most records of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> in the present study (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211171.g001" href="#pone.0211171.g001">Fig 1</a>). Climate change-related increase of temperature will affect wind regimes, ocean circulation and, consequently, precipitation and continental runoff, directly affecting the salinity in coastal waters [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref115" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref115">115</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref116" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref116">116</a>]. That may explain the spatial reduction in shallow waters projected in the FPH, and the increase in deeper zones. However, such habitat shifting can be related to several factors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another important factor is the competition with algae (macroalgae and filamentous algae). These organisms dominate Brazilian benthic communities on reefs down to 15 m deep [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref117" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref117">117</a>]. Algae are favored by anthropic impacts, such as reduction of herbivorous/grazer fishes by overfishing, and increase of land nutrient discharges [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref118" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref118">118</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref119" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref119">119</a>]. Thus, in future scenarios, algae will likely continue to be favored, and its competition with corals tends to reduce coverage of the later in shallow waters. In contrast, besides less light availability, deeper areas would be less susceptible to the influence of runoff, temperature and salinity changes. Despite the lack of earlier baselines for Brazilian benthic communities, it is possible to affirm that the current scenario is result of a sum of anthropic impacts, as studies back in the 1960’s describe distinctive zonation and coverage in these communities [
