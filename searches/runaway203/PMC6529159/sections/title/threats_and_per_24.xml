  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref011">11</a>]. Local impacts boost these effects through higher sedimentation, multiple biological invasions, bleaching, coral diseases and, consequently, loose of diversity on reef environments [

  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> used to be described as forming extensive bands on coastal reefs, showing colonies usually up to 1 m in diameter [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref120" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref120">120</a>]. Currently, this is a rare scenario for most of these reefs, which often have a low coral coverage, not corresponding the descriptions of the 1970’s.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental changes have triggered reorganizations in reef ecological relationships, zonation and dominance, in processes also called

  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref147" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref147">147</a>]. In most reefs, for example, scleractinian dominance have been replaced mainly by macroalgae [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref119" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref119">119</a>], octocorals [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The accelerated loss of biodiversity and habitats is one of the worst crisis of the present time, as evidenced by the ever increasing species red lists. All current and future scenarios showed herein alert for the relevance of the endemism and the role of

  <span class="italic">harttii</span> as a reef builder in Brazilian reefs. Currently, the species is classified as “in risk of extinction” [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref019">19</a>], and the perspective of reduction of suitable shallow areas highlight the urgency of priority conservation measures. Future environmental politics, therefore, must focus not only in the recovery of coastal populations, but also on the conservation of mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCE’s). Despite being less affected by climate changes, MCE’s are impacted by human activities, such as fisheries, mining and drilling [
