 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “deep reef refugia hypothesis” (DRRH) considers that coastal anthropic impacts and thermal stress effects are progressively reduced with depth [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref128" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref128">128</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref129" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref129">129</a>]. Therefore, mesophotic coral ecosystems, between 30 and 150 m, have been treated as important refugia for shallow reefs diversity [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref130" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref130">130</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref131" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref131">131</a>], temporarily supporting coral populations from shallow-reefs under stress conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref132" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref132">132</a>]. Such areas would provide shelter in which these populations might persist in a long time [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref129" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref129">129</a>], and from which would subsequently expand [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref133" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref133">133</a>], recovering previously damaged areas [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref117" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref117">117</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reduction of shallow suitable areas and increase of deeper habitats suggest the potential of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> for using mesophotic reefs as refugia, ensuring its subsistence. However, the DRRH is more adequate for species with wide depth distribution ranges [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref117" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref117">117</a>] and presupposes larvae exchange between deep and shallow populations [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref135" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref135">135</a>], which have been demonstrated to be local and species-specific [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref136" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref136">136</a>]. Despite 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> is particularly representative in shallow waters (2–6 m), scattered records show this species occupying deeper reefs (up to 80 m) [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref020">20</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref094">94</a>,

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0211171.s006" href="#pone.0211171.s006">S6 Appendix</a>), which reinforces the potential of the species to occupy deep mesophotic areas.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even showing wide depth ranges, connectivity between coral populations is not always continuous along bathymetric gradients [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref134" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref134">134</a>]. Consequently, it is still unknown if deeper populations of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> would serve as genetic stocks for shallow waters, as most of its deep records are sparse and rare [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref135" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref135">135</a>]. In any case, the expansion of deeper suitable areas may result in the expansion of deeper populations of 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span>, regardless of the maintenance of coastal populations. In case of connectivity, such refugia would contribute for the recolonization of the coastal zone affected.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies using of global climate models mostly suggest that few shallow coral species will persist under a sea surface temperature increase of 2°C in the next one hundred years [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref138" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref138">138</a>]. Nevertheless, given the current slowness in mitigation measures, it is expected an increase of 3.1°C in the same period (RCP 8.5) [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref139" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref139">139</a>]. In such scenarios, identify and protect deep sea refugia must become priorities for species conservation [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref131" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref131">131</a>], considering the various factors defining a potentially true refuge [
