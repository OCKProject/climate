 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predicting and mapping potential suitable habitats for threatened and endangered species is critical for monitoring and restoring their natural populations [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref091">91</a>]. In this sense, a modeling approach is an effective tool to predict the direction of contractions and expansions of species distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref092">92</a>], producing probability maps for the presence or relative suitability of a species [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref093">93</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides elevated CPH validation indexes, literature data (not geo-referenced and therefore not used in the model) also record 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> in areas indicated by the model as suitable for the species, such as the southern portion of the Abrolhos bank (Esp√≠rito Santo State) [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref094">94</a>]. A model that fails to omit known points of presence is less accurate than those predicting unknown inhabited areas [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref095">95</a>]. These unknown areas provide a precise representation of the spatial extent of habitable conditions for the species [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref082">82</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the FPH of the species (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211171.g005" href="#pone.0211171.g005">Fig 5</a>) extends beyond the calibration area of the model (
  <span class="bold">M</span>), it was already expected an area of potential species habitat larger than the real distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref065">65</a>]. Consequently, projections beyond the time interval of a training dataset (distribution in future dates) require cautious interpretations to avoid possible misinterpretations [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref096">96</a>]. Such caution is because AUC values tend to increase when the selected background area is larger than the observed current habitat of a species [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref097" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref097">97</a>]. Although the AUC values (close to 1) showed that the models performed very well with the results [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref090">90</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref091">91</a>] (better than any model generated with a set of random predictors [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref083">83</a>]), it was necessary to use a different approach to evaluate the models. In the AUC metric, the weight of commission errors is much lower than that of omission errors, which makes it an inappropriate performance measurement [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref098" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref098">98</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The AUCratio also showed a good performance of the model, with values above 1 [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref082">82</a>] and close to 2. These results allowed us to evaluate the statistical significance of the AUC itself [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref098" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref098">98</a>]. In this way, it is more appropriate to evaluate the model performances [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref084">84</a>]. The thresholds used to generate the binary maps are best suited for applications in ecological niche templates [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref087">87</a>] [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref039">39</a>] by better predicting independent occurrence data [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref046">46</a>] [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref099" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref099">99</a>] [
