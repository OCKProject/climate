  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The choice of the study area was based on a heuristic structure called

   <span class="bold">B</span> represents the population dynamics (competition, predation, dispute over food or area) in the area where biotic parameters are suitable for the species. Estimation of these parameters would require a dense set of observations over large spatial extensions [
   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref038">38</a>]. So we decided to neglect the effects of these biotic interactions on the modeling process. 
   <span class="bold">A</span> represents mainly the abiotic conditions that do not depend on the presence or abundance of the species [
   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref039">39</a>]. This geographic region is the fundamental niche of the species, which can potentially be invaded when both conditions are adequate (

   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref038">38</a>]. It defines the dispersal potential of a species if the barriers are removed [
   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref040">40</a>]. The parts of the world that have been accessible to the species via dispersal over relevant periods are symbolized by

   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref040">40</a>]. The subset of the fundamental niche that is actually represented on relevant landscapes (

   <span class="bold">M,</span> there may be truncation, which sub-characterizes niches and lead to different sets of problems for model transfer [
   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref042">42</a>]. Increasing the extent also often includes absences that are more distant environmentally from the presences, but due to the limitations of 
   <span class="bold">M</span>, makes the model look better than it actually is [
   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref040">40</a>]. Using a larger study region (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An extensive search was made in specialized literature (using the terms "Mussismilia", "harttii", "Brazil", and "Brasil"), with publications containing precise geographic information (latitude, longitude and/or georeferenced maps). Occurrence records with errors or lacking georeferenced were not used in the analyzes, resulting in a set of 147 records which were used to discuss the suitable areas provided by the models. The search focused on records of

   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref068">68</a>], because it presents consistent predictive performance compared to other algorithms [
   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref069">69</a>], especially when the number of occurrence points is low [

   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref074">74</a>], using the three variables of each set, modeling records (using checkerboard2 for partitioning of occurrence data), maximum background number (10000) and using the following parameter settings: multiplayer regularization values (0.5–4.0 with 0.5 intervals), six resource class configurations: L, LQ, H, LQH, LQHP and LQHPT (where L = linear, Q = quadratic, H = hinge, P = product and T = threshold). The Jackknife function of MaxEnt [
   <a rid="pone.0211171.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref075">75</a>] was used to identify the percentage of contribution for each variable. The best model for each set of variables (
   <a rid="pone.0211171.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0211171.t001">Table 1</a>) was chosen based on the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) values [
