 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The choice of the study area was based on a heuristic structure called 
  <span class="bold">BAM</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref037">37</a>]. 
  <span class="bold">B</span> represents the population dynamics (competition, predation, dispute over food or area) in the area where biotic parameters are suitable for the species. Estimation of these parameters would require a dense set of observations over large spatial extensions [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref038">38</a>]. So we decided to neglect the effects of these biotic interactions on the modeling process. 
  <span class="bold">A</span> represents mainly the abiotic conditions that do not depend on the presence or abundance of the species [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref039">39</a>]. This geographic region is the fundamental niche of the species, which can potentially be invaded when both conditions are adequate (
  <span class="bold">A ∩ B</span>) but the species has not yet been able to reach is represented by 
  <span class="bold">G’</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref038">38</a>]. It defines the dispersal potential of a species if the barriers are removed [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref040">40</a>]. The parts of the world that have been accessible to the species via dispersal over relevant periods are symbolized by 
  <span class="bold">M</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref040">40</a>]. The subset of the fundamental niche that is actually represented on relevant landscapes (
  <span class="bold">A</span> ∩ 
  <span class="bold">M</span>) is the occupied area and can be defined as the existing fundamental niche [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref041">41</a>]. Finally, this heuristic scheme then states that stable populations of a species will be found only in the region of intersection of 
  <span class="bold">B</span>, 
  <span class="bold">A</span> and 
  <span class="bold">M</span>, (
  <span class="bold">B</span> ∩ 
  <span class="bold">A</span> ∩ 
  <span class="bold">M</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref037">37</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Barve et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref040">40</a>] emphasized the importance of 
  <span class="bold">M</span> as the appropriate region through which models should be calibrated. If the fundamental niche extends beyond the environment boundaries represented in 
  <span class="bold">M,</span> there may be truncation, which sub-characterizes niches and lead to different sets of problems for model transfer [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref042">42</a>]. Increasing the extent also often includes absences that are more distant environmentally from the presences, but due to the limitations of 
  <span class="bold">M</span>, makes the model look better than it actually is [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref040">40</a>]. Using a larger study region (
  <span class="bold">G</span>') would prone the model to overfit environmental conditions present in the region where the species is known to occur, in situations referred as non-equilibrium distributions [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref043">43</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Owens et al.[
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref042">42</a>], models applied to centrally occurring species within 
  <span class="bold">M</span> environments should not present problems with extrapolation, even in the presence of new conditions within a transfer region (
  <span class="bold">G’</span>). This may produce more realistic predictions of the potential distribution of a species [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref042">42</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We divided the study area into two regions: The first one (
  <span class="bold">M</span>) is the area containing all occurrence records of the species and also includes the priority areas for its conservation, according to the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (Portaria N° 19, of March 9, 2016—ICMBio). 
  <span class="bold">M</span> extends between the states of Ceará and Espírito Santo in Brazil [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref037">37</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref040">40</a>]. The second region (
  <span class="bold">G’</span>) comprises the entire coastal zone of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, from the intertidal zone down to 100 m deep [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref044">44</a>]. The model was calibrated in 
  <span class="bold">M</span> and the potential habitat for the late 21st century was projected in 
  <span class="bold">G'</span> (
