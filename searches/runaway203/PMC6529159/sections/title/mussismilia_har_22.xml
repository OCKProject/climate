  <span class="italic">harttii</span> showed expansion of suitable areas, towards deeper sites where there are few records of this species. Concomitantly, there was a reduction of suitable shallow water areas, especially at the northeast distribution limit, which suffered the greatest losses (Figs

Our results also indicate the same in a future scenario (RCP 8.5) with a loss of 98.5% of the current suitable area (~ 25480.7 km

Thus, in a future scenario, the species would lose suitable habitats in coastal shallow sectors, followed by a gain of deeper habitats, which could serve as refugia in face of climate changes, if other environmental conditions such as luminosity, salinity and others are favorable [
