  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0211171.s003" href="#pone.0211171.s003">S3 Appendix</a>), the continuous maps of CPH and FPH were transformed into binary maps of suitability or probability [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref089">89</a>], in which pixels are classified as "adaptive / presence" and "non-adaptive / absence" [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref051">51</a>]. Through the maps with the presence pixels, we calculated the total area, the lost, gained and maintained areas. Additionally, we also calculated those areas in the depths of 0 to -20, -20 to -50, -50 to -75, andâ€”75 to -100 meters. All area analyzes (CPH and FPH) were developed in the
