 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coral reefs are one of the most ecologically valuable ecosystems on earth [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref001">1</a>] providing a number of ecosystem services [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref002">2</a>], such as shelter for associated fishes [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref003">3</a>] and crustaceans [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref004">4</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref005">5</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref007">7</a>], also serving as substrate for coralline algae [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref008">8</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref009">9</a>]. Stable water conditions are determinant for the maintenance of living corals on reefs [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref010">10</a>]. However, effects of climate changes put at least 50% of shallow-water species in critical risk of extinction in the next 20 years [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Southwestern Atlantic, coastal reef communities occur along of 3000 km of the Brazilian coastline [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref013">13</a>], showing high endemism of reef-building species [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref014">14</a>]. Four of those endemic species belong to the genus 
  <span class="italic">Mussismilia</span>, commonly known as brain-corals [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref015">15</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref016">16</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref017">17</a>]. Although molecular assessments on 
  <span class="italic">Mussismilia</span> are still rare [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref018">18</a>], the distinctiveness among species is well established, allowing rapid identification in the field [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref015">15</a>]. The genus has at least two species in risk of extinction: 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">braziliensis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref019">19</a>]. The first is restricted to shallow reefs of Bahia State and Abrolhos reefs, whereas the latter is found from the coast of Ceará to Espírito Santo States (from -3.822 to -18.0480 latitude).

  <span class="italic">Mussismilia harttii</span> is the main reef-building coral in northeastern Brazil [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref014">14</a>], usually found at depths of 2–6 m, with isolated records up to 80 m [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref020">20</a>]. It is a hermaphrodite spawner species, with an annual reproductive cycle, releasing its gametes between September and November new moons [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref021">21</a>]. Currently, 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> shows the lowest percentages of coverage among its congeners [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref022">22</a>] and populations in severe decline [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref019">19</a>]. Although its conservation status at the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) database is still regarded as “Data Deficient” (DD). however the “Red Book of the Brazilian Endangered Fauna” (2014, 2018), already classifies the species as EN (Endangered) [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref019">19</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of marine organisms, including corals, is determined by interactions of physical, chemical and biological factors [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref023">23</a>]. Based on that, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) approaches can provide information on the potential distribution of species within specific study areas [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref024">24</a>]. SDMs associate environmental or spatial data to a set of distributional information’s, such as distribution records [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref025">25</a>], adopting the general thesis that the best indicator of a species climatic requirements is its current distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref026">26</a>]. Based on that, models indicate the environmental conditions in which a given species may occur [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref027">27</a>], also indicating the most suitable areas for its occurrence [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref028">28</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref029">29</a>]. Modern SDMs studies began with BIOCLIM (the first SDM package), which became available in January 1984 [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref030">30</a>] and are broadly applied to: prevent marine bioinvasions [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref031">31</a>], conservation management planning [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref032">32</a>], and especially to studies on climate changes [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref033">33</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref034">34</a>], predicting possible shifts on geographical distributions of key species [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref035">35</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SDMs also can be used to calculate the relative adequacy of a given habitat occupied by a species and to estimate changes in such suitability over time [
  <a rid="pone.0211171.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211171.ref036">36</a>]. In the present study, we applied SDMs to generate maps of Current Potential Habitat (CPH) and Future Potential Habitat (FPH) for 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">harttii</span> by the end of the 21st century. These maps indicate potentially suitable areas and estimate habitat gains and losses in the different climatic scenarios projected. The projections will serve as tools for management plans and reef conservation in the southwestern Atlantic reefs.
