For all simulations, an initial spin-up procedure for ice-sheet temperatures is employed for which ice-sheet topography and surface temperature of the ice-sheet stay constant over 100 000 years. For the subsequent 100 000 year equilibrium run, the surface temperature from the GCM is corrected with a lapse rate of −8 °C km

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulations with ANICE and SICOPOLIS are performed including land-based and floating ice, whereas for the BASISM simulations only land ice is included in the simulations. For land ice all three models include the shallow ice approximation (SIA), which approximates the stress balance by only taking into account horizontal shear stress and lead to velocities that are dependent on depth
