         from the five remaining PlioMIP climate models to force three ISMs. In general, there
         is a greater degree of variation between the individual ISM reconstructions for the
         mPWP in terms of ice presence than has been shown in the modern experiments (Figs. 
         <a>3a, e</a> and 
         <a>4</a>). In total, the reconstructed AIS grounded ice volume varies from 19.68 × 10

         <a>4</a>). Over 85% of the simulations produced a reduction in grounded ice volume (13 of
         the 15 cases), compared to pre-industrial simulations, but only two cases resulted
         in an ice-sheet that was smaller than the initial PRISM3 reconstruction (Fig.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When considering West and East Antarctica separately, we simulate a reduced WAIS relative
         to the present for all of the PlioMIP models using ANICE. SICOPOLIS predicts a consistent
         reduction in ice over WAIS, with every climate model forcing resulting in a collapse
         of the marine basins leaving just a number of isolated ice-caps on the West Antarctic
         islands (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). The warmer-than-modern sub-shelf temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>3</a>) prevent ice-shelves from growing around Antarctica in the majority of simulations
         using ANICE and SICOPOLIS (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). BASISM shows the largest intra-model spread over West Antarctica, but as the only
         SIA model, it should be expected that the representation of ice over West Antarctica
         is not reliable.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over East Antarctica, none of the climate models produce conditions that allow the
         ISMs to attain the extent of retreat prescribed in the PRISM3 ice-sheet reconstruction,
         due to a predominantly positive SMB over the Wilkes and the Aurora SGB driven largely
         by increased precipitation in these regions (Fig. 
         <a>5</a> and Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>2</a> and 
         <a>4</a>). Figure 
         <a>3e</a> shows strong agreement between models in the centre of East Antarctica, however,
         only around 40% of the ensemble members suggest ice-sheet reduction over the Wilkes
         and Aurora SGBs. With ANICE, the Wilkes and the Aurora SGBs only remain open-ocean
         in the simulations using IPSLCM5A and NorESM-L, and there are also small portions
         of coastline that continue to be ice-free (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). With SICOPOLIS, there appears to be a much more consistent response in the Wilkes
         Land region whereby ice extends out from its initial PRISM3 grounding line, but does
         not entirely reach the modern coastline in any of the simulations (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). BASISM predicts a modern ice extent for all climate scenarios over East Antarctica,
         suggesting that the inclusion of higher order and grounding line physics are key to
         simulating ice-sheet reduction in this region. By using different ISMs, we can see
         that in terms areal extent and the details of predicting ice conditions in certain
         SGBs, the result is highly dependent on the choice of ISM and not necessarily simply
         reliant on the choice of climate model forcing.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A final observation for the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> ensemble is the large range of ice-sheet thickness predictions over the EAIS for
         the mPWP (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). Whilst this is anticipated in the regions where there is low agreement amongst
         the models regarding ice presence (e.g. Wilkes and Aurora SGBs; Fig. 
         <a>3e</a>), over the continental interior we still demonstrate thickness differences of over
         1.5 km. The range in GCM-predicted temperatures and precipitation rates over the EAIS
         corresponds to a large range in SMB in this region (varying from around 600 to 1800 Gt year
         <span>−1</span>), which is a likely contributor to broad differences in ice-sheet thickness in the
         centre of East Antarctica.
