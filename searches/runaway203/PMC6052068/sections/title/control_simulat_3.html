      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climatological fields from the PlioMIP pre-industrial experiments are used to
         predict a modern AIS, which can be compared with the Bedmap2 reconstruction
         <span><a>39</a></span>. We use forcing fields from each of the seven PlioMIP climate models to run simulations
         with three ISMs, producing an ensemble of 21 control simulations. Whilst there is
         some consistency across the ISMs in the prediction of the grounded extent of the modern
         ice-sheet, especially over the EAIS (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>), there are considerable differences in the predictions of the extent of the WAIS
         and also the ice-shelves.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A visual comparison of the simulated modern ice-sheets highlights some GCM–ISM combinations
         that result in a poor reconstruction of the present day ice-sheet. The final simulated
         modern AIS grounded ice volume varies considerably between the models (23.64 × 10
         <span>6</span>–37.36 × 10
         <span>6</span> km
         <span>3</span>), and is generally larger than the Bedmap2 reconstruction (26.54 × 10
         <span>6</span> km
         <span>3</span>; volume difference between Bedmap2 and ISM predictions equates to a difference in
         sea level of between +6.3 m s.e. and −25.3 m s.e. (metres of sea level equivalent);
         ref.
         <span><a>39</a></span>; Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). In order that we only consider GCM–ISM combinations that provide a reasonable representation
         of the modern AIS in our Pliocene analysis, we developed performance criteria to assess
         predictions of the modern AIS, whilst also comparing our results to the Bedmap2 AIS
         reconstruction (see Methods and Supplementary Note 
         <a>1</a>). This leads to the removal of MRI-CGCM2.3 and MIROC4m from the Pliocene analysis.
         Whilst it is beyond the scope of the current study to fully investigate the potential
         reasons for a volumetrically divergent prediction of the present-day AIS, we examine
         the likely climate forcings driving this (see Supplementary Note 
         <a>2</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It should be noted that the control simulations presented here were not tuned to give
         an optimal representation of the AIS using the different climate forcing fields and
         each ISM used only one set-up for each experiment (see Methods). This was done in
         order to allow for the assessment of model dependency of the results (without having
         to take into consideration the impact of potentially different ISM parameter value
         choices). We have shown that five out of the seven GCMs lead to a reasonable representation
         of present-day Antarctica. This gives us confidence when using the same model set-up
         to assess the climate model dependency of mid-Pliocene Antarctic simulations. For
         clarity, we have excluded two of the GCM–ISM combinations from our Pliocene analysis,
         however, the results from these GCM–ISMs are shown in Supplementary Figs.
