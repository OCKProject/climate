This was done in order to allow for the assessment of model dependency of the results (without having to take into consideration the impact of potentially different ISM parameter value choices). We have shown that five out of the seven GCMs lead to a reasonable representation of present-day Antarctica. This gives us confidence when using the same model set-up to assess the climate model dependency of mid-Pliocene Antarctic simulations. For clarity, we have excluded two of the GCM–ISM combinations from our Pliocene analysis, however, the results from these GCM–ISMs are shown in Supplementary Figs.

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over East Antarctica, none of the climate models produce conditions that allow the ISMs to attain the extent of retreat prescribed in the PRISM3 ice-sheet reconstruction, due to a predominantly positive SMB over the Wilkes and the Aurora SGB driven largely by increased precipitation in these regions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> and Supplementary Figs. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a> shows strong agreement between models in the centre of East Antarctica, however, only around 40% of the ensemble members suggest ice-sheet reduction over the Wilkes and Aurora SGBs. With ANICE, the Wilkes and the Aurora SGBs only remain open-ocean in the simulations using IPSLCM5A and NorESM-L, and there are also small portions of coastline that continue to be ice-free (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). With SICOPOLIS, there appears to be a much more consistent response in the Wilkes Land region whereby ice extends out from its initial PRISM3 grounding line, but does not entirely reach the modern coastline in any of the simulations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). BASISM predicts a modern ice extent for all climate scenarios over East Antarctica, suggesting that the inclusion of higher order and grounding line physics are key to simulating ice-sheet reduction in this region. By using different ISMs, we can see that in terms areal extent and the details of predicting ice conditions in certain SGBs, the result is highly dependent on the choice of ISM and not necessarily simply reliant on the choice of climate model forcing.

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A final observation for the Pliocene
   <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> ensemble is the large range of ice-sheet thickness predictions over the EAIS for the mPWP (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). Whilst this is anticipated in the regions where there is low agreement amongst the models regarding ice presence (e.g. Wilkes and Aurora SGBs; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>), over the continental interior we still demonstrate thickness differences of over 1.5 km. The range in GCM-predicted temperatures and precipitation rates over the EAIS corresponds to a large range in SMB in this region (varying from around 600 to 1800 Gt year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>), which is a likely contributor to broad differences in ice-sheet thickness in the centre of East Antarctica.

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One feature of the PlioMIP1 experimental design, based on the PRISM3 reconstruction of boundary conditions, is the specification of reduced ice-sheet volume and extent for the mPWP. The PRISM3 ice-sheet reconstruction was in line with sea level records that were published at the time the project commenced and was also based on some of the initial ISM reconstructions of the mPWP

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
   </span>. It can be argued that such a prescribed retreat in the climate modelling simulations will lead to the ISMs predicting a greater level of ice reduction than may have occurred in the warmest intervals of the Pliocene. However, to have prescribed a modern AIS in the PlioMIP1 GCMs would have also been incorrect, as this would have been incompatible with various lines of proxy evidence (e.g. sea level data). Ultimately, in the absence of reliable geological reconstructions of mPWP ice-sheets a choice must be made of how to initialise climate model simulations. It is nevertheless useful to test the sensitivity of our mid-Pliocene simulations to the prescribed PRISM3 ice-sheet in the climate models. It is not possible for each GCM to repeat their PlioMIP1 experiment with a different AIS boundary condition (e.g. modern), therefore we have analysed whether or not the initial conditions prescribed in the ISM impact upon the predicted result. We ran a suite of simulations where each ISM experiment was initialised from the Bedmap2 modern ice-sheet configuration (Pliocene

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of ice-sheet extent, most of the three ISMs showed a similar pattern of large-scale response, in that the Pliocene

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). In the SIA-SSA ISMs ocean conditions are warm enough to melt the majority of the ice shelves and reduce ice to the islands of West Antarctica for all of the simulations except those using forcing fields from CCSM4 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). ANICE displays a strong hysteresis over West Antarctica, as under the same climate conditions ice remains on the West Antarctic islands in Pliocene
   <sub>Ice-PD</sub>, whereas it is absent in the Pliocene
   <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> experiments. For the EAIS most models produce a similar surface topography to Pliocene
   <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> when using modern starting conditions, with the exception that no significant retreat is demonstrated in any model in the Wilkes and Aurora SGBs (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). This suggests that a modern sized EAIS would require additional forcing to retreat from a modern size than the standard PlioMIP experimental design, e.g. stronger insolation forcing and/or even higher concentrations of atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub>, when using SSA–SIA ISMs. Alternatively, this could highlight the potential need to include alternative grounding line physics within the ice-sheet modelling framework (e.g. ref.

   <sub>Ice-PD</sub>; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d</a>). For Pliocene
   <sub>Ice-PD</sub> an average sea level rise of 5.24 m s.e. from the WAIS is partially offset by a sea level fall from the EAIS (−2.80 m s.e.; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7e</a>) when considering only SIA-SSA ISMs. Similarly, the EAIS shows lower sea levels than the control (mean of −1.99 m s.e.) when considering the entire Pliocene
   <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> ensemble.
