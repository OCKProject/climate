            experiment, which included a reduced AIS
            <span><a>26</a></span> (see Methods). Near surface temperature differences over the AIS (including over
            ice shelves) simulated by the PlioMIP1 models range from +3.9 to +10.5 °C (relative

            <a>1</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). Circum-Antarctic ocean surface temperatures during the Pliocene are variable (between
            −1.6 and 2.1 °C higher than pre-industrial) with extrapolated sub-shelf temperatures
            reaching as much as 2.2 °C higher than pre-industrial (see Methods). Precipitation

            that result in a poor reconstruction of the present day ice-sheet. The final simulated
            modern AIS grounded ice volume varies considerably between the models (23.64 × 10

            <span>6</span> km
            <span>3</span>; volume difference between Bedmap2 and ISM predictions equates to a difference in
            sea level of between +6.3 m s.e. and −25.3 m s.e. (metres of sea level equivalent);
            ref.

            of the modern AIS in our Pliocene analysis, we developed performance criteria to assess
            predictions of the modern AIS, whilst also comparing our results to the Bedmap2 AIS
            reconstruction (see Methods and Supplementary Note 
            <a>1</a>). This leads to the removal of MRI-CGCM2.3 and MIROC4m from the Pliocene analysis.
            Whilst it is beyond the scope of the current study to fully investigate the potential
            reasons for a volumetrically divergent prediction of the present-day AIS, we examine
            the likely climate forcings driving this (see Supplementary Note

            an optimal representation of the AIS using the different climate forcing fields and
            each ISM used only one set-up for each experiment (see Methods). This was done in
            order to allow for the assessment of model dependency of the results (without having
            to take into consideration the impact of potentially different ISM parameter value
            choices). We have shown that five out of the seven GCMs lead to a reasonable representation
            of present-day Antarctica. This gives us confidence when using the same model set-up
            to assess the climate model dependency of mid-Pliocene Antarctic simulations. For
            clarity, we have excluded two of the GCM–ISM combinations from our Pliocene analysis,
            however, the results from these GCM–ISMs are shown in Supplementary Figs.

            to the present for all of the PlioMIP models using ANICE. SICOPOLIS predicts a consistent
            reduction in ice over WAIS, with every climate model forcing resulting in a collapse
            of the marine basins leaving just a number of isolated ice-caps on the West Antarctic

            is not reliable.

            ISMs to attain the extent of retreat prescribed in the PRISM3 ice-sheet reconstruction,
            due to a predominantly positive SMB over the Wilkes and the Aurora SGB driven largely
            by increased precipitation in these regions (Fig. 
            <a>5</a> and Supplementary Figs. 
            <a>2</a> and 
            <a>4</a>). Figure 
            <a>3e</a> shows strong agreement between models in the centre of East Antarctica, however,
            only around 40% of the ensemble members suggest ice-sheet reduction over the Wilkes
            and Aurora SGBs. With ANICE, the Wilkes and the Aurora SGBs only remain open-ocean
            in the simulations using IPSLCM5A and NorESM-L, and there are also small portions
            of coastline that continue to be ice-free (Fig. 
            <a>5</a>). With SICOPOLIS, there appears to be a much more consistent response in the Wilkes
            Land region whereby ice extends out from its initial PRISM3 grounding line, but does
            not entirely reach the modern coastline in any of the simulations (Fig. 
            <a>5</a>). BASISM predicts a modern ice extent for all climate scenarios over East Antarctica,
            suggesting that the inclusion of higher order and grounding line physics are key to
            simulating ice-sheet reduction in this region. By using different ISMs, we can see
            that in terms areal extent and the details of predicting ice conditions in certain
            SGBs, the result is highly dependent on the choice of ISM and not necessarily simply
            reliant on the choice of climate model forcing.

            <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> ensemble is the large range of ice-sheet thickness predictions over the EAIS for
            the mPWP (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>5</a>). Whilst this is anticipated in the regions where there is low agreement amongst
            the models regarding ice presence (e.g. Wilkes and Aurora SGBs; Fig. 
            <a>3e</a>), over the continental interior we still demonstrate thickness differences of over
            1.5 km. The range in GCM-predicted temperatures and precipitation rates over the EAIS
            corresponds to a large range in SMB in this region (varying from around 600 to 1800 Gt year
            <span>−1</span>), which is a likely contributor to broad differences in ice-sheet thickness in the

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One feature of the PlioMIP1 experimental design, based on the PRISM3 reconstruction
            of boundary conditions, is the specification of reduced ice-sheet volume and extent
            for the mPWP. The PRISM3 ice-sheet reconstruction was in line with sea level records
            that were published at the time the project commenced and was also based on some of
            the initial ISM reconstructions of the mPWP
            <span><a>19</a>,
               <a>26</a></span>. It can be argued that such a prescribed retreat in the climate modelling simulations
            will lead to the ISMs predicting a greater level of ice reduction than may have occurred
            in the warmest intervals of the Pliocene. However, to have prescribed a modern AIS
            in the PlioMIP1 GCMs would have also been incorrect, as this would have been incompatible
            with various lines of proxy evidence (e.g. sea level data). Ultimately, in the absence
            of reliable geological reconstructions of mPWP ice-sheets a choice must be made of
            how to initialise climate model simulations. It is nevertheless useful to test the
            sensitivity of our mid-Pliocene simulations to the prescribed PRISM3 ice-sheet in
            the climate models. It is not possible for each GCM to repeat their PlioMIP1 experiment
            with a different AIS boundary condition (e.g. modern), therefore we have analysed
            whether or not the initial conditions prescribed in the ISM impact upon the predicted
            result. We ran a suite of simulations where each ISM experiment was initialised from
            the Bedmap2 modern ice-sheet configuration (Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PD</sub>; Figs. 
            <a>4</a> and 
            <a>6</a>). This provides a good test of whether or not the models can simulate a retreat from
            the present-day grounding line, given the imposed Pliocene climate forcing.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of ice-sheet extent, most of the three ISMs showed a similar pattern of large-scale
            response, in that the Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PD</sub> equilibrium AIS was larger than the Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> ice-sheets, but smaller than the modern reconstruction (Figs. 
            <a>4</a> and 
            <a>6</a>). In the SIA-SSA ISMs ocean conditions are warm enough to melt the majority of the
            ice shelves and reduce ice to the islands of West Antarctica for all of the simulations
            except those using forcing fields from CCSM4 (Fig. 
            <a>6</a>). ANICE displays a strong hysteresis over West Antarctica, as under the same climate
            conditions ice remains on the West Antarctic islands in Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PD</sub>, whereas it is absent in the Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> experiments. For the EAIS most models produce a similar surface topography to Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> when using modern starting conditions, with the exception that no significant retreat
            is demonstrated in any model in the Wilkes and Aurora SGBs (Fig. 
            <a>6</a>). This suggests that a modern sized EAIS would require additional forcing to retreat
            from a modern size than the standard PlioMIP experimental design, e.g. stronger insolation
            forcing and/or even higher concentrations of atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub>, when using SSA–SIA ISMs. Alternatively, this could highlight the potential need
            to include alternative grounding line physics within the ice-sheet modelling framework
            (e.g. ref. 
            <span><a>21</a></span>).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of volume, BASISM and ANICE tend to predict ice-sheets for Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PD</sub> that are relatively close to their predicted Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> volume (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). Predictions from the SICOPOLIS model are often more divergent with the Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PD</sub> being larger than the Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> by an average of 3.8 × 10
            <span>6</span> km
            <span>3</span>. This is most likely attributable to the different ways in which the ISMs compute
            SMB. In particular, the method of converting total precipitation to effective accumulation
            is different between the ISMs.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contributions of Antarctica to sea level are shown in Fig. 
            <a>7</a> (see Methods for sea level calculations). On average the 10 SIA-SSA simulations,
            which have also been used in the Pliocene analysis overestimate the present-day ice
            volume by 2.13 m s.e. for the control simulations relative to Bedmap2 (Fig. 
            <a>7a</a>). For the mPWP, we consider sea level contribution for the whole of Antarctica for
            Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> and Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PD</sub> relative to Bedmap2 and as a change from the control prediction using the same climate
            model forcing for each ISM (Fig. 
            <a>7a, d</a>; Table 
            <a>1</a>). We focus on our predictions relative to the control prediction from each ensemble
            member as this goes some way to reduce any biases inherent in our modern simulations,
            i.e. the too large modern ice-sheet predictions. Our results show that mean sea level
            change relative to the control simulation (calculated from SIA-SSA simulations only)
            is 7.79 ± 4.06 m s.e. (1 standard deviation, Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub>) and 2.43 ± 3.53 m s.e. (1 standard deviation, Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PD</sub>; Fig. 
            <a>7d</a>). For Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PD</sub> an average sea level rise of 5.24 m s.e. from the WAIS is partially offset by a sea
            level fall from the EAIS (−2.80 m s.e.; Fig. 
            <a>7e</a>) when considering only SIA-SSA ISMs. Similarly, the EAIS shows lower sea levels than
            the control (mean of −1.99 m s.e.) when considering the entire Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> ensemble.
