         Fig. 
         <a>1</a>) were taken from results of the coupled-atmosphere ocean climate simulations run
         as part of the PlioMIP project. Full details for the experimental design of PlioMIP
         can be found in ref. 
         <span><a>27</a></span>. Briefly it involved the implementation of PRISM3 boundary conditions
         <span><a>26</a></span> in IPCC AR4 class general circulation models (GCMs). PRISM3 boundary conditions included
         increased atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations, an altered palaeogeography, including changes to the land-sea mask
         (LSM), a changed vegetation cover
         <span><a>55</a></span> and altered Pliocene ice-sheet configurations. In PRISM3 West Antarctica is deglaciated
         and East Antarctica is retreated beyond the marine portions of the Wilkes and Aurora
         SGB
         <span><a>56</a></span>. Where possible, modelling groups were asked to alter their LSM to allow for a West
         Antarctic Seaway. More details of the seven GCMs that have been used in this study
         and their implementation of the PRISM3 boundary conditions can be found in Supplementary
