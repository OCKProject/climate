  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Circum-Antarctic ocean surface temperatures during the Pliocene are variable (between −1.6 and 2.1 °C higher than pre-industrial) with extrapolated sub-shelf temperatures reaching as much as 2.2 °C higher than pre-industrial (see Methods). Precipitation over Antarctica in general increases to around 0.8 mm day
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in the Pliocene simulations from an average of 0.55 mm day

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). On average, Pliocene surface air temperatures over West Antarctica (WAIS) are predicted to be 15 °C warmer than East Antarctica (EAIS). The warmest areas of East Antarctica are around the Wilkes Land margin, in the region that was prescribed as ice-free in the PRISM3 boundary conditions (Supplementary Fig.
