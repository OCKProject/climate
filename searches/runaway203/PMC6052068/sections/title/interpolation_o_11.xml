 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All ice-sheet models are run on a 40 km by 40 km grid of 141 × 141 grid points. All climate fields from the GCMs, i.e. surface-air temperature, precipitation, ocean temperature and reference topography, are interpolated on the ice-sheet rectangular grid using OBLIMAP v2.0. A polar stereographic projection is employed, using a central longitude of 0°E and a standard parallel of 24.7°, i.e. a latitude of true scale of 65.3°S
