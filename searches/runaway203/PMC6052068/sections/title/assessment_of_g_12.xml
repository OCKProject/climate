Additionally, we have considered each GCM individually to assess whether the predicted volumes (from the three ISMs) fall within the range of the mean plus or minus the standard deviation of the other models. If we assume a normal distribution, we would expect, on average 68% of predicted volumes to fall within this range. In cases where only one or no present-day simulations are within one standard deviation of the mean, it suggests that this particular GCM is producing ice-sheets significantly different from the others and is skewing the ensemble means (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Where a GCM falls outside of the ensemble mean (±1 standard deviation) and also demonstrates poor skill in reconstructing elements of either volume, area or ice-sheet thickness the GCM has been excluded (see Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Nevertheless, for completeness and to demonstrate the effect of including all GCM–ISM combinations, all results are shown in Supplementary Figs.
