      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we use seven of the coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate models (GCMs) from
         PlioMIP Phase 1 (HadCM3
         <span><a>32</a></span> as used in ref. 
         <span><a>28</a></span>, COSMOS
         <span><a>33</a></span>, CCSM4
         <span><a>34</a></span>, IPSLCM5A

         <span><a>36</a></span>, MRI-CGCM2.3

         <span><a>38</a></span>; Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a>) in order to provide climatological forcing for the ISMs. A summary of key climate
         model components can be found in ref. 
         <span><a>1</a></span> and the differences in model resolution are shown in Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a>. All of the PlioMIP1 models implemented PRISM3 boundary conditions for their mid-Pliocene
         experiment, which included a reduced AIS
         <span><a>26</a></span> (see Methods). Near surface temperature differences over the AIS (including over
         ice shelves) simulated by the PlioMIP1 models range from +3.9 to +10.5 °C (relative
         to the pre-Industrial; Fig. 
         <a>1</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). Circum-Antarctic ocean surface temperatures during the Pliocene are variable (between
         −1.6 and 2.1 °C higher than pre-industrial) with extrapolated sub-shelf temperatures
         reaching as much as 2.2 °C higher than pre-industrial (see Methods). Precipitation
         over Antarctica in general increases to around 0.8 mm day
         <span>−1</span> in the Pliocene simulations from an average of 0.55 mm day
         <span>−1</span> (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). On average, Pliocene surface air temperatures over West Antarctica (WAIS) are predicted
         to be 15 °C warmer than East Antarctica (EAIS). The warmest areas of East Antarctica
         are around the Wilkes Land margin, in the region that was prescribed as ice-free in
         the PRISM3 boundary conditions (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>2</a>).
