         ref. 
         <span><a>27</a></span> and presented in ref. 
         <span><a>28</a></span>. Here, we ran simulations with three different ice-sheet model focussing on the equilibrium
         response of the ice-sheet to seven different climate models from the PlioMIP ensemble
         <span><a>1</a></span>. An ensemble of simulations was performed for three different scenarios. The first
         scenario was a control experiment with climate forcings from the GCMs that were run
         with pre-industrial boundary conditions. The second was a Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> experiment with climate forcings from the GCMs that were run with Pliocene boundary
         conditions. The ice-sheet models were initialised with the PRISM3 ice-sheet topography
         <span><a>28</a></span>. The final scenario was a Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PD</sub> experiment with climate forcings from the GCMs that were run with Pliocene boundary
         conditions. The ice-sheet models were initialised with the PD ice-sheet topography
         from Bedmap2

         employed for which ice-sheet topography and surface temperature of the ice-sheet stay
         constant over 100 000 years. For the subsequent 100 000 year equilibrium run, the
         surface temperature from the GCM is corrected with a lapse rate of −8 °C km

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulations with ANICE and SICOPOLIS are performed including land-based and floating
         ice, whereas for the BASISM simulations only land ice is included in the simulations.
         For land ice all three models include the shallow ice approximation (SIA), which approximates
         the stress balance by only taking into account horizontal shear stress and lead to
         velocities that are dependent on depth
         <span><a>57</a></span>. On the contrary, for floating ice we apply the SSA that only includes longitudinal
         stress and vertically independent horizontal velocities
