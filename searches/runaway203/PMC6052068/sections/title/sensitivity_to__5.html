      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One feature of the PlioMIP1 experimental design, based on the PRISM3 reconstruction
         of boundary conditions, is the specification of reduced ice-sheet volume and extent
         for the mPWP. The PRISM3 ice-sheet reconstruction was in line with sea level records
         that were published at the time the project commenced and was also based on some of
         the initial ISM reconstructions of the mPWP
         <span><a>19</a>,
            <a>26</a></span>. It can be argued that such a prescribed retreat in the climate modelling simulations
         will lead to the ISMs predicting a greater level of ice reduction than may have occurred
         in the warmest intervals of the Pliocene. However, to have prescribed a modern AIS
         in the PlioMIP1 GCMs would have also been incorrect, as this would have been incompatible
         with various lines of proxy evidence (e.g. sea level data). Ultimately, in the absence
         of reliable geological reconstructions of mPWP ice-sheets a choice must be made of
         how to initialise climate model simulations. It is nevertheless useful to test the
         sensitivity of our mid-Pliocene simulations to the prescribed PRISM3 ice-sheet in
         the climate models. It is not possible for each GCM to repeat their PlioMIP1 experiment
         with a different AIS boundary condition (e.g. modern), therefore we have analysed
         whether or not the initial conditions prescribed in the ISM impact upon the predicted
         result. We ran a suite of simulations where each ISM experiment was initialised from
         the Bedmap2 modern ice-sheet configuration (Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PD</sub>; Figs. 
         <a>4</a> and 
         <a>6</a>). This provides a good test of whether or not the models can simulate a retreat from
         the present-day grounding line, given the imposed Pliocene climate forcing.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of ice-sheet extent, most of the three ISMs showed a similar pattern of large-scale
         response, in that the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PD</sub> equilibrium AIS was larger than the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> ice-sheets, but smaller than the modern reconstruction (Figs. 
         <a>4</a> and 
         <a>6</a>). In the SIA-SSA ISMs ocean conditions are warm enough to melt the majority of the
         ice shelves and reduce ice to the islands of West Antarctica for all of the simulations
         except those using forcing fields from CCSM4 (Fig. 
         <a>6</a>). ANICE displays a strong hysteresis over West Antarctica, as under the same climate
         conditions ice remains on the West Antarctic islands in Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PD</sub>, whereas it is absent in the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> experiments. For the EAIS most models produce a similar surface topography to Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> when using modern starting conditions, with the exception that no significant retreat
         is demonstrated in any model in the Wilkes and Aurora SGBs (Fig. 
         <a>6</a>). This suggests that a modern sized EAIS would require additional forcing to retreat
         from a modern size than the standard PlioMIP experimental design, e.g. stronger insolation
         forcing and/or even higher concentrations of atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub>, when using SSA–SIA ISMs. Alternatively, this could highlight the potential need
         to include alternative grounding line physics within the ice-sheet modelling framework
         (e.g. ref. 
         <span><a>21</a></span>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of volume, BASISM and ANICE tend to predict ice-sheets for Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PD</sub> that are relatively close to their predicted Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> volume (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). Predictions from the SICOPOLIS model are often more divergent with the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PD</sub> being larger than the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> by an average of 3.8 × 10
         <span>6</span> km
         <span>3</span>. This is most likely attributable to the different ways in which the ISMs compute
         SMB. In particular, the method of converting total precipitation to effective accumulation
         is different between the ISMs.
