      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All of the control ISM simulations were assessed in terms of how well they reconstruct
         the modern AIS (when compared to Bedmap2
         <span><a>39</a></span> (see Supplementary Note 
         <a>1</a> and Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>7</a>–
         <a>9</a>)). Additionally, we have considered each GCM individually to assess whether the predicted
         volumes (from the three ISMs) fall within the range of the mean plus or minus the
         standard deviation of the other models. If we assume a normal distribution, we would
         expect, on average 68% of predicted volumes to fall within this range. In cases where
         only one or no present-day simulations are within one standard deviation of the mean,
         it suggests that this particular GCM is producing ice-sheets significantly different
         from the others and is skewing the ensemble means (Supplementary Table 
         <a>2</a> and 
         <a>S3</a>). Where a GCM falls outside of the ensemble mean (±1 standard deviation) and also
         demonstrates poor skill in reconstructing elements of either volume, area or ice-sheet
         thickness the GCM has been excluded (see Supplementary Note 
         <a>1</a>). Nevertheless, for completeness and to demonstrate the effect of including all GCM–ISM
         combinations, all results are shown in Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>11</a> to 
         <a>13</a>.
