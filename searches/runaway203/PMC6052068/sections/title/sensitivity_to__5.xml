 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One feature of the PlioMIP1 experimental design, based on the PRISM3 reconstruction of boundary conditions, is the specification of reduced ice-sheet volume and extent for the mPWP. The PRISM3 ice-sheet reconstruction was in line with sea level records that were published at the time the project commenced and was also based on some of the initial ISM reconstructions of the mPWP

  </span>. It can be argued that such a prescribed retreat in the climate modelling simulations will lead to the ISMs predicting a greater level of ice reduction than may have occurred in the warmest intervals of the Pliocene. However, to have prescribed a modern AIS in the PlioMIP1 GCMs would have also been incorrect, as this would have been incompatible with various lines of proxy evidence (e.g. sea level data). Ultimately, in the absence of reliable geological reconstructions of mPWP ice-sheets a choice must be made of how to initialise climate model simulations. It is nevertheless useful to test the sensitivity of our mid-Pliocene simulations to the prescribed PRISM3 ice-sheet in the climate models. It is not possible for each GCM to repeat their PlioMIP1 experiment with a different AIS boundary condition (e.g. modern), therefore we have analysed whether or not the initial conditions prescribed in the ISM impact upon the predicted result. We ran a suite of simulations where each ISM experiment was initialised from the Bedmap2 modern ice-sheet configuration (Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PD</sub>; Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). This provides a good test of whether or not the models can simulate a retreat from the present-day grounding line, given the imposed Pliocene climate forcing.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of ice-sheet extent, most of the three ISMs showed a similar pattern of large-scale response, in that the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PD</sub> equilibrium AIS was larger than the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> ice-sheets, but smaller than the modern reconstruction (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). In the SIA-SSA ISMs ocean conditions are warm enough to melt the majority of the ice shelves and reduce ice to the islands of West Antarctica for all of the simulations except those using forcing fields from CCSM4 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). ANICE displays a strong hysteresis over West Antarctica, as under the same climate conditions ice remains on the West Antarctic islands in Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PD</sub>, whereas it is absent in the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> experiments. For the EAIS most models produce a similar surface topography to Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> when using modern starting conditions, with the exception that no significant retreat is demonstrated in any model in the Wilkes and Aurora SGBs (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). This suggests that a modern sized EAIS would require additional forcing to retreat from a modern size than the standard PlioMIP experimental design, e.g. stronger insolation forcing and/or even higher concentrations of atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub>, when using SSA–SIA ISMs. Alternatively, this could highlight the potential need to include alternative grounding line physics within the ice-sheet modelling framework (e.g. ref.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of volume, BASISM and ANICE tend to predict ice-sheets for Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PD</sub> that are relatively close to their predicted Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> volume (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Predictions from the SICOPOLIS model are often more divergent with the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PD</sub> being larger than the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> by an average of 3.8 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">3</span>. This is most likely attributable to the different ways in which the ISMs compute SMB. In particular, the method of converting total precipitation to effective accumulation is different between the ISMs.
