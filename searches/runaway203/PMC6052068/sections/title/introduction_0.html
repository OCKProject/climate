      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A warm interval during the Late Pliocene (the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period; mPWP; 3.264–3.025 Ma)
         offers the most recent time in Earth history where global annual mean temperatures
         were on average 1.8–3.6 °C higher
         <span><a>1</a></span> and while variable, carbon dioxide concentrations are suggested to be elevated relative
         to the pre-industrial
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>3</a></span>. Estimates of sea level change between 10 and 30 m above present day
         <span><a>4</a>–
            <a>8</a></span> have been reconstructed based on geological evidence, suggesting that a significant
         contribution to sea level from both the Greenland and Antarctic Ice-sheets (AIS) is
         required at certain intervals within the mPWP. This makes the mPWP an important interval
         to understand in terms of future climate change and ice-sheet stability
         <span><a>9</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extent and nature of the AIS during the mPWP remains uncertain. Sedimentological
         evidence from the ANDRILL core suggests that there were periods where no ice was present
         on West Antarctica (WAIS) during the Pliocene
         <span><a>10</a></span>. Marine records from the margin of East Antarctica also have been interpreted to
         suggest a dynamic EAIS margin at this time
         <span><a>11</a>–
            <a>13</a></span>. A more recent study used a combination of cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages alongside
         ice-sheet modelling to suggest that the EAIS continental interior could have been
         up to 600 m higher than present
         <span><a>14</a></span>. Such limited direct proxy evidence means that ice-sheet modelling is particularly
         important in understanding more about the behaviour and dynamics of ice-sheets during
         the Pliocene.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous modelling studies have supported the geological inferences and shown the
         potential for significant ice-sheet collapse events during the Pliocene in West Antarctica
         <span><a>15</a></span>. However, models are not in agreement as to what degree the EAIS could vary during
         the warmer intervals of the Pliocene
         <span><a>16</a></span>. Transient simulations with ice-sheet models (ISMs) have not shown significant ice
         retreat in the areas that proxy data suggests
         <span><a>17</a>,
            <a>18</a></span>. However, studies using climate forcings derived from climate models with imposed
         Pliocene boundary conditions (e.g. the PRISM boundary conditions; Pliocene Research,
         Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping) to force shallow ice approximation (SIA) ISMs
         have shown the potential for ice-sheet reduction
         <span><a>19</a>,
            <a>20</a></span>. More recent studies have advocated the inclusion of alternative physics within ISMs
         in order to facilitate the simulation of different extents of the Pliocene AIS
         <span><a>21</a>–
            <a>23</a></span>, and these have shown the potential for marine incursions into the Wilkes and Aurora
         subglacial basins (SGB). Nevertheless, it is difficult to perform a true comparison
         between such previous studies due to the very different models and modelling frameworks
         that have been adopted.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (Part 1; PlioMIP1)
         <span><a>1</a>,
            <a>24</a></span> offers a unique opportunity to test the dependency of ice-sheet simulations to the
         climate model forcing that is implemented. The models used in PlioMIP1 are similar
         in terms of complexity (all having atmosphere, land-surface, coupled ocean and sea-ice
         components) and are all models that were represented in the IPCC 5th Assessment report
         <span><a>25</a></span>. All of the PlioMIP1 models implemented PRISM3 boundary conditions for their mid-Pliocene
         experiment, which included a reduced AIS
         <span><a>26</a></span> (see Methods). It has been shown previously, that whilst the PlioMIP1 model results
         have commonalities in terms of the large-scale features of Pliocene climate, there
         is substantial regional variation in the sensitivity of models to the implementation
         of the Pliocene boundary conditions
         <span><a>1</a></span>. Therefore, it is useful to assess the impact of any simulated regional climate differences
         over Antarctica on the prediction of the Pliocene.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we present results from the Pliocene Ice-sheet Modelling Intercomparison Project
         (PLISMIP)
         <span><a>27</a></span>, which was initiated in order to understand the extent to which using different climate
         and ISMs changes the predicted ice-sheet configuration for the warm Pliocene. We use
         output from the climate modelling intercomparison project, PlioMIP
         <span><a>1</a>,
            <a>24</a></span>, to force ice-sheet simulations of the mPWP. The significance of using different
         ISMs has been demonstrated previously
         <span><a>28</a></span> and therefore, here we force three different ISMs (representing different levels
         of complexity; ANICE
         <span><a>18</a></span>, SICOPOLIS
         <span><a>29</a>,
            <a>30</a></span> and BASISM
         <span><a>31</a></span>) and simulate equilibrium ice-sheets following the initial PLISMIP experimental set-up
         <span><a>27</a></span> (see Methods). Using our ensemble of simulations, we demonstrate that there is a
         high level of climate model dependency in the reconstruction of the present-day AIS
         as well as the mPWP AIS. This is especially so in terms of the reconstructed ice volume.
         For the Pliocene, we use both PRISM3 and present-day AIS configurations to initialise
         our ISMs. We show that in general when using PRISM3 initial conditions in the ISMs,
         there is a consistent reduction in the broad extent of the WAIS in the Pliocene. However,
         some ensemble members retain ice over the West Antarctic Islands, while others lose
         this ice completely. When using present-day ice-sheet initial conditions different
         outcomes arise. One model predicts a WAIS with an extent equivalent to modern, whereas
         the remaining ice-sheet simulations reduce the size of WAIS. Over East Antarctica,
         the areas of ice reduction in the Pliocene (when compared to modern) differ according
         to which climate forcing but also importantly which of the ISMs is employed. It is
         worthy of note that there is more consistency in the results when present-day initial
         conditions are used within the ISMs. We conclude that it is very important to acknowledge
         the likely biases in Pliocene ice-sheet simulation based on a single model or even
         combination of models. Whilst it is useful to show the plausible range in Pliocene
         AIS reconstructions as a result of choosing different GCMs or ISMs, it is difficult
         to use the results presented here to directly inform us about the exact configuration
         of the AIS during the warmest intervals of the Pliocene due to insufficient geological
         data constraints on the ice-sheet itself.
