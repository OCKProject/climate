 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to be confident in model predictions, it is critical to quantify the impact of various sources of uncertainty on palaeo ice-sheet reconstructions. The quantification of uncertainty introduced by the choice of climate model or ISM used has been the primary goal of the PLISMIP project presented here and in previous papers

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate a high level of climate model dependency in reconstructing the Antarctic ice-sheet volume (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) and resulting sea level change (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). Given the complex nature of the PlioMIP1 climate models used to provide our forcing fields, understanding the reasons for differences in the ISM predictions is non-trivial. It is clear that some of the major variations in the simulated extent and volume of the AIS for the Pliocene scenarios are closely linked to the way temperature, precipitation and ocean temperatures are predicted among the climate models. Warming among the PlioMIP1 climate models in the Antarctic region has been previously attributed to the changes in the cryosphere and surface albedo
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. Over Antarctica, the clear sky albedo is the dominant component of the energy balance, which leads to increased warming in all PlioMIP models south of 75°S (although there is a large range in warming at 90°S (1.5–12 °C))

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference in the results from the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> ensemble (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>) and the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PD</sub> ensemble (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>) also shows the level to which the equilibrium ice-sheet predictions are dependent upon the history of the ice-sheet system (hysteresis); in this case, the specific initial conditions used in the ISM set-up. This is most clearly demonstrated in the results using ANICE and SICOPOLIS driven by the CCSM4 climate model. CCSM4 exhibits some of the coldest sub-shelf ocean temperatures, especially over the Ross Ice Shelf (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>), and has the coldest temperatures (~−25 °C) over West Antarctica of the considered PlioMIP models (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). This may be in part due to the higher albedo levels in CCSM4 (
  <span class="italic">α</span> = ~0.6) over West Antarctica relative to the other GCMs helping to promote cooling. In the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> simulation, the precipitation rates over West Antarctica are not sufficient to create a strong positive SMB (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>), thus the results from CCSM4 are in line with the other GCMs (in that the Pliocene WAIS remains collapsed from the initial PRISM3 starting configuration; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). However, when the ISMs are initialised with a modern AIS (Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PD</sub>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>), hysteresis is strong due to the fact that the combination of lapse-rate corrected temperatures that are applied and ocean-driven melting are not sufficient to cause a reduction of the WAIS and associated retreat of the ice shelves in either ISM.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As we have shown a broad spread in sea level changes associated with our ensemble of AIS predictions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d</a>), it is useful to understand how these compare to sea level data and also other modelling studies for the mPWP in order to assess which of a number of sources of uncertainty lead to the largest range in predictions of the AIS (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The results presented here indicate that the spread in sea level change predictions for the mPWP from the PlioMIP ensemble (based on the difference to the modern volume) using the SIA-SSA models is between 2.24 m s.e. (ANICE with HadCM3) and 14.57 m s.e. (SICOPOLIS with IPSLCM5A) for the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> scenario (the mean is 7.79 m s.e.). Using just the ANICE ISM, the range in sea level change predictions is 7.04 m s.e. for the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> simulations, and for the SICOPOLIS ISM the range is slightly larger (11.64 m s.e.; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d</a>). However, the average difference between the predictions of the two SSA–SIA ISMs using one climate model forcing is only 4.35 m s.e., which shows that the results are more dependent upon the chosen climate model forcing and not the ISM used. However, both have an impact on the determined result. The range in mean sea level change predicted here in both of our Pliocene scenarios is 14.57 to −3.99 m s.e. using only SIA-SSA ISMs. This demonstrates that the choice of initial conditions imposed in the ISMs is an important control on the total range of sea level predictions, as demonstrated previously

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Focussing primarily on studies employing SIA-SSA models, Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> provides a summary of previous work assessing various sources of uncertainty in predicting the Pliocene AIS (see also ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>). Following a similar experimental design to that presented here and initialising from a PRISM3 ice-sheet, ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> predicted a range in mean sea level rise for equilibrium Pliocene ice-sheets of 5.83 m s.e. (7.96–13.79 m s.e.) when considering six different SIA-SSA ISMs but only one climate model forcing (HadCM3). The comparable range shown here incorporating five different GCMs is 12.33 m s.e., supporting the conclusion that climate model dependency on AIS predictions for the Pliocene is high.

  </span>. They simulated AIS configurations ranging from −4.2 to 6.6 m s.e. volume (causing a 10.8 m s.e. variation due to parameter uncertainty). In the same study, temperature and precipitation were also increased in steps of 1 °C for temperature and 5.1% increase in precipitation per degree of temperature change in order to explore the influence of uncertainty in the Pliocene climate forcing on the modelled AIS. Considering this additional warming, the mass loss of the AIS relates to a global mean sea level rise of 6.2–13.0 m relative to present day (range of 6.8 m s.e.; ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>

  </span> and Antarctic bedrock topography
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span> have also been considered in a Pliocene ISM framework, however, these mechanisms only cause a small variation in predicted AIS volume and hence mean sea level change (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Therefore, it is clear from our results that in terms of the range of predictions of global mean sea level change, the climate model chosen has the potential to exert a larger influence on the results than the ISM, ISM parameterisations or changes in topography.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While ideally proxy-based estimates of global mean sea level change for the mPWP could be used to constrain which of the modelled AIS scenarios is more or less likely, significant uncertainty remains in the estimates of Pliocene sea level high stands

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. Recent studies inferring sea level changes from oxygen isotopes have offered a more constrained reconstruction of Pliocene sea level, suggesting that high-stands were between 9 and 13.5 m above modern, implying that the EAIS may be less sensitive during the Pliocene than previously considered
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. A further study using a novel approach to constrain mPWP sea level high stands by assessing whether or not particular AIS configurations are consistent with the oxygen isotope record have suggested that AIS contribution to mPWP sea level rise was at most ~13 m
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. However, a recent review
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span> of the sources of uncertainty associated with using marine geochemical proxies to infer past changes in sea level (e.g. refs. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>), has shown that diagenesis and potential long-term changes in seawater chemistry likely have large and poorly constrained effects on interpretations of such records. This may limit their ability to make meaningful Pliocene sea level estimates at the present time

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question as to whether or not the EAIS was dynamic or reduced in the Pliocene is a long-standing issue (see ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>). Our results show that in around 40% of the simulations for the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> experiment, substantial ice-sheet reduction is exhibited in the Wilkes and Aurora SGB and around Wilkes Land (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). This is consistent with ice-rafted debris data thought to be indicative of a dynamic Wilkes Land margin region during the Late Pliocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. However, this result depends on the boundary conditions imposed in the climate model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> and the starting conditions of the ISMs. For example, none of the AIS configurations presented in the Pliocene
  <sub>Ice-PD</sub> experiments suggest significant retreat into the EAIS SGBs (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). It must be acknowledged that this is potentially inconsistent with geological proxy evidence for retreat of portions of the EAIS during the mPWP (e.g. ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>). Nevertheless, the results presented here also demonstrate that, while the total AIS volume is most heavily influenced by the choice of climate model, detailed predictions of areal extent are more likely to be influenced by the ISM used and ISM initial conditions (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). For example, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> shows that ANICE predictions generally would lead to the conclusion that the Aurora SGB was covered in ice (apart from when using IPSL-CM5A climate forcing), BASISM predictions always suggest an ice-covered region, whereas SICOPOLIS predicts some ice retreat under all climatologies.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are also additional sources of uncertainty that have been shown previously to impact upon the details of predicted SGB retreat that have not been considered here. When considering the modern AIS under future warming scenarios, it has been shown that the implementation of subgrid interpolation of basal melting at grounding lines within SIA-SSA ISMs may accelerate grounding line retreat
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span> and impacts upon the final ice volume predicted in long palaeo-integrations increasing the range in volume predictions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. None of the ISMs considered here include fine scale representations of the grounding line, for example, subgrid friction schemes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span> or adaptive mesh refinement
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span> that has been shown to improve accuracy in a modern setting at very high (&lt;1 km) resolution. DeConto and Pollard also employ a parameterisation of ice-shelf hydrofracturing and ice-cliff collapse of marine-terminating ice margins, which is not included in any of the ISMs here and this could potentially have a large impact on predictions of sea level change for the Pliocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). As ISMs that are applicable to palaeo problems evolve (e.g. can be run on a continental scale for long time integrations), it is likely that such fine scale and novel grounding line parameterisations will continue to alter our understanding of potential ice-sheet collapse in the EAIS SGBs and this will be an interesting avenue for future research.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PLISMIP was the first ISM intercomparison project set up to shed light of palaeo ice-sheet variability, with the ambition of helping to understand the sensitivity of the ice-sheets in a warmer-than-modern world
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. To realise this, one of the key aims of the PLISMIP project was to reconstruct the most likely geometry and volume of ice masses on Greenland and Antarctica. The results over Greenland allowed for an improvement to be made in the understanding of the potential extent and configuration of the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Pliocene

  </span> and the experimental design for PlioMIP2
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>. However, results presented here and in other ice-sheet modelling studies for the Pliocene AIS
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> show that the level of uncertainty associated with simulating a marine-based WAIS and also the potential dynamic nature of the grounding line over the EAIS mean that we cannot be confident in using the results from this study to infer a most likely AIS configuration for the mPWP.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, our results unequivocally demonstrate that the climate forcing fields used (and in effect the climate model chosen) can have a significant impact on the predicted equilibrium state ice-sheet for the mPWP. When compared against other sources of uncertainty (e.g. ISM parameterisations and the choice of ISM), the atmospheric forcing field used brings in the largest source of uncertainty in terms of the global mean sea level change associated with volumetric changes in the ice-sheet (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). We also show, however, that the details of the predicted ice-sheet configuration are generally more affected by which ISM is used, rather than the particular climate forcing, with a caveat that this may be affected by some of the ice boundary condition choices used within the PlioMIP models. Therefore it is important that as a community we do not place undue confidence on the ice-sheet reconstructions of one ISM or one climate model, when additional sources of structural uncertainty have not been considered.
