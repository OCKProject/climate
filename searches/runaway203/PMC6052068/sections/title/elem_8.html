            volumes (from the three ISMs) fall within the range of the mean plus or minus the
            standard deviation of the other models. If we assume a normal distribution, we would

            only one or no present-day simulations are within one standard deviation of the mean,
            it suggests that this particular GCM is producing ice-sheets significantly different
