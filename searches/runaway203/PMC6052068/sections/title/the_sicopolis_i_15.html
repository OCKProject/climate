         finite difference ice-sheet-shelf model
         <span><a>29</a></span>. On land, the model utilises a hybrid combination of the SIA and the SSA (including
         basal drag) as described in ref.

         and south of Amery Ice shelf) to better represent their modern positions. At each
         time step, the calving front is iteratively checked for grid points with a thickness
         below 50 m, which are calved out, until no more calving occurs.
