      <p>The mid-Pliocene warm period provides a natural laboratory to investigate the long-term
         response of the Earthâ€™s ice-sheets and sea level in a warmer-than-present-day world.
         Proxy data suggest that during the warm Pliocene, portions of the Antarctic ice-sheets,
         including West Antarctica could have been lost. Ice-sheet modelling forced by Pliocene
         climate model outputs is an essential way to improve our understanding of ice-sheets
         during the Pliocene. However, uncertainty exists regarding the degree to which results
         are model-dependent. Using climatological forcing from an international climate modelling
         intercomparison project, we demonstrate the high dependency of Antarctic ice-sheet
         volume predictions on the climate model-based forcing used. In addition, the collapse
         of the vulnerable marine basins of Antarctica is dependent on the ice-sheet model
         used. These results demonstrate that great caution is required in order to avoid making
         unsound statements about the nature of the Pliocene Antarctic ice-sheet based on model
         results that do not account for structural uncertainty in both the climate and ice
         sheet models.
