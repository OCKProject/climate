      <p>Ice sheet models forced by climate model output indicate ice-sheet retreat during
         the Pliocene, yet concerns remain regarding potential model bias. Here, the authors
         present results from the Pliocene Ice-sheet Modelling Intercomparison Project, and
         show that results are highly dependent on the model forcing used.
