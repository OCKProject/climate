            <span>i</span> Ice-sheet presence prediction for each of the climate scenarios (as a percentage
            of the total ensemble members). Also shown is the middle (

            <span>f</span>,

            <span>l</span>) ice-sheet configuration (surface height (m) and ice-shelf thickness (m)). Middle
            is the 5th ranking ice volume from the list of 10 SIA-SSA model results. Results from
            the control simulations of MIROC4m and MRI-CGCM2.3 are not included in this figure
            to allow better comparison between the presented scenarios
