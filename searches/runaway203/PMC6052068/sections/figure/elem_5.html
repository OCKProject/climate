         <p>Simulated Pliocene ice-sheets initialised from present-day Antarctica. ISM predictions
            of grounded ice-sheet surface height (m) and ice-shelf thickness (m) for the Pliocene
            <sub>Ice-PD</sub> experiments using the climatological forcing fields from the PlioMIP climate models.
            Initial present-day ice-sheet is shown in the top left for ref. 
            <span><a>39</a></span>. Note that ice-shelves are only simulated by the ANICE and SICOPOLIS ISMs. Results
            from MIROC4m and MRI-CGCM2.3 are shown in Supplementary Fig.Â
