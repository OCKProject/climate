There is a total of 30 ensemble members of forced runs for the period between 850 and 2005, which are a combination of full forcing runs evolving in time and runs considering of each forcing individually with all other forcings fixed at values from the year 850. These are volcanic only, solar

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the LM eruptions analysis, we consider the output from 10 full forcing and 5 volcanic-only ensemble members. This analysis has been restricted to the period 850–1850, to exclude any CO
  <sub>2</sub>-induced trends in the full forcing runs. The ensemble average is used to reduce the internal variability

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All seven selected eruptions were averaged together. The year of the eruption is referred as Yr0 in the composite analysis, which means that all 7 eruptions from the 15 ensemble members were averaged. The composite evolution starts in the year before the eruption (Yr-1) and includes the 6 subsequent years (Yr + 1 to Yr + 6). As in the Mt. Pinatubo section, we only analyze austral summer (DJF) results, for that we considered the average of December, from the year of the eruption, January and February, from the subsequent year.</p>

This is the nonparametric version of the t-test, which only makes the assumption of independence between the time series and equal variance, but not that the data have a known distribution
