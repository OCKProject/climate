 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We quantified the SST perturbation caused by the Mt. Pinatubo 1991 eruption, which showed an anomalous warming response near the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea at Yr + 2. Such response was not expected given that the known impact of volcanic eruptions is an overall cooling

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. The physical mechanism responsible for this surface warming was investigated considering the LM (850–1850) largest eruptions. Even though the LM eruptions are known to be much stronger than Mt. Pinatubo and have different intrinsic characteristics (i.e. intensity), we observed the same robust anomalous warming near the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea. In addition, any eruptions occurring in the future could be as strong as the LM ones, and given the robust warming response in the Weddell Sea, we anticipate that such future large eruptions would once again generate significant warming in the region.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Composite ensemble average for LM eruptions showed ∼0.8 °C SST increase accompanied by positive salinity anomaly (~0.16) developed near the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea during the first year after the eruption (Yr + 1). The composite analysis for the simulated LM eruptions presented the same sea surface temperature pattern as after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption (averages from 0.2 to 0.85 °C for different data sets), however it is the largest at Yr + 1, while the Mt. Pinatubo largest response is at Yr + 2. The different year of the largest sea surface response is related to the size of the analyzed eruptions; LM eruptions are much larger than more recent ones

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span> that the anomalous warm SST response to large volcanic eruptions in the Weddell Sea is due to changes in the ocean dynamics, rather than to the direct radiative forcing. During the first year after the eruption (Yr + 1), a strengthening of 0.03 N m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> of the prevailing westerlies was observed, which was accompanied by a southward shift of ∼2° of its southernmost extension. At the same time, the meridional component of the wind stress near the northern Antarctic Peninsula changes direction from northward to southward. As a response to the wind changes, the ACC intensifies at its southern limit in about 10%, enhancing mixing off the northern Antarctic Peninsula, together with a ∼16% weakening of the WG subsurface outflow down to ~400 m deep. Consequently, some of the water that was normally exported out of the WG is trapped at the subsurface region near the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea. The subsurface water (i.e., WDW), that is warmer and saltier than the surface water, is brought up to the surface by the enhanced mixing. Because of the anomalous wind this water gets trapped in the Weddell Sea surface outflow region near the Antarctic Peninsula.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> due to projected increases in ocean stratification, further warming in the Weddell Sea due to volcanic eruptions could enhance the probability of sudden ice shelf collapse. Therefore, despite the global cooling associated with volcanic eruptions, the dynamical response actually enhances the regional response to anthropogenic warming in the Antarctic Peninsula, which highlights the Southern Ocean’s vulnerability
