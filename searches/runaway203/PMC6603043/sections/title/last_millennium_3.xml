   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the composite evolution from Yr0 to Yr + 3 for SST and salinity (Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>), the greatest signal (significant at 90% level according to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is seen during the first year after the eruption (Yr + 1). The same anomalous warming pattern (here of ∼0.8 °C) near the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea from results after Mt. Pinatubo eruption is observed for LM eruptions in the model results (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). At the same time, there is a positive salinity anomaly (∼0.16) off the northern Antarctic Peninsula that spreads eastward (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). The year of the largest response after LM eruptions is different than that after Mt. Pinatubo eruption. For the LM eruptions the greatest response is at Yr + 1, while for Mt. Pinatubo it is at Yr + 2. This difference may be explained by the size of the eruption, since most responses scale with the magnitude of the eruption

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CESM-LME wind stress anomaly reveals an intensified westerly flow (represented by vectors in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b</a>), which is further investigated separately for each component (zonal and meridional). The zonal wind stress substantially changes at Yr + 1 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). During the year after the eruption (Yr + 1), its southernmost extension has shifted southward compared to the climatology (dotted and continuous lines, respectively, in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). The southward shift starts at Yr0 (1.48° of latitude, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>) and increases to 2.16° at Yr + 1. This shift is larger than the westerlies interannual variability during the LM (±1.67°). In addition, there is an intensification of ∼20% (0.03 N m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>). The same pattern of meridional shift and westerlies intensification was observed after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The westerlies southward shift and strengthening has been also shown by other authors

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. It is related to the overall intensified equator-to-pole temperature gradient after a large eruption, caused by the aerosol absorption that causes warming in the tropical region of the lower-stratosphere
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> and also related to the zonal flow-planetary wave interactions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The meridional wind stress climatological pattern in the Weddell Sea is a northward flow that reverts direction in the northernmost portion of the Antarctic Peninsula (continuous line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). Due to volcanic eruptions, the response in the meridional wind stress is a negative anomaly off the northern Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>), which is sufficient to reverse the circulation in this region. The position of the zero meridional wind stress shifts southward after the eruption (dotted line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The surface wind system changes help explain the anomalous warming near the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea. The substantial wind stress field changes have an impact on the ocean surface currents (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>). Zonal and meridional surface velocities anomalies present a 10% to ~14% increase in the flow, respectively, mainly in the southern extension of the ACC (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a>). After the eruption the currents near the Antarctic Peninsula are highly influenced by the flow at the southern end of the ACC. This means that the stronger ACC flow enhances mixing further south.
