  <p>Schematics from the suggested mechanism in the Weddell Sea near the Antarctic Peninsula after a large eruption. The surface and vertical section in the location of SR4
   <span class="italic">/</span>WOCE stations represent the temperature anomaly for the year after the eruption (Yr + 1). The wind circulation is represented in yellow and blue thick arrows. The red arrows represent the ACC southern extension. The inflow and outflow of the WG are in green and blue, respectively.
