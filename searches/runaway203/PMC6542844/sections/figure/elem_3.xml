  <p>Sketch maps of eastern Asia showing the major summer precipitation and circulation characteristics for early, middle, and late Holocene. Original results were derived by applying pollen-based transfer functions to 101 fossil pollen records and using a minimal empirical model based on present-day relationships between insolation, the position of the westerly jet stream, and spatial distribution patterns for precipitation. (EASM—East Asian Summer Monsoon, ISM—Indian Summer Monsoon)</p>
