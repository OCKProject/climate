  <p>Reconstructed and simulated precipitation of selected sites in China and Mongolia. Pollen-based reconstructions of annual precipitation (mm/year; black circles are original data points, red lines is loess smoothed values (span: 0.5, left scale) compared to simulated precipitation anomalies (mm/year, blue lines, right scale) using a minimal empirical model of selected sites. Correlation coefficient and 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-values are indicated (i.e., between loess-smoothed reconstructions and simulated time-series from the respective grid-cell). Central map shows the locations of the sites: only sites that had a sufficiently high-resolution and a reliable age model were selected (see Supplementary TableÂ
