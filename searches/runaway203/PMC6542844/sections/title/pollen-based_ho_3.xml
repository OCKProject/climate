 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pollen trapped in sedimentary archives provides the only quantitative proxy for continental climates on millennial-time-scales during the Holocene that has sufficient spatial resolution for detailed spatiotemporal interpretation. Modern pollen records from eastern Asia have been shown to mainly reflect annual precipitation levels
  <span class="sup">

  </span>, because this region is largely characterized by moisture-limited vegetation (see more arguments in the Methods section). This study presents annual precipitation reconstructions for the period between 10 and 2ka, obtained by applying pollen–climate transfer functions to fossil pollen records (see Methods section). A total of 101 sets of pollen records was available from the transition between areas influenced by the monsoon and the westerly jet stream (20–55°N and 80–130°E)

  </span> (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We have assumed that changes in the Holocene pollen record provide a reliable reflection of climatic changes rather than of human impact, since the major trends in pollen-based reconstructions show a highly significant correlation with those from a semi-quantitative, non-vegetation, precipitation-proxy dataset derived from the same sites (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). This assumption is also supported by results obtained in previous investigations

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fuzzy-clustering of derived standardized pollen-based precipitation time-series yielded three clusters with contrasting Holocene precipitation trends (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a–c</a>) and rather distinct regional distributions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d–f</a>). Sites in the late-Holocene maximum cluster are mostly located in the southern part of China and along a southeast to northwest oriented band extending from Xinjiang to eastern Mongolia (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c, f</a>). All show an increasing precipitation trend during the Holocene. Records from the early-Holocene maximum cluster mostly derive from western parts of the study area, which includes the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, the Altai Mountains (northern Xinjiang and western Mongolia), and Yunnan Province in southern China (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a, d</a>). They show a declining precipitation trend during the Holocene. In contrast, records from the mid-Holocene maximum cluster derive from a southwest to northeast oriented band that extends from the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, over north-central China and into northeastern China (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b, e</a>).

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our proxy-based observation of three contrasting temporal precipitation patterns, each with a rather distinct spatial extent, contrasts with results from previous investigations of variations in Holocene precipitation levels in China

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has recently been suggested that strong summer insolation such as occurred during the early or middle Holocene may have led to the northward displacement of the westerly jet stream occurring earlier in the year than it does today, and thus to a prolongation of the monsoonal period in the northern parts of China. In contrast, during periods of low summer insolation, such as occurred during the late Holocene, the EASM would be retained for longer in a transitional position supporting an elevated moisture supply to southern China

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Although this hypothesis may to some extent explain the contrasting Holocene precipitation trends that we interpreted for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and southern China, it fails to explain the mid-Holocene precipitation maximum reconstructed using the high number of records from the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and from northern and northeastern China. According to this hypothesis, the entire northern part of China should have experienced a decreasing precipitation trend throughout the Holocene, correlating with the reduction in summer insolation, but this is not supported by our pollen-based reconstructions. A prolonged northern position for the westerly jet stream in times of stronger summer insolation cannot alone explain the inferred Holocene precipitation pattern.
