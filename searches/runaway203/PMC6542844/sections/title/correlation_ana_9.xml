 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We performed correlation analyses between time-series of pollen-based precipitation reconstruction and simulated precipitation. In a first analysis (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), the model results are linearly interpolated to the sample times of the reconstructed record. We account for the autocorrelation in the significance estimates by adjusting the effective degrees of freedom using the estimated lag-1 correlation of the reconstructed records. Second, the mean correlation of the spatially and temporally smoothed records was investigated. To account for the temporal autocorrelation, as well as the effect of kernel smoothing in space and time on the temporal and spatial correlation structure, we perform a Monte-Carlo experiment. We create a set of surrogate records by simulating a random annual time-series, following a power-law scaling with beta = 1 and block averaging the record to the sampling resolution of the true record. In analog to the observed records, this set of surrogate records is then smoothed in time and space using the Gaussian kernel and the (weighted) correlation to the model results is estimated. Repeating this 1000 times allows an empirical estimation of the
