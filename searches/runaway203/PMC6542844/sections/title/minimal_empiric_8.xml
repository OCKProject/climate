 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We established a minimal model to simulate the annual precipitation in the area influenced by the EASM and in the EASM-westerly transition area (20–55°N and 80–130°E) over the period between 10 and 2 ka (Source Data File 3). The main driver of Holocene climate changes is change in incoming insolation. Simple empirical models between local daily insolation and local daily temperature have been shown to produce the main features of the Holocene temperature evolution, resembling simulations of state-of-the-art climate models

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>, which is also mainly related to insolation. Accordingly, this model assumes that insolation is the first-order control of the jet-stream position and the jet stream position is a major factor in controlling the daily precipitation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence for the relationship of local insolation and the jet stream position stems from the strong seasonal relationship between the jet-stream position and insolation at 35°N (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) and this relationship is not sensitive to the choice of the latitude of insolation (the

  <span class="sup">2</span> of insolation and jet position is &gt;0.86 for any latitude between 20° and 50°N).

  </span> and confirmed by predicting the local climatological seasonal cycle in precipitation using the jet stream position (Supplementary Fig.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specifically, we used daily precipitation data from the APHRODITE project (1951–2007)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> to obtain a representation of the spatial precipitation patterns. We also used daily u-wind data (i.e., the east–west component of wind) at the 250 hPa pressure level (i.e., the atmospheric height at which the westerly jet stream occurs) from the NCEP reanalysis data (2.5° × 2.5° grid) for the same years as the precipitation data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. The daily position of the westerly jet stream was estimated by taking the zonal mean of the u-wind field between 100°E and 120°E and choosing the latitude with the maximum daily windspeed. We parametrized the position of the westerly jet stream as a function of insolation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. A second-order polynomial transfer function was fitted between the modern daily insolation at 35°N and the climatological position of the westerly jet stream, after including a time lag of 45 days (= the time lag that maximized the correlation) to take into account the thermal inertia. Our result is not sensitive to the choice of any insolation latitude inside our prediction area. The second-order polynomial resulted in a coefficient of determination (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>) of 0.88 (compared to an 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> of 0.78 in a linear model). Past positions of the westerly jet stream were estimated by applying this transfer function to the daily insolation values for the period between 10 and 2 ka
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. In order to preserve the fine-scale features and the absolute range of the wind positions, the jet-stream position anomalies between the observed and modeled modern jet climatology were added to the reconstructed historical jet-stream positions. The modeled position of the westerly jet stream for a particular day in the past was used to identify the past spatial precipitation pattern. For that purpose, all days (= analog days) in the modern dataset (1951–2007, ~20,000 days) with a westerly jet stream position within ± 5 degrees of latitude of the modeled jet stream position were chosen. We restricted our selection to days within the same season as the targeted historical day (i.e., to ± 60 days) in order to avoid a mixture of spring and autumn precipitation patterns. Finally, the precipitation patterns for the analog days in the modern dataset were then averaged to obtain an average precipitation pattern for each day, and annual means were calculated. To estimate the wind-field corresponding to the jet-stream position and precipitation patterns (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), we averaged the analog days in the modern u-wind and v-wind datasets to obtain the average wind field for each day. R code is available in Supplementary Note
