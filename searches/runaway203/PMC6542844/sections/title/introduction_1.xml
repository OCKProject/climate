 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A profound understanding of the atmospheric dynamics embedded in the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), particularly of the low-level monsoonal flow that transports moist air to East Asia from nearby oceans, is of utmost importance for predicting ecological and economic changes that China is likely to face as a result of a changing climate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Simulating the EASM is particularly challenging because of strong interactions between the mid-latitude and low-latitude circulation systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. The monsoonal circulation is driven by numerous controls of the ocean–atmosphere system that are ultimately triggered by the annual insolation cycle
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. The associated distinctive spatiotemporal rainfall pattern is, however, a result of interactions between the monsoon and the upper tropospheric westerly jet stream

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Ensemble simulations of future climate predict an overall warming accompanied by an increase in precipitation over northern China during the next two decades and a reduction over southeastern China
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Paleoclimate simulations using Earth System Models (ESMs) support this projection, revealing a similar precipitation pattern of change associated with increasing temperatures
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. However, the results of these simulations conflict with proxy-based evidence of changes in Holocene precipitation, although this evidence varies between different proxies. For example, while stalagmite records throughout China (such as those from the Sanbao Cave in north-central China) consistently indicate an early-Holocene precipitation maximum
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, high-resolution pollen-based reconstructions from north-central and northeastern China show a mid-Holocene precipitation maximum instead
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> (early Holocene: 11–7 ka, mid-Holocene: 7–3 ka, late Holocene: 3–0 ka; where ka = thousands of years before present). Investigations based on sedimentary records also revealed regional differences in the timing of the precipitation maximum
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> with no consistent spatiotemporal pattern among these studies. Accordingly, the proxy-based inferences were assigned to a number of different mechanisms including seasonality changes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>, relative changes in the evaporation-to-precipitation ratio
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>, or interactions with the Indian Summer Monsoon
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Recently, variations in the interactions between the EASM and the westerly jet have been considered as an explanation of spatial differences in the timing of Holocene maximum
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Based on modeling results from a general circulation model it was speculated that the seasonal variations in the northward displacement of the westerly jet stream during the Holocene may have determined the length of the monsoonal period in the different regions leading to an early-Holocene maximum in northern China and a late-Holocene maximum in southern China
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. However, the proxy-based reconstruction of mid-Holocene maxima in north-central and northeastern China are in conflict with these and other simulations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. All the proposed explanations lack a broad-scale and methodologically consistent data–model comparison approach. Accordingly, regionally varying timing of the Holocene precipitation maxima poses a major challenge to a common understanding of EASM dynamics and may have impeded an accurate representation of EASM dynamics in general circulation models. Precipitation projections in China and Mongolia for the coming decades may, therefore, involve high levels of uncertainty, despite being derived from state-of-the-art climate models.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we present spatiotemporal precipitation patterns for the Holocene derived from pollen-based reconstructions, providing unprecedented spatial coverage for an empirical dataset that has been reconstructed using a consistent approach throughout. Similar Holocene precipitation patterns were also obtained using a minimal empirical (analog-based) model that explores, and extrapolates from, present-day relationships between insolation, westerly jet stream characteristics, and rainfall.</p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study provides consistent empirical and modeling results with respect to regional variations in the timing of Holocene precipitation maxima including mid-Holocene maxima in north-central and northeastern China. This model–data agreement leads us to the conclusion that the temporal variation in the position and orientation of the westerly jet stream mainly controlled the spatiotemporal precipitation pattern—providing a new answer to the old question of circulation mechanisms behind Holocene climate change in China and Mongolia. Our simple analog-based simulation reproduces proxy-inferred Holocene precipitation trends and even quantitative precipitation anomalies as well, indicating that, irrespective of the time-scale or the forcing mechanisms invoked, spatiotemporal precipitation patterns are caused by similar mesoscale climatic processes. Our study thus implies that a better representation of these mesoscale processes and a more accurate implementation of monsoon–westerly jet interactions in ESMs will likely lead to a decrease in the uncertainty of precipitation projections.</p>
