 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our estimates of the contribution of anthropogenic warming to the Pan‐Caribbean did not consider anthropogenic effects on precipitation trends and variability nor how these affected the Pan‐Caribbean drought, as these effects are likely too complex to be approximated by calculating empirical trends (Abatzoglou &amp; Williams, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0001">2016</a>; Deser et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0015">2012</a>; Williams et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0048">2015</a>). Notably, climate models consistently simulate significant decreases in precipitation in the Caribbean as anthropogenic greenhouse‐gas concentrations increase in the future (IPCC, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0021">2014</a>; Neelin et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0031">2006</a>), and if those trends are already underway, then the total contribution of anthropogenic climate change would be greater than that estimated here.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Uncertainties in our results arise from intrinsic limitations of scPDSI as a soil moisture indicator. However, we compared observational (Global Land Data Assimilation Systems) and modeled (CMIP5) soil moisture anomalies against scPDSI and found consistency in their trends and variability (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">S1</a>). Although further uncertainties in our results also arise from our statistical downscaling method, the paucity of long‐term high‐quality weather station data and the low resolution of CMIP5 data relative to the size of the Caribbean Islands precluded a more accurate evaluation. Nevertheless, we validated our downscaled products with station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network before computing scPDSI (
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Supporting Information S1</a>). As shown in 
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Figure S3</a>, our products correlated well with independent Global Historical Climatology Network stations in the Caribbean and northern South America. We also included a combination of various observational data sets in our analysis, obtaining similar results as those reported from our downscaled climate products (
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Supporting Information S1</a>). Collectively, our results indicate that anthropogenic warming almost certainly increased drought severity and the area experiencing record‐breaking drought during the Pan‐Caribbean drought, which is similar to what was found for California during the 2012–2014 drought (Williams et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0048">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ScPDSI does not account for the effect of increased atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration on plant physiology, which is hypothesized to diminish PET‐induced soil drying by increasing water use efficiency of plants (Cook et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0009">2016</a>; Mankin et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0029">2018</a>; Swann et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0039">2016</a>). We thus compared scPDSI from CMIP5 with soil moisture from CMIP5 during 1950–2016 over the Caribbean as in Cook, Ault, and Smerdon (
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0008">2015</a>). Simulated soil moisture in the coupled land surface models of CMIP5 is a more explicit and physically based representation of the surface moisture balance than the simple bucket model used in scPDSI and includes responses of vegetation to climate and CO
  <sub>2</sub>. If CO
  <sub>2</sub> effects on water use efficiency have a large water savings effect, we would expect the model soil moisture to show substantially less drying than scPDSI. For each CMIP5 model considered in the Caribbean (
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Table S2</a>), there was a significant correlation between scPDSI and soil moisture anomalies (ranging from 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.23 to 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.85, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05), with an average correlation of 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.69 (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01; Figures 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0004">4</a>b and 
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">S4</a>), and drying trends in scPDSI were not systematically more severe than in soil moisture (
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Supporting Information S1</a>). This suggests that scPDSI accurately reflects surface moisture balance in these models, in spite of the simple water balance formulation it uses, and that CO
  <sub>2</sub> effects on plant physiology and PET‐induced drying trends were small in the Caribbean over the analysis period.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the Pan‐Caribbean drought, precipitation anomalies were not the lowest on record in the Caribbean. By comparing precipitation anomalies of some of the worst droughts in the region (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0004">4</a>c), we found that the 1974–1977 and 1968–1969 droughts had larger rainfall deficits. However, drought rankings calculated with scPDSI (
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Figure S5</a>) indicate the Pan‐Caribbean drought was the most severe drought in ~32% of the Caribbean Islands, but when removing the warming trend, this area changed to 21% (
