 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since 1950, the Caribbean has seen a gradual drying trend (e.g., −0.09 self‐calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index [scPDSI] units per decade; Dai,

  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0038">2012</a>) with several multiyear droughts, the most severe and widespread of which occurred between 2013 and 2016 (Herrera &amp; Ault, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0019">2017</a>). Given its extensive spatial scale, we refer to this event as the 
  <span class="italic">Pan‐Caribbean Drought</span> (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0001">1</a>). This drought affected the entire region and pushed more than two million people into food insecurity (OCHA, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0044">2015</a>). The effects were particularly acute in Haiti, where one million people (~10% of its population) were severely affected by food insecurity and required immediate assistance (OCHA, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0044">2015</a>), and over 50% of crop were lost due to the drought (FAO,

   <p>Spatial and temporal characteristics of the Pan‐Caribbean drought: (a) scPDSI composite between July 2013 and October 2016, (b) and (c) are the same as (a) but with precipitation and Penman‐Monteith potential evapotranspiration (PET) anomalies, respectively. Both precipitation and PET anomalies are calculated as departures from the 1950–1980 climatology. The Caribbean averaged scPDSI time series is plotted in (d). Negative scPDSI values indicate drought, while positive values are pluvials. Finally, the drought area index between 1950 and 2016 across the Caribbean is plotted in (e). The Pan‐Caribbean drought affected ~98% of land area of the region. scPDSI = self‐calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to significant precipitation deficits, which were driven in part by the strong El Niño in 2015–2016 (Blunden &amp; Arndt, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0006">2016</a>; OCHA, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0044">2015</a>), the Pan‐Caribbean drought occurred in conjunction with some of the highest temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) anomalies observed in the region (Herrera &amp; Ault, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0019">2017</a>). As compared to previous droughts that also occurred during strong El Niño events (e.g., in 1997–1998), the Pan‐Caribbean drought was considerably more severe (Herrera &amp; Ault, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0019">2017</a>), and it affected regions usually associated with wet conditions during El Niño, such as western Cuba (Jury et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0022">2007</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies using climate model simulations have projected increased aridity and freshwater stress for the Caribbean in the near future as a result of anthropogenic climate change (Hayhoe, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0018">2013</a>; IPCC, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0021">2014</a>; Karnauskas et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0024">2016</a>). In fact, Lehner et al. (
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0026">2017</a>) suggested that drought risk in the Caribbean is highly sensitive to even relatively small increases in global mean temperature. The authors indicate that both the severity and duration of drought in the region will increase with global mean temperatures of 1.5 and 2 °C above historical averages. Similarly, Karnauskas et al. (
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0025">2018</a>) suggest that 2 °C higher global mean temperature will increase freshwater stress in the Caribbean by ~25% by the end of the 21st century. Although the projected drying is mostly due to a significant decrease of precipitation rates (30% to 50% in most areas of the Caribbean across most models; IPCC, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0021">2014</a>), future changes in precipitation are less certain than those projected for temperature (IPCC, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0021">2014</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the warming and drying projected for the Caribbean over the coming decades (Dai, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0013">2011</a>; Hayhoe, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0018">2013</a>; IPCC, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0021">2014</a>) and because of the observed warming in the Caribbean since 1950 (Herrera &amp; Ault, 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0019">2017</a>; Stephenson et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-1034" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-1034">2014</a>), assessing the contribution of anthropogenic warming to drought is critical for better understanding drought risks in the region. Along these lines, we estimate the contribution of anthropogenic warming to the Pan‐Caribbean drought using climate data from observations and model simulations to calculate the scPDSI for the period 1950–2016, which we used as a proxy for surface soil moisture balance given the data limitation of the Caribbean. To address the inherent limitations of coarse resolution data sets for characterizing drought on the Caribbean Islands––many of them with substantial topographic variability over small scales––the observed gridded products are statistically downscaled following Herrera and Ault (
