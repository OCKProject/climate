 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed annual PET anomalies during 2013–2016 were significantly higher than PET anomalies with the adjusted temperatures, increasing PET rates from 27 to 72 mm/year in the Caribbean on average (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0002">2</a>). The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble supports a similar contribution of higher temperatures to these PET anomalies, increasing from 15 mm/year with the preindustrial control to 51 mm/year with the RCP8.5 scenario with bias‐corrected temperatures and from 9 mm/year to 36 mm/year with uncorrected modeled temperatures (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0002">2</a>c). However, the magnitude of simulated PET anomalies estimated with not bias‐corrected CMIP5 temperatures was lower than that from observations, because multimodel ensemble temperatures were also lower in the Caribbean. Changes in PET anomalies on each island were comparable to those observed in the Caribbean as a whole, with the lowest change in the Lesser Antilles (38 mm/year) and the highest in Hispaniola Island (48 mm/year; Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0002">2</a>d).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anthropogenic warming accounted for ~15 ± 2% regional average of the Pan‐Caribbean drought severity across the region, which was significant against the null hypothesis that these trends in scPDSI were random (see section 
  <a rid="grl58044-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" href="#grl58044-sec-0002">2</a> and

  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0003">3</a>). Consistent with observations, estimations from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble indicated a ~17 ± 4% (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) contribution to drought severity with the RCP8.5 scenario during this period as compared to the preindustrial control. However, there was substantial geographic variability in these contributions across the Caribbean (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0003">3</a>a). For example, the greatest changes in scPDSI were observed in Cuba, where there was a 32 ± 7% (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05) contribution of anthropogenic warming to the drought severity, while in the Lesser Antilles, it was only 6 ± 4% and not statistically significant. The contribution of anthropogenic warming to drought severity in Hispaniola Island was 13 ± 4% (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05), yet drought severity changes were only statistically significant on parts of the island (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0003">3</a>a). In Jamaica, anthropogenic warming contributed to ~16 ± 5% of drought severity (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05), while in Puerto Rico, the contribution was 12 ± 5% and not statistically significant (

  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0003">3</a>c). Anthropogenic warming also increased the probability of occurrence of the Pan‐Caribbean drought from 4% to 7% (two‐tailed 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). This result was primarily due to higher‐temperature effects on PET, shifting scPDSI mean toward drier conditions during the Pan‐Caribbean drought. Finally, the averaged contributions estimated from various combinations of observationally based climate products were ~14.5%, with the highest contributions (~16%) from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre and Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature and the lowest (~13%) from Climatic Research Unit (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Higher temperatures also enhanced the geographic extent of the drought (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0003">3</a>d). In the Caribbean, for example, anthropogenic warming accounted for ~7% of the area affected by mild drought (scPDSI values between −1.9 and −1.0) and for ~20% of the area under severe drought (scPDSI values between −3.9 and −2.0; 
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Table S3</a>). These changes encompassed areas of nearly 16,000 and 13,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively. Consistent with changes in drought severity, the greatest change in dry area was observed over Cuba, where the warming trend accounted for 16% and 25% of areas under mild and severe drought, respectively (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0003">3</a>d). For comparison, a 16% contribution to drought area in Cuba corresponds to ~10,400 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> more land under mild drought, which roughly comprises 10% of the total area of the country (109,820 km

  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Table S3</a>). In Hispaniola Island, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Lesser Antilles, contributions to mild‐drought area ranged from approximately 6% to 19% (
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Table S3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that the contribution of anthropogenic warming to drought severity, as estimated with scPDSI, does not respond linearly to changes in PET anomalies at local scales. By comparing Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0002">2</a>a with Figure 
  <a rid="grl58044-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58044-fig-0003">3</a>a, for example, this nonlinearity is noticeable in southern Hispaniola Island and parts of central‐eastern Cuba, where the largest contributions of anthropogenic warming to PET anomalies were observed. These areas, however, did not correspond to those with the highest contributions of anthropogenic warming to scPDSI. This apparent discrepancy is likely related to how scPDSI is calibrated. For example, the scPDSI's sensitivity to both precipitation and PET varies across the region because it is calibrated to local climate conditions. Consequently, relative contributions of precipitation and PET to scPDSI vary depending on the climate of a specific location. During the Pan‐Caribbean drought, we found that areas with the lowest coefficients of variation in precipitation anomalies coincided with those where there was the largest contribution of anthropogenic warming to drought (
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Figure S2</a>). This result suggests that the effect of anthropogenic warming on drought severity is stronger in areas where precipitation is less variable.
