 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the contributions of anthropogenic warming to the Pan‐Caribbean drought using our downscaled precipitation and temperature products. Alternatively, we used other observationally based gridded climate products that were combined to validate the consistency of our findings (see 
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Supporting Information S1</a>). We compared the observed record of PET and scPDSI to an alternate record calculated after removal of anthropogenic warming trends since 1950, following a similar approach as in Williams et al. (
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0048">2015</a>). We refer to the alternate PET and scPDSI records that do not include warming trends as “adjusted” records. In both calculations, we used unadjusted records of precipitation, net radiation, and wind speed. The anthropogenic contribution to drought was estimated as the difference between PET anomalies and scPDSI calculated using adjusted temperature (

  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>max</sub>, and net radiation from CMIP5.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We approximated the anthropogenic trends as the difference between naturally only and fully forced ensemble means of temperature anomalies from 28 CMIP5 models during 1950–2016 (see 
  <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Supporting Information S1</a>). Since most CMIP5 historical simulations end in December 2005, we appended the difference between the RCP8.5 scenario and the preindustrial control temperature anomalies from 2006 to 2016. We then smoothed these trends of simulated temperature anomalies using a 30‐year low‐pass filter. To calculate the adjusted temperature record, we subtracted the anthropogenic trends from observationally based gridded temperature products. Despite its simplicity, we used this approach because we aimed to specifically quantify the anthropogenic warming trend, which models are likely to accurately characterize. However, we did not attempt to identify the anthropogenic component of other variables used in the calculation of PET and scPDSI (such as precipitation) because of the difficulty of separating forced and internal variability in these variables (Cook et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0010">2014</a>; Deser et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0015">2012</a>; Williams et al., 
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0048">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the robustness of results using the methodology described above, alternate approaches to characterize the anthropogenic warming effect on the Pan‐Caribbean drought were also taken. For example, we evaluated temperature and net radiation data from 14 CMIP5 models to determine the change in the Pan‐Caribbean drought severity due to the ~2‐Wm
  <span class="sup">−2</span> anthropogenic radiative forcing after the preindustrial era. To do so, we compared PET and scPDSI calculated with historical outputs of temperature and net radiation from CMIP5, against PET and scPDSI using preindustrial control outputs of the same variables. As we did from observed records, in these calculations, we used observed unadjusted precipitation and wind speed data. Modeled temperatures were bias‐corrected, so that the variance and mean match with observed temperature records.
