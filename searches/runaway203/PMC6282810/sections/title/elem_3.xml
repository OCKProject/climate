  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since it was introduced in the mid‐1960s, PDSI (Palmer, 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0032">1965</a>), and more recently scPDSI (Wells et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0046">2004</a>), has been widely used in North America for drought monitoring and research (Cook, Seager, et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0011">2015</a>; Dai,

   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0045">2013</a>). PDSI has been also used as a metric in hydroclimate reconstructions over the last thousand years in North America, southern Asia, and Europe (Cook et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0012">2004</a>; Cook, Seager, et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0011">2015</a>) and for assessing observed and projected changes in hydroclimate as a result of anthropogenic climate change (e.g., Ault et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0004">2014</a>, 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0005">2016</a>; Lehner et al.,

   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0048">2015</a>). Although PDSI has been criticized as a soil moisture indicator due to its relatively simple water balance formulation, limitations in long‐term and quality‐controlled climate data across the Caribbean precluded the use of a more sophisticated model like the Variable Infiltration Capacity Model (Liang et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0027">1994</a>). Criticism of PDSI has also arisen because the index does not account for the effect of increased atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration on plant physiology, which is projected by earth system models to moderate drought impacts on plant water demand (e.g., Swann et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0039">2016</a>). However, as shown in Figure 
   <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">S1</a> and further discussed in section 
   <a rid="grl58044-sec-0008" ref-type="sec" href="#grl58044-sec-0008">4</a>, soil moisture and scPDSI calculated over the Caribbean using data from NASA's Global Land Data Assimilation Systems (Rodell et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0034">2004</a>) are consistent in terms of long‐term trends and variability during the period 1979–2017 (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.65). We further selected scPDSI as the main drought metric for comparison to previous work in California that used a similar methodology (e.g., Williams et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0048">2015</a>). A comprehensive description of how PDSI and scPDSI are formulated is included in

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) PET formulation (Allen et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0002">1998</a>) because it is more physically realistic than the Thornthwaite (
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0041">1948</a>) equation used in the original PDSI calculation (Palmer, 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0032">1965</a>). A key drawback of the Thornthwaite approach—especially for climate change applications—is the use of temperature as the only climate variable forcing PET, which leads to an exacerbation of the sensitivity of PET to temperature variations (Abatzoglou &amp; Williams, 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0001">2016</a>; Smerdon et al.,

   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0048">2015</a>). The FAO formulation for PET, in contrast, is calculated using temperature, vapor pressure, wind speed, and net radiation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimation of Anthropogenic Contribution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the contributions of anthropogenic warming to the Pan‐Caribbean drought using our downscaled precipitation and temperature products. Alternatively, we used other observationally based gridded climate products that were combined to validate the consistency of our findings (see 
   <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Supporting Information S1</a>). We compared the observed record of PET and scPDSI to an alternate record calculated after removal of anthropogenic warming trends since 1950, following a similar approach as in Williams et al. (
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0048">2015</a>). We refer to the alternate PET and scPDSI records that do not include warming trends as “adjusted” records. In both calculations, we used unadjusted records of precipitation, net radiation, and wind speed. The anthropogenic contribution to drought was estimated as the difference between PET anomalies and scPDSI calculated using adjusted temperature (
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>min</sub>, 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>mean</sub>, and 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>max</sub>) against PET anomalies and scPDSI using unadjusted temperature. Results were compared to the same estimates calculated using multimodel ensembles of 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>min</sub>, 
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>max</sub>, and net radiation from CMIP5.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We approximated the anthropogenic trends as the difference between naturally only and fully forced ensemble means of temperature anomalies from 28 CMIP5 models during 1950–2016 (see 
   <a rid="grl58044-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58044-supitem-0001">Supporting Information S1</a>). Since most CMIP5 historical simulations end in December 2005, we appended the difference between the RCP8.5 scenario and the preindustrial control temperature anomalies from 2006 to 2016. We then smoothed these trends of simulated temperature anomalies using a 30‐year low‐pass filter. To calculate the adjusted temperature record, we subtracted the anthropogenic trends from observationally based gridded temperature products. Despite its simplicity, we used this approach because we aimed to specifically quantify the anthropogenic warming trend, which models are likely to accurately characterize. However, we did not attempt to identify the anthropogenic component of other variables used in the calculation of PET and scPDSI (such as precipitation) because of the difficulty of separating forced and internal variability in these variables (Cook et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0010">2014</a>; Deser et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0015">2012</a>; Williams et al., 
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0048">2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the robustness of results using the methodology described above, alternate approaches to characterize the anthropogenic warming effect on the Pan‐Caribbean drought were also taken. For example, we evaluated temperature and net radiation data from 14 CMIP5 models to determine the change in the Pan‐Caribbean drought severity due to the ~2‐Wm
   <span class="sup">−2</span> anthropogenic radiative forcing after the preindustrial era. To do so, we compared PET and scPDSI calculated with historical outputs of temperature and net radiation from CMIP5, against PET and scPDSI using preindustrial control outputs of the same variables. As we did from observed records, in these calculations, we used observed unadjusted precipitation and wind speed data. Modeled temperatures were bias‐corrected, so that the variance and mean match with observed temperature records.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical Hypothesis Test and Significance</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the relatively small size of our sample (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 48 months from January 2013 to December 2016) and because the data are not normally distributed, we implemented a resampling (10,000 samples with replacement), or 
   <span class="italic">bootstrap</span>, method to estimate the statistical significance of our findings following Wilks (
   <a rid="grl58044-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0047">2011</a>). Here the null hypothesis states that “anthropogenic warming did not increase the Pan‐Caribbean drought severity,” while the alternative hypothesis states that “anthropogenic warming has intensified the drought.” We selected the mean as the statistic to test using the unadjusted‐temperature PET and scPDSI records to contrast them against the adjusted‐temperature version of the same metrics during the Pan‐Caribbean drought. Using this approach, we considered as significant anthropogenic contributions those with 
   <span class="italic">p</span> values ≤0.05 at the 95% confidence level. Additionally, we used a two‐tailed 
   <span class="italic">t</span> test to evaluate whether anthropogenic warming has significantly increased the overall drought risk in the Caribbean during the 1980–2016 period.
