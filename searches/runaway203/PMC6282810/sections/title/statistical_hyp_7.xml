 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical Hypothesis Test and Significance</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the relatively small size of our sample (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 48 months from January 2013 to December 2016) and because the data are not normally distributed, we implemented a resampling (10,000 samples with replacement), or 
  <span class="italic">bootstrap</span>, method to estimate the statistical significance of our findings following Wilks (
  <a rid="grl58044-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58044-bib-0047">2011</a>). Here the null hypothesis states that “anthropogenic warming did not increase the Pan‐Caribbean drought severity,” while the alternative hypothesis states that “anthropogenic warming has intensified the drought.” We selected the mean as the statistic to test using the unadjusted‐temperature PET and scPDSI records to contrast them against the adjusted‐temperature version of the same metrics during the Pan‐Caribbean drought. Using this approach, we considered as significant anthropogenic contributions those with 
  <span class="italic">p</span> values ≤0.05 at the 95% confidence level. Additionally, we used a two‐tailed 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test to evaluate whether anthropogenic warming has significantly increased the overall drought risk in the Caribbean during the 1980–2016 period.
