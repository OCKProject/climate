  <p>(
   <span class="italic">Top</span>) The net RF as a function of year due to combined contributions of GHGs, land-use carbon changes, and aerosols. The dark solid line is the global forcing and includes the contributions due to LULC and aerosols. The dotted line shows the forcing if aerosol forcing were not included. The dashed line shows the forcing if land-use carbon were not included. (
   <span class="italic">Middle</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Bottom</span>) The portions of the net global mean RF allocated to regions based primarily on GHG (including land-use carbon emissions) and sulfur emissions from the nine regions noted in the text. The regions are separated into two panels to minimize overlap between curves.
