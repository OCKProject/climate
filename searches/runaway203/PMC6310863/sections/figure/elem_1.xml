 <div class="caption">
  <p>The cumulative contributions to global mean net RF by emissions from the nine regions of the world. The dark bars on the left side for each region are the cumulative RF to date due to emissions from 1900 to 2017. The gray bars above the dark bars are what would be retained by 2100 due to emissions to date, i.e., what the world has already committed to because of GHGs that are already in the atmosphere. The hatched bars to the right are the same quantities without land-use carbon changes.</p>
