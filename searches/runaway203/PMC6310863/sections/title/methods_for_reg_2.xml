 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first estimate the contribution to RF due to emissions from different regions. We emphasize that we are calculating the contributions by regions to global RF, not the RF over specific regions. In the current study, we have divided the world into nine regions: (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) North America (Canada and United States); (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) Western Europe; (
  <span class="italic">iii</span>) Russia and other Eastern Europe; (
  <span class="italic">iv</span>) China and its immediate surroundings; (
  <span class="italic">v</span>) The Indian Subcontinent (India and some of its neighbors); (
  <span class="italic">vi</span>) Asia excluding China (but including South Korea, which is highly industrialized); (
  <span class="italic">vii</span>) Middle East and Africa; (
  <span class="italic">viii</span>) Latin America (including Mexico); and (
  <span class="italic">ix</span>) the Pacific (mostly Japan, Australia, and New Zealand). These regions correspond to regions and subdivisions thereof used by the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>
  </span> lists the countries in each region. One could debate this division and it could be changed if one chooses to do so. For example, former Eastern-bloc countries that are now in the European Union could arguably be grouped with either Western Europe or with Russia as economies in transition. Indeed, one could do an analysis country by country although the uncertainties for some small emitters would be very large. The purpose of using regions is to keep the figures and discussion manageable while preserving similarities in geography and economic development paths.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RF due to emissions from each region could in principle be obtained from a regionally resolved emissions inventory along with knowledge of the atmospheric lifetime and forcing of each species. In practice, for most gases the concentration history, from direct atmospheric measurements and from gas trapped in firn and ice, is known better than the emission history. Therefore, in this work we started from the atmospheric concentration history of carbon dioxide and other GHGs. Using the estimated atmospheric lifetimes, we derived an inferred time history of global emissions that created the observed concentrations. The inversion process used for CO
  <sub>2</sub>, N
  <sub>2</sub>O, and CH
  <sub>4</sub> essentially takes time derivatives so the forcings were smoothed over 7 y before the inversions. (The emission history of chlorofluorocarbons and related ozone-depleting gases is well known.) For carbon dioxide, the global time series of the inferred emissions closely matches the direct emissions estimates. Other gases also compare well to the less complete emissions inventories available for them.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We took this extra step of an inferred global emissions history because it guarantees self-consistency between the emissions, atmospheric lifetimes, and the known atmospheric concentrations. Otherwise, one might take the emissions from one reference and the lifetime from another reference and calculate an RF that was inconsistent with the atmospheric concentrations. Starting from the concentration history also keeps the calculations more self-consistent if the airborne fraction of CO
  <sub>2</sub> changes. However, information to date suggests that the airborne fraction of CO
  <sub>2</sub> has not changed significantly (
  <a rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" href="#r17">17</a>, 
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For aerosols, there is no record of atmospheric concentrations comparable to those for CO
  <sub>2</sub>, N
  <sub>2</sub>O, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, and halocarbons. Here we use literature estimates of the time history of global RF from aerosols and apportion the forcing by sulfate emissions. Sulfate is the largest component of anthropogenic change of aerosols but is not all of it. Apportioning the entire anthropogenic aerosol effect by sulfur does not mean that other aerosol species are ignored but rather that the regional patterns of their emissions are assumed to be similar to the regional pattern of sulfur emissions. This is reasonable since the emitted black carbon, nitrates, and secondary organics are also often proportional to economic activity.

  </span>. CO
  <sub>2</sub>, N
  <sub>2</sub>O, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, and halocarbon RFs are from Skeie et al. (
  <a rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" href="#r19">19</a>), with more recent years from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Monitoring Division (
  <a rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" href="#r20">20</a>). Global aerosol forcings, including both direct and aerosol–cloud interaction effects, are scaled to sulfur emissions from Smith et al. (
  <a rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" href="#r21">21</a>) and Klimont et al. (
  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>), with an average value of −1.0 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> for the period 1980–2005 (
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>). Forcings beyond the last available year from each reference were assumed to be the same until 2017.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once time histories of global emissions were derived, the emissions inventories were used to apportion the global emissions to each region. National emissions inventories for the GHGs are from Climate Analysis Indicators Tools (
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>, 
  <a rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" href="#r24">24</a>). CO
  <sub>2</sub> histories go back to 1850; other emissions histories are available only from 1990. Regional fractions of N
  <sub>2</sub>O, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, and halocarbons for 1990 were used for prior years. Carbon emissions from land-use and land-cover changes are from Houghton and Nassikas (
  <a rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" href="#r25">25</a>). National sulfur emissions are from Smith et al. (
  <a rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" href="#r21">21</a>) and Klimont et al. (
  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>). Gas-phase and aerosol species emissions before 1850 were assumed to be zero. RFs for methane and halocarbons were scaled to make a partial allocation of the forcing from tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, respectively. Methane is the largest single contributor to changes in tropospheric ozone (
  <a rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" href="#r1">1</a>). The recent RF of methane changes from about 0.5 to 0.8 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> if one includes its indirect effects on ozone (
  <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>), with a somewhat smaller ozone forcing in more recent estimates (
  <a rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" href="#r1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>). Scaling methane can approximate just under half of the tropospheric ozone forcing (
  <a rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" href="#r1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A simplification implicit in using cumulative net forcing is that climate change is driven by the net forcing. Although it is a good first approximation, this is not strictly true: Offsetting forcings can lead to important changes, particularly in precipitation and the hydrologic cycle (
  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>, 
  <a rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" href="#r29">29</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Calculation of the future commitment due to the emissions already taken place to date is straightforward. It is essentially due to gases remaining in the atmosphere in the future. We took the concentrations of each GHG, computed its forcing going forward in time based on its atmospheric lifetime with no further emissions, and multiplied the integral of that future forcing by the fraction of that gas in the atmosphere in 2017 due to emissions from each region (which is not the same as either the regional fraction of 2017 emissions or the regional fraction of total emissions from 1900 to 2017). Note that the contributions due to aerosols are zero to the future cumulative RF since they are essentially gone from the atmosphere after the year in which they are emitted. We are not including the impact of regional contributions of aerosols or other short-lived forcing agents on the carbon cycle. We also computed regional contributions for RCP scenarios until 2100. To make the calculations consistent with the other inventories, we computed the RCP scenarios in a manner similar to that for past emissions, i.e., we started with the RCP forcings, computed the emissions required to get them, then allocated along the RCP regional emissions.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are numerous uncertainties in the time histories of RF by various species. Most have little impact on the general results presented here. Ignoring emissions before 1850 probably underestimates the later RF from Europe, especially from land-use change that took place in that region. There are of course uncertainties in the emissions inventories, especially for CO
  <sub>2</sub> from land-use and land-cover change. The aerosol analysis assumes that the global mean forcing per unit aerosol emission is independent of where the aerosols were emitted. Bellouin et al. (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>) found that the specific RF for sulfur emissions from Europe and East Asia are within about 50% of the world average. In this regional discussion, we are not including the relatively small amounts of RF due to alterations in albedo induced by land-use changes and we have only a very approximate treatment of the forcing due to ozone. We estimate the largest uncertainty to be the time history of global aerosol RF. The effects of some alternate assumptions for aerosol forcings on our calculations are shown in
