 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many key features of this figure are worthy of comment. The calculated changes in the global RF are well documented and discussed in the literature. The largest changes started around 1970. An inflection is clearly visible in the dark curve that includes both GHG and aerosol forcing. It is less apparent when aerosols are excluded. Also evident is that before 1970 the global net RF was not significantly positive if CO
  <sub>2</sub> from LULC is excluded.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The middle and lower panels show the individual contributions from each of the nine regions from 1900 to date to the overall forcing shown in the top panel. Until about 1970, the contributions of each of the nine regions were less than 0.1 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">North America, Western Europe, Russia and Eastern Europe, and China have successively followed a common pattern of near-cancellation of aerosol and GHG forcing followed by rapid growth of their net contributions to global forcing (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>, 
  <span class="italic">Middle</span>). A similar pattern was also followed by the Pacific Rim countries (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>, 
  <span class="italic">Bottom</span>). There are two conditions for the RF by aerosols to nearly cancel that by longer-lived gases during periods of economic development. First, there must be few emissions controls on the aerosol pollution. Second, the long atmospheric lifetime of CO
  <sub>2</sub> means that its RF in a given year depends on the integrated past emissions. Maintaining a near-cancellation between the forcing from integrated emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub> and the emissions from aerosols at a given time requires that the emissions follow a pattern that is proportional to its own integral, i.e., an exponential function. So, an economy that follows exponential growth with few emission controls can have near-zero net RF for a period of time. This happened for North America in the 1950s and 1960s (also for the Pacific region), for Western Europe slightly after that, and for China in the 1990s and 2000s. More details for North America and Western Europe are shown in

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S5
  </span>. The Indian subcontinent region may still be in a stage with near-cancellation. Other areas such as Latin America and other Asia without a sharp inflection in net RF have strong contributions from LULC compared with fossil fuel use (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The near-cancellation of aerosol and GHG RF ends when either air-quality regulations are imposed on aerosols, aerosol emissions are limited for another reason, or the region’s economy can no longer maintain exponential emissions growth. What remains in the atmosphere is a commitment to future RF that cannot be taken back without active decarbonization of the atmosphere.</p>

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> shows the net cumulative RF from the nine regions noted above due to emissions from 1900 to date. We acknowledge that this figure would be slightly different if the starting date were changed, say to 1850 or 1950, but the relative contributions would remain roughly the same. [The 
   <span class="italic">y</span> axis is 1 yottajoule, YJ (10
   <span class="sup">24</span> J). For reference, the total annual electrical energy consumed globally is currently about 0.00007 YJ (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://yearbook.enerdata.net/electricity/electricity-domestic-consumptiondata.html" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://yearbook.enerdata.net/electricity/electricity-domestic-consumptiondata.html</span>)]. The figure also shows the contribution to future RF by the emissions that have taken place to date (i.e., no further emissions after 2017).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is striking that for all regions, the future commitments up to 2100 from GHGs already in the atmosphere (gray bars) are larger than the cumulative RF to date (dark bars). The differences between these contributions to the past and future arise because the offset due to aerosols is completely absent for the future as opposed to the past emissions. In addition, the atmospheric lifetime of CO
   <sub>2</sub> is long and there is more time for the contribution from now until 2100 relative to that up to now since 1970 (when the growth accelerated). The differences are also evident when we compare China and the Indian subcontinent. Even though the net contributions to date by these two countries are similar, the commitment by China until 2100 is much larger than that of the Indian subcontinent. This is simply because China has emitted more GHGs, whose effect to date has been offset by China’s large aerosol contribution.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For those regions such as Latin America that have not had large cancellations by sulfate emissions, the future commitment is only slightly larger than the cumulative RF to date. These are the same regions that have a relatively large contribution from LULC carbon (compare the right-hand bars).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The region with the largest contribution to the cumulative RF is North America. Western Europe, other Asia (Japan and Korea), Eastern Europe (including Russia), Middle East and Africa, and Central and South America all have contributed roughly equally to date. Note that the absolute values for regions depends on how the regions are defined. For example, combining the Indian subcontinent with other Asia would naturally yield a larger bar in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>. The hashed area to the right shows the varied influence of land-use carbon changes for different regions. The land-use carbon change makes little difference for western Europe, where most land-use changes occurred well before 1900. The largest fractional influences due to land use change area for Latin America and other Asia, where large-scale deforestation has taken place in the past century. There is significant contribution due to land-use changes in North America. One reason is that North American deforestation in the 19th and early 20th century produced CO
   <sub>2</sub> that has been in the atmosphere a long time and hence has contributed significantly to the integrated forcing.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If one parses 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> by the level of economic development, the total cumulative RF from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations (OECD economically developed countries) is roughly comparable to that from the rest of the world. On a per capita basis, the OECD forcing is much larger. We show these in 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813951115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">

   <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>). Our findings are similar to those authors. In particular, we note that the contributions of the developed countries are much larger on a per capita basis than that by the developing countries.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other Metrics of Future Contributions.</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> shows that considering only today’s RF can be misleading because the commitment to future RF from GHGs already in the atmosphere exceeds the net cumulative forcing to date. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a> shows several metrics (cumulative RF, ocean heat content and temperature) of the regional contributions to today’s and future climate forcing. (The details of this calculation are given in 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1813951115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">

   </span>.) The regions are shown as percentages of the global total because that minimizes, although does not entirely eliminate, the dependence on overall climate sensitivity. The solid black bars in the

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “no emissions after 2017” (second panel from the top) in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a> is not intended as a realistic scenario but instead shows future commitment already baked in due to past emissions. The bottom two panels show calculations based on the widely used scenarios presented in the IPCC reports, i.e., the RCPs. Here we explore the future under two commonly used RCPs––RCP 8.5 when the forcing in 2100 would be 8.5 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> [the so-called “business as usual” scenario] (
   <a rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" href="#r16">16</a>), and RCP-2.6 when the forcing in 2100 would be 2.6 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, which would require major controls in place (
   <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>). One simple message that emerges in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a> is that the contribution of North America is the largest to date, irrespective of the metric used. North America’s contribution remains roughly the same, except for the RCP 8.5 scenario where China contributes slightly more than North America by 2100.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some other general conclusions about regional contributions can be seen by examining the contribution from China in the various panels. China provides a good example because it has large and rapidly changing emissions (
   <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>) rather than any special feature of its mix of emissions. In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>, China’s percentage of the global total varies much more from the top to bottom panels than it does for various metrics within each panel. Considering the top two panels, there is a very large change in China’s contribution if only current conditions are considered or if future commitments are included, but the various bars for China are not all that different within each comparison. Considering the bottom two panels for China, the scenario for future emissions matters much more than which metric is used to measure the regional contributions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The choice of metric to measure regional contributions is more important for 2017 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>, 
   <span class="italic">Top</span>) than commitments to 2100 (second from top). Again, using China as an example, the choice of metric can make about a factor of 2 change to its contribution to 2017 climate but only a modest change to its contribution to 2100. The reason is that the metrics respond differently to short-lived climate forcing, especially aerosols, which have a shorter lifetime than any of the GHGs. In contrast, for percentage contributions to the commitment to climate forcing it hardly matters which metric is used. Even by 2100––less than 100 y from now––most of the already committed climate forcing is from one species, CO
   <sub>2</sub>. In that case, and further into the future, the choice of metric becomes less important than it is for estimating contributions in the present (
   <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>). Beyond 2100, most of the committed forcing is from CO
   <sub>2</sub> so the percentage contributions of various regions to cumulative forcing past 2100 is fairly similar to their percentage contributions to cumulative CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a> shows that the percentage contribution of each region to the global climate is strongly affected by two factors: the pattern of economic development (e.g., RCP 2.6 or 8.5), and by how commitments to future RF are included. The latter is analogous to the known dependence of GWPs on the time horizon used to calculate GWP. In contrast, the choice of climate variable is less important to the percentage contributions by different regions.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Features of the Trends in Cumulative RF.</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our calculations show the impact of the offsetting effects of the GHG emissions and aerosol emissions. As noted in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>, the difference between the RF with and without aerosols is roughly 1 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>. This contribution, which has significantly offset the GHG contributions in many regions, can change markedly as air quality is improved, which is important for health benefits now as well as in the future. In the past, net RF has rapidly increased for North America, the Pacific region, and Europe. China is just recently “breaking out” as its emissions are not increasing exponentially, and measures are being taken to control air pollution. Accelerating emissions are required for aerosol cooling to continue to offset the warming by long-lived GHGs. The accelerating emissions are tied to both economic growths and any controls that are placed due to air quality. India is starting to consider air-quality deterioration and its aerosol emissions are unlikely to continue to accelerate indefinitely. Therefore, one should expect that India would also break out to positive cumulative RF in the next decade or two. Of course, avoiding this pattern could be one of the goals of other regions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the future, other regions may experience rapid growth in their contributions to net RF as air quality is improved. Indeed, if all emissions (including GHGs) ceased in 2017, global net RF would be larger than today for 15–20 y until GHG concentrations decayed enough to offset the roughly −1 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> of aerosol forcing (
   <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>). How could the rest of the world avoid the temporary cancellation/huge commitment scenario followed by North America, Europe, and China? In the absence of large-scale removal of CO
   <sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, avoiding the commitment would require a transition to low-GHG emissions before the exponential growth/high-pollution pattern rather than first using a high-GHG economy and then transitioning away from GHGs.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the differences between cumulative RF and either ocean heat content or temperature change is the inclusion in cumulative RF of the energy represented by 
   <div class="inline-formula">
    <div id="i5" class="math">
     <div class="mrow">
      <div displaystyle="true" class="mstyle">
       <span class="mo">∫</span>
      </div>
      <span class="mi">λ</span>
      <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">Δ</span>
      <span class="mi">T</span>
      <span class="mi">d</span>
      <span class="mi">t</span>
     </div>
    </div>
   </div> term. This term represents the energy that maintained/maintains the Earth at a warmer temperature. The regional contributions to global temperature in, for example, 2100, consider only the temperature in 2100, not keeping the Earth warmer between now and 2100. Because it takes into account the energy needed to maintain a warmer Earth, the cumulative RF may be a useful and appropriate measure of future commitments. On the other hand, the temperature is more closely related to impacts of climate change than cumulative RF. The same considerations apply to GTP and GWP metrics: GTP is more closely related to climate impacts but GWP calculations are simpler and more certain.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative contributions of different regions and nations to the forcing of climate change depends more strongly on what is included in the comparison and the time frames of the examination rather than whether the metric is cumulative RF, temperature change, or ocean heat content. This result is analogous to the calculation of GWPs for individual climate forcing agents: The time horizon chosen for the GWP is generally more important than other details of the way the GWP is defined. One should not minimize the importance of the metric: Even a few percentage points in a global contribution might have large economic consequences. But, the time frame of the comparison (e.g., now, 2100, or some other time horizon) and the inclusion or exclusion of future RF from GHGs already in the atmosphere are much more important to regional contributions than the specific metric used to compare various regions.</p>
