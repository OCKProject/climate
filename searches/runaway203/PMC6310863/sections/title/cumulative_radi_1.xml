 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cumulative Radiative Forcing: Metric to Compare Regional Contributions to Global Radiative Forcing</div>
 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two reasons that the radiative forcing (
  <span class="italic">F</span>) at a given time is not a complete measure of the regional contributions to climate change at that time or in the future. First, the past history of radiative forcing (RF) attributable to those regions must be considered to understand changes in temperature and especially ocean heat content. Second, the contributions “baked in” to the future by past actions are not included in RF but need to be considered because long-lived GHGs carry a commitment to future RF.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One measure of sustained contributions to RF is the cumulative RF, that is, the integral of the time-dependent RF over time. This metric has certain advantages. Regional contributions to cumulative RF can be compared without knowing the response of the climate system, as is necessary for regional contributions to temperature change. When looking ahead to the future, comparing the cumulative RF from various regions is analogous to comparing the GWPs of various GHGs: Both integrate RF over a specified time period.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To elucidate the meaning of the cumulative RF, one can start with the linearized climate equation (

     <span mathvariant="normal" class="mi">Δ</span>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The advantage of cumulative RF is that it does not require either a knowledge of λ or a model of energy flows to compute regional contributions, but this is also a limitation. Without knowing λ one cannot predict the magnitude of the temperature change and without an energy model one cannot predict its time response. As 
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq2" href="#eq2">Eq. 
   <span class="bold">2</span>
  </a> shows, the cumulative RF is closely related to the integral of the temperature change rather than the maximum temperature or rate of temperature change, either of which is arguably more closely related to impacts than is the integral over time. However, the cumulative RF does not depend on complex models and can be a useful quantity for comparison of contributions, akin to the concept of GWP or GWP weighted emissions (i.e., GTCO2eq).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One can also estimate the temperature change from a given time history of RF. Our calculations here use the temporal kernel method (
  <a rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" href="#r13">13</a>). These kernels describe a multimodel mean response to a step change in RF. Briefly, an arbitrary time history of RF can be described as a series of small step changes. To the extent that the climate response is linear, the temperature or ocean heat content can be computed as a sum of responses to those step changes. The kernels provide a formal way of computing these changes from model experiments with step changes in CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The kernel method assumes that the temperature response to all other forcing agents is proportional to their RF with the same climate sensitivity as for CO
  <sub>2</sub>. Comparing regional contributions using temperature rather than cumulative RF brings the comparison closer to impacts but introduces additional uncertainty since the kernels are derived from global climate models. Just as regional contributions to cumulative RF are analogous to GWPs, regional contributions to temperature are analogous to global temperature change potentials (GTPs), with many of the same advantages and disadvantages (
  <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>, 
  <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a>, 
  <a rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" href="#r15">15</a>). The tradeoffs when using ocean heat content to compare regional contributions are intermediate between those for cumulative RF and temperature change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We begin our calculations of emissions in 1850, when regionally apportioned databases for industrial and land-use emissions are available. We start the integration of cumulative RF (
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq2" href="#eq2">Eq. 
   <span class="bold">2</span>
  </a>) in 1900. We choose 1900 as the start since CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations exceeded 300 ppm around this time and industrialization accelerated. It also allows some time for emissions to accumulate before starting the integration. Because RF was small before 1900 compared with today, our calculations are not very sensitive to the exact starting year.
