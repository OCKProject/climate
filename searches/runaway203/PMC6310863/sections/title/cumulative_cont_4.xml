  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> shows the net cumulative RF from the nine regions noted above due to emissions from 1900 to date. We acknowledge that this figure would be slightly different if the starting date were changed, say to 1850 or 1950, but the relative contributions would remain roughly the same. [The 
  <span class="italic">y</span> axis is 1 yottajoule, YJ (10
  <span class="sup">24</span> J). For reference, the total annual electrical energy consumed globally is currently about 0.00007 YJ (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://yearbook.enerdata.net/electricity/electricity-domestic-consumptiondata.html" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://yearbook.enerdata.net/electricity/electricity-domestic-consumptiondata.html</span>)]. The figure also shows the contribution to future RF by the emissions that have taken place to date (i.e., no further emissions after 2017).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is striking that for all regions, the future commitments up to 2100 from GHGs already in the atmosphere (gray bars) are larger than the cumulative RF to date (dark bars). The differences between these contributions to the past and future arise because the offset due to aerosols is completely absent for the future as opposed to the past emissions. In addition, the atmospheric lifetime of CO
  <sub>2</sub> is long and there is more time for the contribution from now until 2100 relative to that up to now since 1970 (when the growth accelerated). The differences are also evident when we compare China and the Indian subcontinent. Even though the net contributions to date by these two countries are similar, the commitment by China until 2100 is much larger than that of the Indian subcontinent. This is simply because China has emitted more GHGs, whose effect to date has been offset by Chinaâ€™s large aerosol contribution.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For those regions such as Latin America that have not had large cancellations by sulfate emissions, the future commitment is only slightly larger than the cumulative RF to date. These are the same regions that have a relatively large contribution from LULC carbon (compare the right-hand bars).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The region with the largest contribution to the cumulative RF is North America. Western Europe, other Asia (Japan and Korea), Eastern Europe (including Russia), Middle East and Africa, and Central and South America all have contributed roughly equally to date. Note that the absolute values for regions depends on how the regions are defined. For example, combining the Indian subcontinent with other Asia would naturally yield a larger bar in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>. The hashed area to the right shows the varied influence of land-use carbon changes for different regions. The land-use carbon change makes little difference for western Europe, where most land-use changes occurred well before 1900. The largest fractional influences due to land use change area for Latin America and other Asia, where large-scale deforestation has taken place in the past century. There is significant contribution due to land-use changes in North America. One reason is that North American deforestation in the 19th and early 20th century produced CO
  <sub>2</sub> that has been in the atmosphere a long time and hence has contributed significantly to the integrated forcing.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If one parses 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a> by the level of economic development, the total cumulative RF from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations (OECD economically developed countries) is roughly comparable to that from the rest of the world. On a per capita basis, the OECD forcing is much larger. We show these in

  <a rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" href="#r9">9</a>) and Wei et al. (
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>). Our findings are similar to those authors. In particular, we note that the contributions of the developed countries are much larger on a per capita basis than that by the developing countries.
