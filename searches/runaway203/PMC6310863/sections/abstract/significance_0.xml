 <p>The cumulative radiative forcing (CRF), an integral of radiative forcing over a given time, is used to calculate the contribution to the global mean net radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases and aerosols from various regions. For every region, the commitment to future radiative forcing from emissions already in the atmosphere is larger than that to date. For individual regions, the CRF is near zero during rapid industrialization and it increases when air-quality regulations come in and/or exponential growth ceases, a pattern repeated by North America, Europe, and China. The relative contributions from regions depends more on when the contributions are compared (e.g., now or 2100) and development scenarios than the metric used (i.e., CRF, ocean heat content, or temperature).</p>
