 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau (HTP) contain the largest volume of snow and ice outside the polar regions. Snow and glacial melt in the HTP constitute the primary freshwater supply for over 20% of the global population

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> showed that a global temperature rises of 1.5 °C would lead to a loss of approximately one-third of the present-day glacial ice mass in the HTP by the end of this century. The warming of the HTP and the glacial retreat therein further affect the weather, hydrological cycles, and ecosystems at the regional and global scales, thereby threatening the water availability and food security for hundreds of millions of people

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Black carbon (BC), which is mainly emitted from incomplete combustion, is the second-most important anthropogenic climate forcer in the present-day atmosphere after carbon dioxide
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Previous studies have shown that BC aerosols can exert significant impacts on glaciers because of both the heating effects of airborne BC and the albedo effects of deposited BC

  </span>. The HTP, which is surrounded by the two most densely industrialized major source regions of BC, namely, South Asia and East Asia, is considered to be more vulnerable to the effects of BC than other regions. Ample evidence shows that the increasing amount of BC being transported into the HTP plays an important role on the observed rapid glacial retreat therein comparable to the effects of greenhouse gases (GHGs)

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Unlike well-distributed and long-lived GHGs, BC has a heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution that is extremely sensitive to the emission sites because of a much shorter residence time in the atmosphere. Therefore, tracing the sources of BC being transported into the HTP is essential for providing valuable guidance for an effective mitigation strategy.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have made efforts to identify the origins of BC over the HTP during the last decade
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. However, those studies attributed the BC over the HTP to only regions where BC emissions occur during the production of goods and services (i.e., production-based emissions), following atmospheric transport pathways. Meanwhile, BC emissions produced in one region can be further assigned to regions where the related goods and services are ultimately consumed (i.e., consumption -based emissions)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. The geographical separation of production and consumption following global trade leads to a shift in air pollutant emissions and their associated environmental pressures across regions

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Therefore, understanding the role of global trade in the distribution of BC emissions and the sharing of responsibility among countries/regions on the BC pollution over the HTP could provide valuable information for the international climate policies making.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To address this issue, we combine four state-of-the-art models to link the BC-related climate forcing over the HTP to different countries/regions as producers and consumers in global trade, respectively. We use the adjoint of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem model to identify the locations from which the BC currently situated over the glaciers of the HTP originate and to quantify their relevant emission sensitivities. We further assign the BC emissions in the production process to the final consumers along the supply chain using a multi-region input–output (MRIO) model. The production- and consumption-based emissions are then combined with the emission sensitivities derived from adjoint simulations to estimate the relative contributions of different countries/regions to BC pollutions over the HTP from production and consumption perspectives, respectively. The corresponding direct radiative forcing (DRF) and snow albedo forcing (SAF) of BC over the HTP glaciers are calculated using a radiative transfer model and a stochastic snow albedo model. In this study, we provide a combined assessment of the sources and radiative forcing of BC over the HTP glaciers from multiple perspectives and reveal the role of global trade in aggravating the BC-related climate forcing over the HTP glaciers. The findings of this study provide valuable implications on the mitigation of the HTP glacial retreat.</p>
