 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our estimates show that nearly 13% of the ~6.9 Tg of global anthropogenic BC emissions in 2011 were related to traded products through global trade. The interregional flow refers to the transfer of BC emissions between regions where the emissions occur in the production activities and regions where the related goods and services are ultimately consumed. Given the large volumes of interregional flows of air pollutants embodied in global trade, these virtual transport pathways of air pollutants can be orders of magnitude more significant than those of traditional atmospheric transport pathways

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a> shows the virtual interregional BC flows embodied in the import/export of goods and services among various countries/regions (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> for a map of the defined regions). China, which is a primary BC source region, accounts for 30% of the global anthropogenic emissions. More than 10% of its direct emissions (above 0.2 Tg) can be attributed to goods and services consumed by other countries/regions, mainly the USA and Europe (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). Considerable BC emissions in India and Southeast Asia are also related to final consumption in other regions. The consumption of Middle Asia enables the outsource of BC emissions (0.06 Tg) to primarily China and India through the import of goods and services. Africa and Southeast Asia export their goods and services to distant regions like Europe while consume goods and services mainly from China. Even though the effects of BC emissions produced in the USA and Europe on the HTP glaciers are negligible, the international trade enables shifts of large amount of BC emissions from the USA and Europe to China, India and other Asian regions, and those emissions may be subsequently transported to the HTP (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>).

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative contributions of different regions to the BC over the HTP glaciers from production and consumption perspectives are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>. The USA and Europe play significantly more important roles in the BC pollution over the HTP glaciers as final consumers than as direct emitters. Our estimation shows that nearly 10% of the BC over the HTP glaciers are related to the emissions embodied in the traded products through global trade. Generally, the global trade leads to a virtual transport pathway of BC from distant regions to the HTP glaciers. This process aggravates the BC pollution towards the HTP glaciers.
