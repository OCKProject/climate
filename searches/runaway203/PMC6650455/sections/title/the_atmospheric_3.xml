  <span class="sup">5</span> kg in 2011. An adjoint sensitivity analysis estimates that anthropogenic emissions accounted for 95.4% of the BC arriving in the HTP glacier regions, among which only 4.7% was emitted locally over the HTP. BC emissions produced in India and the rest of China (i.e., outside the HTP) are two major anthropogenic sources that contribute ~30.1% and 16.3% of the annual BC over the HTP glaciers, respectively. Central Asia, Middle Asia, and Southeast Asia, as producers, collectively contribute 9.8% of BC to the atmospheric column over the HTP glacier regions throughout a year.

  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows detailed maps of the global anthropogenic BC emission directly contributing to the BC concentrations over the HTP glaciers during different seasons (see Supplementary Fig.

The emission hot spots are located over regions adjacent to the Himalayas, including Nepal and Pakistan. The atmospheric transport pathways of BC to the HTP are characterized by the mid-latitude westerlies and Asian monsoon

  </span>. Therefore, the sources of BC over the HTP exhibit substantial seasonal and geographical variabilities. A seasonal-mean mass-burden of 4.2 × 10
  <span class="sup">5</span> kg of BC was estimated over the HTP glaciers during December-January–February (DJF) of 2011, which were transported from world-wide regions following the mid-latitude westerlies due to dry weather conditions and high wind speeds. This amount was nearly halved during the JJA (i.e., June–July–August) because of abundant precipitation and a high BC scavenging efficiency. This seasonal variability in the BC transport to the HTP is consistent with the observations of previous studies

  </span>. The contribution of BC emissions produced in China (including the HTP) to the BC pollution over the HTP increased from 17.4% in DJF to 33.4% in JJA. Accordingly, the mass of BC emitted from Southeast China and transported to the HTP in JJA was more than twice that during the other seasons owing to the East Asia summer monsoon.
