 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The historical trends of anthropogenic contributions to BC over the HTP glaciers from 2000 to 2014 are estimated from a consumption perspective (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). It indicates that the contribution from India to BC over the HTP glaciers has substantially increased by ~40% over the last decade while the USA, Europe, and China all demonstrate a decreasing contribution trend. Specifically, the increasing contribution from India can be mainly attributed to the increasing demand for goods and services in construction and transportation sectors. The significant decrease over China was primarily induced by the mitigation of residential emissions over the last decade. BC emissions related to industrial goods and services consumed in China have increasingly threatened the HTP glaciers from 2000 to 2014 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>).

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, China has implemented a series of clean air actions to reduce emissions of air pollutants and hence the industrial emission of BC in China has begun to decrease since 2014

  </span>. Meng et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span> showed that some labor-intensive and emission-intensive production activities are moving from China to other developing countries including India because of rising labor costs and industry structure change. BC emissions produced in India that are related to goods and services consumed in other regions have been doubled over the last decade. Evidence has shown that the shifting of polluting industries to regions with more permissive environmental regulations has become a substantial and growing problem
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. Considering that the HTP glaciers are more vulnerable to BC emitted from India than that from China, we infer that the rise of trade among developing countries and the increasing emissions from India may enhance BC pollutions over the HTP glaciers.
