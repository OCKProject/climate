 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual-mean BC DRF at the top-of-atmosphere and the average SAF over the HTP glaciers are estimated to be 1.38 and 3.33 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, respectively. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a> shows the BC-SAF over the HTP glaciers contributed by different countries/regions and sectors from production and consumption perspectives. Similar results for the BC DRF are provided in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>. Territorial emissions in India and China are two major contributors to the HTP glaciers, causing BC-SAF of 1.00 and 0.70 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> over the HTP glaciers, respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). More than half of the radiative forcing can be attributed to direct residential emissions (e.g., cooking and heating). Mineral products and transportation constitute two major economic sectors that release substantial BC in India. Meanwhile, BC emissions from the production of petroleum, coal and mineral products in China contribute to 0.19 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> SAF and 0.08 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> DRF over the HTP glaciers (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). Given that substantial territorial emissions are related to the consumption in other regions, the radiative forcing contributed by India and China as final consumers are ~9% lower than as direct emitters (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>).

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pakistan and Nepal, which collectively account for only 2.5% of global BC emissions, exhibit large effects on the BC pollution over the HTP glaciers due to their geographical locations. The collective BC-SAF contributed by Pakistan and Nepal, mainly related to cooking and heating and mineral products, is estimated to be 1.00 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> and 0.94 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> from a production and consumption perspective, respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). Middle Asia, which is also an important contributor to the BC over the HTP glaciers, contributes 0.21 (0.09) W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> SAF (DRF) as a direct emitter. Furthermore, the USA and Europe overall contribute BC-SAF of 0.11 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> to the HTP glaciers as final consumers (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). These effects are nearly 10 times larger than their direct contributions though atmospheric transport pathways. Large components of their consumption-based contributions are derived from transportation and non-transportation services. Moreover, Africa and Southeast Asia contribute 0.11 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> BC-SAF to the HTP glaciers as final consumers, which is one and a half times higher than as direct emitters.
