  </span>. Both BC and CO
  <sub>2</sub> represent major climate factors; however, while BC persists in the atmosphere for only a few weeks, CO
  <sub>2</sub> can remain in the air for centuries. After depositing on the snow and ice, BC directly warms the cryosphere and accelerates the snow-melting more efficiently than CO
  <sub>2</sub> owning to a positive albedo feedback

  </span>. The mitigation of BC could lead to significant climatic benefits and is therefore urgently needed to preserve the HTP glaciers

  </span>. Although emissions produced in Asian countries/regions, especially India and China, play crucial roles on the BC pollution over the HTP glaciers due to their high source-receptor sensitivities to the HTP glaciers, our study reveals global trade can further aggravate this problem through a virtual transport pathway of BC from distant regions like US and Europe to the HTP glaciers. Nearly 10% of BC over the HTP glaciers can be attributed to global trade through the relocation of production activities and exchange of commodities. The rapid rise of trade among developing countries contributes to the increase of BC emitted in India and transported to the HTP, which increasingly threatening the HTP glaciers.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the significant effects of international trade on BC pollutions over the HTP glaciers, collaborative efforts are needed for an effective mitigation of the BC pollution over the HTP glaciers. Asian countries, especially India and China, should expend substantial efforts, such as improving their energy efficiency, developing clean coal technologies, and promoting clean energy sources, to minimize their domestic BC emissions. Countries/regions that primarily import commodities should care more about the selection of their trading partners or provide assistance in the regulations of trade-related emissions to mitigate corresponding climate effects because the sensitivities of BC over the HTP glaciers to various source regions show large differences.</p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Present international policies to regulate the transboundary air pollutions, such as the Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) Convention
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span> and the Mal√© Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>, consider only the responsibilities of direct emitters and physical transboundary air pollutants. The potential effect of international trade on air pollutions and the shared responsibilities of consumers in this issue are generally ignored by policy-makers. The virtual transport of air pollutants related to the trade of goods and services among countries/regions can be orders of magnitude larger than the typical atmospheric transport
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Therefore, future policies should consider the effects of international trade to preserve vulnerable regions like the HTP glaciers.
