An adjoint sensitivity analysis estimates that anthropogenic emissions accounted for 95.4% of the BC arriving in the HTP glacier regions, among which only 4.7% was emitted locally over the HTP. BC emissions produced in India and the rest of China (i.e., outside the HTP) are two major anthropogenic sources that contribute ~30.1% and 16.3% of the annual BC over the HTP glaciers, respectively. Central Asia, Middle Asia, and Southeast Asia, as producers, collectively contribute 9.8% of BC to the atmospheric column over the HTP glacier regions throughout a year.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our estimates show that nearly 13% of the ~6.9 Tg of global anthropogenic BC emissions in 2011 were related to traded products through global trade. The interregional flow refers to the transfer of BC emissions between regions where the emissions occur in the production activities and regions where the related goods and services are ultimately consumed. Given the large volumes of interregional flows of air pollutants embodied in global trade, these virtual transport pathways of air pollutants can be orders of magnitude more significant than those of traditional atmospheric transport pathways

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> for a map of the defined regions). China, which is a primary BC source region, accounts for 30% of the global anthropogenic emissions. More than 10% of its direct emissions (above 0.2 Tg) can be attributed to goods and services consumed by other countries/regions, mainly the USA and Europe (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). Considerable BC emissions in India and Southeast Asia are also related to final consumption in other regions. The consumption of Middle Asia enables the outsource of BC emissions (0.06 Tg) to primarily China and India through the import of goods and services. Africa and Southeast Asia export their goods and services to distant regions like Europe while consume goods and services mainly from China. Even though the effects of BC emissions produced in the USA and Europe on the HTP glaciers are negligible, the international trade enables shifts of large amount of BC emissions from the USA and Europe to China, India and other Asian regions, and those emissions may be subsequently transported to the HTP (Fig.

The USA and Europe play significantly more important roles in the BC pollution over the HTP glaciers as final consumers than as direct emitters. Our estimation shows that nearly 10% of the BC over the HTP glaciers are related to the emissions embodied in the traded products through global trade. Generally, the global trade leads to a virtual transport pathway of BC from distant regions to the HTP glaciers. This process aggravates the BC pollution towards the HTP glaciers.

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The historical trends of anthropogenic contributions to BC over the HTP glaciers from 2000 to 2014 are estimated from a consumption perspective (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). It indicates that the contribution from India to BC over the HTP glaciers has substantially increased by ~40% over the last decade while the USA, Europe, and China all demonstrate a decreasing contribution trend. Specifically, the increasing contribution from India can be mainly attributed to the increasing demand for goods and services in construction and transportation sectors. The significant decrease over China was primarily induced by the mitigation of residential emissions over the last decade. BC emissions related to industrial goods and services consumed in China have increasingly threatened the HTP glaciers from 2000 to 2014 (Fig.

BC emissions produced in India that are related to goods and services consumed in other regions have been doubled over the last decade. Evidence has shown that the shifting of polluting industries to regions with more permissive environmental regulations has become a substantial and growing problem
