  </span> is used to calculate the instantaneous clear-sky BC direct radiative forcing (DRF) in the atmosphere. In the FLG RTM, the delta-four-stream approximation for solar flux calculations is combined with the delta-two/four-stream approximation for infrared flux calculations to assure both the accuracy and the efficiency. The solar (0–5 μm) and infrared (5–50 μm) spectra are divided into 6 and 12 bands, respectively, based on the locations of absorption bands. The correlated 
  <span class="italic">k</span>-distribution method is used to differentiate the gaseous absorption lines. The spatial and temporal distributions of the BC concentrations and the optical depth used within the RTM are obtained from the GEOS-Chem outputs. The meteorological inputs are taken from the GEOS-5 assimilated fields.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span> is used to calculate the BC-snow albedo forcing (SAF). This model explicitly simulates multiple BC particles both stochastically and internally/externally mixed with various shapes of snow grains. Specifically, the light absorption and scattering (i.e., single scattering properties) of the BC-snow mixtures are calculated using an improved geometric-optics surface-wave (GOS) approach

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>. The single scattering properties of an ensemble of randomly orientated snow grains (mixed with BC) are further averaged over all directions. The underlying ground albedo is obtained from GEOS-5 meteorological fields. The snow albedo is computed via the adding/doubling radiative transfer method using the single scattering properties of the BC-snow mixtures. We fully consider different snow grain shapes (sphere or spheroid), BC-snow mixing states (internal or external), and BC coating states (coated or uncoated) in our estimation, and the mean value is used in the final report. The BC-induced snow albedo reduction is calculated as the difference in the snow albedo both with and without BC. This albedo reduction is further coupled with the GEOS-5 incoming solar radiation field to obtain the surface radiative forcing following Wang et al.

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GEOS-Chem-simulated BC concentrations in the air and snow are input into the FLG RTM and SSAM. The global DRF at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and the BC-SAF estimated in this study are 0.54 and 0.07 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, respectively, which fall within the ranges published in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (0.05–0.8 and 0.02–0.09 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, respectively)

These radiative forcing (i.e., DRF and SAF) of BC are averaged over the HTP glacier region selected in this study and further assigned to different regions and sectors according to their relative contributions to the BC concentrations from production and consumption perspectives.
