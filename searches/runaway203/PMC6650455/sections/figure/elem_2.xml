  <p>BC emissions embodied in global trade and BC radiative forcing over the HTP. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Consumption-based interregional flows of BC emissions. Source on the left side refers to BC emissions related to goods and services consumed in the given region that are produced in other regions. Receptor on the right side refers to BC emissions produced in the given region that are related to the consumptions in other regions. Black dots indicate the net interregional flow of BC embodied in global trade as the Receptor minus the Source. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Production- (top bar) and consumption-based (bottom bar) snow albedo forcing (W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>) of BC averaged over the HTP glaciers for different regions and sectors. The results for India, China, Pakistan, Nepal, Middle Asia, and the rest of South Asia are displayed according to the 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis in the top half. The results for the USA, Europe, Russia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and all other regions are displayed according to the 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis on the bottom half. Error bars denote uncertainty ranges related to inter-annual climate variabilities. Please refer to Supplementary Fig.
