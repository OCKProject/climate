         <p>Nominal demand in the (

            2100 of alternative pathways, used to determine model sensitivity to primary energy
            demand, are displayed as columns at right. At bottom, time series of fossil fuel market
            share (as a percentage of total energy consumption) and atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentration are displayed at quarter-century intervals. Source of historical data
