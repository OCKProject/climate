  <p>Ratios are calculated annually as the ratio of net anthropogenic carbon emissions (energy and land-use emissions minus anthropogenic sinks) to net carbon sequestration by global plant, soil and ocean systems. Shaded ranges around the central value of each scenario indicate sensitivity of results to primary energy demand. Global surface temperature anomalies projections (Î”
