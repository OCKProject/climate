            exhaustive categories: agricultural, forest, urban/industrial and ‘other'. Each category
            is calibrated to FAOSTAT data on a global level (available for 1961–2010 for agricultural
            and 1990–2012 for forest and other land)
            <a>24</a>. Although not on a geographically explicit basis, land can be repurposed—most notably,
            due to changes in demand for agricultural land.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land categorized as ‘agricultural' is subdivided into arable land, permanent crops

            produce food, feed or energy crops, while permanent meadows and pastures are used
            only for feed production. The BAU scenario is calibrated to historical data available
            on FAO
            <a>24</a>. Crop and livestock yields are modelled endogenously as a function of input-neutral
            technological advancement, land management practices (that is, the expansion of high-input
            agriculture), water availability, pollution (including atmospheric carbon fertilization)
            and climate change.

            an end to the steady expansion of agricultural land seen in the second half of the
            last century: through 2050, growth in demand for vegetal and animal products is likely
            to be satisfied by agricultural intensification. After midcentury, however, the cumulative
            effects of fertilizer saturation, water scarcity and ozone pollution may cause agricultural
            yields to stagnate or decline. As demand for food (in particular animal products)
            continues to grow, agricultural land may begin to expand indefinitely after 2050 at
            the expense of natural habitats.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 2010 and 2100, both supply- and demand-side trends lead to a 17% expansion
            in agricultural land. As land is a finite resource, transitions are zero sum. In the
            BAU scenario, agricultural land expands at the cost of natural habitats included in
            forests and ‘other' land (that is, grassland). The general category of ‘forest' includes
            both natural and managed stands, although emissions from conversion from natural to

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much of the land-use change in the Fossil Fuels and BAU scenarios can be attributed

            use in ways that are technically possible. Unnecessary deforestation, an example of
            squandered resources, is land-use change driven by social and political constraints,
            including conflict, poor governance, perverse incentives, poverty and shortage of
            labour or capital
            <a>9</a>. Consistent with all four RCPs, the RE-Low and RE-High scenarios eliminate unnecessary

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Net land sink carbon flux is plotted for all scenarios in 
            <a>Fig. 5c</a>. The cycling and availability of nutrients including N, P and water represent another
            important feedback to land sink carbon flow in general and NPP in particular
            <a>20</a>. These considerations tend to limit NPP response to atmospheric carbon concentrations
            and should be included in subsequent iterations of this analysis.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In deep decarbonization scenarios, net carbon flux into the ocean and lands reservoirs
            switches directions, turning these sinks into carbon sources. The simplest physical
            explanation for this effect is that rapid decarbonization reverses the sign, or direction,
            of the chemical coupling between the atmosphere, ocean and land sink. This coupling
            is responsible for increasing the net carbon flux into natural sinks as emissions
            rise; thus, it should also be expected to cause a net carbon flow out of these sinks
            if net-negative anthropogenic emissions are achieved and atmospheric carbon concentration
            begins to drop.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From another perspective, we could invoke Le Châtelier's principle to predict that
            the earth system will act to ‘resist' change. In deep decarbonization scenarios, the
            ‘change' is the reduction in atmospheric carbon concentration resulting from net-negative
            anthropogenic emissions and the natural ‘response' is the net flow of carbon out of
            the land and ocean sinks.
