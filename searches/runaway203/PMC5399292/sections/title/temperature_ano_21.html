      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">HadCRUT4 data on global surface temperature anomaly are used for results validation,
         and represent observed temperature increases relative to the period (1850–1900) from
         the Met Office Hadley Center
         <a>38</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global surface temperature change is affected by radiative forcings, feedback cooling
         due to outbound longwave radiation, and heat transfer from the atmosphere and mixed
         ocean layer to the four deep ocean layers. Net radiative forcing is calculated from
         the concentration of carbon in atmosphere, a product of CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions from the energy and LULUCF sectors and other greenhouse gases, including
         CH
         <sub>4</sub>, N
         <sub>2</sub>O, halocarbons, and other gases and aerosols. Endogenous projections of atmospheric
         carbon concentration are used to model associated radiative forcing anomaly for carbon
         dioxide. Forcing anomalies associated with other greenhouse gases are modeled exogenously
         using RCP 4.5 (ref. 
         <a>7</a>). Total greenhouse gas forcing is translated into temperature anomalies as in the
         C-ROADS model
         <a>34</a><a>35</a> (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 6</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A negative feedback loop incorporates heat transfer from the atmosphere and the upper
         ocean into space via outbound longwave radiation. The magnitude of this feedback,
         or cooling, is determined by the ECS, a metric used to characterize the response of
         the global climate system to a given forcing. ECS is broadly defined as the equilibrium
         global mean surface temperature change following a doubling of atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration. In the FeliX model, ECS is nominally set equal to 3.0 °C/2 × CO
         <sub>2</sub>. In 
         <a>Supplementary Fig. 4a</a>, temperature anomaly projections are shown for the BAU scenario over the full range
         of probable values for ECS (1.5–4.5) as identified by the IPCC
         <a>11</a>. In 
         <a>Supplementary Fig. 5</a>, we plot 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> and Δ
         <span>T</span> projections based on ECS′=2.5 °C/2 × CO
         <sub>2</sub>. This range of values is consistent with Coupled Climate Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison
         Project results
         <a>4</a> and the latest estimates from IPCC
         <a>11</a>.
