      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions from the LULUCF sector include deforestation and forest conversion to managed
         forests and plantations, net of afforestation. All processes are calculated explicitly
         in the model as the net effect of global population growth, per capita energy and
         food demand, and agricultural yields
         <a>2</a><a>32</a>. Relative to energy sector emissions, LULUCF emissions are subject to very large
         uncertainties (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 4</a>), as shown by divergences among annual and cumulative LULUCF emissions estimates
         from the IPCC, CMIP5, CDIAC and RCP database.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the FeliX model, LULUCF emissions per unit area are calibrated using deforestation
         rates from the FAO
         <a>24</a> and historical CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions from the CDIAC
         <a>33</a>. This method produces a historical emissions pathway well within the error range
         as estimated by IPCC and CMIP5 analyses
         <a>3</a><a>5</a>. Future LULUCF emissions projections fall within the full range of RCP projections.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Fossil Fuels scenario, LULUCF emissions drop to zero at the end of the century
         as easily-deforested areas are depleted and the persistent predominance of fossil
         fuels limits land-use change for bioenergy production. Greater bioenergy demand in
         the BAU scenario leads to greater land-use change and associated emissions.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much of the land-use change in the Fossil Fuels and BAU scenarios can be attributed
         to â€˜unnecessary' deforestation, which is forest loss from failure to optimize land
         use in ways that are technically possible. Unnecessary deforestation, an example of
         squandered resources, is land-use change driven by social and political constraints,
         including conflict, poor governance, perverse incentives, poverty and shortage of
         labour or capital
         <a>9</a>. Consistent with all four RCPs, the RE-Low and RE-High scenarios eliminate unnecessary
         deforestation based on the assumption that any significant future transition to REs
         will be coupled with enhanced protection of terrestrial landscapes and their carbon
         stocks
         <a>3</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nominal rate of input-neutral growth is shifted up and down to evaluate the impacts
         of alternative yields. The magnitude of these shifts is indicated by the shaded region
         in 
         <a>Supplementary Fig. 1b</a>, but the effect of this shift is smaller than that of primary energy demand, and
         is therefore suppressed throughout figures in the main paper.
