   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. Although not on a geographically explicit basis, land can be repurposed—most notably, due to changes in demand for agricultural land.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>.

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</a> plots FeliX model projections for crop yields in the BAU scenario. The model predicts an end to the steady expansion of agricultural land seen in the second half of the last century: through 2050, growth in demand for vegetal and animal products is likely to be satisfied by agricultural intensification. After midcentury, however, the cumulative effects of fertilizer saturation, water scarcity and ozone pollution may cause agricultural yields to stagnate or decline. As demand for food (in particular animal products) continues to grow, agricultural land may begin to expand indefinitely after 2050 at the expense of natural habitats.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much of the land-use change in the Fossil Fuels and BAU scenarios can be attributed to ‘unnecessary' deforestation, which is forest loss from failure to optimize land use in ways that are technically possible.

This coupling is responsible for increasing the net carbon flux into natural sinks as emissions rise; thus, it should also be expected to cause a net carbon flow out of these sinks if net-negative anthropogenic emissions are achieved and atmospheric carbon concentration begins to drop.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From another perspective, we could invoke Le Châtelier's principle to predict that the earth system will act to ‘resist' change.
