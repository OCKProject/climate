      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concept of a carbon budget involves multiple dynamic, interrelated components
         of the global carbon cycle and can be defined in a number of ways. As a figure of
         merit, we define an atmospheric flux ratio (
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>) as the ratio of net CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions (anthropogenic sources minus artificial sinks) to net CO
         <sub>2</sub> uptake by natural sinks (that is, plant, soil and ocean systems).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The atmospheric flux ratio characterizes annual changes in the atmospheric carbon
         burden. Atmospheric flux ratios greater than unity (
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>&gt;1) indicate increasing atmospheric carbon concentrations, associated radiative forcing
         and temperatures. Ratio values between zero and unity (0&lt;
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>&lt;1) indicate net negative atmospheric carbon flux due to net ocean and land sink uptake,
         an important milestone on the path to climate stabilization. Finally, values below
         zero (
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>&lt;0) indicate net negative anthropogenic emissions—that is, the achievement of the
         COP carbon emissions target. We calculate recent historical values of 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> on the basis of data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
         <a>3</a> and use the FeliX model to project 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> through 2100 for all scenarios.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the most recent available IPCC data for global atmospheric carbon flux, we
         calculate 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>=1.9±0.2 for the period 2002–2011 (
         <span>cf</span>. 
         <a>Fig. 1</a>). This value is in good agreement with FeliX model results, which estimate 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>=2.1±0.2, indicating that net anthropogenic carbon emissions are roughly double the
         combined net uptake by plants, soil and oceans. Looking in more detail at year 2015
         of the FeliX model, primary energy consumption totals nearly 600 EJ per year (
         <span>cf</span>. 
         <a>Fig. 2</a>) and net emissions from the energy and LULUCF sectors total 10.4 and 1.0 PgC, respectively
         (
         <span>cf</span>. 
         <a>Figs 3a</a> and 
         <a>4a</a>). In the same year, the carbon content of the atmosphere increases by 6.3 PgC and
         the ocean and land sinks each take up 2.7 PgC (
         <span>cf</span>. 
         <a>Fig. 5</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carbon uptake by natural sinks is dependent on anthropogenic emissions via climactic
         and chemical feedback mechanisms
         <a>4</a><a>5</a>. In decarbonization scenarios, net carbon uptake by the land and ocean systems approaches
         zero as anthropogenic emissions also decrease to zero and this dynamic relationship
         makes a moving target of net negative atmospheric carbon flux. In this section, we
         present FeliX scenario results and use 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> to evaluate energy and LULUCF transition pathways relative to the COP targets.
