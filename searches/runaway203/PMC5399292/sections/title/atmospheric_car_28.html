      <p>Ratios are calculated annually as the ratio of net anthropogenic carbon emissions
         (energy and land-use emissions minus anthropogenic sinks) to net carbon sequestration
         by global plant, soil and ocean systems. Shaded ranges around the central value of
         each scenario indicate sensitivity of results to primary energy demand. Global surface
         temperature anomalies projections (Î”
         <span>T</span>) in 2,100 are indicated at the right, where each coloured bar treats the RE-Low and
         RE-High scenarios as the endpoints of a continuous range of energy sector decarbonization,
         plus a fixed rate of CCS. Historical values of 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> and associated errors (
         <span>cf.</span><a>equation (12)</a>) from the IPCC are indicated by green bars
