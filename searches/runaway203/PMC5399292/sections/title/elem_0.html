         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concept of a carbon budget involves multiple dynamic, interrelated components
            of the global carbon cycle and can be defined in a number of ways. As a figure of
            merit, we define an atmospheric flux ratio (
            <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>) as the ratio of net CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions (anthropogenic sources minus artificial sinks) to net CO
            <sub>2</sub> uptake by natural sinks (that is, plant, soil and ocean systems).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The atmospheric flux ratio characterizes annual changes in the atmospheric carbon
            burden. Atmospheric flux ratios greater than unity (
            <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>&gt;1) indicate increasing atmospheric carbon concentrations, associated radiative forcing
            and temperatures. Ratio values between zero and unity (0&lt;
            <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>&lt;1) indicate net negative atmospheric carbon flux due to net ocean and land sink uptake,
            an important milestone on the path to climate stabilization. Finally, values below
            zero (
            <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>&lt;0) indicate net negative anthropogenic emissions—that is, the achievement of the
            COP carbon emissions target. We calculate recent historical values of 
            <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> on the basis of data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
