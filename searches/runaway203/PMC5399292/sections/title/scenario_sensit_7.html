         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> are calculated by propagating uncertainties on each of the component fluxes, as estimated
         by the IPCC and discussed in the Methods section of this analysis, into the final
         figure of merit (

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within each scenario, we have reported 
         <span>C</span><sub>A</sub>, Δ
         <span>T</span> as numerical ranges in the text and as shaded regions in all figures, to indicate
         the sensitivity of the results to alternative primary energy demand projections. Primary
         energy demand shifts are the cumulative effect of exogenous ±0.2% annual increments
         in per capita energy demand after 2015, while market share of each fuel is held near
         constant (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 2</a>). The effect of this shift ranges from Δ
         <span>C</span><sub>A</sub>±16 p.p.m. in RE-High (2100) to Δ
         <span>C</span><sub>A</sub>±37 p.p.m. in Fossil Fuels (2100).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future population growth is the leading socio-economic source of uncertainty, whereas
         the initial net primary productivity (NPP), land sink carbon residence time and equilibrium
         climate sensitivity (ECS; or the global temperature increase resulting from a doubling
         of the atmospheric carbon load) are the leading biogeophysical sources of uncertainty
         in emissions and warming pathways
         <a>11</a>. High and low shifts from the nominal value of these and other fundamental model
         parameters are used to determine the sensitivity of the BAU scenario (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Supplementary Table 2</a>).
