  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). In the nominal energy pathway, REs (that is, solar, wind and biomass) grow at an average annual rate of 4.0% from 2013 through 2100, causing a decline in the total market share of fossil fuels from 90% (2015) to 60% (2100) of primary energy supply. In absolute terms, however, consumption of conventional fuels grows until 2060 to meet growing primary energy demand (
  <span class="italic">cf</span>. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2b</a>). Fossil fuel emissions peak at 12.7–14.5 PgC per year around 2055, then decrease to 10.9–12.6 PgC per year by 2100. Emissions from REs increase from 0.1 PgC per year in 2015 to 0.5–0.7 PgC per year in 2100, reflecting the costs of bioenergy harvesting, transportation and processing (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, annual anthropogenic emissions in the BAU scenario peak at 13.5–15.6 PgC per year around 2054, then decline modestly over the second half of the century (
  <span class="italic">cf.</span>
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5a</a>). Annual ocean CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux increases to a peak of 3.2–3.4 PgC per year around 2065, after which point ocean flux stabilizes as the chemical and temperature feedbacks cancel each other out. Net carbon flux into the land sink peaks at the same magnitude (3.1–3.4 PgC per year) around 2046 and declines to 2.3–2.9 by 2100 due to the temperature feedback (

To contextualize these endogenous results using IPCC benchmarks, we note that the energy and LULUCF sectors, as modelled in the BAU scenario, generate cumulative carbon emissions and temperature anomalies similar to Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 6.0, one of the IPCC's four benchmark concentration pathways for CO
