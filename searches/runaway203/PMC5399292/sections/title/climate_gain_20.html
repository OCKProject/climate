      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Table 3</a> presents FeliX model parameters including climate sensitivity (
         <span>α</span>), land sink sensitivity to carbon (
         <span>β</span><sub>L</sub>) and climate (
         <span>γ</span><sub>L</sub>), and ocean sensitivity to carbon (
         <span>β</span><sub>O</sub>) and climate (
         <span>γ</span><sub>O</sub>), calculated for 2100 as in the Coupled Climate Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison
         Project (C4MIP)
         <a>4</a><a>5</a>. Overall gain (g) of the climate system, which quantifies the ratio of temperature
         change due to these feedback loops to total temperature change, is shown in the column
         at the far right
         <a>4</a><a>37</a>. For comparison to similar models, we also show the average value for each parameter
         from the ensemble of 11 models included in the same study. All FeliX parameters show
         satisfactory agreement with the carbon flux drivers and feedbacks as modelled in this
         ensemble and in the subsequent iteration, CMIP5 (ref. 
         <a>5</a>).
