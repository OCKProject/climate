      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nominal energy demand per capita is linked sigmoidally with GDP per capita
         <a>28</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RE-Low and RE-High scenarios are loosely calibrated to plausible energy futures
         under climate action scenarios, as identified by the Global Energy Assessment (MESSAGE
         model: geala_450_atr_nonuc, geaha_450_atr_full; IMAGE model: GEA_low_450 and GEA_high_450)
         <a>8</a>. In this way, we establish soft links between FeliX, and MESSAGE and IMAGE, two specialized
         models of global energy systems
         <a>8</a> (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Table 2</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Energy consumption in these pathways is compared with FeliX in 
         <a>Supplementary Table 3</a>. In addition, we note that bioenergy production rates in the BAU and RE-Low scenarios
         are compatible with meta-analyses, including â€˜medium agreement' projections from the
         IPCC WG3, AR5 for year 2050, whereas bioenergy production in the RE-High scenario
         falls just beyond this range
         <a>29</a><a>30</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although there are significant uncertainties associated with projecting energy consumption
         several decades into the future, primary energy profiles are not FeliX model results
         for the purposes of this analysis. Rather, they are definitional of their respective
         scenarios, and are intended to illustrate correspondences between 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> and energy sector transformations of various magnitudes.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We model low and high shifts in total primary energy demand as variations on the Fossil
         Fuels, BAU, RE-Low and RE-High scenarios. Primary energy consumption in 2100 in these
         scenarios is indicated by the columns to the right of PE profiles in 
         <a>Fig. 2</a>. Carbon dioxide emissions from oil, gas, coal, biomass, solar, and wind energy are
         calculated as the product of total consumption and carbon intensities which reflect
         the full life-cycle of each technology
         <a>8</a>. 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> and warming projections are calculated for each of these variations and presented
         in 
         <a>Fig. 1</a> as shaded ranges around each of the central values.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In scenarios with CCS, the technology is implemented not as a step function, but as
         a sigmoidal expansion over the course of the twenty-first century to the maximum value
         of 40% (
         
         <div><span></span></div> CCS) or 80% (CCS) of gross energy sector emissions. The expansion of CCS technology
         through 2100 is shown in 
         <a>Supplementary Fig. 1a</a>.
