      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taken together, the Fossil Fuels, BAU, RE-Low and RE-High scenarios define a range
         of plausible energy-emissions pathways. As we have seen, however, even 5% annual growth
         in REs sustained through the twenty-first century fails to achieve critical benchmarks
         for both 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> and Δ
         <span>T</span>. Global transformations of the energy and LULUCF sectors need to be even more ambitious
         than in the RE-High scenario to achieve the COP targets, suggesting that additional
         socioeconomic and technological shifts must be considered.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CCS is implemented as a mitigation wedge within the RE-Low and RE-High scenarios to
         quantify the additional emissions mitigation necessary to achieve the COP targets.
         As variations on the energy and LULUCF sector transitions already discussed, we model
         the effects of CCS technologies scaled up after 2020 to 50% (
         
         <div><span></span></div>CCS) or 100% (CCS) of global energy infrastructures. Assuming an 80% capture efficiency,
         CCS systems capture and permanently sequester up to 40% of gross energy sector emissions
         in the RE-Low+
         
         <div><span></span></div>CCS and RE-High+
         
         <div><span></span></div>CCS variants and up to 80% of gross energy sector emissions in the RE-Low+CCS and
         RE-High+CCS variants.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To achieve these capture rates while keeping up with primary energy demand growth,
         the 
         
         <div><span></span></div>CCS and CCS pathways assume geometric growth (30% and 34% per year, respectively,
         from 2016 through 2040) in the amount of new carbon sequestered each year. Relative
         to the actual current value (7.3 MtC per year)
         <a>10</a>, annual carbon capture expands by a factor of 630–720 by 2040 in 
         
         <div><span></span></div>CCS scenarios and by a factor of 1,310–1,490 by 2040 in the CCS scenarios. From 2040
         through the end of the century, CCS capacity expands an additional 10–40% in both
         pathways to account for rising marginal costs of additional efficiency improvements
         and infrastructural expansion (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Supplementary Fig. 1a</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the RE-Low scenario with

         <div><span></span></div> CCS infrastructure avoids emissions up to 6.1 PgC per year and reaches a cumulative
         total of 383–429 PgC in 2100 (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 3b</a>). In the RE-High scenario, the

      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With CCS applied to the entire energy sector, the RE-Low+CCS scenario achieves 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>=−4.1±5.4, where the outsized error is due to the vanishing denominator, representing
         natural sinks (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 5b,c</a>). CCS infrastructures eliminate up to 12.6 PgC per year, with 776–981 PgC in storage
         by 2100. At the end of the century, 
         <span>C</span><sub>A</sub>=393–405 p.p.m. and Δ

         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> rises again to 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>=−2.1±1.0 in RE-High+CCS, as the removal of carbon from the atmosphere reverses the
         sign of the chemical coupling between the ocean and land reservoirs and the atmosphere,
         transforming them into net sources of carbon (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 5b,c</a>). In this scenario, CCS eliminates up to 11.2 PgC per year and stores a cumulative
         total of 620–844 PgC by 2100 (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 3b</a>). At the end of the century,

         <span>T</span>=1.2–1.4 °C, making this scenario the only one consistent with global warming below
         1.5 °C and beginning a return to pre-industrial atmospheric carbon concentration (
