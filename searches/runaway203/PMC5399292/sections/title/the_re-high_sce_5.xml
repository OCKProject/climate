 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2013 to 2100, REs grow at 5.0% annually, causing absolute fossil fuel consumption to peak as soon as 2022 at 523–532 EJ per year, then decline to less than a fifth of primary energy supply (166–233 EJ per year) by 2100 (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). With the elimination of unnecessary deforestation, net LULUCF emissions fall to 0.2–0.4 PgC per year in 2100 or slightly greater than the corresponding RE-Low value due to land-use change in support of expanded bioenergy production (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summing these effects, net anthropogenic emissions peak at 11.5–11.7 PgC per year in 2022 then decrease to 4.2–6.1 PgC per year in 2100. In response, cumulative carbon uptakes by the ocean and land sinks decrease by 23% and 35%, respectively, relative to BAU from 2011 to 2100 (
