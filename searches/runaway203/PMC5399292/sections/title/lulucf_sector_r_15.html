      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land in the FeliX model is distributed among four mutually exclusive and collectively
         exhaustive categories: agricultural, forest, urban/industrial and ‘other'. Each category
         is calibrated to FAOSTAT data on a global level (available for 1961–2010 for agricultural
         and 1990–2012 for forest and other land)
         <a>24</a>. Although not on a geographically explicit basis, land can be repurposed—most notably,
         due to changes in demand for agricultural land.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land categorized as ‘agricultural' is subdivided into arable land, permanent crops
         and permanent meadows and pastures. Arable land and permanent crops can be used to
         produce food, feed or energy crops, while permanent meadows and pastures are used
         only for feed production. The BAU scenario is calibrated to historical data available
         on FAO
         <a>24</a>. Crop and livestock yields are modelled endogenously as a function of input-neutral
         technological advancement, land management practices (that is, the expansion of high-input
         agriculture), water availability, pollution (including atmospheric carbon fertilization)
         and climate change.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Supplementary Fig. 1b</a> plots FeliX model projections for crop yields in the BAU scenario. The model predicts
         an end to the steady expansion of agricultural land seen in the second half of the
         last century: through 2050, growth in demand for vegetal and animal products is likely
         to be satisfied by agricultural intensification. After midcentury, however, the cumulative
         effects of fertilizer saturation, water scarcity and ozone pollution may cause agricultural
         yields to stagnate or decline. As demand for food (in particular animal products)
         continues to grow, agricultural land may begin to expand indefinitely after 2050 at
         the expense of natural habitats.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 2010 and 2100, both supply- and demand-side trends lead to a 17% expansion
         in agricultural land. As land is a finite resource, transitions are zero sum. In the
         BAU scenario, agricultural land expands at the cost of natural habitats included in
         forests and ‘other' land (that is, grassland). The general category of ‘forest' includes
         both natural and managed stands, although emissions from conversion from natural to
         managed forest (and vice versa) are explicitly accounted for ref. 
         <a>32</a>.
