      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to cycling through terrestrial reservoirs, carbon is removed from the
         atmosphere through dissolution into the mixed ocean layer (depth 0–100 m) and subsequently
         propagates through four independently modelled deeper layers (100–400, 400–700, 700–2,000
         and 2,000–2,800 m).
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The equilibrium dissolved inorganic carbon content of the mixed ocean layer (
         <span>C</span><sub>ML</sub><span>eq.</span>) is given by 
         <a>equation (4)</a>, where 
         
         <div><span></span></div> is the preindustrial carbon content of the oceans, 
         <span>C</span><sub>A</sub> is the present carbon content of the atmosphere and 
         
         <div><span></span></div> is the preindustrial carbon content of the atmosphere. The carbon content of the
         mixed layer (
         <span>C</span><sub>ML</sub>) is assumed to reach equilibrium with the atmosphere with a constant characteristic
         mixing time of 1 year (
         <span>τ</span><sub>ML</sub>=1 year).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ocean-climate coupling (Λ
         <sub>O</sub>; 
         <span>λ</span><sub>O</sub>=0.0045 K
         <span>−1</span>; 
         <span>cf.</span><a>equation (5)</a>) reduces carbon uptake by 46 GtC K
         <span>−1</span> (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Table 3</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the ocean-carbon coupling is expressed by the dimensionless Revelle factor
         (
         <span>ζ</span>), which expresses the marginal capacity of the oceans to absorb carbon (
         <span>δ</span><sub>R</sub>=0.0045). The Revelle factor increases logarithmically with the carbon content of
         the oceans, rising from its initial value (
         <span>ζ</span><sub>I</sub>=9.7) to 10.9 in year 2010 of the simulation (
         <span>cf.</span><a>equation (6)</a>)
         <a>4</a>. The ocean-carbon coupling increases carbon uptake by 1.23 GtC p.p.m.
         <span>−1</span> (
