  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. Fundamental linkages and feedbacks among demographic, economic, land, energy, carbon and climate systems are drawn from published models, articles and sector reports, and codified as differential equations. These equations describe the status and flow of resources, subject to geoclimactic and economic parameters to characterize the present state and co-dependent development of natural and economic systems.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model is calibrated to available historical data between 1900 and 2015 (refs

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>). All FeliX model historical data, parameters, and results are calculated and reported as global averages.
