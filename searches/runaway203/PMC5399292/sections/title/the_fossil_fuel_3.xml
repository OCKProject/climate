  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). In the nominal energy pathway, REs grow at an average annual rate of 2.2% from 2013 through 2100. The primary energy market share of fossil fuels remains steady near 90% over the course of the century, whereas absolute fossil fuel consumption increases to 847–1097 EJ per year by 2100 (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2a</a>). Fossil fuel emissions peak at 16.0–20.1 PgC per year close to the end of the century, whereas emissions from REs do not exceed 0.2 PgC per year (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). LULUCF emissions fall relative to the baseline due to the eventual depletion of easily deforested areas and because diminished bioenergy demand reduces conversion of forests to managed forests and plantations (
