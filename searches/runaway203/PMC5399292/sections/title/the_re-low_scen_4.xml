  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). In the nominal energy pathway, REs grow at an annual rate of 4.4% from 2013 through 2100, driving the market share of conventional fuels below half of primary energy supply in 2100.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although absolute fossil fuel consumption does not begin to decline until after midcentury, it peaks lower (590–688 EJ per year around 2054) and declines more rapidly (to 455–583 EJ per year in 2100) than in the baseline (
  <span class="italic">cf.</span>
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2c</a>). Annual fossil fuel emissions peak in 2050 at 11.1–12.8 PgC per year and decrease to 8.3–10.7 PgC per year in 2100, and emissions from REs grow to 0.7–1.1 PgC per year in 2100 (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assuming a global, concerted effort to achieve the COP targets, policies driving decarbonization of the energy sector in the RE-Low scenario are linked by construction with land-use change restrictions eliminating ‘unnecessary' deforestation or forest loss resulting from poverty, conflict, poor governance, lack of knowledge and other sub-optimal uses of land
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>. FeliX calculates unnecessary deforestation endogenously as the difference between fallow agricultural land and cumulative deforestation after 2011. This optimization of land use offsets emissions from forest conversion to managed forests and plantations, causing annual LULUCF emissions to decrease to 0.1–0.3 PgC per year in 2100 (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, net anthropogenic emissions peak at 12.2–13.2 PgC per year in 2048 and subsequently decline to 9.3–12.0 PgC per year by 2100 (
  <span class="italic">cf.</span>
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5a</a>). In response, cumulative ocean and land sink carbon fluxes over the same period decrease by 7% and 10%, respectively, relative to BAU. These pathways generate a 13% reduction in cumulative emissions relative to the baseline for the period 2011–2100. Although they represent progress in terms of atmospheric carbon (
