  <sub>2</sub> emissions from the LULUCF sector include deforestation and forest conversion to managed forests and plantations, net of afforestation. All processes are calculated explicitly in the model as the net effect of global population growth, per capita energy and food demand, and agricultural yields

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>. Relative to energy sector emissions, LULUCF emissions are subject to very large uncertainties (
  <span class="italic">cf.</span>
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>), as shown by divergences among annual and cumulative LULUCF emissions estimates from the IPCC, CMIP5, CDIAC and RCP database.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the FeliX model, LULUCF emissions per unit area are calibrated using deforestation rates from the FAO
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a> and historical CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions from the CDIAC
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>. This method produces a historical emissions pathway well within the error range as estimated by IPCC and CMIP5 analyses
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a>. Future LULUCF emissions projections fall within the full range of RCP projections.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Fossil Fuels scenario, LULUCF emissions drop to zero at the end of the century as easily-deforested areas are depleted and the persistent predominance of fossil fuels limits land-use change for bioenergy production. Greater bioenergy demand in the BAU scenario leads to greater land-use change and associated emissions.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much of the land-use change in the Fossil Fuels and BAU scenarios can be attributed to â€˜unnecessary' deforestation, which is forest loss from failure to optimize land use in ways that are technically possible. Unnecessary deforestation, an example of squandered resources, is land-use change driven by social and political constraints, including conflict, poor governance, perverse incentives, poverty and shortage of labour or capital
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>. Consistent with all four RCPs, the RE-Low and RE-High scenarios eliminate unnecessary deforestation based on the assumption that any significant future transition to REs will be coupled with enhanced protection of terrestrial landscapes and their carbon stocks

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nominal rate of input-neutral growth is shifted up and down to evaluate the impacts of alternative yields. The magnitude of these shifts is indicated by the shaded region in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</a>, but the effect of this shift is smaller than that of primary energy demand, and is therefore suppressed throughout figures in the main paper.
