      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RE-High scenario describes an accelerated transition to REs in line with aggressive
         climate action scenarios
         <a>8</a>. In this pathway, anthropogenic emissions remain at least 50% higher than natural
         sink flux (
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>=1.7±0.6), but this ratio belies significant progress towards the COP targets.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2013 to 2100, REs grow at 5.0% annually, causing absolute fossil fuel consumption
         to peak as soon as 2022 at 523–532 EJ per year, then decline to less than a fifth
         of primary energy supply (166–233 EJ per year) by 2100 (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 2</a>). Energy sector emissions peak at 10.3–10.5 PgC per year in 2023 and fall to 4.0–5.7 PgC
         per year in 2100 (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 3</a>). With the elimination of unnecessary deforestation, net LULUCF emissions fall to
         0.2–0.4 PgC per year in 2100 or slightly greater than the corresponding RE-Low value
         due to land-use change in support of expanded bioenergy production (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 4</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summing these effects, net anthropogenic emissions peak at 11.5–11.7 PgC per year
         in 2022 then decrease to 4.2–6.1 PgC per year in 2100. In response, cumulative carbon
         uptakes by the ocean and land sinks decrease by 23% and 35%, respectively, relative
         to BAU from 2011 to 2100 (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 5</a>). Cumulative emissions decrease by 42% relative to BAU over the same period. At the
         end of the century, 
         <span>C</span><sub>A</sub>=532–563 p.p.m. and Δ
         <span>T</span>=2.5–2.6 °C (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 6</a>), making the RE-High scenario an approximation of IPCC benchmark RCP 4.5 (refs 
         <a>6</a>, 
         <a>7</a>).
