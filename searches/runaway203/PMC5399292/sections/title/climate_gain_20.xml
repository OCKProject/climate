  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>. For comparison to similar models, we also show the average value for each parameter from the ensemble of 11 models included in the same study. All FeliX parameters show satisfactory agreement with the carbon flux drivers and feedbacks as modelled in this ensemble and in the subsequent iteration, CMIP5 (ref.
