      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Fossil Fuels scenario projects an increase in anthropogenic emissions to at least
         2.5 times the absorptive capacity of natural sinks by 2100 (
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>=2.6±0.7) (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 1</a>). In the nominal energy pathway, REs grow at an average annual rate of 2.2% from
         2013 through 2100. The primary energy market share of fossil fuels remains steady
         near 90% over the course of the century, whereas absolute fossil fuel consumption
         increases to 847–1097 EJ per year by 2100 (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 2a</a>). Fossil fuel emissions peak at 16.0–20.1 PgC per year close to the end of the century,
         whereas emissions from REs do not exceed 0.2 PgC per year (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 3</a>). LULUCF emissions fall relative to the baseline due to the eventual depletion of
         easily deforested areas and because diminished bioenergy demand reduces conversion
         of forests to managed forests and plantations (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 4</a>).
