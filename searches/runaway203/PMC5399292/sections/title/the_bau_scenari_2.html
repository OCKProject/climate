      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The BAU scenario</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The baseline scenario projects an increase in anthropogenic emissions an additional
         20% beyond the absorptive capacity of natural sinks by 2100 (
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>=2.3±0.6) (
         <span>cf</span>. 
         <a>Fig. 1</a>). In the nominal energy pathway, REs (that is, solar, wind and biomass) grow at an
         average annual rate of 4.0% from 2013 through 2100, causing a decline in the total
         market share of fossil fuels from 90% (2015) to 60% (2100) of primary energy supply.
         In absolute terms, however, consumption of conventional fuels grows until 2060 to
         meet growing primary energy demand (
         <span>cf</span>. 
         <a>Fig. 2b</a>). Fossil fuel emissions peak at 12.7–14.5 PgC per year around 2055, then decrease
         to 10.9–12.6 PgC per year by 2100. Emissions from REs increase from 0.1 PgC per year
         in 2015 to 0.5–0.7 PgC per year in 2100, reflecting the costs of bioenergy harvesting,
         transportation and processing (
         <span>cf</span>. 
         <a>Fig. 3</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the LULUCF sector, emissions mitigation from the continuation of recent progress
         combating deforestation is completely offset by emissions from anticipated conversion
         of natural forests to managed forests and plantations for bioenergy production
         <a>6</a><a>7</a>. Net LULUCF emissions decrease to 0.4–1.3 PgC per year in 2100 (
         <span>cf</span>. 
         <a>Fig. 4</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, annual anthropogenic emissions in the BAU scenario peak at 13.5–15.6 PgC
         per year around 2054, then decline modestly over the second half of the century (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 5a</a>). Annual ocean CO
         <sub>2</sub> flux increases to a peak of 3.2–3.4 PgC per year around 2065, after which point ocean
         flux stabilizes as the chemical and temperature feedbacks cancel each other out. Net
         carbon flux into the land sink peaks at the same magnitude (3.1–3.4 PgC per year)
         around 2046 and declines to 2.3–2.9 by 2100 due to the temperature feedback (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 5</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relative to the twentieth century, cumulative anthropogenic emissions increase 225–246%
         (1,250–1,419 PgC) in the present century (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 6b</a>). The BAU energy emissions pathway leads to 
         <span>C</span><sub>A</sub>=684–743 p.p.m. and Δ
         <span>T</span>=3.1–3.3 °C in 2100. To contextualize these endogenous results using IPCC benchmarks,
         we note that the energy and LULUCF sectors, as modelled in the BAU scenario, generate
         cumulative carbon emissions and temperature anomalies similar to Representative Concentration
         Pathway (RCP) 6.0, one of the IPCC's four benchmark concentration pathways for CO
         <sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases
