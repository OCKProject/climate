      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model calculates projected CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions based on representations of carbon emissions from the energy and land-use
         change sectors, as discussed above. These emissions accumulate in the atmosphere until
         they are absorbed into the biosphere, pedosphere or oceans based on C-ROADS, a Simple
         Climate Model, which has been used extensively for climate policy impact analysis
         and decision making by parties to the UNFCCC
         <a>34</a><a>35</a>. Pathways and simplified equations for gross carbon flux among the reservoirs are
         illustrated in 
         <a>Fig. 7</a> and discussed below
         <a>28</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Supplementary Figs 2 and 3</a> illustrates the ocean and land sink responses to increasing atmospheric carbon concentration.
         In 
         <a>Supplementary Fig. 2</a>, cumulative uptake is plotted for both natural sinks relative to atmospheric carbon.
         In 
         <a>Supplementary Fig. 3</a>, we plot the absolute (a) and fractional (b) responses of net sink flux to a range
         of constant emissions rates. For example, 
         <a>Supplementary Fig. 3b</a> indicates that a 100% increase in annual emissions generates a 150% increase in net
         atmospheric carbon flux, an 80% increase in net carbon uptake by the land sink, and
         only a 50% increase in oceanic carbon uptake. Conversely, a 50% decrease in anthropogenic
         emissions generates a 66% decrease in net atmospheric carbon flux and 50 and 35% decreases
         in net land sink and ocean fluxes, respectively.

         <sub>2</sub>), FeliX projects a transient climate sensitivity of 2.4 °C/2 × CO
