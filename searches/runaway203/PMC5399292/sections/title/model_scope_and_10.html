      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">FeliX models the complex interconnections among global human and natural systems to
         identify the probable economic and environmental impacts of trends, policies and technologies
         in the Anthropocene Era
         <a>22</a><a>23</a>. Fundamental linkages and feedbacks among demographic, economic, land, energy, carbon
         and climate systems are drawn from published models, articles and sector reports,
         and codified as differential equations. These equations describe the status and flow
         of resources, subject to geoclimactic and economic parameters to characterize the
         present state and co-dependent development of natural and economic systems.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model is calibrated to available historical data between 1900 and 2015 (refs 
         <a>24</a>, 
         <a>25</a>). All FeliX model historical data, parameters, and results are calculated and reported
         as global averages.
