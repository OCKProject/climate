 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the Paris Agreement encompasses all greenhouse gases, non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions pathways are not modelled endogenously by FeliX. As a result, this analysis is limited to pathways for CO
  <sub>2</sub> mitigation. Emissions pathways and associated radiative forcing for non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> greenhouse gases (that is, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, N
  <sub>2</sub>O, HFC and â€˜others') are assumed to follow RCP 4.5, one of the IPCC's four benchmark pathways for atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, through 2100 (refs
