      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carbon flow from the atmosphere into the land sink begins from preindustrial net primary
         productivity (initial NPP=85.2 PgC per year). This initial carbon flux is coupled
         with atmospheric carbon concentration and global surface temperature via bio-stimulation
         (Λ
         <sub>C</sub>) and climate (Λ
         <sub>T</sub>) coefficients, respectively.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bio-stimulation feedback mechanism introduces logarithmic NPP-carbon coupling
         as described in 
         <a>equation (1)</a> (
         <span>λ</span><sub>C</sub>=0.35). This mechanism increases land sink carbon uptake by 1.25 GtC p.p.m.
         <span>−1</span> (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Table 3</a>) such that a doubling of the carbon content of the atmosphere (

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the land sink, the carbon stocks of the biosphere (plants) and pedosphere (soil)
         are modelled separately to account for distinct characteristic residence times. Gross
         carbon flow out of biomass is equal to biomass carbon stock (
         <span>C</span><sub>B</sub>) divided by a constant residence time (
         <span>τ</span><sub>B</sub>=10.6 years). Treating this parameter as a constant neglects the impact of water and
         other nutrient availability in unmanaged ecosystems, which are not represented in
         the FeliX model
         <a>20</a>. This flow is distributed between the pedosphere and the atmosphere according to
         the constant biomass humification fraction (
         <span>f</span><sub>H</sub>=0.428; 
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 7</a> (2 and 3)). Gross carbon flow out of the pedosphere is equal to the carbon content
         of the reservoir (
         <span>C</span><sub>P</sub>) divided by its residence time (
         <span>τ</span><sub>P</sub>). This residence time is coupled with climate, as discussed below.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carbon flux through the land sink is linked with global temperature change at two
         points in the model, providing feedback to both NPP and pedosphere residence time.
         NPP–climate coupling is included in the nominal land sink carbon flux through the
         climate coefficient (Λ
         <sub>T</sub> in 
         <a>Fig. 7</a> (4) and 
         <a>equation (2)</a> below), where the coefficient (
         <span>λ</span><sub>T</sub>=0.012 K
         <span>−1</span>) is calibrated to match the average value in literature of the land sink-climate
         feedback mechanism

         <div><span></span></div>=27.8 per year for preindustrial climate; 
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 7</a> (1)) is linearly coupled with climate, as shown in 
         <a>equation (3)</a> below, where

         66 PgC K
         <span>−1</span> (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Table 3</a>)
         <a>4</a>. In year 2050 of the BAU scenario, this effect reduces global soil carbon reserves
         by 26 PgC (measured relative to BAU without the coupling. This figure is in line with
         the latest global estimates (30±30 PgC)

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Net land sink carbon flux is plotted for all scenarios in 
         <a>Fig. 5c</a>. The cycling and availability of nutrients including N, P and water represent another
         important feedback to land sink carbon flow in general and NPP in particular
         <a>20</a>. These considerations tend to limit NPP response to atmospheric carbon concentrations
         and should be included in subsequent iterations of this analysis.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In deep decarbonization scenarios, net carbon flux into the ocean and lands reservoirs
         switches directions, turning these sinks into carbon sources. The simplest physical
         explanation for this effect is that rapid decarbonization reverses the sign, or direction,
         of the chemical coupling between the atmosphere, ocean and land sink. This coupling
         is responsible for increasing the net carbon flux into natural sinks as emissions
         rise; thus, it should also be expected to cause a net carbon flow out of these sinks
         if net-negative anthropogenic emissions are achieved and atmospheric carbon concentration
         begins to drop.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From another perspective, we could invoke Le Châtelier's principle to predict that
         the earth system will act to ‘resist' change. In deep decarbonization scenarios, the
         ‘change' is the reduction in atmospheric carbon concentration resulting from net-negative
         anthropogenic emissions and the natural ‘response' is the net flow of carbon out of
         the land and ocean sinks.
