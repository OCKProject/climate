 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-term in situ observations provide the backbone upon which our current understanding of atmospheric methane is founded. Continuation of these observations is paramount to observing and understanding future methane changes. However, it is now abundantly clear that these in situ observations alone are not sufficient for unequivocally partitioning contemporary variations in atmospheric methane (from 1980 to the present) to specific source/sink pathways. This is, in part, because contemporary methane trends are driven by a source–sink imbalance of 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <div id="i62" class="math">
    <span class="mo">∼</span>
   </div>
  </div>20 Tg/y (or 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <div id="i63" class="math">
    <span class="mo">∼</span>
   </div>
  </div>3.5%) yet uncertainties in regional and sectoral components of the methane budget greatly exceed this threshold. In particular, methane emissions from wetlands have an uncertainty of 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <div id="i64" class="math">
    <span class="mo">∼</span>
   </div>
  </div>40 Tg/y [range from Saunois et al. (
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>) is 80 Tg/y] and methane loss due to reaction with OH has an uncertainty of 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <div id="i65" class="math">
    <span class="mo">∼</span>
   </div>
  </div>7% [or 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <div id="i66" class="math">
    <span class="mo">±</span>
   </div>
  </div>38 Tg/y; e.g., Rigby et al. (
  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>)]. These two sectors represent the largest sources of uncertainty in the methane budget and reconciling the contemporary trends will require observations that can (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) provide better constraints on these uncertain sectors and (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) improve our process-level understanding and representation at regional scales. Expansion of the current observational network of methane (and coemitted species) from surface or space will provide valuable information. However, no single program is likely to settle the debate; addressing the major uncertainties in the contemporary methane budget will require a concerted effort in multiple areas. Here we highlight a few potential pathways toward better constraining future methane emissions and their drivers.

   <a rid="r114" ref-type="bibr" href="#r114">114</a>) could provide additional leverage on partitioning the global budget because they would help isolate changes due to the most uncertain sectors (e.g., wetlands and OH). Specifically, radiocarbon measurements would help to separate fossil and nonfossil methane emissions [Petrenko et al. (
   <a rid="r113" ref-type="bibr" href="#r113">113</a>)] while clumped isotopologue measurements can constrain biogenic/thermogenic emissions [Stolper et al. (
   <a rid="r114" ref-type="bibr" href="#r114">114</a>)] or the loss via reaction with OH [Haghnegahdar et al. (
   <a rid="r115" ref-type="bibr" href="#r115">115</a>)]. However, both of these measurements will require advances in the analytical techniques before they could be used in ambient conditions.

    </div>
   </div>D measurements, on the other hand, are less useful than radiocarbon or clumped isotopologues but the measurements are substantially easier to make. All of these isotopic measurements could help to constrain the most uncertain sectors in the methane budget, but there is a trade-off between added value and cost. Expanded studies of source signatures would be required for these isotope-driven approaches to provide maximum value. Radiocarbon shows potential with a less extensive source signature study requirement, as this tracer provides a cleaner delineation between fossil and contemporary methane sources. We encourage more observing-system simulation studies that quantify the added values of different proxies as well as redundancies, at the local to regional and global scales. In the interim, archiving of air samples [such as those at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), ref. 
   <a rid="r116" ref-type="bibr" href="#r116">116</a>] would provide an affordable strategic approach for enabling future measurements of attributive tracers that are infeasible with current technology or have not yet been recognized. As such, expansion of the air archive would enable the community to work backward in future years and address the most uncertain aspects of the methane budget.

   <span class="italic">ii</span>) Targeted Measurement and Modeling Programs Focused on Tropical Wetlands and Global OH.
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These sectors are currently the largest uncertainties in interpreting trends in methane and moving forward will continue to present a challenge unless we can improve the observational constraints and our ability to represent emissions/uptake with process-driven models. Development of high-resolution inventories that resolve, for example, wetland and lake emissions without double counting [e.g., Thornton et al. (
   <a rid="r117" ref-type="bibr" href="#r117">117</a>)] and spatially resolved isotopic source signatures [e.g., Ganesan et al. (
   <a rid="r118" ref-type="bibr" href="#r118">118</a>)] will be crucial to help reduce uncertainties in the use of isotopologue measurements. Dense observations (ground, airborne or space-borne, campaign or sustained) coupled with methane wetland model development for multiple tropical regions could provide a pathway toward more accurate representation and understanding of emissions from this sector. A similar observational approach was applied to the US oil and gas sector [Alvarez et al. (
   <a rid="r119" ref-type="bibr" href="#r119">119</a>)] that led to substantial improvements in the representation of methane sources [Zavala-Araiza et al. (
   <a rid="r120" ref-type="bibr" href="#r120">120</a>)]. Such a campaign could help improve the dynamics of methane emissions in wetland models (including regionally relevant isotopic source signatures) and their sensitivity to changes in temperature and inundation. Global OH presents a different challenge, as point measurements of OH are unlikely to adequately sample the variability in OH to the precision needed for methane trends (better than 3%). Further, the methyl chloroform constraints on OH are degrading with time as the ambient concentrations of methyl chloroform are now

   <a rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" href="#r46">46</a>)]. Recent work from Zhang et al. (
   <a rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" href="#r53">53</a>) suggests that satellite observations of midtropospheric methane could be used for this purpose. Additional work using existing measurements, such as those from AirCore [Karion et al. (
   <a rid="r90" ref-type="bibr" href="#r90">90</a>)] or the Atmospheric Tomography Experiment (ATom) (
