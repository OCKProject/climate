 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is likely that natural sources of methane changed during this period as well; for example, Arora et al. (
  <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>) found an increase in simulated wetland emissions from 1850 to 2000 due to changes in temperature and Dean et al. (
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>) discuss how natural methane emissions may change in response to climatic changes. However, these changes in natural sources are small relative to the more than 300 Tg/y increase in anthropogenic sources from preindustrial times to the present (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methane concentrations stabilized in 2000 (
  <a rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" href="#r8">8</a>) and then growth resumed in 2007 (
  <a rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" href="#r9">9</a>, 
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>) that continues today (
  <a rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" href="#r6">6</a>, 
  <a rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" href="#r7">7</a>). This period from 2000 to 2007 is referred to as the 
  <span class="italic">“</span>stabilization” and the increase from 2007 to present is referred to as the “renewed growth.” Both stabilization and renewed growth have seen conflicting explanations in the literature. Dlugokencky et al. (
  <a rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" href="#r8">8</a>) suggested that this stabilization may be a new steady state for atmospheric methane and, as such, many analyses have viewed the period of renewed growth as anomalous. This view of the renewed growth as a departure from steady state has led to a search for methane sources that increased in 2007. However, if the stabilization period is removed from the contemporary methane record, then the long-term trend becomes a continuous rise (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>, 
  <span class="italic">Inset</span>) with little change in the growth rate. One may wonder which period (if any) is anomalous in the contemporary methane record: If one expects steady state, then the renewed growth appears anomalous; conversely if one expects a long-term rise, then the stabilization appears anomalous. These two views may result in different research foci. For example, the former view may lead one to search for an increasing source while the latter may lead one to look for a decline in sources or increasing sink. The renewed growth has now continued for more than a decade, underlining that the 7-y stabilization period could be considered as anomalous. This perspective does not necessarily require a new, sustained emissions increase in 2007 as many papers have sought. The gaps that need explanation become the anomalous stabilization period and the evolving combination of emissions that contribute to the continued rise.
