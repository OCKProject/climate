 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the uncertainty of the current relative balance of different controls on atmospheric methane, there is no debate that the large increase from preindustrial times is driven by anthropogenic emissions and that reducing anthropogenic emissions can lead to direct, near-term decreases in atmospheric methane. However, changing methane emissions will alter the methane lifetime via chemical feedbacks with OH [Prather (

  <a rid="r109" ref-type="bibr" href="#r109">109</a>)] and, as such, atmospheric abundances can exhibit longer timescales than one may assume. We illustrate this in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a> by using a simple box model [adapted from Turner et al. (
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>)] to evaluate four scenarios to bound the future methane abundances: continued growth in anthropogenic methane emissions (case A), a stabilization of methane emissions in 2012 (case B), and an emission decrease over 10 y (case C) or instantaneously (case D). The emissions decrease in the latter two scenarios is based on a recent report from the International Energy Agency (
  <a rid="r110" ref-type="bibr" href="#r110">110</a>) that estimates current methane emissions from oil and gas could be reduced by 40–50% with zero net cost. For all scenarios, we consider how these changes in methane abundances will impact OH using a simplified

  <span class="italic">Center</span> we see the range of possible methane responses. With increasing emissions, atmospheric levels increase unabated. Important subtleties remain: If OH dynamically responds to methane, atmospheric levels would be 180 ppb higher in the case of continued increasing emissions. Even if emissions stabilized in 2012, atmospheric levels are still increasing in 2050 with interactive OH. This highlights a subtle but important point relevant for understanding recent atmospheric methane behavior: with emissions stabilization atmospheric methane can still increase for more than three decades [see Prather (

  <a rid="r109" ref-type="bibr" href="#r109">109</a>) for a detailed discussion of these feedbacks and their relation to the eigenvalues of the chemical system]. In the scenarios of net-zero cost emission reductions, we do see the atmosphere exhibits decreases in atmospheric concentrations, but depending on the time frame of emission reductions, the atmospheric decrease can take a decade to detect it, and if OH responds dynamically, atmospheric abundances of methane will remain significantly higher (
