  <a rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" href="#r15">15</a>) and that increases in fossil fuel sources contributed to the growth since 2007 (e.g., refs.

  <a href="#r19">*</a>–
  <a rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" href="#r20">20</a>). Studies using isotope measurements tend to find that decreases in microbial sources led to the stabilization (e.g., ref. 
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>) and increases in microbial sources are responsible for the renewed growth (e.g., refs.

  <a rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" href="#r48">48</a>), thus making the problem well posed, leading to stronger conclusions regarding the processes driving the stabilization and renewed growth. However, changes of a few percent in OH are sufficient to perturb the global budget (

  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>), with a 4% decrease in global mean OH being roughly equivalent to a 22 Tg/y increase in methane emissions.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>, 
  <span class="italic">Right</span> shows our current inventory- and process-based understanding of global methane sources. Based on this, the only sources that show a multidecadal trend are anthropogenic (waste, agriculture, and fugitives from fossil fuels). Natural sources and sinks (e.g., wetlands, fires, and OH) exhibit substantial variability on subdecadal scales but we do not have a process/inventory-based explanation for a long-term trend. For example, Poulter et al. (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>) were unable to explain the renewed growth with changes in wetland emissions. Some individual wetland models do find increases in emissions [e.g., McNorton et al. (
  <a rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" href="#r49">49</a>)], but the increases are small (2 Tg/y) relative to the source–sink imbalance (20 Tg/y). Variations in many of these natural sources and sinks have been found to be driven in part by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (e.g., refs. 
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a> and 
  <a rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" href="#r50">50</a>
  <a href="#r51">*</a>
  <a href="#r52">*</a>–
  <a rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" href="#r53">53</a>). The long-term growth trend in atmospheric methane is best explained by the continued rise in anthropogenic emissions—even though the most uncertain sectors are predominantly natural (wetlands and OH)—and as long as anthropogenic emissions continue to rise we expect a concurrent rise in atmospheric methane with variability superimposed due to fluctuations in natural sources and sinks. There is significant uncertainty in anthropogenic emissions, as evidenced when two different versions of the same inventory produce different expected emissions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>, 
  <span class="italic">Top Right</span>), but anthropogenic sources remain alone as able to explain the long-term rise in methane emissions over the past 40 y.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned above, there are large uncertainties in many aspects of the methane budget relative to the changes needed to reconcile the contemporary trends. Specifically, a 20 Tg/y imbalance (or

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Can all of the various lines of evidence be consistently explained? If we focus on the perspective that the stabilization period is anomalous, it can be identified as a time of elevated OH relative to preceding and succeeding years. This shift alone could explain the stabilization period as well as the renewed increase. It is likely a decrease in anthropogenic emissions in the late 1990s (masked at first by the large fire emissions from El Niño) also contributed. There has been a long-term decline in atmospheric ethane [Simpson et al. (
  <a rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" href="#r15">15</a>)] that can be seen in the Southern Hemispheric ethane record in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>; however, the Northern Hemispheric measurements have been more variable and Hausmann et al. (
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>) suggest an increase since 2007 due to an increase in fossil fuel emissions. Inventories also predict increased fossil fuel emissions, but estimated resumption starting a few years earlier, in the middle of the stabilization period. While there may be a timing offset in the inventory, the more recent increase in atmospheric ethane could also be largely driven by expanded production of gas in wet oil fields where

At the same time, we need to consider that mechanistic global atmospheric chemistry transport models fail to even simulate the partitioning of OH between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (e.g., refs. 
  <a rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" href="#r44">44</a> and 
  <a rid="r61" ref-type="bibr" href="#r61">61</a>), which alone warrants further OH studies. It should also be stressed that a similar discrepancy between what mechanistic models predict and what is inferred from observations holds for wetlands, where an ensemble of wetland models is inconsistent with the hypothesis of a large shift in tropical emissions [Poulter et al. (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>) and wetland emissions in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Isotopic and ethane observations provide valuable clues to the relative balance of sources and sinks of methane. One of the most critical gaps in isotopic- and/or ethane-based global observations is the underlying assumption that source/sink signatures and their variation in time are well known. That is, we a priori know the isotopic (ethane) characteristic of every source (sink) and how it varies in time. However, this assumption generally does not hold. For example, a recent update to our understanding of isotopic characteristics of sources from Sherwood et al. (
  <a rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" href="#r54">54</a>) shifted the expected recent historical balance of biotic/abiotic emissions (
  <a rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" href="#r25">25</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial gradients in observed methane concentration have also been used to infer emissions at a variety of scales. This is typically done via “atmospheric inversions,” using models to account for atmospheric transport. Houweling et al. (

  <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>)] that was recently updated by Saunois et al. (
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>) based on an ensemble of inversions. The GCP highlighted the importance of reducing the uncertainty on wetland emissions and reducing “double counting” of sources. It did not address changes in the methane sink but reported a climatological range for the sink based primarily on the work of Naik et al. (
  <a rid="r61" ref-type="bibr" href="#r61">61</a>). Atmospheric inversions are limited by the spatiotemporal coverage of the observations and our ability to accurately simulate atmospheric transport. As such, increases in the spatiotemporal coverage of traceable, calibrated, and validated observations (from surface, aircraft, or satellite) and improvements in atmospheric transport models would help this approach in constraining the methane budget.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Space-borne observations of methane and proxies related to specific sectors represent an attractive constraint on the methane budget [e.g., Sellers et al. (
  <a rid="r80" ref-type="bibr" href="#r80">80</a>)], as they provide a unique spatial coverage. Jacob et al. (
  <a rid="r81" ref-type="bibr" href="#r81">81</a>) provide a detailed review of the role of satellite observations. Briefly, satellite observations have proved to be be useful in constraining methane sources at local-to-regional scales (e.g., refs.

  <a rid="r84" ref-type="bibr" href="#r84">84</a>) but have thus far played a relatively limited role in the discussion of global methane trends because the record is short compared with in situ measurements. For example, the first total column measurements of methane were made by Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) in 2003 (
  <a rid="r73" ref-type="bibr" href="#r73">73</a>, 
  <a rid="r85" ref-type="bibr" href="#r85">85</a>) and Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) (
  <a rid="r86" ref-type="bibr" href="#r86">86</a>) is the longest-running satellite that measures total column methane with 9 y of data (measurements started in April 2009) (
  <a rid="r87" ref-type="bibr" href="#r87">87</a>, 
  <a rid="r88" ref-type="bibr" href="#r88">88</a>). Networks like the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) (
  <a rid="r89" ref-type="bibr" href="#r89">89</a>) and AirCore [Karion et al. (
  <a rid="r90" ref-type="bibr" href="#r90">90</a>)] are crucial to identify biases in satellite measurements, evaluate their uncertainties, and facilitate intercomparisons between different satellite instruments. Satellite observations will likely play a growing role in the discussion of future methane trends as the record length increases and new missions like the recently launched Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) (
  <a rid="r91" ref-type="bibr" href="#r91">91</a>) and recently funded Geostationary Carbon Cycle Observatory (GeoCARB) instrument (geostationary orbit) (

  <a rid="r93" ref-type="bibr" href="#r93">93</a>) and methane (
  <a rid="r94" ref-type="bibr" href="#r94">94</a>). For satellites to provide their full potential value added, rigorous validation and traceability are necessary. Atmospheric inversions should also attempt to cope with potential biases in satellite data by jointly inferring bias terms.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of specific regions such as the United States and the Arctic in recent methane trends is also debated. For example, Turner et al. (
  <a rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" href="#r16">16</a>) inferred an increase in US emissions but Bruhwiler et al. (
  <a rid="r95" ref-type="bibr" href="#r95">95</a>) find that this increase is inconsistent with a model ensemble from the GCP. This topic (US methane emissions) was the focus of a review paper by Miller and Michalak (
  <a rid="r96" ref-type="bibr" href="#r96">96</a>) and a recent National Academy of Sciences Report (
  <a rid="r97" ref-type="bibr" href="#r97">97</a>); however, the role of US methane emissions is still under debate [Sheng et al. (
  <a rid="r98" ref-type="bibr" href="#r98">98</a>)]. It underlines the sobering fact that even for the data-rich United States, we still cannot conclusively determine whether there has been a long-term trend in methane emissions. The role of methane emissions from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) is another topic that has been heavily debated in the recent literature. Work from Shakhova et al. (
  <a rid="r99" ref-type="bibr" href="#r99">99</a>) extrapolated ship-based measurements to estimate ESAS methane emissions; however, more recent work from Berchet et al. (
  <a rid="r100" ref-type="bibr" href="#r100">100</a>), Thornton et al. (
  <a rid="r101" ref-type="bibr" href="#r101">101</a>), and Warwick et al. (
  <a rid="r102" ref-type="bibr" href="#r102">102</a>) found emissions that were a factor of 4–30 lower. Widespread emissions of methane hydrates are unlikely [Ruppel et al. (
  <a rid="r103" ref-type="bibr" href="#r103">103</a>)] as methane sources in waters deeper than 100 m have negligible contributions to the atmosphere (
  <a rid="r104" ref-type="bibr" href="#r104">104</a>, 
  <a rid="r105" ref-type="bibr" href="#r105">105</a>) and recent work from Sparrow et al. (
  <a rid="r106" ref-type="bibr" href="#r106">106</a>) uses radiocarbon measurements from the Beaufort Shelf in the Arctic Ocean to infer that less than 10% of methane in surface water is from sources deeper than 30 m. More broadly, there has been a lot of interest in understanding how methane emissions from the Arctic may change in the future because of the temperature dependence of microbial methane sources and enhanced warming due to Arctic amplification (
  <a rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" href="#r1">1</a>). While it is important to understand these regional emissions, current uncertainties in the tropics greatly exceed the absolute magnitude of Arctic sources. Further, Sweeney et al. (
  <a rid="r107" ref-type="bibr" href="#r107">107</a>) suggest Arctic emission changes would have little impact on global budgets if the temperature sensitivity is similar to what has been observed in the present. This is not to discount the potential importance of future Arctic methane emissions, but the prime uncertainties in the current global methane budget lie in the tropics for a number of reasons: (
