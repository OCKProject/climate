 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While a plethora of observation-based evidence points toward the existence of rapid climate transitions in Earth’s past, and it is generally accepted that these are closely linked to Southern Ocean dynamics, the processes relevant to contributing to, or triggering, these rapid climate transitions have remained elusive. Here, I show, using the jet north of the KP as an example, how the dynamics of Southern Ocean jets and their interaction with topographic features and ocean stratification can lead to rapid changes in Southern Ocean ventilation. For a small increase in wind stress, these jet dynamics lead from a state where the tracer is confined to the SML to a state where the tracer is ventilated into the ocean interior. Once a certain threshold in wind stress is passed, jet dynamics abruptly change, allowing for the ventilation of fresh AASW into AAIW. These dynamics could lead to a rapid change in Southern Ocean surface stratification, the transport of heat, freshwater, and nutrients at intermediate depths into the global ocean, and could potentially have crucial impacts for the Atlantic MOC. On the basis of observation-based evidence of past ocean circulation, all of these changes are thought to have played a crucial role in rapid climate transitions in Earth’s past (

  </a>). In addition to consequences on the surface and mid-depth ocean, changes in freshwater forcing in the shallow Southern Ocean can lead to changes in the global deep ocean stratification (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two main reasons why it is only now that the important role of jets in Southern Ocean ventilation has emerged. First, it is only over the past few years that it has become evident that nonzonal dynamics are essential to understand the Southern Ocean’s Antarctic Circumpolar Current, such as, for example, its equilibration (
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
   <span class="italic">42</span>
  </a>) and the localized nature of observed CO
  <sub>2</sub> ventilation (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>). Much of the previous literature on ocean ventilation has focused on the role of the Southern Ocean MOC, which is generally assumed to be a residual between the wind-driven Ekman overturning circulation and an eddy overturning circulation driven by eddy buoyancy fluxes, with eddy momentum fluxes (also known as Reynolds stresses) assumed negligible. Nevertheless, to understand the localized jet dynamics presented here, it is necessary to take into account eddy momentum fluxes, which are closely associated with the strong lateral shear in the barotropic jet. Second, it is only over the last few years that computational resources reached a point where numerical models of the Southern Ocean can be run at sufficiently high horizontal resolution, such as the 1/20° horizontal grid spacing used here, to resolve jet dynamics in the Southern Ocean. Nevertheless, for the complete picture of Southern Ocean ventilation, one has to take into account both dynamics of the Southern Ocean MOC and jet dynamics; it is the delicate balance between these two processes that is relevant to understanding carbon and nutrient budgets in the past, current, and future Southern Ocean.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model grid spacing used in this work is 1/20° in the horizontal, which resolves the jet dynamics presented here. This horizontal grid spacing needs to be compared to the 1° grid spacing (or coarser) used in studies that model past ocean circulation (due to their need to run over long time periods) and the 1/4° grid spacing of most climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to predict climate for the next centuries. A doubling of horizontal grid spacing, taking into account the necessary adjustments of the model time step, results in approximately an order of magnitude increase in computational resources. Extending this work to the global ocean to understand the impact of rapid changes in Southern Ocean ventilation on global climate would therefore push the current generation of supercomputers to their limits. Nevertheless, with a steady increase in computational resources, it would be of great benefit to extend this work from being restricted to the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean to simulate the circumpolar Southern Ocean. In particular, Drake Passage is of great interest because of its central role in AAIW ventilation in our current climate. It is possible that a change in wind forcing in glacial climates could have resulted in a shutdown of Southern Ocean ventilation in this region, leading to the highly stratified Southern Ocean observed in glacial climates (

   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reynolds stresses (convergence of eddy momentum fluxes) are crucial for maintaining Southern Ocean jets. Thus, to represent jet dynamics in simulations of past and future climates, it is necessary to either resolve or parameterize these Reynolds stresses. Both conceptual models used to study the role of the global MOC and eddy parameterizations in more realistic models such as those used by the IPCC currently assume Reynolds stresses to be negligible. While regional models, such as the model used in this study, are capable of resolving Reynolds stresses using computational resources available today, it needs to be shown whether global climate simulations, run at lower grid spacing, are able to adequately represent these jet dynamics and associated changes in Southern Ocean ventilation. Until computational resources allow for global ocean models to fully resolve Reynolds stresses, these models rely on parameterizations of these unresolved processes. One approach to achieve this is to build on existing eddy parameterizations, which are limited to eddy buoyancy fluxes and include Reynolds stresses (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>). Another promising approach is to parameterize Reynolds stresses using stochastic eddy parameterizations that improve jet dynamics in eddy-permitting ocean models, that is, models that partially resolve the relevant dynamics (

   <span class="italic">44</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">
   <span class="italic">45</span>
  </a>). Nevertheless, much work remains until these approaches can be applied in realistic simulations of global climate, with the abrupt change described in this study, at wind stresses predicted for the very near future, pointing toward the urgency to make progress in this field.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To develop adequate eddy parameterizations, it is first necessary to understand the underlying dynamics of the processes presented here. This study provides a very descriptive approach to show how jet dynamics can abruptly change, with important consequences for Southern Ocean ventilation, but many challenging questions about the detailed dynamics remain. While it has previously been demonstrated that jets can abruptly reorganize their structure as a consequence of small changes in their forcing (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>), these efforts have been limited to highly idealized model configurations aimed at representing the atmospheres of Earth and giant gas planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn. Nevertheless, the abrupt change in jet dynamics presented here is closely related to the interaction of jets with topography and ocean stratification, both of which are absent in these previous studies. To explore the dynamics behind this abrupt jet reorganization, it is therefore necessary to work from the knowledge gained from these highly idealized model configurations toward the more complex dynamics described in this study.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main caveats of this study are the very idealized surface forcing used and the regional, re-entrant domain of this model configuration. Here, the wind forcing is a zonal and annual mean, and it will have to be shown in future work how these results would change under a seasonal cycle or a large amount of stochastic variability on both seasonal and interannual time scales. Seasonal cycles and stochastic variability might also make it harder to detect the processes shown here. The passive tracer is also introduced at the ocean surface with a short time scale, which is equivalent to an infinite tracer reservoir in the SML, and it will have to be shown in future work how this choice affects the percentage change in ventilation presented here. While the processes described here could, to some extent, change in a more realistic model configuration with, for example, a global model domain and an interactive atmosphere, these caveats are also the strength of this particular model configuration. It is only in such an idealized model configuration that it is possible to separate the physical process of interest from many other processes occurring in a more complex model. Taking into account current limitations of supercomputing resources, it is also only possible to run multiple perturbation experiments with sufficient model grid spacing if the model domain is limited in its spatial extent. Several future directions to extend this work become apparent. The abrupt change in jet dynamics presented here leads to an abrupt increase in Rossby number, with consequences for submesoscale processes and hence the ventilation process. Submesoscale processes are barely resolved in this model configuration, and further work is necessary to understand changes in ventilation if these processes were resolved, including the interaction of submesoscale processes with the jet dynamics presented here. It also remains an open question why ventilation does not occur at the SEIR where a similar strong jet is observed. One difference in this region is that topography does not reach close to the surface, and the jet north of the SEIR is close to the boundary of the model domain, which could have effects on ventilation in this region. Another difference is that the jet in the SEIR moves in latitude with changes in wind stress, while the KP jet is pinned to its position by the KP. More idealized experiments would be necessary to understand this discrepancy. More work is also necessary to further understand the adjustment time scales of this abrupt change in jet dynamics and its role in Southern Ocean ventilation. The model results discussed here are based on equilibrated experiments, and hence, it is not known how long the wind has to increase for it to change Southern Ocean ventilation—is a storm enough, or an increase of winds during winter, or a long-term increase of winds as predicted by climate models for the coming decades? With more supercomputing resources becoming available in the future, much can be learned from using the idealized experiments used here in conjunction with more complex climate models to understand the consequences of jet dynamics on the global climate system.</p>
