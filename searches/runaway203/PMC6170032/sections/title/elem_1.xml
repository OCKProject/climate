  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time- and depth-mean circulation in an eddy-resolving ocean model (Materials and Methods) of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean is shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>. The prominent topographic features in this region are the KP and the SEIR, both of which develop strong jets along their northern boundaries due to the interaction of the Southern Ocean’s background mean flow with topography. The model experiment shown represents “modern” conditions, with the wind and buoyancy forcing being annually and zonally averaged values from the year 2005. Six perturbation experiments were run in which the zonal component of the wind stress was varied, while all other forcing was kept constant (in the following, modern wind stress is denoted by τ, and perturbation experiments range from 0.5*τ to 2*τ; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>). In each experiment, a passive tracer, intended to represent a chemical species, such as CO
   <sub>2</sub>, undergoing atmosphere-ocean exchange processes but ignoring biological and chemical interaction, is introduced homogeneously at the ocean surface for 10 years after model equilibration. This passive tracer is restored with a 2-hour time scale, approximating an infinite tracer reservoir in the surface mixed layer (SML). Results below are shown after 5 years of tracer ventilation since, after this time, the limited domain of this model configuration affects results (Materials and Methods).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first striking result of these model experiments is evident from 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>, which shows changes of the maximum of the Southern Ocean MOC (blue line; Materials and Methods), and tracer concentrations in the ocean interior (integrated between depths of 500 and 1500 m) after 5 years (red line; Materials and Methods), as a function of changes in wind stress. The black line represents a 1:1 relationship between wind stress and ventilation changes. This figure shows that Southern Ocean ventilation, assuming an infinite tracer reservoir in the SML, is much more sensitive to changes in wind stress than the maximum in Southern Ocean MOC, which is the metric currently used to understand the role of Southern Ocean ventilation in past and future climates. For the perturbation experiments with a wind stress below modern values, changes in tracer ventilation are about twice as large as changes in the maximum of the Southern Ocean MOC, whereas for the perturbation experiments with a wind stress above modern values, changes in tracer ventilation are about one order of magnitude larger than changes in the maximum of the Southern Ocean MOC. As will be shown below, both the high sensitivity of Southern Ocean ventilation to wind stress and the change of behavior at modern wind stress values are closely related to changes in jet dynamics and their interaction with topography and stratification.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second striking result is evident from 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, which shows the geographic location at which the tracer ventilates the ocean interior. Snapshots of tracer concentrations at a depth of 200 m are shown for two perturbation experiments—for a wind stress of τ, 8 months after the tracer is introduced (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>), and for a wind stress of 2*τ, 4 months after the tracer is first introduced (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>). These snapshots focus on the time when the tracer first ventilates the ocean interior and before the tracer is advected beyond the ventilation region. Note that because of the differences in ventilation mechanism, both times of snapshots and color scales in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> (A and B) are different. These examples highlight the two different states of tracer ventilation, closely linked to two different dynamical states of the jet north of the KP (referred to as the Kerguelen jet in the following). For the perturbation experiment with a wind stress of τ (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>), tracer ventilation predominantly occurs in filaments downstream of the Kerguelen jet in a region commonly referred to as oceanic storm track, with storm tracks being regions of anomalously high eddy kinetic energy (EKE) downstream of topographic features caused by the instability of jets (
   <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
    <span class="italic">27</span>
   </a>). On the other hand, for the perturbation experiment with a wind stress of 2*τ (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>), tracer ventilation occurs along the Kerguelen jet. Both states of tracer ventilation have very different consequences for Southern Ocean ventilation.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of the Kerguelen jet in these two states of tracer ventilation becomes even more evident by examining the time-mean tracer forcing at the ocean surface for the perturbation experiments with a wind stress of τ (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>) and 2*τ (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>) and the time-mean vertical tracer advection at a depth of 200 m, where the depth is chosen to visualize the tracer being advected across the base of the SML, for the same perturbation experiments (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>, C and D, respectively). The perturbation experiment with a wind stress of 2*τ shows enhanced values for the tracer forcing at the ocean surface, which is consistent with an increased tracer ventilation by the Kerguelen jet, reducing the tracer concentration at the ocean surface and subsequently increasing the tracer forcing that restores the tracer concentration at the ocean surface (Materials and Methods). The enhanced values of tracer forcing at the northern boundary are due to currents coming out of the northern sponge layer where the tracer concentration is restored to zero and hence are a numerical artifact. The time-mean vertical tracer advection in the perturbation experiment for a wind stress of 2*τ also shows much larger values than the perturbation experiment for a wind stress of τ, with changes again occurring along the core of the Kerguelen jet. From this figure, it is also evident that the dominant length scales of upward and downward advection, of the order of 100 km, point toward tracer ventilation being a consequence of the Kerguelen jet interacting with standing mesoscale features. Note though that this long-term mean will remove the footprint of small-scale eddies simply due to the chaotic and short-lived nature of these eddies. These small-scale eddies are crucial for the upper ocean vertical transport and are mostly due to mixed layer instabilities and frontogenesis that can be enhanced in an energetic mesoscale eddy strain field relevant to jets. In the following, the perturbation experiments with wind stresses of 0.5*τ, τ, and 2*τ will be used to further highlight the differences in tracer ventilation and jet dynamics, with the focus being on the Kerguelen jet.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a> shows the extent to which the passive tracer has ventilated the ocean interior after 5 years. Vertical sections of tracer concentrations are shown in

The cyan transect is chosen to be north of the ventilation region, and the purple transect is chosen to be downstream of the ventilation region, both to highlight tracer concentrations in the ocean interior rather than the ventilation region. Black contours in

For a wind stress of 0.5*τ, the tracer is confined to the SML and hence there is no ventilation of the ocean interior (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, A and D). For a wind stress of τ, the tracer is ventilated into the top ~500 m of the water column, with tracer concentrations decreasing monotonically with depth (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, B and E). For a wind stress of 2*τ, the tracer is ventilated across the base of the SML into AAIW, with a vertical separation between elevated tracer concentrations in the SML and AAIW (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, C and F). These results would suggest that tracer ventilation in storm track leads to deep SMLs, while tracer ventilation along the jet leads to tracer ventilation across the base of the SML into AAIW.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different states of tracer ventilation are intimately linked to changes in jet dynamics, best explained using time-mean hydrographic sections across the Kerguelen jet, as shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a> for the green transect in

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Figure 5</a> (J to L) shows a horizontal section of stratification at a depth of 120 m (which is approximately the depth of the SML) for the same perturbation experiments. The red patch in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5H</a> highlights a region of convection. Additional insight is gained from the transient behavior of the jet, shown on a Hovmöller diagram of zonal velocities at the ocean surface for wind stresses of 0.5*τ (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5M</a>), τ (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5O</a>). The abrupt change in jet dynamics occurs at a critical point between wind stresses of τ and 2*τ (at approximately a wind stress of 1.25*τ, which will become evident below). Beyond the critical point, the Kerguelen jet suddenly accelerates, westward jets appear at its flanks (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, A, D, and G), and, as seen in the Hovmöller diagram, the Kerguelen jet becomes more steady, locked in latitude, and smaller length scales appear (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, M to O). While an increase in wind stress from 0.5*τ to τ leads to a decrease in stratification across the base of the SML across the Kerguelen jet (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, B and E), it is only when the wind stress increases to 2*τ that convection across the base of the SML occurs, resulting in the ventilation of fresh (that is, low salinity) surface waters, known as AASW, into AAIW (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, C, F, and I), consistent with the ventilation of the passive tracer shown in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change in jet dynamics shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Figs. 5</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6</a> can be interpreted as follows. For a wind stress of 0.5*τ, the jet core has near-zero bottom velocities (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6A</a>, blue line) and its potential vorticity gradient is positive everywhere across the jet (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6C</a>, blue line). For this state, an increase in wind stress to τ leads to an increase in the jet’s vertical shear (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6A</a>) and, consequently, an increase in its baroclinic instability with an associated increase in EKE (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6C</a>). At the critical point, the potential vorticity gradient approaches zero at its southern flank (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6D</a>), with a zero crossing of the potential vorticity gradient being the necessary condition for the barotropic instability of the jet (
   <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
    <span class="italic">29</span>
   </a>). Once the wind stress further increases, the jet abruptly reorganizes its structure to equilibrate its eddy instabilities through modification of its mean structure by eddy fluxes (
   <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
    <span class="italic">30</span>
   </a>). As a consequence, the eastward jet core significantly accelerates while its flanks develop two westward jets, leading to a large increase in the jet’s lateral shear (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Figs. 5</a>, G and L, and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">6</a>, A and B). This jet structure is now associated with a large positive potential vorticity gradient across the jet’s core and negative potential vorticity gradients across both of its flanks (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6D</a>). Beyond the critical point, a further increase in wind stress results in the acceleration of the jet core’s depth-mean velocities and, subsequently, a further increase in the jet’s lateral shear while keeping its vertical shear near constant (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F6" href="#F6">Fig. 6</a>, A and B). At the critical point, the jet dynamics therefore abruptly change from that of a baroclinic jet, in which the jet’s vertical shear increases as the jet is accelerated, to that of a barotropic jet, in which the jet’s lateral shear increases as the jet is accelerated. This strong lateral shear is known to be able to suppress baroclinic instability, a process known as the barotropic governor (
   <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
    <span class="italic">31</span>
   </a>), which explains why this jet can sustain such steep isopycnals without becoming unstable. The effects of jet dynamics on baroclinic instability and, hence, EKE can be used to find the critical point at which jet dynamics abruptly change. From 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5C</a>, it is apparent that EKE adjacent to the jet increases from a wind stress of 0.5*τ to 1.25*τ, reaches a maximum of 1.25*τ, and then decreases with further increases in wind stress. This is particularly evident in the region where the shear between the eastward jet core and its westward jets at its flanks becomes largest due to the barotropic governor increasingly suppressing baroclinic instability. For the Kerguelen jet, the critical point occurs for a wind stress increase of 25%.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Southern Ocean, strong westerly winds prevail and hence blow into the direction of the jets, a scenario usually referred to as “down-front winds” (
   <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
    <span class="italic">32</span>
   </a>). These down-front winds lead to Ekman advection of buoyancy across the jet. Depending on the lateral gradients of buoyancy and momentum across the jet, the Ekman advection of buoyancy can lead to convection across the base of the SML (
   <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
    <span class="italic">32</span>
   </a>). As evident from vertical sections of stratification across the Kerguelen jet (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, B, E, and H), increasing winds erode the stratification across the base of the SML across all perturbation experiments, but it is only beyond the critical point, where the jet changes from baroclinic to barotropic, that this reduction in stratification is sufficient to lead to convection across the base of the SML [
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, B, E, and H; note that the mixed layer depth in the jet (~400 m in the case of 2*τ) is much deeper than the boundary layer parameterized by KPP (K-profile parameterization) for the same region (~100 m in the case of 2*τ) and hence is not a numerical artifact due to the choice of this parameterization scheme (Materials and Methods)]. This convection allows the passive tracer (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, C and F) and AASW (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5I</a>) to ventilate AAIW along the jet. As evident from 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a> (J to L), which shows a horizontal section of stratification at the base of the mixed layer at a depth of 120 m, convection across the base of the SML is confined to the core of the jet, that is, regions where lateral gradients of buoyancy and momentum are largest. These results therefore point toward the possibility of the abrupt reorganization from a baroclinic to a barotropic jet and the associated increase in the lateral gradients of buoyancy and momentum, which is a prerequisite for the ventilation of AAIW along the jet.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of jet dynamics in Southern Ocean ventilation can be summarized as follows. Because of the interaction of the Southern Ocean’s background mean flow with topography, strong jets appear adjacent to this topography, such as the Kerguelen jet discussed here. For the example of the Kerguelen jet, an increase in winds of up to 1.25*τ leads to an increase in the jet’s vertical shear, which is associated with an increase in EKE due to baroclinic instability in both the jet and the associated storm track. The consequence of this increase in storm track intensity is a change from no tracer ventilation (0.5*τ) to the tracer being ventilated into a deep SML (0.75*τ to 1.25*τ). Once the wind stress increases beyond the critical point at 1.25*τ, the jet abruptly changes its structure to a barotropic jet with westward jets at its flanks, increasing its lateral shear and hence suppressing baroclinic instability due to an effect known as the barotropic governor. Because of the emerging barotropic governor, a further increase in winds leads to a decrease in EKE and increasingly steep isopycnal surfaces. This abrupt increase in cross-jet gradients of buoyancy and momentum, combined with down-front winds, leads to convection across the base of the SML. This convection across the base of the mixed layer, combined with the steep isopycnal surfaces across the jet, leads to the ventilation of AAIW along the jet.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While observations related to the dynamics of Southern Ocean jets and their effect on tracer ventilation are sparse, the few observations that exist are consistent with the dynamics proposed here. Using observational data sets, it has been shown that Southern Ocean ventilation is a very localized process, associated with topographic features (
   <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
    <span class="italic">34</span>
   </a>). This has also been confirmed using observationally based estimates of anthropogenic carbon concentrations to show the localized nature of anthropogenic CO
   <sub>2</sub> ventilation (
   <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
    <span class="italic">35</span>
   </a>). More recent work has used biogeochemical autonomous floats (BGCArgo) to detect intermittent ventilation events in oceanic storm tracks (
   <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
    <span class="italic">36</span>
   </a>). All these observational studies agree with the jet dynamics in the case of a baroclinic jet, with ventilation occurring in storm tracks. For the ventilation of AAIW, in the case of a barotropic jet, observations become even more sparse. Most of the AAIW ventilation under current climate forcing occurs in Drake Passage, where the Southern Ocean jet known as the polar front (PF) is pushed through the narrow gap between South America and Antarctica. Observations of the PF in this region show both zero crossings of the cross-jet potential vorticity gradient and bottom velocities of the order of 0.04 to 0.05 m s
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (
   <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
    <span class="italic">37</span>
   </a>), similar to the barotropic state of the jet discussed here, that is, the state for which AAIW ventilation occurs. In 1998, an interference between El Nino–Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode led to an anomalous wind forcing with winds in the region of AAIW ventilation being directed in an up-front direction rather than the usual down-front direction. A time series of physical and biogeochemical properties between 1969 and 2005, produced from transects across Drake Passage, shows that in 1998/1999, AAIW suddenly warmed, salinified, and de-oxygenated (
   <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
    <span class="italic">5</span>
   </a>). These observations suggest an interruption of AAIW ventilation for 1 to 2 years following this anomalous wind forcing, pointing toward the crucial role of down-front winds in ventilating the ocean interior. Nevertheless, to test whether this anomaly in AAIW ventilation can be explained by the jet dynamics introduced here, it would be necessary to run multiple perturbation experiments of the circulation in Drake Passage. These experiments would be technically very challenging and computationally expensive since the topography of Drake Passage prevents the use of a simple re-entrant model configuration, as done in this study, and hence it would be necessary to simulate the full Southern Ocean.
