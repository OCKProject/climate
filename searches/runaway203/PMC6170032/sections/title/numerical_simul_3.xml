 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) Time- and depth-mean zonal velocities for the modern wind stress (color) and ocean depth (contours). Both the KP and the South East Indian Ridge (SEIR) are marked. Colored lines show locations of vertical transects shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figs. 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">4</a>. (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Wind stress (N m
  <span class="sup">âˆ’2</span>) of the six perturbation experiments (the red line represents modern conditions). Only the westerly components of the wind stress are changed. (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) Changes in Southern Ocean ventilation as a function of changes in wind stress, where zero marks the annual and zonal average winds of 2005. The blue line shows changes in Southern Ocean overturning, the red line shows changes in tracer uptake integrated between water depths of 500 and 1500 m, and the black line shows the 1:1 line, that is, where wind changes equal ventilation changes. Circular markers show the different perturbation experiments.
