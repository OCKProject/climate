 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time- and depth-mean circulation in an eddy-resolving ocean model (Materials and Methods) of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>. The prominent topographic features in this region are the KP and the SEIR, both of which develop strong jets along their northern boundaries due to the interaction of the Southern Ocean’s background mean flow with topography. The model experiment shown represents “modern” conditions, with the wind and buoyancy forcing being annually and zonally averaged values from the year 2005. Six perturbation experiments were run in which the zonal component of the wind stress was varied, while all other forcing was kept constant (in the following, modern wind stress is denoted by τ, and perturbation experiments range from 0.5*τ to 2*τ; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>). In each experiment, a passive tracer, intended to represent a chemical species, such as CO
  <sub>2</sub>, undergoing atmosphere-ocean exchange processes but ignoring biological and chemical interaction, is introduced homogeneously at the ocean surface for 10 years after model equilibration. This passive tracer is restored with a 2-hour time scale, approximating an infinite tracer reservoir in the surface mixed layer (SML). Results below are shown after 5 years of tracer ventilation since, after this time, the limited domain of this model configuration affects results (Materials and Methods).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first striking result of these model experiments is evident from 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>, which shows changes of the maximum of the Southern Ocean MOC (blue line; Materials and Methods), and tracer concentrations in the ocean interior (integrated between depths of 500 and 1500 m) after 5 years (red line; Materials and Methods), as a function of changes in wind stress. The black line represents a 1:1 relationship between wind stress and ventilation changes. This figure shows that Southern Ocean ventilation, assuming an infinite tracer reservoir in the SML, is much more sensitive to changes in wind stress than the maximum in Southern Ocean MOC, which is the metric currently used to understand the role of Southern Ocean ventilation in past and future climates. For the perturbation experiments with a wind stress below modern values, changes in tracer ventilation are about twice as large as changes in the maximum of the Southern Ocean MOC, whereas for the perturbation experiments with a wind stress above modern values, changes in tracer ventilation are about one order of magnitude larger than changes in the maximum of the Southern Ocean MOC. As will be shown below, both the high sensitivity of Southern Ocean ventilation to wind stress and the change of behavior at modern wind stress values are closely related to changes in jet dynamics and their interaction with topography and stratification.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second striking result is evident from 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, which shows the geographic location at which the tracer ventilates the ocean interior. Snapshots of tracer concentrations at a depth of 200 m are shown for two perturbation experiments—for a wind stress of τ, 8 months after the tracer is introduced (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>), and for a wind stress of 2*τ, 4 months after the tracer is first introduced (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>). These snapshots focus on the time when the tracer first ventilates the ocean interior and before the tracer is advected beyond the ventilation region. Note that because of the differences in ventilation mechanism, both times of snapshots and color scales in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> (A and B) are different. These examples highlight the two different states of tracer ventilation, closely linked to two different dynamical states of the jet north of the KP (referred to as the Kerguelen jet in the following). For the perturbation experiment with a wind stress of τ (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>), tracer ventilation predominantly occurs in filaments downstream of the Kerguelen jet in a region commonly referred to as oceanic storm track, with storm tracks being regions of anomalously high eddy kinetic energy (EKE) downstream of topographic features caused by the instability of jets (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). On the other hand, for the perturbation experiment with a wind stress of 2*τ (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>), tracer ventilation occurs along the Kerguelen jet. Both states of tracer ventilation have very different consequences for Southern Ocean ventilation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of the Kerguelen jet in these two states of tracer ventilation becomes even more evident by examining the time-mean tracer forcing at the ocean surface for the perturbation experiments with a wind stress of τ (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>) and 2*τ (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>) and the time-mean vertical tracer advection at a depth of 200 m, where the depth is chosen to visualize the tracer being advected across the base of the SML, for the same perturbation experiments (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>, C and D, respectively). The perturbation experiment with a wind stress of 2*τ shows enhanced values for the tracer forcing at the ocean surface, which is consistent with an increased tracer ventilation by the Kerguelen jet, reducing the tracer concentration at the ocean surface and subsequently increasing the tracer forcing that restores the tracer concentration at the ocean surface (Materials and Methods). The enhanced values of tracer forcing at the northern boundary are due to currents coming out of the northern sponge layer where the tracer concentration is restored to zero and hence are a numerical artifact. The time-mean vertical tracer advection in the perturbation experiment for a wind stress of 2*τ also shows much larger values than the perturbation experiment for a wind stress of τ, with changes again occurring along the core of the Kerguelen jet. From this figure, it is also evident that the dominant length scales of upward and downward advection, of the order of 100 km, point toward tracer ventilation being a consequence of the Kerguelen jet interacting with standing mesoscale features. Note though that this long-term mean will remove the footprint of small-scale eddies simply due to the chaotic and short-lived nature of these eddies. These small-scale eddies are crucial for the upper ocean vertical transport and are mostly due to mixed layer instabilities and frontogenesis that can be enhanced in an energetic mesoscale eddy strain field relevant to jets. In the following, the perturbation experiments with wind stresses of 0.5*τ, τ, and 2*τ will be used to further highlight the differences in tracer ventilation and jet dynamics, with the focus being on the Kerguelen jet.

  <sub>10</sub> scale, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a> shows the extent to which the passive tracer has ventilated the ocean interior after 5 years. Vertical sections of tracer concentrations are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a> (A to C) for the cyan transect in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a> and in

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>. The cyan transect is chosen to be north of the ventilation region, and the purple transect is chosen to be downstream of the ventilation region, both to highlight tracer concentrations in the ocean interior rather than the ventilation region. Black contours in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a> (A to F) represent salinity, with AAIW being defined by the salinity minimum evident between depths of approximately 500 and 1500 m. For a wind stress of 0.5*τ, the tracer is confined to the SML and hence there is no ventilation of the ocean interior (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, A and D). For a wind stress of τ, the tracer is ventilated into the top ~500 m of the water column, with tracer concentrations decreasing monotonically with depth (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, B and E). For a wind stress of 2*τ, the tracer is ventilated across the base of the SML into AAIW, with a vertical separation between elevated tracer concentrations in the SML and AAIW (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, C and F). These results would suggest that tracer ventilation in storm track leads to deep SMLs, while tracer ventilation along the jet leads to tracer ventilation across the base of the SML into AAIW.
