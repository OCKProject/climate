 <div class="title">Tracer ventilation as a function of jet dynamics.</div>
 <p>Tracer concentration at a depth of 200 m for a wind stress of (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) τ, 8 months after the tracer is first introduced, and a wind stress of (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) 2*τ, 4 months after the tracer is introduced. Black contours show time-mean velocities at 200 m to highlight the position of the Kerguelen jet. Note the different color scales.
