 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A passive tracer has been introduced at the ocean surface over the last 10 years of model integration. This is done by relaxing the tracer concentration to a value of 1, with a relaxation time scale of 2 hours, homogeneously everywhere south of 37.6Â°S. North of this latitude, no tracer is introduced because of the numerics of the sponge layer, leading to unphysical vertical motion of the tracer. At the northern boundary of the model domain, the tracer concentration is relaxed to zero to simulate the tracer leaving the domain. The transient increase in tracer concentration in the mid-depth Southern Ocean, integrated between depths of 500 and 1500 m, is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F9" href="#F9">Fig. 9</a>. Tracer concentrations increase over approximately 5 years before leveling off due to the tracer being relaxed to zero once reaching the northern sponge layer. Tracer concentrations shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a> are a 2-month mean after 5 years of tracer input at the ocean surface.
