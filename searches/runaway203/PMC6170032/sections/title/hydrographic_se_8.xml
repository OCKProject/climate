 <p>Colors show vertical sections along the green transect in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a> of time-mean (
  <span class="bold">A</span>,

  <span class="bold">B</span>,

  <span class="bold">I</span>) salinity (psu), for the perturbation experiments with wind stresses of (A to C) 0.5*τ, (D to F) τ, and (G to I) 2*τ. White contours are time-mean isopycnals, and the green line is the time-mean mixed layer depth. The black feature is the northern slope of the KP. The red patch in (H) marks a region of time-mean convection. Horizontal sections of time-mean buoyancy frequency (per second) on a log
  <sub>10</sub> scale at a depth of 120 m, chosen to represent the depth of the base of the SML, for the perturbation experiments with wind stresses of (
  <span class="bold">J</span>) 0.5*τ, (
  <span class="bold">K</span>) τ, and (
  <span class="bold">L</span>) 2*τ. Hovmöller diagrams of zonal surface velocities along the green transect in
