 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ocean is the global climate system’s second largest reservoir of heat and carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>) behind the solid Earth. Because of the correlation between global temperature and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations over glacial cycles, the time scales involved, and the ocean’s capability to store large amounts of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, it is thought that the ocean is a major player behind these changes (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). Most of the ocean below a depth of 1 km interacts with the atmosphere through less than 4% of the ocean’s surface area, mostly at high latitudes (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). These high-latitude areas, particularly the Southern Ocean, are therefore crucial in controlling the exchange of CO
  <sub>2</sub> between the atmosphere and the deep ocean. Numerous proxy data obtained from sediment cores, used to reconstruct past patterns of ocean circulation, confirm the important role of the Southern Ocean (

   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>). In particular, the ventilation of a water mass known as Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is of global significance. AAIW is formed by fresh Antarctic Surface Waters (AASW) ventilating the mid-depth Southern Ocean (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>), leading to the redistribution of heat, freshwater, and nutrients throughout the global ocean (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>). AAIW is a significant sink of anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>) and is recognized as being pivotal in explaining rapid transitions observed in Earth’s past climate (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>). Both observational (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>) and model studies (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>) show a possible link between abrupt changes in the ventilation of AAIW and the collapse of North Atlantic Deep Water formation, pointing toward a crucial role of AAIW ventilation in contributing to, or even triggering, abrupt reorganizations of the global meridional overturning circulation (MOC).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of the rotation of Earth, persistent westerly winds over the Southern Ocean push surface waters to the north, leading to the steepening of isopycnals and subsequently the upwelling of carbon and nutrient-rich deep waters as part of the Southern Ocean MOC (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>). Once these deep waters reach the ocean surface, they are able to exchange properties with the atmosphere before they re-ventilate the ocean interior. The resulting carbon budget is a delicate balance between these ventilation pathways (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>). From a physical perspective, the balance between the outgassing of CO
  <sub>2</sub> from the upwelling of natural carbon-rich deep waters and the drawdown of atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> by the ventilation process determines whether the Southern Ocean acts as a sink or source of CO
  <sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>). If the biological perspective is taken into account, this balance is also responsible for the availability of nutrients at the ocean surface, with consequences for the export of carbon into the ocean interior due to the sinking of biological matter (
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>). The net role of the Southern Ocean as a source or sink of CO
  <sub>2</sub> is therefore a combination of both physical and biological processes (

   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fueled by observation-based evidence of rapid climate transitions in Earth’s past, and the uncertainty of the ocean’s heat and CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake in future climates, substantial effort has gone into understanding how these processes are likely to change under varying wind forcing (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>), buoyancy forcing (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>), and sea ice cover (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>). Most of this effort has focused on the wind-induced overturning by the Southern Ocean MOC. It has been shown that the upwelling of deep waters, although partially compensated by mesoscale eddies, increases continuously for an increase in wind stress (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>). With winds predicted to increase under anthropogenic forcing (
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>), this would lead to enhanced outgassing of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in the future, opposing anthropogenic carbon uptake (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>), although these results remain controversial (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). While substantial progress in understanding this upwelling process has been made, very little is known about the processes that lead to the re-ventilation of these water masses. This is particularly the case for the ventilation of AAIW, for which many processes have been suggested as possible candidates, such as convection driven by air-sea fluxes, Ekman transport, eddy and turbulent mixing, and mixing at the base of the mixed layer, but no conclusion has been reached (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study sheds some light on this problem by using a high-resolution numerical model of the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean to elucidate on the processes relevant to Southern Ocean ventilation. Using the topographically steered jet north of the Kerguelen Plateau (KP) as an example, I show how changes in wind stress affect jet dynamics and their interaction with topographic features and stratification. The sensitivity of jet dynamics to wind stress leads to changes in Southern Ocean ventilation, which are an order of magnitude larger than would be expected from changes in the Southern Ocean MOC alone. Once the wind stress is increased beyond a certain threshold, the jet dynamics abruptly change, allowing for the ventilation of AAIW. Since the jet dynamics discussed here depend on small-scale turbulent processes, it will be a tremendous challenge to represent these jet dynamics, and their effect on Southern Ocean ventilation, in models used for simulations of past and future climates. Nevertheless, it is only once we understand these dynamics that we can confidently predict possible rapid transitions in a future climate.</p>
