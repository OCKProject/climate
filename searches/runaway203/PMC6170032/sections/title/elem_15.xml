 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the perturbation experiments, the westerly component of the wind stress was changed to multiples of the annually and zonally averaged wind stress of the year 2005 taken from the Southern Ocean State Estimate (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>). With the 2005 winds used as the reference case, and denoted by τ, five perturbation experiments were run where the westerly component of the wind stress was perturbed to 0.5*τ, 0.75*τ, 1.25*τ, 1.5*τ, and 2*τ. In all perturbation experiments, forcing at the northern boundary and the surface remained the same as in the reference experiment. All perturbation experiments were run for 30 years starting from the equilibrated reference experiment, with results shown here being mean values over the last 10 years.

  <sub>bci</sub>), barotropic transports (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>btp</sub>), and maximum Southern Ocean MOC (Ψ
  <sub>max</sub>) for all perturbation experiments. Similar to EKE derived from satellite observations and modeling studies, EKE increases with increasing wind forcing (

  <a rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" href="#R56">
   <span class="italic">56</span>
  </a>). Because of the complex topography in the model, baroclinic and barotropic transports were calculated using a two-layer model approximation (
  <a rid="R57" ref-type="bibr" href="#R57">
   <span class="italic">57</span>
  </a>) at the most eastern longitude of the model domain. The barotropic transport (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>btp</sub>) was defined as the average velocity in the bottom layer multiplied by the ocean depth, and the baroclinic transport (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>bci</sub>) was defined as the difference in transport between the upper and lower layers. The boundary between the two layers was chosen to be 1600 m, with the transport anomalies in the perturbation experiments being insensitive to this choice (
  <a rid="R57" ref-type="bibr" href="#R57">
   <span class="italic">57</span>
  </a>). As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">Fig. 8</a>, the baroclinic transport changed very little with wind stress, an effect known as “eddy saturation” (
  <a rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" href="#R56">
   <span class="italic">56</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R58" ref-type="bibr" href="#R58">
   <span class="italic">58</span>
  </a>), whereas the barotropic transport increased with wind stress. The insensitivity of the baroclinic transport is the reason why ocean observations show little change in isopycnal slopes over recent decades during which wind speeds increased (
  <a rid="R59" ref-type="bibr" href="#R59">
   <span class="italic">59</span>
  </a>). The Southern Ocean MOC increases less than linearly with wind stress owing to a partial compensation of the wind stress by mesoscale eddies, an effect known as “eddy compensation” (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). All of these metrics agree with previous work.
