  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ocean model used was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) (
   <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
    <span class="italic">46</span>
   </a>). It uses depth coordinates, partially filled cells for the bathymetry, a quadratic bottom drag coefficient of 0.0025, a nonlinear equation of state (
   <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
    <span class="italic">47</span>
   </a>), a seventh-order advection scheme, and the K-profile parameterization (
   <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
    <span class="italic">48</span>
   </a>). The model domain ranged from 57° to 129°E in longitude and 70° to 35°S in latitude and hence included the steep topography associated with the KP and the SEIR. The horizontal grid spacing was 1/20°, which converts to a zonal grid spacing of ~4.5 km at the northern boundary and ~1.9 km at the southern boundary, with a meridional grid spacing of ~5.6 km. The vertical resolution was resolved by 150 layers, ranging from 10 m thickness at the surface to 50 m thickness at depth.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model topography was taken from the 1-min-resolution Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (
   <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
    <span class="italic">49</span>
   </a>) with a maximum depth of 5000 m. The model domain was made periodic in the east-west direction, and the topography was interpolated over 4° bands at its eastern and western bands to avoid discontinuities. The northern boundary was relaxed over a 1°-wide sponge layer with a relaxation time of 4 days to annually and zonally averaged climatological fields taken from year 2005 of the Southern Ocean State Estimate (
   <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">
    <span class="italic">50</span>
   </a>). At the ocean surface, the model was forced to the annually and zonally averaged sea-surface temperature (which was restored with a relaxation time of 15 days), freshwater fluxes, and wind forcing from the Southern Ocean State Estimate. The Southern Ocean MOC was calculated using the MITgcm’s layer package (
   <a rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" href="#R51">
    <span class="italic">51</span>
   </a>), with the maximum value being determined for all regions south of the sponge layer. For this reference experiment, the total zonal transport was equal to 155 Sverdrup (1 Sverdrup = 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> m
   <span class="sup">3</span> s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>), which was close to the observed value of the transport estimated in Drake Passage of 173.3 Sverdrup (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perturbation experiments</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the perturbation experiments, the westerly component of the wind stress was changed to multiples of the annually and zonally averaged wind stress of the year 2005 taken from the Southern Ocean State Estimate (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>). With the 2005 winds used as the reference case, and denoted by τ, five perturbation experiments were run where the westerly component of the wind stress was perturbed to 0.5*τ, 0.75*τ, 1.25*τ, 1.5*τ, and 2*τ. In all perturbation experiments, forcing at the northern boundary and the surface remained the same as in the reference experiment. All perturbation experiments were run for 30 years starting from the equilibrated reference experiment, with results shown here being mean values over the last 10 years. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">Figure 8</a> shows EKE, baroclinic transports (
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>bci</sub>), barotropic transports (
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>btp</sub>), and maximum Southern Ocean MOC (Ψ
   <sub>max</sub>) for all perturbation experiments. Similar to EKE derived from satellite observations and modeling studies, EKE increases with increasing wind forcing (
   <a rid="R55" ref-type="bibr" href="#R55">

   </a>, 
   <a rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" href="#R56">
    <span class="italic">56</span>
   </a>). Because of the complex topography in the model, baroclinic and barotropic transports were calculated using a two-layer model approximation (
   <a rid="R57" ref-type="bibr" href="#R57">
    <span class="italic">57</span>
   </a>) at the most eastern longitude of the model domain. The barotropic transport (
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>btp</sub>) was defined as the average velocity in the bottom layer multiplied by the ocean depth, and the baroclinic transport (
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>bci</sub>) was defined as the difference in transport between the upper and lower layers. The boundary between the two layers was chosen to be 1600 m, with the transport anomalies in the perturbation experiments being insensitive to this choice (
   <a rid="R57" ref-type="bibr" href="#R57">
    <span class="italic">57</span>
   </a>). As shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">Fig. 8</a>, the baroclinic transport changed very little with wind stress, an effect known as “eddy saturation” (
   <a rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" href="#R56">
    <span class="italic">56</span>
   </a>, 
   <a rid="R58" ref-type="bibr" href="#R58">
    <span class="italic">58</span>
   </a>), whereas the barotropic transport increased with wind stress. The insensitivity of the baroclinic transport is the reason why ocean observations show little change in isopycnal slopes over recent decades during which wind speeds increased (
   <a rid="R59" ref-type="bibr" href="#R59">
    <span class="italic">59</span>
   </a>). The Southern Ocean MOC increases less than linearly with wind stress owing to a partial compensation of the wind stress by mesoscale eddies, an effect known as “eddy compensation” (
   <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
    <span class="italic">2</span>
   </a>). All of these metrics agree with previous work.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tracer ventilation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A passive tracer has been introduced at the ocean surface over the last 10 years of model integration. This is done by relaxing the tracer concentration to a value of 1, with a relaxation time scale of 2 hours, homogeneously everywhere south of 37.6°S. North of this latitude, no tracer is introduced because of the numerics of the sponge layer, leading to unphysical vertical motion of the tracer. At the northern boundary of the model domain, the tracer concentration is relaxed to zero to simulate the tracer leaving the domain. The transient increase in tracer concentration in the mid-depth Southern Ocean, integrated between depths of 500 and 1500 m, is shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F9" href="#F9">Fig. 9</a>. Tracer concentrations increase over approximately 5 years before leveling off due to the tracer being relaxed to zero once reaching the northern sponge layer. Tracer concentrations shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a> are a 2-month mean after 5 years of tracer input at the ocean surface.
