 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While observations related to the dynamics of Southern Ocean jets and their effect on tracer ventilation are sparse, the few observations that exist are consistent with the dynamics proposed here. Using observational data sets, it has been shown that Southern Ocean ventilation is a very localized process, associated with topographic features (

  </a>). This has also been confirmed using observationally based estimates of anthropogenic carbon concentrations to show the localized nature of anthropogenic CO

  </a>). More recent work has used biogeochemical autonomous floats (BGCArgo) to detect intermittent ventilation events in oceanic storm tracks (

  </a>). All these observational studies agree with the jet dynamics in the case of a baroclinic jet, with ventilation occurring in storm tracks. For the ventilation of AAIW, in the case of a barotropic jet, observations become even more sparse. Most of the AAIW ventilation under current climate forcing occurs in Drake Passage, where the Southern Ocean jet known as the polar front (PF) is pushed through the narrow gap between South America and Antarctica. Observations of the PF in this region show both zero crossings of the cross-jet potential vorticity gradient and bottom velocities of the order of 0.04 to 0.05 m s

  </a>), similar to the barotropic state of the jet discussed here, that is, the state for which AAIW ventilation occurs. In 1998, an interference between El Nino–Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode led to an anomalous wind forcing with winds in the region of AAIW ventilation being directed in an up-front direction rather than the usual down-front direction. A time series of physical and biogeochemical properties between 1969 and 2005, produced from transects across Drake Passage, shows that in 1998/1999, AAIW suddenly warmed, salinified, and de-oxygenated (

   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). These observations suggest an interruption of AAIW ventilation for 1 to 2 years following this anomalous wind forcing, pointing toward the crucial role of down-front winds in ventilating the ocean interior. Nevertheless, to test whether this anomaly in AAIW ventilation can be explained by the jet dynamics introduced here, it would be necessary to run multiple perturbation experiments of the circulation in Drake Passage. These experiments would be technically very challenging and computationally expensive since the topography of Drake Passage prevents the use of a simple re-entrant model configuration, as done in this study, and hence it would be necessary to simulate the full Southern Ocean.
