  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within LM3-TAN, water and energy storage in land and exchanges with the atmosphere are computed at a 30-min timestep. Five vegetation functional types (C3 and C4 grasses, temperate deciduous, tropical, and cold evergreen trees) are simulated based on total biomass and prevailing climate conditions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>. The vegetation pools include leaves, fine roots, sapwood, heartwood, and labile storage, which are updated daily to account for vegetation growth and allocation, leaf fall and display, natural and fire-induced mortality. Four land-use types (primary land—land undisturbed by human activities during land-use reconstruction, secondary land—abandoned agricultural land or regrowing forest after logging, cropland, and pasture) and land-use changes are simulated by using a historically reconstructed scenario of land-use transitions including the effects of wood harvesting and shifting cultivation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span>. The model is spatially gridded, and each grid cell consists of up to 15 tiles: 1 primary land, 1 cropland, 1 pasture, 1 lake, 1 glacier, and up to 10 secondary land tiles, reflecting unique perturbation histories, such as de/reforestation and agricultural activities.
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When wood is harvested, the vegetation biomass in primary or secondary land is removed, and the land is replaced with (1) cropland or pasture for agriculture or (2) secondary forests after logging
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>. When crops are harvested, all leaf and the aboveground fraction of labile stores in croplands are cut. When grass is harvested, a fraction of leaf in pasture is removed. Crop and grass harvesting are done annually. See Shevliakova and colleagues

The net harvest can be further partitioned into that associated with agricultural lands (agricultural net harvest) and that associated with non-agricultural lands (non-agricultural net harvest).

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>. Each C pool in vegetation and organic soils is paired with a respective N pool using pool-specific C:N ratios. Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) releases inorganic ammonium N, which is further transformed into nitrite or nitrate N by nitrification. Soil denitrification emissions are simulated by using a first-order loss function with respect to soil nitrate N content, with adjustments for the influence of soil water content and temperature

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>. Simulations of biologically available inorganic N species allow accounting for N limitation on vegetation growth and BNF as well as N feedbacks on SOM decomposition and immobilization. BNF is considered as a high light-requiring costly process, and is thus only simulated if plant uptake cannot meet N demands, as a prognostic function of local N availability and of sunlight access in temperate and boreal biomes

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). The resultant model couples hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical cycles, and captures key N dynamics within a vegetation-soil-river-lake system in response to LULCC, anthropogenic Nr inputs, atmospheric CO
