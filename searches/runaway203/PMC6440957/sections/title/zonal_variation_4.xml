 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When NLI is broken down by latitude, results suggest that tropical NLI is generally higher than extratropical NLI over the last century (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>, magenta vs. cyan lines). By the latter half of the 20th century, the extratropics become a strong net N sink, sequestering 18 (18–20)% of total land Nr inputs, while the tropics become nearly neutral (NLI = ~1) despite the global tendency toward net N sequestration. These tropical systems ultimately produce 48 (46–69)% of global land N outputs to the ocean and atmosphere (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total input and output fluxes comprising the NLI allow us to assess whether land is sequestrating or releasing N at global and basin scales. Estimating N pollution from land, however, requires additional considerations. Partitioning of the N outputs into pollutants and environmentally benign forms (see Methods and Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) further suggests that the tropics produce 56 ± 6% of global land N pollution to the ocean and atmosphere (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Even without CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization, tropical contributions to global land N pollution are 57 ± 6% (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). These high contributions occur despite the tropics covering only 34% of global land area and receiving much lower amounts of synthetic fertilizers than the extratropics (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a, b</a>).

    <p>Prominence of the tropics in global N pollution. Tropical (global) land N pollution was estimated as the sum of N outputs from tropical (global) land, minus the sum of environmentally benign portions of the outputs (see Methods and Supplementary Note 
     <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). These estimates suggest that the tropics create 56 ± 6% of global land N pollution despite covering only 34% of global land area and receiving far lower amounts of synthetic fertilizers than the extratropics (Table 
     <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
     <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>, b). The reported uncertainties consider the sensitivity of the pollution estimates to variations in the forcing (i.e., different BNF settings, fertilizer inputs, and LULCC) and different partitioning of the outputs into environmentally benign vs. pollutant forms

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the tropics, the largest contributors to increasing land N outputs are net harvest and denitrification (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>). As mentioned previously, the majority of the net harvest is assumed to ultimately go to the atmosphere
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Most of the increasing tropical N outputs thus go to the atmosphere, and river exports to the ocean remain relatively stable. Averaged across all tropical systems, the increasing N outputs are in near balance with increasing agricultural BNF (largely due to expansion of agricultural land areas) and, more recently, limited increases in fertilizer inputs and atmospheric deposition (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>), explaining the nearly neutral N fluxes to land storage (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5e</a>). In the extratropics, contemporary (1976–2005 mean) total land Nr inputs amount to 136 TgN yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>), however, enhanced land N sequestration (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5f</a>) reduces total land N outputs to 111 TgN yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>). Rapid increases in fertilizer use and relatively modest increases in atmospheric deposition and agricultural BNF have continued to augment N outputs despite the enhanced N sequestration. It is notable that in the extratropics, the increasing N outputs not only go to the atmosphere, but also are exported to the ocean in the form of bioavailable inorganic N. The same essential source/sink dynamics evident in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> operate for the other BNF settings, fertilizer inputs, and LULCC, with only modest changes in relative importance (Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the no-CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization scenario, since the late 19th century, agricultural and non-agricultural BNF in the tropics and extratropics are lower than those in the baseline simulation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a, b</a>, dash-dot vs. solid lines). The lower BNF decreases land N storage, primarily in tropical non-agricultural lands including large intact forests, but does not immediately reduce overall N outputs (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c–f</a>). Since the mid 20th century, the lower BNF results in only a small reduction in N outputs, specifically agricultural net harvest. Thus, the comparison of simulations with and without CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization suggests that CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization has increased land N storage primarily in undisturbed areas, but have not significantly affected tropical and extratropical N outputs.
