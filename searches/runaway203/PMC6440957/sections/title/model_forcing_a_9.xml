The four Nr inputs were linearly interpolated between years of data available to be applied for the intervals without data. Uniform annual rates of the first (last) year data were applied for the periods before (after) the first (last) year of data available. Atmospheric deposition was applied for the entire simulation periods. Fertilizers and manure were applied from 1901 to 2005. Urban wastewaters were applied from 1951 to 2005.

These urban wastewaters were also deducted from simulated harvest. Each of the Nr inputs was divided into three N species (i.e., organic, ammonium, and nitrate plus nitrite N) by multiplying reported fractions (Supplementary Table

 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the end of the spin-up, the N budget has come to equilibrium for all regions, except high-latitude boreal forest and tundra regions where N continues to accumulate in cold soils. We note that some degree of disequilibrium in such high-latitude systems may reflect the actual multimillennial response to the Last Glacial Maximum. This response has previously been modeled in other long-term N simulations
