 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulated global land N storage and fluxes in LM3-TAN are found to be within published uncertainty bounds in 16 different studies, when comparable categorization, definitions, and assumptions are applied (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Simulated regional river discharge, dissolved inorganic and organic N loads and concentrations also agree with reported discharge and measurement-based N estimates from 47 major rivers, which are distributed broadly over the globe and influenced by various climates, biomes, and human activities (Supplementary Figures

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The global C balance is also found to be generally within uncertainty bounds in large-scale constraints and atmospheric studies. Simulated global net land C fluxes (e.g., 1.0 (0.9–1.3) PgC yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for 1990s, 1.1 (1.0–1.3) PgC yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for 2001–2004) agree with estimates based on global C budget constraints (e.g., 1.1 (0.5–1.8) PgC yr
