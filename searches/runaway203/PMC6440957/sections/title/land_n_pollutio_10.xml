 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The input and output fluxes described in the main text and Methods allow us to close the land N budget and assess whether land is sequestrating or releasing N at global and basin scales. Estimating N pollution from land, however, requires additional considerations. Total land N pollution was estimated as the total land N outputs, minus the sum of N
  <sub>2</sub> emissions and human appropriation of the net harvest into durable goods (e.g., home building). The fractional partitioning of each output flux into these environmentally benign forms was based on reported values from the literature

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>
  </span>, organic N exports from rivers may be less critical drivers of acute pollutant effects on coastal ecosystems. We thus tested the robustness of our results to the exclusion of river organic N exports from land N pollution. Our reported uncertainties consider the sensitivity of our results to variations in this forcing. Finally, in recognition of the uncertainty surrounding the degree of CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effects on terrestrial C sink

  <sub>2</sub> fertilization.
