 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globally, our results suggest that, from 1750 until the late 1940s, land served as a net N source (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>): reduced land N storage (cyan line) augmented N outputs from land (orange line) such that they exceeded contemporaneous Nr inputs to land (black line). That is, substantial exports of legacy land N storage enhanced N fluxes to the ocean and atmosphere relative to what would had been caused by the contemporaneous Nr inputs alone. Since the late 1940s, land has become a net N sink: land systems have acted to reduce N outputs to the ocean and atmosphere by sequestrating a fraction of contemporaneous Nr inputs. The global transition of land from a net N source to a net N sink in the late 1940s mirrors a similar transition in terrestrial C storage

  </span>. It is a robust result of increasing N demand from vegetation and subsequent N accumulation in soils associated with secondary forest regrowth in some regions and overall enhanced vegetation growth due to CO

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the evolving land capacity to sequester Nr inputs, we define a global and basin-specific N-Loss Index, NLI, as total N outputs from land, divided by total Nr inputs to land. NLI larger than 1 indicates that land is releasing an amount of N that exceeds total land Nr inputs, decreasing land N storage and amplifying N outputs. NLI smaller than 1 indicates that land is sequestrating a fraction of total land Nr inputs, increasing land N storage and releasing less N than it receives. When NLI is 1, land inputs and outputs are in balance. In a manner consistent with Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>, global NLI is between 1–1.1 up to the late 1940s, reflecting 0–10% augmentation of total land Nr inputs (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). It then falls below 1 and decreases, eventually sequestrating 11% of total land Nr inputs. This result is robust across the different BNF settings, fertilizer inputs, and LULCC (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>).
