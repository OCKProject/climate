 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (Nr) inputs to terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., synthetic fertilizers and atmospheric deposition associated with agricultural industrialization and fossil fuel combustion) and subsequent (N) losses to the ocean and atmosphere have sharply increased over the past century

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Nitrous oxide emitted from soils, rivers, and lentic systems are the third largest greenhouse gas contributor to radiative forcing

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much attention has been placed on the effects of sharply increased anthropogenic Nr inputs on severe oceanic or atmospheric pollution
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. However, numerous other anthropogenic and natural processes modulate N fluxes to the ocean and atmosphere. Biological N fixation (BNF) adds substantial Nr to terrestrial ecosystems, especially in the tropics

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Land use and land cover change (LULCC) export substantial N and carbon (C) from storage in wood, crops, grasses, and soils via deforestation, slash-and-burn agriculture, harvesting, and livestock grazing

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. In some regions, increasing terrestrial Nr inputs directly augment N fluxes to the ocean and atmosphere

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, whereas terrestrial ecosystems in other regions sequester a significant fraction of added Nr, buffering N fluxes
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. This regional variation in the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester Nr inputs appears to depend on both current and past anthropogenic land disturbances
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> and changing climate and variability

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fate of Nr in many terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems remains uncertain because of sparse measurements of N cycling processes

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we used the global land biosphere model LM3-TAN

  </span> which represents coupled water, C, and N dynamics and interactions within a vegetation–soil–river–lake system and simulates the exchanges between and transformations within each subsystem for three N species (i.e., organic, ammonium, and nitrate plus nitrite N)

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyze the past two and half centuries of terrestrial and freshwater N storage and fluxes to the ocean and atmosphere, considering not only the effect of increased anthropogenic Nr inputs, but also the effects of elevated atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> (i.e., CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization), LULCC, and climate change. We demonstrate how LULCC has disrupted vegetation-soil systems across 159 major river basins covering 70% of global land area. We then show how this has altered terrestrial-freshwater N cycling and affected N fluxes and pollution to the ocean and atmosphere at global scales, across the tropics (between 23.26°N and 23.26°S) and extratropics, and at the basin scale. These analyses suggest that recent accelerating LULCC in tropical regions has resulted in prominence of the tropics in global N pollution despite their disproportionately smaller land area and far lower fertilizer applications than the extratropics.
