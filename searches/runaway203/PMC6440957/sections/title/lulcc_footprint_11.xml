 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We classified the 159 river basins based on five small-to-large evolving types of LULCC footprints, which are reflected by five distinct basin-scale pathways of land N storage from 1750 to 2005: Small footprint (persistently increased N storage; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a, f</a>, blue), Small-to-medium footprint (stable and increased N storage; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b, f</a>, blue-green), Medium footprint (decreased and increased N storage; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c, f</a>, green), Medium-to-large footprint (increasingly reduced N storage; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6d, f</a>, yellow), and Large footprint (sharply reduced and increased N storage; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6e, f</a>, red). The land N storage from 1750 to 2005 in the Mackenzie, Colorado, Amazon, Parana, and Mississippi River Basins were chosen as representatives of reflecting the five LULCC footprints, because these basins are the largest ones presenting each type among the 47 basins used for the result evaluation (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). This classification was made based on the highest Pearson’s correlations between each of the land N storage in the 154 basins and the five representatives from 1750 to 2005. The result was shaded in five distinct colors, representing each LULCC footprint (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6f</a>).
