   <span class="bold">f</span> 159 river basins shaded by five distinct colors representing the five LULCC footprints. Small footprint basins account for 21 of the 159 basins, 7% of the area of the 159 basins, and 1% of the total N outputs from the 159 basins. Small-to-medium footprint basins account for 40 basins, 21% of the area, and 10% of the outputs. Medium footprint basins account for 30 basins, 27% of the area, and 25% of the outputs. Medium-to-large footprint basins account for 57 basins, 37% of the area, and 48% of the outputs. Large footprint basins account for 11 basins, 8% of the area, and 15% of the outputs
