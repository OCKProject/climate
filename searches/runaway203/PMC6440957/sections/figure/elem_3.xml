  <p>Prominence of the tropics in global N pollution. Tropical (global) land N pollution was estimated as the sum of N outputs from tropical (global) land, minus the sum of environmentally benign portions of the outputs (see Methods and Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). These estimates suggest that the tropics create 56 ± 6% of global land N pollution despite covering only 34% of global land area and receiving far lower amounts of synthetic fertilizers than the extratropics (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>, b). The reported uncertainties consider the sensitivity of the pollution estimates to variations in the forcing (i.e., different BNF settings, fertilizer inputs, and LULCC) and different partitioning of the outputs into environmentally benign vs. pollutant forms
