  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globally, our results suggest that, from 1750 until the late 1940s, land served as a net N source (Fig.

That is, substantial exports of legacy land N storage enhanced N fluxes to the ocean and atmosphere relative to what would had been caused by the contemporaneous Nr inputs alone. Since the late 1940s, land has become a net N sink: land systems have acted to reduce N outputs to the ocean and atmosphere by sequestrating a fraction of contemporaneous Nr inputs. The global transition of land from a net N source to a net N sink in the late 1940s mirrors a similar transition in terrestrial C storage

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the evolving land capacity to sequester Nr inputs, we define a global and basin-specific N-Loss Index, NLI, as total N outputs from land, divided by total Nr inputs to land. NLI larger than 1 indicates that land is releasing an amount of N that exceeds total land Nr inputs, decreasing land N storage and amplifying N outputs. NLI smaller than 1 indicates that land is sequestrating a fraction of total land Nr inputs, increasing land N storage and releasing less N than it receives. When NLI is 1, land inputs and outputs are in balance. In a manner consistent with Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>, global NLI is between 1–1.1 up to the late 1940s, reflecting 0–10% augmentation of total land Nr inputs (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). It then falls below 1 and decreases, eventually sequestrating 11% of total land Nr inputs. This result is robust across the different BNF settings, fertilizer inputs, and LULCC (Fig.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total input and output fluxes comprising the NLI allow us to assess whether land is sequestrating or releasing N at global and basin scales. Estimating N pollution from land, however, requires additional considerations. Partitioning of the N outputs into pollutants and environmentally benign forms (see Methods and Supplementary Note

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the tropics, the largest contributors to increasing land N outputs are net harvest and denitrification (Fig.

   </span>. Most of the increasing tropical N outputs thus go to the atmosphere, and river exports to the ocean remain relatively stable. Averaged across all tropical systems, the increasing N outputs are in near balance with increasing agricultural BNF (largely due to expansion of agricultural land areas) and, more recently, limited increases in fertilizer inputs and atmospheric deposition (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>), explaining the nearly neutral N fluxes to land storage (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5e</a>). In the extratropics, contemporary (1976–2005 mean) total land Nr inputs amount to 136 TgN yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>), however, enhanced land N sequestration (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5f</a>) reduces total land N outputs to 111 TgN yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>). Rapid increases in fertilizer use and relatively modest increases in atmospheric deposition and agricultural BNF have continued to augment N outputs despite the enhanced N sequestration. It is notable that in the extratropics, the increasing N outputs not only go to the atmosphere, but also are exported to the ocean in the form of bioavailable inorganic N. The same essential source/sink dynamics evident in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> operate for the other BNF settings, fertilizer inputs, and LULCC, with only modest changes in relative importance (Supplementary Figures 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>–
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the no-CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization scenario, since the late 19th century, agricultural and non-agricultural BNF in the tropics and extratropics are lower than those in the baseline simulation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a, b</a>, dash-dot vs. solid lines). The lower BNF decreases land N storage, primarily in tropical non-agricultural lands including large intact forests, but does not immediately reduce overall N outputs (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c–f</a>). Since the mid 20th century, the lower BNF results in only a small reduction in N outputs, specifically agricultural net harvest. Thus, the comparison of simulations with and without CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization suggests that CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization has increased land N storage primarily in undisturbed areas, but have not significantly affected tropical and extratropical N outputs.

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inspection of basin-scale NLI patterns (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>) shows that considerable variation in land N sequestration or release underlie the emergent global and latitudinal patterns discussed above. Contemporary basin-specific NLIs vary between substantial sinks (&lt;0.5) and substantial sources (&gt;1.25). That is, basins with NLI much smaller than 1 are providing a valuable ecosystem service by sequestrating a significant fraction of their total Nr inputs, whereas other basins are releasing an amount of N that far exceeds the sum of their Nr inputs, amplifying N fluxes to the atmosphere or ocean. This large regional variation is consistent with N isotope records

   </span>. Basins with NLIs smaller than 1 are far more prevalent in temperate regions, while those with NLIs exceeding 1 or nearly 1 are more prevalent in the tropics, but exceptions exist. The standard deviation in NLIs between the different BNF settings, fertilizer inputs, and LULCC is generally &lt;0.05 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>), and 4 or more of the 5 simulations agree on whether a basin is a net N sink or source during 1976–2005 for all but 5 of the 159 basins considered.
  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of evolving land N storage and fluxes at the basin scale suggests that the primary driver of variation in land N sequestration or release is the timing, intensity, and legacy of prior agricultural land use and deforestation (i.e., LULCC footprints). We classify the 159 basins based on five small-to-large evolving types of LULCC footprints, which are here reflected by five distinct basin-scale pathways of land N storage from 1750 to 2005 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>).

   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a, f; e.g.</a>, Mackenzie) have been modestly influenced by slow, minimal, and late agricultural land use and deforestation (see Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a> for historical land-use changes and Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a> for global distributions of contemporary land use). These basins are furthermore located at high-latitude boreal forest and tundra regions and exhibit slow N accumulation, reflecting long equilibrium timescales of the systems
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
   </span> (See Methods). These factors combine with modest secondary forest regrowth and enhanced vegetation growth due to CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization to yield persistent increases in land N storage.

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small-to-medium footprint basins (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b, f; e.g.</a>, Colorado) are characterized by relatively slow, mild, and late LULCC, but changes are considerably larger than near-pristine small footprint basins (Supplementary Figures 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). Small-to-medium footprint basins tend to be in somewhat warmer climates than extremely high-latitude small footprint basins and are near equilibrium until the late 19th century. In these basins, LULCC effects are small enough that they are offset by secondary forest regrowth and enhanced vegetation growth due to CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization. The most distinctive feature of small and small-to-medium footprint basins relative to the other footprint basins is the lack of any significant decrease in land N storage during the historical period.

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Medium footprint basins (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c, f; e.g.</a>, Amazon) feature significant deforestation and logging at a very early stage of the Anthropocene (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9b</a>) followed by minimal agricultural land use over the 20th century (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9a</a>). As a result, these basins present decreased land N storage until the late 19th century, then increasing land N storage thereafter. This pattern in other medium footprint boreal and temperate basins (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6f</a>) are largely explained by forest management and recovery from past fire and disturbances (Europe)

   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6d, f; e.g.</a>, Parana) are characterized by early deforestation and modest agricultural land use until the late 19

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, large footprint basins (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6e, f; e.g.</a>, Mississippi) present sharply decreased land N storage up to the mid 20th century, indicating early, rapid, and intensive LULCC

   </span>. There are also scattered small-to-medium and medium footprint basins in the tropics, but the tempering effect of land N sequestration in these systems cannot curtail the overall prominence of the tropics in contemporary N pollution.
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A breakdown of N inputs and outputs from two of the largest tropical river basins, the medium footprint Amazon and the medium-to-large footprint Parana (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>), provides further perspective on the fate and drivers of tropical N fluxes and pollution (and allows us to relate our results to recent measurements in tropical systems, see Discussion). Since the late 19th century, increasing N outputs from the both basins are primarily driven by net harvest (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7c, d</a>) and thus result primarily in increasing atmospheric emissions. In the Parana River Basin, increasing agricultural land use, which is reflected by agricultural net harvest, is the major cause of large increases in N outputs. The increasing N outputs (~8 TgN yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) are only partly balanced by increasing inputs of ~6 TgN yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, driven mainly by agricultural BNF (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a, c</a>). Release of ~2 TgN yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span> of legacy land N storage thus have further augmented the outputs (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7e</a>). In the Amazon River Basin, both non-agricultural and agricultural BNF increase inputs by ~5 TgN yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7b</a>). Outputs, however, increase by only ~3 TgN yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, indicating net land N sequestration of ~2 TgN yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d, f</a>). Similar to the case for the tropical systems as a whole (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), the CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect leads to only a small increase in overall N outputs (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7c, d</a>, sold vs. dashed lines). Overall BNF is higher than that in the no-CO
   <sub>2</sub> fertilization scenario (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a, b</a>). This enhances land N storage primarily in intact forests (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7e, f</a>), but does not alter the relative magnitudes of tropical and extratropical N outputs (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7c, d</a>).
