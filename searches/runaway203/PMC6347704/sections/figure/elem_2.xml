  <p>OHC and sea-level trends in the Atlantic Ocean as a function of latitude. Atlantic OHC linear trends calculated over 1955–2017 (ZJ per degree latitude per decade) as a function of latitude for GF (orange) and observational estimates (black) and for different depth ranges: (
   <span class="italic">A</span>) top 700 m, (
   <span class="italic">B</span>) top 2,000 m, (
   <span class="italic">C</span>) 700–2,000 m, and (
   <span class="italic">D</span>) below 2,000 m. The average uncertainty (shading) is calculated using the signal to noise ratio from the different datasets, thereby partially including both the departure of the signal from the linear trend over a decade and the uncertainty in the trends from the different observational products. 
   <span class="italic">E</span> and 
   <span class="italic">F</span> show the difference in sea level (centimeters per degree latitude) estimated using the upper 2,000-m OHC during the periods 1955–1970 and 1971–2016, respectively. The difference is estimated using an average of the first and last 5 y in each period.
