   <sub>2</sub> Emissions from LF, PF, and BF
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study showed that the seasonal variation of CO
   <sub>2</sub> emission fluxes in typical forest LF, PF, and BF in the Daxing’an Mountains were similar, and reached a peak during the growing season (from July to August, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f002">Figure 2</a>a), which is consistent with the results of the Song et al. [
   <a rid="B33-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-16-02999">33</a>] and Li et al. [
   <a rid="B34-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-16-02999">34</a>]. Soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> is mainly derived from autotrophic respiration (mainly vegetation root respiration), heterotrophic respiration (mainly soil microbial respiration), and mineralization decomposition of organic matter. The vegetation in this study area is mostly a shallow root system. During summer, with gradually increasing temperature, the appropriate combination of water and heat in the soil drives root respiration and soil microbial activity, which promotes soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> to reach emission peaks. Previous studies reported that the seasonal change of CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions were dominant controlled by soil temperature [
   <a rid="B32-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-16-02999">32</a>,
   <a rid="B35-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-16-02999">35</a>]. This study found a consistent result, whereby soil temperature was significantly correlated with CO
   <sub>2</sub> fluxes as the dominant environmental variables in affect CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f003">Figure 3</a>a). During the non-growing season, soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> fluxes fluctuated within a lower range. Analysis of the reasons indicated that root respiration and microbial activity were weak due to low temperature. On the other hand, when the soil was frozen, the active nutrient substrate, which can be directly used by microorganisms was reduced [
   <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02999">36</a>], thus resulting in the reduction of soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> fluxes. Two years of observations revealed that the temperature in the study area suddenly decreased due to the influence of low environment temperatures at the end of August each year, and the soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> fluxes of the three forest types decreased. Then, the soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> emission flux value increased, accompanying the increasing temperature back to the normal level of the same period [
   <a rid="B35-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-16-02999">35</a>]. This study found that the soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> fluxes in coniferous forests were higher than that in broad-leaved forests. The PF soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> cumulative fluxes were significantly higher than BF. Analysis of the reason found that the PF soil with high temperature had strong microbial metabolic activity, and the humus layer under the forest decomposed faster, releasing a large amount of CO
   <sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> is widely used to assess the sensitivity of soil or ecosystem respiration to temperature changes [
   <a rid="B37-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-16-02999">37</a>]. The 
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> value of forest soil respiration in China is 1.33~5.53 [
   <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-02999">38</a>]. The LF soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> fluxes (
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> = 5.47) are more sensitive than BF (
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> = 4.06) and PF (
   <span class="italic">Q</span>
   <sub>10</sub> = 3.67) to temperature changes, which is consistent with the research results of Zheng et al. [
   <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-02999">39</a>]. The significant correlation between soil temperature in the study area and soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> fluxes indicates strong positive short-term feedback between climate warming and soil CO
   <sub>2</sub> fluxes.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CH
   <sub>4</sub> is produced by a biogeochemical cycle. It is oxidized by methanotrophs at the soil–water interface or rhizosphere aerobic environment, and the remainder is released into the atmosphere [
   <a rid="B40-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-16-02999">40</a>]. During this process, methanotrophs and methanogens play a key role. Previous studies have shown that soil CH
   <sub>4</sub> as trace gas has both absorption [
   <a rid="B41-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-16-02999">41</a>,
   <a rid="B42-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-16-02999">42</a>] and emission [
   <a rid="B43-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-16-02999">43</a>,
   <a rid="B44-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-16-02999">44</a>,
   <a rid="B45-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-16-02999">45</a>]. Soil hydrothermal conditions directly or indirectly change the community characteristics of anaerobic methanogens and aerobic methanotrophs to affect soil CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes; therefore, the difference in hydrothermal conditions under different ecosystems leads to different soil CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes [
   <a rid="B46-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-16-02999">46</a>]. This study observed that the three types of forest soil CH
   <sub>4</sub> showed overall absorption. Soil CH
   <sub>4</sub> emission, with maximum emission fluxes, only occurred in winter (January or February), and the other seasons showed absorption with the maximum absorption fluxes appearing in June (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f002">Figure 2</a>b). After the soil was completely frozen in winter, the soil formed a better anaerobic environment, which was beneficial for the metabolic activity of methanogens and promoted the release of CH
   <sub>4</sub>. At the beginning of the growing season, the thickness of the permafrost active layer further increases with increasing temperature, which provides a large place for the survival of the methanotrophs [
   <a rid="B47-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-16-02999">47</a>]. The release of C and N from the frozen microorganisms that were killed in winter provides an important matrix for methanotrophs to accelerate the oxidative absorption of CH
   <sub>4</sub> [
   <a rid="B48-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-16-02999">48</a>]. At the same time, the soil has a short drought period before the rainy season, which is conducive for the spread of atmospheric CH
   <sub>4</sub> and O
   <sub>2</sub> to the soil and increase the absorption of CH
   <sub>4</sub> [
   <a rid="B49-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-16-02999">49</a>]. During summer, the soil moisture increases due to precipitation, and the soil CH
   <sub>4</sub> absorption decreases. The study also found that soil temperature and moisture were significantly related to soil CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f003">Figure 3</a>b,e). Soil CH
   <sub>4</sub> average annual absorption flux of three forest types showed BF &gt; PF &gt; LF, and the soil CH
   <sub>4</sub> absorption fluxes in the broad-leaved forest were higher than in the coniferous forest, which was consistent with the results of Steudler et al. [
   <a rid="B50-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-16-02999">50</a>]. The reason for this could be that LF and PF are loamy soils, which are tight and have poor aeration, while the soil bulk density of BF is relatively small, and the gravel content is high. The BF loose soil is conducive to oxygen transport, which enhances the activity of methane oxidase and methane oxidizing microorganisms in soil, which improves the absorption capacity of CH
   <sub>4</sub> in BF soil.

   <sub>2</sub>O Emissions from LF, PF, and BF
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil nitrification and denitrification are two important links in the nitrogen cycle of ecosystems and form an important source of atmospheric N
   <sub>2</sub>O. The monitoring results showed that N
   <sub>2</sub>O fluxes of the three forest types were all sources of emissions. In June (during the growing season), soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O fluxes showed peak emission periods. Thomas et al. [
   <a rid="B51-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-16-02999">51</a>] also reached a similar conclusion. The main reason may be that the outer surface of the soil particles is covered by an ice layer and the inner layer is wrapped with a tightly bound liquid water film, which forms a better anaerobic environment and remains high active nutrients after the soil completely frozen in winter [
   <a rid="B52-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-16-02999">52</a>]. The anaerobic environment provides a good place for denitrification to produce N
   <sub>2</sub>O, which is sequestered by the frozen soil [
   <a rid="B53-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-16-02999">53</a>]. The N
   <sub>2</sub>O enclosed in the soil is burst out into the atmosphere after thawing. In summer, plants grow vigorously and absorb a large amount of nitrogen. Competition between vegetation and microbes causes soil microbes to utilize substrate reduction, and frequent rainfall during the summer causes the shallow soil to alternate between wet and dry conditions, all of which affects the soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emission rate [
   <a rid="B54-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-16-02999">54</a>]. Permafrost soils, which are characterized by cold temperatures, have low net N mineralization rates and availability of mineral nitrogen [
   <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02999">36</a>]. Consequently, the available nitrogen in the soil (predominantly ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen) is poor in the forests of northern China [
   <a rid="B55-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-16-02999">55</a>]. This study found that PF soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O fluxes were higher than LF and BF. The available nitrogen (NH
   <sub>4</sub>
   <span class="sup">+</span>-N and NO
   <sub>3</sub>
   <span class="sup">−</span>-N) contents of different forest types showed that BF was significantly higher than both PF and LF (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05), and the NH
   <sub>4</sub>
   <span class="sup">+</span>-N content was significantly higher than the NO
   <sub>3</sub>
   <span class="sup">−</span>-N content (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0. 05) (
   <a rid="ijerph-16-02999-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02999-t001">Table 1</a>). Therefore, denitrification may be the main source of soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O fluxes in this region. However, BF soil pH was significantly lower than LF and PF (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) (
   <a rid="ijerph-16-02999-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02999-t001">Table 1</a>). According to Struwe et al. [
   <a rid="B56-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijerph-16-02999">56</a>], the optimal pH range for denitrification in soil is between 6 and 8. Soil denitrification is inhibited under acidic conditions and the rate of denitrification decreases with increasing soil acidity. Therefore, the N
   <sub>2</sub>O emission rate of LF was lower than that of PF and BF. Our study found that the temperature sensitivity of N
   <sub>2</sub>O in LF, PF, and BF were 2.23, 1.82, and 1.49, respectively, and LF soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O responded most to temperature rise. However, the difference of N
   <sub>2</sub>O fluxes between the three forest types were not significant, and the forest type was not the main factor affecting soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O fluxes.
