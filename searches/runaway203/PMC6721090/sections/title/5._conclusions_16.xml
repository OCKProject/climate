   <p>The typical forest soil of the Daxing’an Mountains permafrost region was a “source” of CO
    <sub>2</sub> and N
    <sub>2</sub>O and a “sink” of CH
    <sub>4</sub>. The three greenhouse gas fluxes showed strong temporal variety, while the fluxes varied depending on the different sites. The PF soil CO
    <sub>2</sub> fluxes were significantly higher than BF. At the same time, the soil absorption fluxes of CH
    <sub>4</sub> in BF were significantly higher than that in LF.

   <p>Soil temperature and moisture were key environmental factors that correlated the CO
    <sub>2</sub> and CH
    <sub>4</sub> fluxes of different forest types in this high-latitude permafrost region. 
    <span class="italic">Q</span>
    <sub>10</sub> values showed that LF soil greenhouse gas fluxes were more sensitive to temperature. The N
    <sub>2</sub>O fluxes were mainly correlated by the soil nitrogen content.

   <p>Against the background of climate warming, the CO
    <sub>2</sub> and N
    <sub>2</sub>O emission rates of the three forest types increased with increasing temperature, and the CH
    <sub>4</sub> absorption rate decreased, thus enhancing the atmospheric greenhouse effect. On a 100-year time scale, the greenhouse gas GWP of the three forest soil systems in the Daxing’an Mountains permafrost region was positive, which had positive feedback on global warming.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Daxing’an Mountains permafrost region is extremely sensitive to climate change. The CO
  <sub>2</sub>, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, and N
  <sub>2</sub>O fluxes in the study area had significant emission potential. Temperature alteration leads to complex changes in hydrothermal conditions that either directly or indirectly affect forest ecosystems in the cold region, which transforms ground-gas exchange ratios to affect greenhouse gas fluxes. In the future, stable isotope tracing and microbial high-throughput sequencing technologies will be comprehensively used to analyze the mechanism of soil greenhouse gas accumulation, conversion, and transmission in permafrost region.
