  <sub>4</sub> Fluxes across LF, PF, and BF

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the test, the three types of forest soil all showed CH
  <sub>4</sub> absorption fluxes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f002">Figure 2</a>b), with apparent seasonal fluctuations. The soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes had similar temporal variation in LF, PF, and BF, which showed increasing fluctuation from June to January of the following year, followed by a gradual decreased until June. The soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes ranged from −57.71 ± 4.65 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> to 32.51 ± 13.03 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. During the growing season, all three types of forest soil absorbed CH
  <sub>4</sub>; however, positive CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes were found in winter. The highest absorption for CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes from LF and PF were observed in June (−47.76 ± 3.9 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, −52.18 ± 8.36 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), while it was August for BF (−57.71 ± 4.65 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The peak fluxes from PF and BF occurred in February (20.43 ± 8.15 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 23.46 ± 6.35 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), and in January for LF (32.51 ± 13.03 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The average annual flux of CH
  <sub>4</sub> in LF, PF, and BF were −19.33 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, −24.59 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and−30.46 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively. The soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> absorption fluxes in broad-leaved forest were higher than in coniferous forest, and BF soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> cumulative absorption fluxes were significantly higher than LF (
