  <sub>2</sub> Fluxes across LF, PF, and BF
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temporal variations of soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes in the three forest types in the permafrost region of Daxing’an Mountains were basically exactly the same (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f002">Figure 2</a>a). The whole monitoring period was characterized by emissions with significant seasonal variations. The soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes ranged from 7.92 ± 1.30 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> to 650.93 ± 28.12 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and both were unimodal during the two monitoring periods. The majority of emissions were concentrated during the growing season (average fluxes 341.92 ± 202.41 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), while emissions were relatively low during the non-growing season (average flux 57.92 ± 29.13 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). PF soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions reached a maximum in July (650.93 ± 28.12 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), and LF and BF reached the maximum emissions in August (629.8 ± 33.91 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 536.27 ± 22.36 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively). PF, LF, and BF reached minimum fluxes of 7.92 ± 1.3 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (February), 10.27 ± 3.92 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (February), and 15.63 ± 2.31 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (March), respectively. The average annual flux of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in three forest types followed PF (291.76 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) &gt; LF (273.84 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) &gt; BF (243.29 mg·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes in coniferous forest were higher than in broad-leaved forest, and PF soil CO
  <sub>2</sub> cumulative fluxes were significantly higher than BF (
