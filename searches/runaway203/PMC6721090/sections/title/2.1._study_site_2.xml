 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study site was situated in the experimental area of the Mohe Forest Ecosystem National Positioning Observation and Research Station in Heilongjiang province (53°17′~53°30′ N, 122°06′~122°27′ E) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f001" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f001">Figure 1</a>). The experimental area is located in the permafrost area of the Daxing’an Mountains, with low hills at an average elevation of 300~500 m. It is controlled by a cold temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of −3.3 °C and precipitation of 442.95 mm (monitored in 2016 and 2017). In this region, 66.47% of the precipitation is concentrated in summer (from June to August). Furthermore, the soil activity layer freeze-thaw period lasts for about half a year (from mid-April to mid-October), which is slightly longer than the snowpack cover time (from late October to early April). The annual sunshine hours are 2377~2625 h, with an annual total solar radiation of 402~448 kJ cm
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, and ≥10 °C annual accumulated temperature of 1436~2062 °C. The zonal soil of the study site is dark brown forest soil. The vegetation in this area belongs to the southern extension of the Eurasian cold-temperate coniferous forest. The zonal vegetation is dominated species of 
  <span class="italic">Larix gmelinii</span>. Other major species include 
  <span class="italic">Betula platyphylla</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span> var.
  <span class="italic">mongolica</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Populus davidiana</span>, etc. Common plants include 
  <span class="italic">Ledum palustre</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">dilatatum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Rhododendron dauricum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Vaccinium uliginosum</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Vaccinium vitis-idaea</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Pyrola incarnate</span>. Sample selection was based on representative and feasibility principles. After comprehensive investigation, the three most typical forest types in the permafrost region of the Daxing’an Mountains: 
  <span class="italic">Larix gmelinii</span> forest (LF), 
  <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span> var.
  <span class="italic">mongolica</span> forest (PF), 
  <span class="italic">Betula platyphylla</span> forest (BF) were selected. One 100 m × 100 m fixed experimental block with similar site conditions was set in each forest type (LF, PF and BF), and a total of 3 experimental blocks were set. All acronyms such as LF, PF, and BF which applicable for all tables and all figures.
