 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In each quadrat (5 m × 5 m), five soil samples (0–15 cm) were randomly collected by removing the surface layer of the soil, and uniformly mixed into one subsample. Each time, 9 soil subsamples were collected from 3 fixed experimental blocks (100 m × 100 m), and total of 216 soil subsamples were collected during the observation period. The atmospheric pressure (BY-2003P barometer, Xieya Electronics Co., Beijing, China), air temperature (Ta), 10 cm soil temperature (T
  <sub>10</sub>) (Delta TRAK portable thermometer, Delta TRAK, CA, USA) were measured simultaneously with soil sampling. All soil samples were shipped back to the laboratory in ziplock bags for the determination of soil moisture, bulk density (Bd), pH, ammonium nitrogen (NH

  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span>-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total organic carbon (TOC) (

Soil bulk density was determined by the ring-knife method. Soil pH was determined in suspensions composed of 1:5 ratio of air-dried soil and deionized water using a PHSJ-3F pH meter (PHSJ-3F pH, Shanghai, China). Soil NH
