 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CH
  <sub>4</sub> is produced by a biogeochemical cycle. It is oxidized by methanotrophs at the soilâ€“water interface or rhizosphere aerobic environment, and the remainder is released into the atmosphere [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-16-02999">40</a>]. During this process, methanotrophs and methanogens play a key role. Previous studies have shown that soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> as trace gas has both absorption [
  <a rid="B41-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-16-02999">41</a>,
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-16-02999">42</a>] and emission [
  <a rid="B43-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-16-02999">43</a>,
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-16-02999">44</a>,
  <a rid="B45-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-16-02999">45</a>]. Soil hydrothermal conditions directly or indirectly change the community characteristics of anaerobic methanogens and aerobic methanotrophs to affect soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes; therefore, the difference in hydrothermal conditions under different ecosystems leads to different soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-16-02999">46</a>]. This study observed that the three types of forest soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> showed overall absorption. Soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission, with maximum emission fluxes, only occurred in winter (January or February), and the other seasons showed absorption with the maximum absorption fluxes appearing in June (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f002">Figure 2</a>b). After the soil was completely frozen in winter, the soil formed a better anaerobic environment, which was beneficial for the metabolic activity of methanogens and promoted the release of CH
  <sub>4</sub>. At the beginning of the growing season, the thickness of the permafrost active layer further increases with increasing temperature, which provides a large place for the survival of the methanotrophs [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-16-02999">47</a>]. The release of C and N from the frozen microorganisms that were killed in winter provides an important matrix for methanotrophs to accelerate the oxidative absorption of CH
  <sub>4</sub> [
  <a rid="B48-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-16-02999">48</a>]. At the same time, the soil has a short drought period before the rainy season, which is conducive for the spread of atmospheric CH
  <sub>4</sub> and O
  <sub>2</sub> to the soil and increase the absorption of CH
  <sub>4</sub> [
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-16-02999">49</a>]. During summer, the soil moisture increases due to precipitation, and the soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> absorption decreases. The study also found that soil temperature and moisture were significantly related to soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f003">Figure 3</a>b,e). Soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> average annual absorption flux of three forest types showed BF &gt; PF &gt; LF, and the soil CH
  <sub>4</sub> absorption fluxes in the broad-leaved forest were higher than in the coniferous forest, which was consistent with the results of Steudler et al. [
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-16-02999">50</a>]. The reason for this could be that LF and PF are loamy soils, which are tight and have poor aeration, while the soil bulk density of BF is relatively small, and the gravel content is high. The BF loose soil is conducive to oxygen transport, which enhances the activity of methane oxidase and methane oxidizing microorganisms in soil, which improves the absorption capacity of CH
  <sub>4</sub> in BF soil.
