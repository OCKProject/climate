  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study site was situated in the experimental area of the Mohe Forest Ecosystem National Positioning Observation and Research Station in Heilongjiang province (53°17′~53°30′ N, 122°06′~122°27′ E) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f001" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f001">Figure 1</a>). The experimental area is located in the permafrost area of the Daxing’an Mountains, with low hills at an average elevation of 300~500 m. It is controlled by a cold temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of −3.3 °C and precipitation of 442.95 mm (monitored in 2016 and 2017). In this region, 66.47% of the precipitation is concentrated in summer (from June to August). Furthermore, the soil activity layer freeze-thaw period lasts for about half a year (from mid-April to mid-October), which is slightly longer than the snowpack cover time (from late October to early April). The annual sunshine hours are 2377~2625 h, with an annual total solar radiation of 402~448 kJ cm
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, and ≥10 °C annual accumulated temperature of 1436~2062 °C. The zonal soil of the study site is dark brown forest soil. The vegetation in this area belongs to the southern extension of the Eurasian cold-temperate coniferous forest. The zonal vegetation is dominated species of 
   <span class="italic">Larix gmelinii</span>. Other major species include 
   <span class="italic">Betula platyphylla</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span> var.
   <span class="italic">mongolica</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Populus davidiana</span>, etc. Common plants include 
   <span class="italic">Ledum palustre</span> var. 
   <span class="italic">dilatatum</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Rhododendron dauricum</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Vaccinium uliginosum</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Vaccinium vitis-idaea</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Pyrola incarnate</span>. Sample selection was based on representative and feasibility principles. After comprehensive investigation, the three most typical forest types in the permafrost region of the Daxing’an Mountains: 
   <span class="italic">Larix gmelinii</span> forest (LF), 
   <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span> var.
   <span class="italic">mongolica</span> forest (PF), 
   <span class="italic">Betula platyphylla</span> forest (BF) were selected. One 100 m × 100 m fixed experimental block with similar site conditions was set in each forest type (LF, PF and BF), and a total of 3 experimental blocks were set. All acronyms such as LF, PF, and BF which applicable for all tables and all figures.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three 5 m × 5 m quadrats were randomly distributed along the diagonal of each fixed experimental block (100 m × 100 m) in each forest type, but each quadrat was separated by at least 20 m in order to collect greenhouse gas samples. A total of 9 quadrats were set in the three forest types. The static opaque chamber and gas chromatography method were adopted to monitor soil CO
   <sub>2</sub>, CH
   <sub>4</sub>, and N
   <sub>2</sub>O gas fluxes in situ. The static chamber was mainly composed of the chamber and a stainless-steel base. Before sampling, the stainless-steel base with the water groove was buried in the quadrat one week in advance, and was kept fixed during the whole monitoring period to reduce interference by the surrounding environment. The outside of the chamber was affixed with insulation material to decrease the temperature disturbance by the environment inside the box. Three holes were reserved at the top of the chamber to connect the fan power cable, the thermometer probe, and the sampling port, respectively. A 12-V battery-powered fan was installed in the chamber to evenly mix the gas.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In sunny weather, gas samples were collected during mid-morning (9:00~11:00 a.m., local time), which was used to represent one day of average flux [
   <a rid="B25-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-16-02999">25</a>], and once per week during the growing seasons (from May to September in 2016–2017) and once or twice per month during the non-growing seasons (from October 2016 to April 2017 and from October 2017 to April 2018). The aboveground plant inside the stainless-steel base was cut off 1 day before each sampling during the growing season, while natural snow accumulation was not treated during winter greenhouse gas collection. A medical syringe (60 mL), equipped with a three-way stopcock, was used to collect gas 0, 10, 20, and 30 min after the opaque chamber was sealed with water. When the temperature was below 0 °C, we brought our incubator to store water (300 mL of water per static chamber to water seal), and removed ice or water from the stainless-steel base after each experiment to facilitate the next sampling for water sealing. The samples were immediately transferred to a 200 mL gas sampling bag (Delin gas packing co., Dalian, China) and shipped back to the laboratory for analyzing by 7890B Gas Chromatography (7890B GC System, Agilent, CA, USA).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In each quadrat (5 m × 5 m), five soil samples (0–15 cm) were randomly collected by removing the surface layer of the soil, and uniformly mixed into one subsample. Each time, 9 soil subsamples were collected from 3 fixed experimental blocks (100 m × 100 m), and total of 216 soil subsamples were collected during the observation period. The atmospheric pressure (BY-2003P barometer, Xieya Electronics Co., Beijing, China), air temperature (Ta), 10 cm soil temperature (T
   <sub>10</sub>) (Delta TRAK portable thermometer, Delta TRAK, CA, USA) were measured simultaneously with soil sampling. All soil samples were shipped back to the laboratory in ziplock bags for the determination of soil moisture, bulk density (Bd), pH, ammonium nitrogen (NH
