  <sub>2</sub>O Fluxes across LF, PF, and BF
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O fluxes of the three forest types were largely consistent during the monitoring period of 2016~2018 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02999-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02999-f002">Figure 2</a>c). The soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O fluxes ranged from −3.87 ± 1.35 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> to 31.1 ± 2.92 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in LF, PF, and BF. Emissions during the non-growing season were at a relatively low value with a small amount of absorption and concentrated during the growing season. Soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O fluxes showed a bimodal trend during 2016–2017, and a unimodal trend during 2017~2018. The maximum soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O fluxes of LF (22.25 ± 3.66 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and PF (31.1 ± 2.92 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) were recorded in June, and those for BF (24.91 ± 2.8 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) in October. In contrast, the minimum absorption of N
  <sub>2</sub>O fluxes were recorded in January (LF: -3.87 ± 1.35 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, PF: −3.68 ± 0.68 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and March (BF: −2.17 ± 2.13 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), respectively. The average annual flux of N
  <sub>2</sub>O for PF (13.33 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) were higher than LF (11.8 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and BF (11.45 ug·m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>·h
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O fluxes in coniferous forest were higher than in broad-leaved forest.
