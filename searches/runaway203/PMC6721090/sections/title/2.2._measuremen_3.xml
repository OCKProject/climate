  <sub>4</sub> and, N
  <sub>2</sub>O Fluxes in Soil

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three 5 m × 5 m quadrats were randomly distributed along the diagonal of each fixed experimental block (100 m × 100 m) in each forest type, but each quadrat was separated by at least 20 m in order to collect greenhouse gas samples. A total of 9 quadrats were set in the three forest types. The static opaque chamber and gas chromatography method were adopted to monitor soil CO
  <sub>2</sub>, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, and N
  <sub>2</sub>O gas fluxes in situ. The static chamber was mainly composed of the chamber and a stainless-steel base. Before sampling, the stainless-steel base with the water groove was buried in the quadrat one week in advance, and was kept fixed during the whole monitoring period to reduce interference by the surrounding environment. The outside of the chamber was affixed with insulation material to decrease the temperature disturbance by the environment inside the box. Three holes were reserved at the top of the chamber to connect the fan power cable, the thermometer probe, and the sampling port, respectively. A 12-V battery-powered fan was installed in the chamber to evenly mix the gas.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In sunny weather, gas samples were collected during mid-morning (9:00~11:00 a.m., local time), which was used to represent one day of average flux [
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-16-02999" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-16-02999">25</a>], and once per week during the growing seasons (from May to September in 2016–2017) and once or twice per month during the non-growing seasons (from October 2016 to April 2017 and from October 2017 to April 2018). The aboveground plant inside the stainless-steel base was cut off 1 day before each sampling during the growing season, while natural snow accumulation was not treated during winter greenhouse gas collection. A medical syringe (60 mL), equipped with a three-way stopcock, was used to collect gas 0, 10, 20, and 30 min after the opaque chamber was sealed with water. When the temperature was below 0 °C, we brought our incubator to store water (300 mL of water per static chamber to water seal), and removed ice or water from the stainless-steel base after each experiment to facilitate the next sampling for water sealing. The samples were immediately transferred to a 200 mL gas sampling bag (Delin gas packing co., Dalian, China) and shipped back to the laboratory for analyzing by 7890B Gas Chromatography (7890B GC System, Agilent, CA, USA).
