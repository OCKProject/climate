      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Paris Agreement was adopted by 195 countries in December 2015, putting in place
         a legal architecture for international climate action. On 4 November 2016, the agreement
         entered into force. Article 2 of the agreement contains the formulation of the main
         goal: ‘holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above
         pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C
         above pre-industrial levels’. In the context of this long-term temperature goal, Article
         4 sets a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation goal of achieving ‘a balance between anthropogenic
         emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases'. Earlier studies have
         discussed various related concepts such as carbon neutrality, climate neutrality and
         net-zero carbon or net-zero GHG emissions (e.g. [
         <a>1</a>–
         <a>5</a>]). Here, we explore how the GHG balance objective of Article 4 can be interpreted
         from a scientific perspective and analyse the scientific implications of possible
         policy choices. 
         <a>Figure 1</a> gives a selective overview of various elements of Article 4 that may be subject to
         interpretation and which related questions may be raised.
