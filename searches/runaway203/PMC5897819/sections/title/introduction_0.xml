 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Paris Agreement was adopted by 195 countries in December 2015, putting in place a legal architecture for international climate action. On 4 November 2016, the agreement entered into force. Article 2 of the agreement contains the formulation of the main goal: ‘holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’. In the context of this long-term temperature goal, Article 4 sets a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation goal of achieving ‘a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases'. Earlier studies have discussed various related concepts such as carbon neutrality, climate neutrality and net-zero carbon or net-zero GHG emissions (e.g. [
