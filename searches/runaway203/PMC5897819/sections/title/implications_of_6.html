      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are used for calculations of emissions pathways
         consistent with various levels of global warming. Based on information about physical
         properties of individual climate forcers (RF, atmospheric lifetimes), available technologies
         and costs to reduce them, as well as various assumptions about the level of international
         collaboration or the inclusion of specific options (like land-based options), these
         models generate internally consistent emissions pathways per forcing agent [
         <a>25</a>]. The optimal trade-off between emissions of different GHGs is usually calculated
         based on economic considerations—either by directly evaluating the marginal costs
         and marginal benefits (in terms of reaching the temperature goal) of reducing an additional
         unit of emissions for each gas, or by assuming a conversion metric such as the GWP
         for imposing a uniform price on all GHG emissions. Other forcing agents such as ozone
         (other than the aforementioned response to methane) and aerosols are usually not accounted
         for in the economic optimization of climate mitigation measures, and would only adjust
         to climate policy to the extent its anthropogenic sources respond to GHG control (such
         as SO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions being reduced by phasing out of coal-fired power plants) [
         <a>26</a>]. For example, 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>a</span> shows emissions pathways consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C
         in 2100 and to 2°C during the entire twenty-first century, with greater than 50% and
         greater than 66% probability, respectively. Scenarios here have been drawn from the
         IPCC AR5 Scenario Database, which is hosted by the International Institute for Applied
         Systems Analysis (IIASA) and available at 
         <span>https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/AR5DB/</span> [
         <a>27</a>], and from an earlier study on 1.5°C pathways [
         <a>28</a>]. This set of emission scenarios enables us to show the implications of the remaining
         emissions by the end of the century and are used for illustrating the effect of choice
         of metric for the timing of net-zero emissions. Thus, they should not be seen as post-2100
         scenarios. The two interpretations of the temperature targets that were introduced
         above have been chosen because they are commonly used in scientific analyses and policy
         discussions. The 2°C probability refers to peak warming, while the 1.5°C probability
         refers to the year 2100. These interpretations do not represent an assessment of the
         exact meaning of Article 2 of the Paris Agreement.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The individual GHG emission paths (in 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>a</span>) from the IAMs can be aggregated (in 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>b</span>) to ‘CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions’ by the use of an emission metric. A common choice is GWP
         <sub>100</sub> from the IPCC SAR, which was adopted as the standard metric under the Kyoto Protocol.
         For this reason, the IPCC AR5 used SAR GWP
         <sub>100</sub> to aggregate emissions information from IAMs in CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent terms. As can be seen from 
         <a>figure 2</a><span>b</span>, the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emission paths from different models have different temporal developments,
         and therefore cross the zero line at various points in time during the second half
         of the century. The point of reaching net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions varies across both models and metrics.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Figure 2</a><span>c</span> shows the impact of using different metrics (i.e. GWP and GTP, and different time
         horizons) for aggregating the various GHGs to CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions, focusing on how this affects the 
         <span>timing</span> of net-zero emission for our interpretation of 1.5°C (
         <a>figure 2</a><span>c</span>(i)) and 2°C (
         <a>figure 2</a><span>c</span>(ii)) scenarios (see electronic supplementary material, table S1 for an overview of
         metric values).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a>Figure 2</a><span>b,c</span> shows that choosing a different metric for the aggregation of various GHGs changes
         their relative contributions and therewith the 
         <span>perceived</span> timing of when net-zero GHG emissions are achieved. Policymakers based the text of
         the Paris Agreement on information that was available to them at the time of drafting.
         This information, like the IPCC AR5 or the UNEP Emissions Gap Reports, showed CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions pathways aggregated with the GWP
         <sub>100</sub> metric, in most cases with values from SAR or AR4. Changing the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalence metric from GWP
         <sub>100</sub> to any other metric while still keeping the same timing of achieving net-zero GHG
         emissions could hence potentially introduce an internal inconsistency between paragraph
         17 of the Decision associated with the agreement and Article 4 of the agreement itself.
         It may also be argued that it could introduce inconsistency between Articles 2 and
         4—depending on the interpretation of the long-term temperature goal. Any change in
         the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalence metric should thus be considered in conjunction with the additional information
         and context provided in these Articles.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As stated in the Paris Agreement, the time of net-zero emissions for CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions (based on GWP
         <sub>100</sub> from SAR) is in the second half of the century for the two warming targets. For the
         1.5°C and 2°C cases, updating the CO
         <sub>2</sub> equivalents from SAR to AR4 or AR5 will only shift the timing by a few years. However,
         for the 2°C median case (not shown) such an update would move the timing of reaching
         net-zero emissions beyond 2100.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarize, when GWP
         <sub>100</sub> is used to calculate CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions from existing pathways, the net-zero timing is not very sensitive
         to updates from SAR to AR4 or AR5 values. Using GTP
         <sub>100</sub> will shift the net-zero timing to earlier periods, due to less weight given to CH
         <sub>4</sub>. The use of a 20-year time horizon for GWP or GTP would give a net-zero timing after
         2100. As residual emissions of CH
         <sub>4</sub> persist in all pathways, higher metric values for CH
         <sub>4</sub> require larger net negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions to establish net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions, which happens at a later point in time or may not happen at
         all in these illustrative scenarios. Correspondingly, a low metric value for CH
         <sub>4</sub> (such as GTP
         <sub>100</sub>) will lead to early net-zero value of the two gases.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The earlier introduced CO
         <sub>2</sub>-fe emissions could also be considered as an indicator of balance. 
         <a>Figure 3</a> shows time series of annual CO
         <sub>2</sub>-fe emissions and global temperatures for scenarios in the IPCC AR5 Scenario Database,
         with colours representing the two most ambitious categories for mitigation, as defined
         in [
         <a>27</a>]. (Scenarios that treat sulfate and GHGs in an inconsistent manner have been excluded.)
         The total anthropogenic RF from each scenario has been used to calculate a CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration that equates to that RF [
         <a>29</a>]. The FAIR model [
         <a>29</a>] is used to calculate the time profile of CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions required to produce the time profile of CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations, leading to the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-fe emissions shown in 
         <a>figure 3</a><span>a</span>. The most ambitious mitigation scenarios (category 1 and 2, light and dark blue)
         reach net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-fe emissions around 2070 at the earliest, with some not crossing that threshold until
         after 2100. (Category 1 scenarios have CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent concentrations of 430–480 ppm, and category 2 scenarios have 480–530 ppm.)
         This illustrates the importance of using consistent metrics when considering balance
         and its timing.
