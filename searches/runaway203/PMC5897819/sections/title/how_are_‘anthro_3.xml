 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How are ‘anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks' defined?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The definition of 
  <span class="italic">anthropogenic emissions</span> of GHGs is relatively intuitive and reporting guidelines exist in the UNFCCC for emissions related to domestic, industrial, agricultural and forestry activities. The definition of 
  <span class="italic">anthropogenic removals</span> is more subject to debate, and previous interpretations and definitions have to be reassessed in the light of the Paris Agreement, new emerging technologies and the body of scientific literature on CDR or ‘negative emissions’ (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C14">14</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides Reporting Guidelines for GHG emissions and removals in the context of the UNFCCC [
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C15">15</a>]. From these guidelines, it is clear that anthropogenic removals refer to the removal of CO
  <sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere by a sink due to human activities. Currently, this is particularly the case in the land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector. The UNFCCC already offers the possibility for emissions inventories to include CO
  <sub>2</sub> removal associated with carbon sequestration from afforestation, agricultural practices and, more generally, the management of terrestrial ecosystems, and a number of Annex 1 countries routinely report carbon forest sinks. These reported sinks are not fully anthropogenic in that indirect effects (e.g. due to fertilization by atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> and/or nitrogen deposition) and natural effects on managed land are also included. The exact definition of land-use emissions is a challenge, and may vary between land-use modelling and integrated assessment models (IAMs) on the one hand, and estimates from UNFCCC accounting rules on the other. There is also no sophisticated treatment of land-use management in the current generation of Earth system models yet. As a result, so-called permissible CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions associated with a given concentration or temperature pathway may not be directly comparable to the net global CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions as per UNFCCC reporting rules when there is a significant contribution from CO
  <sub>2</sub> removals by ecosystems [
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C16">16</a>]. Finally, natural sinks can persist up to several decades after CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations have peaked in 1.5°C or 2°C mitigation pathways [
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C17">17</a>] due to the fact that the carbon cycle is currently out of equilibrium.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prospect of novel CDR techniques can raise new and different sets of questions. CDR technologies can be broadly grouped according to where they store the atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub>. Besides the terrestrial CDR measures in the LULUCF sector, there exist geological CDR techniques like bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air capture and storage, and enhanced weathering, as well as ocean-based CDR measures like ocean alkalinization and ocean iron fertilization. Geological CDR sequesters the CO
  <sub>2</sub> in geological formations or mineralizes it. BECCS, in particular, has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. Owing to its reliance on bioenergy, it can impact anthropogenic emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector that require robust reporting. However, its CDR component, the sequestration of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in geological formations, occurs in the energy sector and would need to be accounted for in terms of how much of the biomass carbon is transferred to geological storage (avoiding double counting with LULUCF fluxes). Ocean-based CDR measures would raise a host of additional questions concerning the governance of international waters, including the London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution, and the reporting of territorial emissions. And when a natural sink like the oceans or the terrestrial biosphere is enhanced by some anthropogenic action or by climate change itself, it may be a matter of interpretation how much of it should be considered anthropogenic.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite this complexity, there are some basic properties of the carbon cycle that allow assessment of the permanence of different storage options. Carbon is exchanged between atmospheric, oceanic and biospheric reservoirs, such that, for example, the rate of increase in atmospheric load is only about half present-day net CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. Uptake of the remainder by the terrestrial biosphere and oceans is often referred to as a ‘natural sink’, but it represents a redistribution of carbon between finite-capacity reservoirs, not permanent removal. The additional carbon taken up by the oceans and biosphere may continue to play a role in the climate system even though it is not present in the atmosphere because, for example, it would partially be released again if atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels were to be artificially drawn down by CDR. Thus, the time scales and reversibility associated with enhanced CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake by terrestrial and ocean-based CDR measures are critical.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By contrast, natural geological processes that remove carbon from the active carbon cycle and resequester it into the lithosphere are so slow relative to anthropogenic sources and sinks that such removals, although permanent, can be largely ignored on multi-century time scales. Hence, in a strict sense, only sequestration of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in geological formations with negligible leakage or enhanced weathering and artificial remineralization techniques represent permanent sinks to balance the extraction of fossil carbon.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, an important issue is the 
  <span class="italic">permanence</span> of the CO
  <sub>2</sub> removal process under consideration. This applies to both industrial and ecosystem-based CO
  <sub>2</sub> removal processes [
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C18">18</a>]. Carbon sequestered in soils and ecosystems may return to the atmosphere as CO
  <sub>2</sub> on time scales of years to decades in the case of a change in agricultural practices or timber harvest. Forest fires are another example by which a ‘natural’ process may cancel the effect of land management practices favouring carbon sequestration. It can be argued that uptake of CO
  <sub>2</sub> by the biosphere might only count as a ‘removal’ in the context of Article 4 if it could be guaranteed that the relevant CO
  <sub>2</sub> will not be re-released into the atmosphere over time scales of centuries; or alternatively, if emissions inventories would also confidently include potential re-release of carbon from such temporary reservoirs and count it towards anthropogenic emissions. In the case of carbon capture and storage or BECCS, a fraction of the carbon sequestered in geological reservoirs may also leak back to the atmosphere as CO
  <sub>2</sub>. As a result, 1 kg of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emitted at a given time may not be equivalent to 1 kg of CO
  <sub>2</sub> removed at the same time. Kim 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C18">18</a>] have shown that CO
  <sub>2</sub> removals through land-based carbon sequestration may have to be discounted by up to 50% to account for the impermanence of the storage or the existence of maintenance costs. While the latter study [
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C18">18</a>] focused on agricultural tillage and forest management practices, the argument holds for other carbon sequestration techniques if there is a risk for carbon leakage or if there are maintenance or monitoring costs. This issue has received little echo so far in policymaking but could be a way to address the issue of permanence of the sinks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) such as methane, the interpretation of ‘removals by sinks’ also requires clarification in the context of the UNFCCC. Approximately 10% of atmospheric methane is oxidized every year, so a steady rate of anthropogenic methane emissions maintains the atmospheric methane load above its natural level by an amount approximately 10 times the annual rate of anthropogenic methane emissions. If anthropogenic emissions were to cease, methane concentrations would revert to a level in balance with natural sources within a few decades. Importantly, however, unlike the uptake of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in oceans and biosphere, the removal of methane through oxidation is permanent and irreversible (but it produces CO
  <sub>2</sub>—which is a net addition to atmospheric burden if the CH
  <sub>4</sub> is of fossil origin).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Enhanced concentration of an atmospheric species generally increases its removal rate. Taking methane as an example, it may be argued that the enhanced rate of oxidation due to anthropogenic elevation of atmospheric CH
  <sub>4</sub> concentrations constitutes an ‘anthropogenic removal’. Under these assumptions, a constant rate of anthropogenic emissions that stabilizes atmospheric methane concentrations may be considered as achieving a ‘balance’ between anthropogenic sources and anthropogenic sinks. On the one hand, oxidation is a natural process whose rate has been increased by the anthropogenic elevation of atmospheric CH
  <sub>4</sub> concentrations; on the other hand, this additional methane oxidation would not be happening in the absence of human influence on climate, because the additional methane would not be there. This can be seen in the light of the IPCC emission reporting guidelines, which only consider emissions removals if they occur on 
  <span class="italic">managed</span> land. Despite methane being included in emissions inventories since the very beginning, in no instance do IPCC guidelines suggest that atmospheric oxidation processes would be counted towards anthropogenic removals.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Active direct anthropogenic removals of non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> gases such as CH
  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O are in principle possible [
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C19">19</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C20">20</a>] but are much more speculative. In the case of catalytic destruction of these gases, there is no issue of permanence of the removal, but the climate effects of by-products have to be accounted for before setting an equivalence between emissions and removals.
