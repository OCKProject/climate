      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The word ‘balance’ alludes to an equilibrium concept where, for example, flows of
         GHGs into and out of the atmosphere are balanced to minimize further anthropogenic
         perturbation of the climate system. Because there are several anthropogenic GHGs,
         which are subject to both anthropogenic influences and natural variability, a question
         that follows is what type of balance or equilibrium is aimed at. We here describe
         several possible ‘balance’ interpretations in terms of particular climatic quantities,
         with varying degree of consistency with the text of the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC
         [
         <a>6</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main goal of the Paris Agreement is formulated in terms of change in the 
         <span>global mean temperature</span> relative to pre-industrial levels. This indicator can, therefore, guide the interpretation
         of reaching a balance between sources and sinks. The balanced 
         <span>net</span> emissions (i.e. the difference between emissions and removals) could thus in one
         interpretation correspond to those GHG emissions that 
         <span>stabilize the global mean temperature</span> at some given level (within natural climate variability). Note, however, that the
         Paris Agreement makes no reference to whether the global mean temperature is to be
         stabilized at some level above pre-industrial levels or whether it has to peak and
         thereafter decline again. As the Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal does
         not put an end date on the target to ‘pursuing’ limiting global temperature rise to
         1.5°C, a trajectory of the global temperature peaking and declining is thus not excluded.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second hypothetical interpretation of ‘balance’ could be evaluated in terms of the
         GHG emissions that stabilize radiative forcing (RF) at some level. These two interpretations
         differ because the climate system is currently out of radiative balance, but become
         equivalent once climate equilibrium is reached.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third, and related, definition of balance could be the point at which ‘CO
         <sub>2</sub>-forcing-equivalent’ [
         <a>7</a>] emissions reach zero, where ‘CO
         <sub>2</sub>-forcing-equivalent’ is defined as the CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions that give the same total and rate of change of RF for all components combined
         as CO
         <sub>2</sub> alone. Net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-forcing-equivalent (CO
         <sub>2</sub>-fe) emissions lead to a gradually declining RF, just as RF declines slowly after
         anthropogenic emissions reach zero in the case in which CO
         <sub>2</sub> is the only radiatively active agent. As CO
         <sub>2</sub>-fe emissions behave, by construction, exactly like CO
         <sub>2</sub>, it follows that the well-known result that net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions correspond to zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-induced warming [
         <a>8</a>] also applies. Hence, sustained net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-fe emissions represent a better predictor of global temperature stabilization than
         stable atmospheric composition or RF (see the second interpretation, above), which
         is associated with a substantial residual long-term warming commitment.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A fourth interpretation, which will be explored in later sections, is that the ‘balance’
         can be interpreted in terms of net-zero 
         <span>CO
            <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions
            </span>. This requires a decision on how to calculate CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions by weighting different GHGs. In particular, the meaning of net-zero
         GHG emissions varies with the chosen emission metric, and so does the climate effect
         of maintaining this ‘balance’ over time.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Paris Agreement text is not explicit about whether the balance between sources
         and sinks is mandated at a global or national level. From a climate system perspective,
         the global level matters most. However, there are significant differences in anticipated
         residual (i.e. costly and hard to abate) emissions across countries; some countries
         have high emissions from agriculture, heavy industry, etc., that may be costly or
         difficult to bring to zero. Furthermore, emissions from international aviation and
         maritime transport are currently not attributed to individual countries. There are
         also differences in the potentials for net negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions across countries due to differences in forest volume and characteristics,
         biofuels and carbon-free renewables, sequestration capacity, etc. Thus, even in an
         ambitious low-emission world, the achievement of balance at the national level will
         be differentiated and diverse in space and time. To achieve net-zero emissions at
         a global level, mechanisms will be needed for strong international coordination. Various
         mechanisms (e.g. emission trading) could be elements of an international regime that
         aims to obtain balance at a global scale.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several unresolved scientific and political issues remain related to active carbon
         dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere (e.g. [
         <a>9</a>]) and many of these also apply to the context of GHG balance, such as who should
         pay for the implementation and maintenance of CDR measures that are needed to balance
         emissions from various activities within a country or across countries? Several questions
         related to responsibilities and coordination need to be considered from various perspectives
         and disciplines [
         <a>10</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solar radiation management (SRM) by injecting sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere
         has also been suggested as a measure to limit warming (e.g. [
         <a>11</a>–
         <a>13</a>]). However, such a response strategy is not covered by the text of the Paris Agreement
         and can be excluded from considerations of a GHG balance.
