 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Achieving a ‘balance’ in GHG emissions implies that any difficult-to-abate emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub> and non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> gases, expressed in CO
  <sub>2</sub> equivalence through a metric of choice, need to be compensated by negative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. The choice of metric type and time horizon for calculation of CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions will affect the magnitude of net negative emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub> needed to produce net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160445F4" href="#RSTA20160445F4">Figure 4</a> uses N
  <sub>2</sub>O and CH
  <sub>4</sub> as representative long-lived and short-lived non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> gases to demonstrate the effect of metric type and time horizon on the required amount of net negative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions needed to achieve a net-zero balance in terms of CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions. GTP
  <sub>100</sub> gives substantially lower weight to methane emissions than under GWP
  <sub>100</sub>, and consequentially smaller amounts of net negative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions are needed than when considering GWP
  <sub>100</sub>. In general, metric choice affects the amount of negative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions needed to balance residual CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions much more than for residual N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions. This is due to the fact that N
  <sub>2</sub>O, like CO
  <sub>2</sub>, is long-lived, so it can be compared against CO
  <sub>2</sub> in a much more like-for-like fashion leading to relatively little variation in values between the different metrics.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the physical consequences of net-zero balance will depend on the choice of metric, it is important to evaluate to what extent differing metrics correspond to differing physical consequences under maintained net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions, for example, its global temperature consequences. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160445F5" href="#RSTA20160445F5">Figure 5</a> shows the evolution of global temperature relative to 2100 under the maintenance of net-zero emissions between CH

  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions under the range of metrics considered for these highly idealized cases. To assess the global mean temperature response to this balance, we use a simple impulse–response climate model (FAIR) which is calibrated to capture the dependence of the climate response to pulse emissions on the background climate state [

  <sub>4</sub>. The higher the metric value for methane, from 4 for GTP

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the climate response to RF is not instantaneous, the temperature responses shown in

  <span class="italic">a</span> are also affected by the forcings from previous emissions, and therefore the post-2100 evolution of warming shown in

  <span class="italic">b,</span> we use an emissions background of maintained 2100 values of emissions and other forcings in the RCP2.6 scenario and add an additional perturbation of the maintained net-zero balances between 2100 residual CH
  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions (from the individual 430–480 ppm scenarios), and negative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions according to different metrics, from 2100 onwards. The temperature outcome is then differenced from the standard RCP2.6 case to isolate the effect of the perturbation. In this isolated and idealized case for illustration, the near-term warming of CH
  <sub>4</sub> is clearly seen, with warming initially rising under metrics that give a low weight to methane. Conversely, as the GWP* metric balances the sustained CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions with a single pulse removal of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in the first year, the cooling effect from this pulse removal is the dominant near-term signal with the net temperature returning towards zero.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Which perspective to use—including effects of previous emissions or the isolated effects of the balanced remaining emissions—is one of the questions that need to be answered to obtain a clear and operational definition of GHG balance.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the Paris Agreement aims to limit peak warming and it also provides a broad timing for achieving the Article 4 ‘balance’, it is of interest to understand how the timing of achieving net-zero emissions relates to timing of the peak in global mean temperature increase, and how different metrics affect this relationship. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160445F6" href="#RSTA20160445F6">Figure 6</a> shows the timing of net-zero emissions versus the timing of peak warming in the scenarios available in the IPCC AR5 Scenario Database. For a hypothetical case in which only CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions occur, we would expect peak warming to occur very rapidly after the achievement of net-zero emissions [
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C32">32</a>]. As the CO
  <sub>2</sub>-forcing equivalent (grey), by construction, achieves a perfect equivalence between other GHGs and CO
  <sub>2</sub> in terms of their effect on global temperature, CO
  <sub>2</sub>-fe shows the closest relationship between the timing of net-zero emissions and the timing of peak warming in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160445F6" href="#RSTA20160445F6">figure 6</a>. For the other metrics shown, GWP* (brown) best captures the link between the date of peak warming and the date of net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub>-forcing equivalent emissions, with other metrics typically reaching net-zero emissions after peak warming has occurred. (The net-zero timing is calculated using CO
  <sub>2</sub>, CH
  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O only, so the scatter is also in part associated with the profiles of other forcing agents.) GWP
  <sub>100</sub> results in a delay of about 20 years between the timing of peak warming and the timing of net-zero emissions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative approach to interpret and define balance would be to counterbalance only the long-lived non-CO
  <sub>2</sub> GHGs while keeping the emissions of short-lived components constant, as near-stabilized emissions of these components (e.g. CH
  <sub>4</sub>) would only contribute to small temperature changes after this point (this is, in effect, what net-zero emissions measured by GWP* means). We find that both GWP and GTP applied for CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions of N
  <sub>2</sub>O will give good compensation of the temperature effect and that the variance of the N
  <sub>2</sub>O-induced warming between metric choices is small (electronic supplementary material, figure S1a and S1b). Note that despite being denoted as zero CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emission based on GWP*, a constant and ongoing high level of SLCF emissions may still represent a significant contribution to warming and a mitigation opportunity.
