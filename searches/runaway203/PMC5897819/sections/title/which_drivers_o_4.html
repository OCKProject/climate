      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human activities affect climate through emissions of gases, aerosols and changes in
         land surface characteristics (e.g. [
         <a>21</a>]) and the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), submitted prior to
         COP21, include a broad set of components beyond well-mixed GHGs. For example, some
         countries included measures to reduce short-lived forcers such as nitrogen oxides
         (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and black carbon (BC) aerosols. However, the words ‘greenhouse
         gases’ in Article 4 exclude aerosols and aerosol precursor gases (e.g. BC and SO
         <sub>2</sub>) from the group of components included in the evaluation of ‘balance’. By convention,
         this phrase also probably implies well-mixed GHGs, excluding tropospheric and stratospheric
         ozone changes. In the case of methane, however, indirect short-lived GHG responses
         are included. That is, the tropospheric ozone chemical response is routinely included
         (via the global warming potential for CH
         <sub>4</sub>), creating a situation where one ozone precursor's impact on climate via tropospheric
         ozone is accounted for, whereas all others are not. Changes in stratospheric ozone
         and water vapour and the climate impacts of these are also generally included for
         methane.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Kyoto Protocol adopted a basket of six gases or groups of gases: CO
         <sub>2</sub>, CH
         <sub>4</sub>, N
         <sub>2</sub>O, SF
         <sub>6</sub>, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—and it may be argued that
         this is the group of gases that could by default be included in the ‘greenhouse gas
         balance’. (Later, NF
         <sub>3</sub> was added to the basket of ‘Kyoto II’.) The GHG chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons
         (HCFCs) are regulated under the Montreal Protocol, and HFCs are now also likely to
         be regulated under the Montreal Protocol through the Kigali Amendment.
