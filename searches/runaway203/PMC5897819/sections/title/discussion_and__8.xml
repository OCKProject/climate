 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Article 4 of the Paris Agreement stipulates that in order to achieve the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, countries aim to achieve a ‘balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks'. Based on available evidence in the UNFCCC process, it seems clear that the word ‘anthropogenic’ applies to both ‘emissions by sources' and ‘removal by sinks’. Issues related to the scope of ‘anthropogenic’ remain, for instance, when natural sinks are indirectly enhanced, weakened or reversed by anthropogenic perturbations. Development and application of robust and transparent reporting methods will be essential, including definitions of system boundaries and clarification of time scales. In particular, the issue of 
  <span class="italic">permanence</span> of the CO
  <sub>2</sub> removal process under consideration is important, and applies to both industrial and ecosystem-based CO
  <sub>2</sub> removals. There is a range of time scales for carbon removals—from short time scales (soil carbon that is later perturbed), over long time scales (soil carbon that is not perturbed for decades, or surface ocean), further to very long time scales (deep ocean, geological storage with leakage), and, finally, almost infinite (geological storage with no leakage, mineralized carbon). It may be argued that if a storage is non-permanent, it has to be discounted and replaced later by another form of storage. Despite its limitation, non-permanent storage could play a role in the near term.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A balance between anthropogenic sinks and sources of GHG emissions can be defined in several ways. From a scientific point of view, these various options translate into a most appropriate choice of metric for weighting emissions. The Paris decision highlights the importance of using common metrics as assessed by the IPCC (cf. paragraph 31 of Decision 1/CP.21). However, more specific guidelines might be developed. As demonstrated, balancing a steady rate of methane and other short-lived emissions with active removal of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, the option of achieving net-zero emissions under conventional emissions reporting procedures (i.e. based on GWP
  <sub>100</sub>) results in a steady decline of global temperatures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clarifying the scope of ‘removals by sinks’ for different GHGs is ultimately a matter for the UNFCCC; our role here is to point out the implications of different interpretations. One option that could be consistent with the context of Article 4 would be to consider a removal to be any anthropogenic activity that results in a permanent (or at least verifiably multi-century) reduction in the concentration of a GHG in the atmosphere. For CO
  <sub>2</sub>, this means active capture and sequestration. For methane, this could mean the permanent enhancement of a natural sink, in this case induced by the methane emissions themselves. Simply actively removing a fixed quantity of methane is of less relevance, because concentrations would recover within a few decades after the removal activity ends, unlike the removal of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, for which the benefits are effectively permanent. These potential interpretations of ‘removals’ point to the need for clarification by policymakers. If deemed appropriate, such interpretation would also point to the use of a metric like GWP* relating rates of emission of SLCFs with cumulative emissions of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in the definition of ‘net-zero emissions’. It is worth noting that a constant and ongoing high level of SLCF emission may still represent an important contribution to warming and a mitigation opportunity even if it is denoted as zero CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emission based on GWP*.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the Paris text requests countries to include all categories of emissions and removals in their nationally determined contributions and GHG inventories. However, the Paris Agreement itself is not specific on which components are included in the balance calculations of CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions. From the Agreement text it is clear that aerosols are not included. Based on current practice under the UNFCCC, it seems reasonable to assume that any balance assessment will be applied to the Kyoto basket of GHGs, although this has yet to be specified. SRM by injection of sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere is clearly excluded from the balance considerations as covered in the Paris Agreement.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a geophysical perspective, the balance between sources and sinks is needed at a global, not national, level. However, there are significant differences across countries in anticipated residual emissions and potentials for negative CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. To achieve net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions and balance at a global level, mechanisms will be needed for strong international coordination. In this context, Article 4 already indicates that emissions reductions and the achievement of a balance between sinks and sources should be carried out ‘on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty’. This results in some key questions, some of which are scientific and some of which are political in nature. For example, understanding synergies and trade-offs of specific mitigation measures with the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals becomes increasingly important and cannot be simply related to global temperature change. At the same time, political and ethical issues related to who should pay for creating and maintaining sinks, or who would be responsible for the sinks’ effectiveness and durability over time, have to be discussed and resolved through a political dialogue.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we have clarified how from a scientific perspective the ‘balance’ referred to in Article 4 of the Paris Agreement may be applied to anthropogenic sources and anthropogenic sinks. We have shown how the timing of nominal ‘net-zero’ CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions depends on choice of metric. Changing from GWP
  <sub>100</sub> to any other metric while still keeping the same timing of achieving net-zero GHG emissions could introduce an inconsistency between paragraph 17 of the Paris decision and Articles 2 and 4 of the Paris Agreement itself. Depending on the interpretation of the long-term temperature goal described in Article 2, some metrics might be better suited to implement the balance of Article 4. In particular, we clarified that the way in which a balance is achieved and maintained influences the anticipated temperature outcome over time. For example, achieving and maintaining net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions calculated with GWP
  <sub>100</sub>—adopted for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and in UNFCCC reporting—would result in a peak and decline in global temperature and a cooling effect, with the rate of cooling dependent on the contribution of SLCFs to the overall CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions. Adopting a different usage of this metric, here denoted by GWP*, would result in global temperatures remaining approximately constant once net-zero CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions are achieved and maintained. Policymakers should be aware of these particularities and determine which metric is most appropriate in the context of the goals of the Paris Agreement.
