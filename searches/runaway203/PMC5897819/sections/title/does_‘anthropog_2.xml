 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determining whether the word ‘anthropogenic’ in Article 4 applies to both emission sources and removals by sinks is essential to quantify the implications of the Paris Agreement's ‘balance’ (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The combined information available in the Paris Agreement indicates that only anthropogenic sources and anthropogenic sinks are to be considered to determine the Agreement's ‘balance’. Article 29 of the Paris Agreement states that the Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish texts of the Agreement are all equally authentic. Both the Spanish and the French versions of the Agreement state explicitly that the required balance applies to anthropogenic emissions and anthropogenic removals

  </span>. Many articles in international agreements are necessarily left open to interpretation, and subtle differences between translations are difficult to avoid. In this case, however, we assume that the more precise wording as spelled out literally in the French and Spanish versions of the Agreement removes most of the ambiguity present in the other language versions regarding the application of ‘anthropogenic’.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional comparison of Article 4 with other documents under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) seems to further support the exclusion of natural sinks. Specifically, the wording of Article 4 is similar to the earlier use of the phrase ‘anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks’ in the original UNFCCC text (Article 4.1(a) in [
  <a rid="RSTA20160445C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20160445C6">6</a>]), which stipulates that Parties shall: ‘Develop, periodically update, publish and make available to the Conference of the Parties, […] national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, using comparable methodologies to be agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties’. The Paris Agreement Article 4 language thus directly mirrors this earlier UNFCCC language, and in order to determine how ‘anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases’ is understood under the UNFCCC, one can hence look at existing reporting rules developed for the UNFCCC national inventories. This understanding is further supported by clarifications in the Paris Agreement. For instance, although the reporting rules for anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals have not yet been decided, the Paris Agreement already stipulates that ‘[i]n the context of their nationally determined contributions, when recognizing and implementing mitigation actions with respect to anthropogenic emissions and removals, Parties should take into account, as appropriate, existing methods and guidance under the Convention’. These various lines of evidence thus suggest that the GHG balance described in the Paris Agreement refers to achieving net-zero anthropogenic GHG emissions [
