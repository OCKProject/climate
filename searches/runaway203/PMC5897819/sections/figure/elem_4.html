            <span>a</span>) Global mean surface temperature response to maintained net-zero balance of CO
            <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions from 2100 for various metrics. Thin lines indicate the range
            of response for the net-zero balances imposed using constant 2100 CH
            <sub>4</sub> and N
            <sub>2</sub>O emissions from the complete set of 430–480 ppm scenarios, while thick lines indicate
            the response for the balance imposed from 2100 for the RCP2.6 scenario. (
            <span>b</span>) Calculations are done as perturbations above an RCP2.6 background of emissions with
            the perturbation implemented from 2100 and onwards. The spread in responses reflects
            the spread in non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions due to scenario and model assumptions.
