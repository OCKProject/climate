         <p>Dependence of negative CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions needed to balance residual emissions of CH
            <sub>4</sub> and N
            <sub>2</sub>O (given as Mt CH
            <sub>4</sub> and Mt N
            <sub>2</sub>O, respectively) on metric choice. For the left-hand panel, the bar height indicates
            the mean of the distribution of CH
            <sub>4</sub> and N
            <sub>2</sub>O emissions in 2100, with the extent of the error bar marking the 5th–95th percentiles
            of the distribution. For the right-hand panel the bar heights indicate the mean net
            negative CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions needed to balance the combinations of 2100 CH
            <sub>4</sub> (orange) and N
            <sub>2</sub>O emissions (brown) present in the scenarios partitioned by metric (
            <span>x</span>-axis). The 5th–95th percentiles of the distribution of the total required net negative
            CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions are marked by the vertical extent of the bars.
