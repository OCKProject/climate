 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess TSC, we employ GCM ensembles, which contain idealized experiments of the evolution of the climate system under prescribed emissions trajectories. Because GCM ensembles include simulations from multiple GCMs, they allow us to quantify uncertainty in future climate change due to internal variability of the climate system and model uncertainty (Deser et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0006">2012</a>; Thompson et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0031">2015</a>). To estimate TSC, certain characteristics are required. First, GCMs must be forced by an emission scenario that results in increasing GHG concentrations until a certain time, followed by constant GHG concentrations. Second, after GHG concentrations are held fixed, GCMs must continue to be run for at least another century, preferably longer, in order for the climate system to adjust to a near‐stable warming rate. And third, there must be a sufficiently large number of ensemble members available in order to robustly define uncertainty in the particular ensemble.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CMIP5 and CMIP3 archives contain three GCM “constant composition commitment” experiments that emulate the stabilization of GHG as described above (Meehl et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0050">2007</a>; Meinshausen et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0023">2011</a>). In the CMIP5 experiment, GCMs are forced by the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) from 2005 to 2150, after which point the GHG composition of the atmosphere is held constant and models are run out to 2300 (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58884-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58884-fig-0001">1</a>b). In the CMIP3 experiments, GCMs are forced by either the SRES B1 or A1B emission scenarios from 2000 to 2100, after which point the GHG composition of the atmosphere is held constant and models are run out to 2300 (Meehl et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0050">2007</a>). For all three emission scenarios considered here, peak GHG concentrations occur at their stabilization values. Of the RCP4.5, A1B, and B1 experiments, we have obtained 10, 11, and 17 GCM simulations, respectively. TSC is estimated from mean annual surface temperature fields from these experiments (section
