  </div>, and 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <span class="italic">ϵ</span>
  </div> exhibit greater magnitudes in the Arctic than in low latitudes. While these regions display similar signal‐to‐noise ratios, the Arctic steadies at a much higher 23rd century warming rate. Low latitudes take a similarly long time to reach steady change but stabilize at a low

   <sub>end</sub>
  </div>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, the NNA and the Southern Ocean exhibit early TSCs and low signal‐to‐noise ratios, but both

   <span class="italic">m</span>
   <sub>end</sub>)
  </div> and 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <span class="italic">ϵ</span>
  </div> are larger in the Southern Ocean than in the NNA. Portions of the NNA and Southern Ocean have such pronounced internal variability that the MMM warming through the entire simulation period is within uncertainty of the 23rd century warming rates. These correspond with regions that have 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <span class="italic">ξ</span>≈
  </div> 1 or less. As expected, the areal extent of such regions is greater in the lowest‐emission scenario considered here, that is, experiment B1 (SI). The early TSCs found in the Southern Ocean and NNA correspond with high 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <span class="italic">m</span>
   <sub>end</sub>/
   <span class="italic">m</span>
   <sub>max</sub>
  </div> ratios (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58884-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58884-fig-0003">3</a>d), that is, the highest 23rd century warming rates relative to maximum warming rates, meaning that models project these regions' long‐term warming rates will be globally the most similar to their 21st century rates. This reflects the delayed warming in the Southern Ocean and NNA, which is understood to be driven by ocean circulation (Marshall et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0020">2015</a>). Previous studies have shown that the Southern Ocean responds as a passive tracer to anthropogenic forcing due to northward ocean heat transport and upwelling of deep ocean water in the region (Armour et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0001">2016</a>), whereas the depressed warming in the NNA has been attributed to the meridional ocean heat flux carrying more heat out of the region than into the region (Marshall et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0020">2015</a>). The ubiquitously large noise terms (i.e., 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <span class="italic">ϵ</span>
  </div>) in high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere may be, in part, a manifestation of the response of the Antarctic Oscillation to this GHG scenario, where northern high latitudes warm faster than southern high latitudes during transient periods followed by a reversal of the trend during stabilization of GHG (Cai et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0004">2003</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial patterns for each variable shown in Figure 
  <a rid="grl58884-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58884-fig-0003">3</a> are consistent with those from the CMIP3 ensembles (SI); however, the A1B scenario produces larger 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <span class="italic">ξ</span>
  </div> and 
  <div class="inline-formula">
   <span class="italic">m</span>
   <sub>end</sub>
  </div> values, globally, reflecting the long‐term persistent effects of a higher emission scenario.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the emission scenarios considered in this analysis, higher emission scenarios coincide with later global TSC values. This could be a result of higher GHG requiring more time to reach an equilibrium warming rate or could be due to the different transition times between peak emissions and constant (or near constant) GHG. For example, a more abrupt change point from increasing to constant forcing could lead to a delayed transition between the fast and slow climate responses following GHG stabilization (Held et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0014">2010</a>). Changes in ocean circulation provide a possible explanation of this transition time between the fast and slow response of warming (Rugenstein et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0026">2016</a>; Stouffer, 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0029">2004</a>). Abrupt increases in forcing lead to faster relative warming of the ocean surface, increasing stability, and temporary weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. This, in turn, leads to temporary increases in Arctic ice formation, which delays the onset of the slow increase in warming. Further experimental analysis would be required to probe the mechanisms leading to the different TSC time scales across emission scenarios.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While studies characterizing the period of steady change have primarily focused on globally averaged temperature change (Gillett et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0010">2011</a>; Meinshausen et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0023">2011</a>; Solomon et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0028">2009</a>) or spatial warming patterns over millennial time scales (Gillett et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0010">2011</a>), here we have introduced the first framework for estimating the timing of transition into this period. Just as in studies of ToE, other definitions are possible and future studies may well probe alternative definitions. While we have focused our analysis on the geographic patterns of TSC as it pertains to annual mean temperature, it is likely that the timing and spatial patterns of TSC would differ for other variables. For instance, TSC for annual rainfall is likely to be determined by large‐scale circulation and changes in horizontal temperature gradients as opposed to local temperatures alone (Byrne &amp; O'Gorman, 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0003">2015</a>; Chadwick et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0005">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have presented one formulation of this transition time, and we also explore some alternative definitions that produce similar results (SI). Even in a scenario such as RCP 4.5, where emissions are rapidly reduced by mid‐21st century, there are substantial spatial differences in the time it takes to reach a rate of steady warming. This transition time occurs latest in the Arctic and low latitudes; as low latitudes have been characterized as having the earliest ToE (Hawkins &amp; Sutton, 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0013">2012</a>; Mahlstein et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0018">2011</a>), this study finds that they will also experience among the longest periods of high transience. While the ToE and TSC bookend this second stage of high transience, it is important to note that TSC need not imply climate stabilization. For example, amplified warming in high latitudes is expected in the 23rd century at rates that are multiple times higher than the global average of 0.02
  <span class="bold">°</span>C/decade (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58884-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58884-fig-0003">3</a>b), and global mean surface temperature is expected to continue to increase for centuries under an increased constant GHG concentration scenario (Rugenstein et al., 
  <a rid="grl58884-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58884-bib-0026">2016</a>; Figure 
  <a rid="grl58884-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58884-fig-0001">1</a>a). Even in comparison with 21st century warming rates, relatively high rates of continued warming are expected for some regions, such as parts of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58884-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58884-fig-0003">3</a>d).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the UNFCCC's objective of stabilizing GHG is achieved, then despite slower global warming rates our work suggests regional differences in the climate change trajectory in the coming centuries. An important limitation of our analysis is that TSC is estimated relative to 23rd century warming rates. This is because the ensemble simulations did not extend beyond 2300. It is possible that these rates will change in future centuries, which would result in later TSC values than the ones estimated in this analysis.</p>
