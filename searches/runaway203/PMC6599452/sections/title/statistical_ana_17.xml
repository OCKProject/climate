  <span class="sup">®</span> AMOS 19.0 software’s (IBM Corporation Software Group, Somers, NY, USA). The differences in energy balances, carbon stocks, GHG emissions, carbon economic efficiency, NER, and net income were analyzed using Linear Models, with the four kinds of agricultural production systems fitted as the fixed effect and other parameters as random effects. Predicted means, the standard error of the differences, and the level of significant differences were analyzed using Duncan test. The temporal variations in output indicators among the four systems were also evaluated using a chart presentation. The data of carbon balances and carbon economic efficiency that exhibited high heterogeneity of variance among treatments were transformed in
