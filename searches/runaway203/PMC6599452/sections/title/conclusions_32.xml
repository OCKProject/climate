 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study developed models to estimate energy balances and GHG emissions within the farm gate associated with the production per farm for the four contrasting agricultural production systems in Minqin Oasis. The statistical analysis of data from 2014 to 2015 indicated that the NER in EGLP was significantly higher than that in other three systems. The current research found that the EGLP system in Minqin Oasis is a carbon sink, and the net income in IFLP was the highest among the four systems in Minqin Oasis. However, relative to the contribution of GHG emissions from production input, all of the results of the four agricultural systems showed that fertilizer, methane emissions from enteric fermentation, and plastic mulch accounted for the greatest proportion. The path models showed that breeding structure was strongly linked to the economic income. The direct and total effects of water use efficiency via its positive influences on energy balances and GHG emissions were much stronger than those of other dependent variables. Although there is a range of uncertainties relating to the calculations of these emission factors, these data could provide benchmark information for Chinese authorities to evaluate the effect of GHG emissions from contrasting agricultural production systems in Minqin Oasis.</p>
