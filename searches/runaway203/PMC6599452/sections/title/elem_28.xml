  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The energy balance of agricultural production systems can be influenced by variations in farm input and output capacities, including family population, production systems, environmental conditions, management regimes, and input capacity. It is known that the evaluation of energy balances is related to the variability of computed energy parameters. The parameters of energy and GHG emissions in this study were collected from literature in similar research sites. For example, the energy parameters of herbicides and insecticides selected in this study are higher than that reported by 
   <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Pishgar-Komleh, Ghahderijani &amp; Sefeedpari (2012b)</a>. The present carbon balances for agricultural production are comparable to those published elsewhere. For example, our NER for wheat and maize production are similar to those in Iran (2.09 vs. 2.13 GJ/ha, 2.63 vs. 2.67 GJ/ha, respectively) (
   <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">Khoshroo, 2014</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-70">Yousefi, Damghani &amp; Khoramivafa, 2014</a>). However, our input energy and output energy of maize production (76.7 and 201.1 GJ/ha, respectively) are much higher than those (50.5 and 134.9 GJ/ha, respectively) estimated using LCA in Iran (
   <a rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-70">Yousefi, Damghani &amp; Khoramivafa, 2014</a>). Our input energy for cotton production (50.2 GJ/ha) is much higher than that (31.2 GJ/ha) in Iran (
   <a rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-51">Pishgar-Komleh, Sefeedpari &amp; Ghahderijani, 2012a</a>). The present NER of ICP (1.04) and IFLP (0.63) are within the range of crop production (0.5–2.1 GJ/farm) and livestock production (0.5–1.0 GJ/farm) of eastern Gansu in China, respectively (
   <a rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-68">Xu et al., 2010</a>). Our NER for tomato production (0.63) is similar to that (0.6) in India (
   <a rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-44">Nautiyal et al., 2007</a>). However, the NER of wheat production (2.09) in this study is higher than that in Pakistan (
   <a rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-1">Abbas et al., 2017</a>), and the corresponding value of maize and cotton production in our study are much lower than that (2.63 vs. 5.52) in Turkey and (1.40 vs. 2.27) in India, respectively (
   <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Baran &amp; Gokdogan, 2016</a>; 
   <a rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-7">Channagouda, Babalad &amp; Patil, 2017</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nature of agricultural production systems is the flow and circulation of matter and energy (
   <a rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-57">Sere, Steinfeld &amp; Groenewold, 1996</a>). Energy is the foundation of the development of agricultural systems. ICP, which is an open system in Minqin Oasis, depends on high inputs with fertilizer, plastic mulch, and machinery accounting for 99% the total inputs. The large input of inorganic energy has improved the living standards of local farmers, however, the inorganic energy, especially, chemical fertilizer, pesticide and plastic mulch have yielded negative effect on local environment. It is a sustainable mode of agricultural development to enlarge the alfalfa planting area and to breed numerous sheep in Minqin Oasis.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carbon balances of agricultural production systems</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As indicated previously, our GHG emission factors are comparable to those published elsewhere. For example, the average value of the carbon balance for grassland from intensive livestock production (Grazing) in Minqin Oasis is higher than that (49.1 vs. 22–44 g/C/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>.year) for grassland in southern Belgium (
   <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Goidts &amp; Van Wesemael, 2007</a>), and lower than that (129 g C/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>.year) for grazed European grassland. Our carbon emission for maize production (12.79 ton CO
   <sub>2</sub>-eq/ha) is similar to that (12.865 ton CO
   <sub>2</sub>-eq/ha) reported in Iran (
   <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">Soussana, Tallec &amp; Blanfort, 2010</a>). Similar findings were reported, that is, that the restoration and reconstruction of grassland can significantly increase the amount of soil organic carbon storage in China (
   <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Li et al., 2006</a>). The present carbon economic efficiency ($0.0464/kg CO
   <sub>2</sub>-eq) is within the range for wheat production ($0.01–$0.085/kg CO
   <sub>2</sub>-eq) in the USA (
   <a rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-56">Sanders &amp; Webber, 2014</a>). Nevertheless, our GHG emission factor for wheat production is higher than that (10.55 vs. 1.28 ton CO
   <sub>2</sub>-eq/ha) in the UK (
   <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">Hillier et al., 2009</a>); for maize production is higher that (12.79 vs. 2.44–4.20 ton CO
   <sub>2</sub>-eq/ha) in the USA (
   <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Farrell et al., 2006</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is no similar research on energy and carbon balances, which are of great significance to adjust the agricultural production model in China. The high inputs, such as fertilizer, mulch, and machining, accounted for a relatively large proportion, and low outputs in crop production resulted in high carbon emission in Minqin Oasis. It was found that the agricultural production inputs, that is, fertilizer and plastic mulch are the dominant factors that contribute to GHG emissions in this study. In Hexi corridor (including Minqin Oasis) of China, the average annual growth rate of agricultural fertilizer and film per unit of area had a slight increase since 2012 and reached to a certain extent (
   <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Li et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, this finding can well provide suggestions to policy makers to adjust agricultural production model in Minqin Oasis, China. In addition, GHG emissions might be assigned a price in prospective climate policy frameworks. It would be useful to know the extent to which those policies would increase the incremental production costs of crop production within the agricultural production system.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Uncertainty of GHG emissions assessment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many factors could contribute to the uncertainty of the present assessment of GHG emissions from typical agricultural production systems in Minqin Oasis. First, although the eight towns selected from each production system were typical of the production system in the region, these eight towns might not fully cover all variations in crop and livestock production systems within each region. Second, the official data collection system in China might not be as good as that in developed countries (
   <a rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-69">Xue, Wang &amp; Yan, 2014</a>). In addition, the emission factors of the seed, P and K fertilizers, and pesticides in China were estimated using reported values (
   <a rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-10">Cheng et al., 2011</a>) and (
   <a rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-72">Zeng et al., 2012</a>), which originated from other countries. The use of the Tier 1 method proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2013 (
   <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2014</a>) also added uncertainty to the present emission factors for livestock production because this method does not consider the effects of animals and dietary factors on enteric methane emissions. In summary, although the above uncertainties might add errors to estimates of GHG emissions in Minqin Oasis, our results could provide benchmark information for the Chinese government to develop appropriate policies to reduce GHG emissions from agricultural production in northwestern China. However, further improvement is required in future to upgrade the current evaluation of GHG emissions from agricultural production systems in this area.
