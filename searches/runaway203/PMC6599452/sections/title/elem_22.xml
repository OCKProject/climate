  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" href="#fig-3">Figure 3</a> shows the contribution of different factors to the total GHG emission in the abovementioned sub-agricultural systems (namely, ICP, ICLP, IFLP, EGLP) in Minqin Oasis. Among the factors, soil respiration contributes a lot to the total GHG emissions in these sub-systems with the contribution ratio being 41.85% in ICP, 25.86% in ICLP, 99.31% in EGLP, respectively. In the ICP system, fertilizer and mulch resulted in GHG emissions that accounted for 35.78% and 9.53%, respectively. In the ICLP system, methane emissions from enteric fermentation and fertilizer resulted in GHG emissions that accounted for 25.7% and 20.94%, respectively. In the IFLP and EGLP systems, methane emissions and N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions accounted for the greater proportion of total GHG emissions; the respective values being as follows:
