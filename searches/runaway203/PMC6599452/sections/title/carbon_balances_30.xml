 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As indicated previously, our GHG emission factors are comparable to those published elsewhere. For example, the average value of the carbon balance for grassland from intensive livestock production (Grazing) in Minqin Oasis is higher than that (49.1 vs. 22–44 g/C/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>.year) for grassland in southern Belgium (
  <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Goidts &amp; Van Wesemael, 2007</a>), and lower than that (129 g C/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>.year) for grazed European grassland. Our carbon emission for maize production (12.79 ton CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq/ha) is similar to that (12.865 ton CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq/ha) reported in Iran (
  <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">Soussana, Tallec &amp; Blanfort, 2010</a>). Similar findings were reported, that is, that the restoration and reconstruction of grassland can significantly increase the amount of soil organic carbon storage in China (
  <a rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-37">Li et al., 2006</a>). The present carbon economic efficiency ($0.0464/kg CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq) is within the range for wheat production ($0.01–$0.085/kg CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq) in the USA (
  <a rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-56">Sanders &amp; Webber, 2014</a>). Nevertheless, our GHG emission factor for wheat production is higher than that (10.55 vs. 1.28 ton CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq/ha) in the UK (
  <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">Hillier et al., 2009</a>); for maize production is higher that (12.79 vs. 2.44–4.20 ton CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq/ha) in the USA (
  <a rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-15">Farrell et al., 2006</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is no similar research on energy and carbon balances, which are of great significance to adjust the agricultural production model in China. The high inputs, such as fertilizer, mulch, and machining, accounted for a relatively large proportion, and low outputs in crop production resulted in high carbon emission in Minqin Oasis. It was found that the agricultural production inputs, that is, fertilizer and plastic mulch are the dominant factors that contribute to GHG emissions in this study. In Hexi corridor (including Minqin Oasis) of China, the average annual growth rate of agricultural fertilizer and film per unit of area had a slight increase since 2012 and reached to a certain extent (
  <a rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-36">Li et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, this finding can well provide suggestions to policy makers to adjust agricultural production model in Minqin Oasis, China. In addition, GHG emissions might be assigned a price in prospective climate policy frameworks. It would be useful to know the extent to which those policies would increase the incremental production costs of crop production within the agricultural production system.
