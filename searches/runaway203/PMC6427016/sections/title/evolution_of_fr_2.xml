 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results are next refined at the daily timescale, through an analysis of daily frost occurrence, to represent the evolution in the summertime frost (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). This is done under contrasted emission scenarios and for the mid- and late century, compared to current climate conditions (as described by historical simulations). Errors inherited from the CMIP5 are shown in Supplementary Figure 2, corresponding uncertainties in Supplementary Figure 3, and similar analyses applied to the winter season in Supplementary Figure 4. Projected changes are of larger magnitude for Tn, because most of the domains already experiences positive temperature in summer under current climate conditions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). They are much sensitive to the emission scenario, especially for the late century. Morning frost occurrence (Tn) decreases by about 25–30 pp over most of the Mont-Blanc massif in the mid-century under RCP8.5, and slightly less than that for the late century under RCP2.6. Frost occurrence experiences a huge drop of 45–50 pp for the late century for RCP8.5. The geography of these changes is strongly driven by the topography (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Crucially, even the Mont-Blanc summit shows obvious evolutions: up to −20 pp by the end of the century for frost occurrence in the morning (Tn), and even –35 pp in the afternoon (Tx), according to the RCP8.5 scenario. Such decrease may lead to major changes of its local climate. Under current climate conditions, it has only experienced brief thaw events

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present altitudinal range of frost occurrence will show major changes during the 21st century (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Main changes occur between 2000 and 4000 m asl for RCP2.6 in the morning (Tn), and between 3000 and 4500 m in the afternoon (Tx), according to RCP2.6 downscaled simulations. They are much higher in elevation and magnitude for RCP8.5 (up to −45–50 pp between 3500 and 4000 m asl for Tn and −30 to −50 pp at the same elevation for Tx by the late century).
