  <span class="sup">2</span> peak above 4000 m but only 1 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> above 4500 m. This raises the question of the availability of so-called climatic shelters, that is, areas where the ecosystems can migrate to remain in environmental conditions favourable to their development
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. In the plains of the mid-latitudes, a rise of 0.6 °C typically corresponds to a poleward shift of one latitude degree (about 111 km). In the temperate mountain ranges, this corresponds to a vertical shift of 100 m only
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. A warming of several Celsius degrees, as estimated by the fifth assessment report of the IPCC, could thus lead to a general migration of several hundreds of meters vertically, and cause a dramatic transformation of high-mountain environments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. In high elevations, temperature remains negative almost constantly, favouring snow accumulation and permafrost in non glaciated areas

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. This is likely to change in the future, hence the need for very high-resolution climate projections.

  </span> (see Supplementary Information) are appropriate tools to estimate the spatial variability of variables like air temperature, using spatial predictands derived from high-resolution digital elevation models, and large-scale temperature changes (predictors) taken from climate models. Here, we use a novel algorithm, allowing for more precise and refined temperature estimations
  <span class="sup">

  </span>, to regionalize climate change as simulated by a sample of 13 climate models (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) at a spatial resolution of 200 m. The two most contrasted greenhouse gas emission scenarios are selected, namely RCP2.6 (optimistic) and RCP8.5 (pessimistic), to consider the whole spread of possible climate evolutions, together with historical simulations conducted with observed concentrations of greenhouse gases since the 1850s. This downscaling procedure is necessary to consider the combined effects of elevation, slopes, orientation and valleys, on daily minimum (Tn) and maximum (Tx) air temperature. In the resulting elevation model (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>), the Mont-Blanc summit peaks at 4763 m instead of 4808 m in the real world, illustrating the high degree of realism reached by such hectometric resolution.
