 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model domain comprises the entire WAIS, the Antarctic Peninsula, and part of East Antarctica (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). We start from an ice sheet that was spun up into thermal equilibrium under constant present-day conditions of the atmosphere and the ocean and under fixed bed and ice geometry. Sub–ice shelf melt rates are calculated via the novel Potsdam Ice-Shelf Cavity Model (PICO) module (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>), which is an integral part of PISM. PICO simulates the vertical overturning circulation in ice shelf cavities, reproducing observed melt rate patterns and the wide range of ice shelf individual average melt rates. Here, we force PICO by circum-Antarctic present-day observations of ocean temperature and salinity (
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
   <span class="italic">42</span>
  </a>). Prescribed present-day surface mass balance and temperature are taken from the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>). Letting the ice sheet evolve freely, inland-spreading ice thinning and acceleration, as well as grounding line retreat (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>), occur with a marine ice sheet instability starting to unfold in the coastal region of TG, which is consistent with present-day observations (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">

  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>) and increase with time (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). The simulated initial thinning in the coastal area of PIG and TG reaches up to 5 m year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> locally, which is in accordance with observational estimates of maximum thinning rates of 4 to 9 m year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in that area (

  <span class="sup">−1</span>. The rates are in line with regional simulations of the destabilization of TG that used a different ice sheet model (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). The joint catchment basin of PIG and TG (fig. S1) is drained within 4000 year, confirming results from a previous study applying an earlier version of the PISM model under different boundary conditions (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examine the possibility of preventing this destabilization conducting an ensemble of perturbation simulations. We artificially enhance snowfall onto the ice sheet within a fixed sector that covers the coastal region of PIG and TG (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). This perturbation is applied as a pulse of mass addition rates between 
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 62.5 and 875 Gt year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, lasting over a duration of 
  <span class="italic">T</span> = 10 to 50 year, which yields a total ice mass of 
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 625 to 18,750 Gt throughout the ensemble of simulations. This would lead to a sea level drop between about 2 and 5 cm, assuming that the mass is taken out of the ocean. We restore the original atmospheric conditions after the perturbation. The oceanic boundary condition remains unmodified during all simulations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ice sheet responds with continued and delayed retreat in a part of the simulations, leading to the complete drainage of the marine portion of the WAIS. The other part of simulations reveals a stabilizing ice sheet, which we define as being characterized by grounding line equilibration and a loss in long-term ice volume by less than 5%. Whether stabilization takes place or not depends on whether the amount of added ice is sufficient to stop the previously initiated grounding line retreat. In the unperturbed case, ice sheet thinning, retreat, and discharge evolve in a self-enforcing loop (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). The mass deposition can break this loop through a temporal thickening (~10 m yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) of the ice sheet in the region adjacent to the grounding line. The enforced increase in ice surface elevation upstream of the grounding line induces a strong steepening of the surface slope, enhancing the driving stress at the grounding line area (
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
   <span class="italic">48</span>
  </a>). Increased ice advection into the ice shelf (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>) allows for a regrounding of the ice shelf, pushing the grounding line toward the ocean and up the bed slope. The rate and duration of the perturbation determine whether the local grounding line advance is strong enough to enable the ice sheet to enter a long-term stable configuration (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a> and figs. S2 and S3).
