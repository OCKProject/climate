  <span class="bold">A</span>) The unperturbed reference simulation and (
  <span class="bold">B</span> and 
  <span class="bold">C</span>) a mass addition of 
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 8000 Gt for two different combinations of rate 
  <span class="italic">R</span> and duration 
  <span class="italic">T</span> of the perturbation. While the low-rate perturbation (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) cannot prevent ice sheet collapse, the high-rate perturbation (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) is sufficient to stabilize the ice sheet (see corresponding white stars in 
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). The two vertical lines indicate the sections of mass addition (asterisks) along the transects. The ice shelf is truncated 25 km downstream of the grounding line for clarity. Locations of cross sections are shown in 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>.
