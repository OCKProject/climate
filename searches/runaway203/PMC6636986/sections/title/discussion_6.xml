 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model simulations neglect several mechanisms that could alter the speed and degree of the potential ice sheet collapse, including possible snowfall increase and ice shelf hydrofracturing due to future atmospheric warming, the effect of glacial isostasy, or consequences of marine ice cliff failure (

  </a>–

  </a>). The absence of these processes introduces uncertainty concerning the ice sheet stabilization threshold inferred in this study. For instance, if ice shelf hydrofracturing, which tends to enhance ice discharge across the grounding line as observed on the Antarctic Peninsula (
  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
   <span class="italic">49</span>
  </a>), would also become relevant for the Amundsen Sea sector, then the amount of mass to be deposited would need to be larger as calculated here. It is also possible that not yet anticipated processes might become important during a potential stabilization effort. Other uncertainties stem from the physical approximations of the ice sheet model, parameter choices, the limited model resolution, observational uncertainties of the used data, and the choice of the mass deposition region in our simulations. Consequently, our study should serve as a proof of concept rather than as a means to deliver exact numbers on the amount and duration of mass deposition required for stabilization. Careful monitoring of the region during the intervention period would need to be a prerequisite to reduce the risk of unintended effects. The practical execution of the endeavor is beyond the scope of this study, and it would be a technical challenge in many ways. For instance, the lifted ocean water could be added either in liquid form or as snow onto the ice sheet. Liquid water addition would raise the question of how it could be kept at the ice sheet surface sufficiently long to freeze. The creation of supraglacial lakes may need to be prevented, as it could cause acceleration of ice discharge as observed in Greenland (

   <span class="italic">50</span>
  </a>). Snowing the water mass onto the ice sheet would mimic the type of precipitation naturally occurring over most part of the ice sheet, demanding a considerable amount of energy and requiring extensive infrastructure for the snow making. The effect of latent heat release due to the phase change of the water is not accounted for in our simulations. In addition, desalination of the water would need consideration, as the addition of salt to the ice sheet surface could have serious effect on the local flow dynamics of the ice sheet. A potential desalination procedure (
  <a rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" href="#R51">
   <span class="italic">51</span>
  </a>) would be extremely energy consuming and would need an appropriate, robust, high-end technology. Furthermore, the removal of the sea water to be deposited on the ice sheet would likely perturb the circulation regime of the ocean locally, possibly facilitating the intrusion of warm water into the glaciers’ ice shelf cavities. The additionally induced local flow would be roughly 0.03 sverdrup, which is about 10% of the strength of the ocean circulation beneath the ice shelf cavity of PIG (

   <span class="italic">52</span>
  </a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ocean water would have to be lifted from the sea level to the top of the ice sheet by about 640 m on average (mean ice surface elevation of the perturbation area). In our simulations, this area covers the joint coastal region of PIG and TG with an extent of about 52,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, which is similar to the size of the state of Costa Rica or half the size of Iceland. The practical realization of elevating and distributing the ocean water would mean an unprecedented effort for humankind in one of the harshest environments of the planet. For instance, the uplifting of the ocean water alone would require a theoretical minimum of 145 GW (neglecting frictional losses), a power that, in theory, could be provided by more than 12,000 high-end wind turbines driven by the regional wind fields, which in principle would have sufficient capacity (
  <a rid="R53" ref-type="bibr" href="#R53">
   <span class="italic">53</span>
  </a>). However, the effective total power demand of the endeavor including potential desalination and heating of the ocean water, as well as snow making, carried out under the difficult circumstances of the Antarctic climate, could be much higher, requiring careful assessment by engineering experts. The building of the wind turbines and the further infrastructure, as well as the extraction of the ocean water itself, would mean the loss of a unique natural reserve, with serious effects on its sensitive marine and coastal ecosystems [e.g., significant emission of underwater noise and electromagnetic fields and fatal collision with energy structure; see (
  <a rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" href="#R54">
   <span class="italic">54</span>
  </a>)]. Potential hazards coming along with such an enormous operation would be difficult to anticipate and hard to handle, likely having devastating impact. Despite its disruptive character, the intervention could however relieve the world’s most populous areas from the long-term, several meter–scale sea level commitment of a tipped WAIS. Whether the projected continuation of the observed destabilization of the ice sheet will prove true has to be answered by extensive future monitoring of the Amundsen Sea sector, forming the basis for a weighing between the benefits and the serious implications of an artificial restabilization of the ice sheet. Operations such as the one discussed pose the risk of moral hazard. We therefore stress that these projects are not an alternative to strengthening the efforts of climate mitigation. The ambitious reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is and will be the main lever to mitigate the impacts of sea level rise. The simulations of the current study do not consider a warming ocean and atmosphere as can be expected from the increase in anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The computed mass deposition scenarios are therefore valid only under a simultaneous drastic reduction of global CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions.
