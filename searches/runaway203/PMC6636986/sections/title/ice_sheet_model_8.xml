  </a>) to carry out regional simulations of the WAIS at a horizontal resolution of 4 km and a minimum vertical resolution of 7 m. The model applies a superposition of the shallow ice approximation (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>

  </a>) of the full-Stokes stress balance (
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>). This hybrid scheme ensures a smooth transition between different ice sheet flow regimes and allows for stress transmission across the grounding line. A linear interpolation of the freely evolving grounding line and, accordingly, interpolated basal friction enable realistic grounding line motion also at medium or low resolution (
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>). Basal friction was calculated using a nonlinear Weertman-type sliding law (
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>) with a sliding exponent of 3/4 in combination with a Mohr-Coulomb model for plastic till (

  <a rid="R59" ref-type="bibr" href="#R59">
   <span class="italic">59</span>
  </a>). The till friction angle was parameterized with bed elevation, as in (
  <a rid="R60" ref-type="bibr" href="#R60">
   <span class="italic">60</span>
  </a>), and the basal pore water pressure was limited to a maximum fraction of 0.97 of the overburden pressure. This friction scheme ensures a continuous transition from quasi–nonslip regimes in elevated regions to the marine areas where basal resistance was low. We used a kinematic first-order calving law (

   <span class="italic">61</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R62" ref-type="bibr" href="#R62">
   <span class="italic">62</span>
  </a>), with a prescribed proportionality factor of 10
  <span class="sup">17</span> m·s and a minimum ice thickness at the calving front of 200 m. The physically motivated calving law takes into account the eigenvalues of the horizontal strain-rate tensor, allowing for geographically confined ice shelves and dynamic calving front positions. A physical stress boundary condition was applied at the calving front to close the equations of the shallow shelf approximation (
