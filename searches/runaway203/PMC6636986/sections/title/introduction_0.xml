 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dynamic ice loss from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) and Thwaites Glacier (TG) currently represents Antarctica’s largest and strongly accelerating contribution to global sea level rise. From the mid-1990s to the year 2010, the ice loss from both regions substantially increased from 6 Gt year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> to more than 40 Gt year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for PIG and from about 30 to 52 Gt year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for TG (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). Recent estimates from the IMBIE (Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise) project show an increase of West Antarctica’s sea level contribution from 0.15 mm year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in 1992 to 0.44 mm year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in 2017 (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). This acceleration in ice discharge is likely linked to the increased flow of warmer ocean waters toward the ice shelves (

   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). The warm water masses melt the ice shelves adjacent to the glaciers from below. Thinner ice shelves exert less backstress (buttressing) on their feeding glaciers (

   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>), increasing glacier flow speed. The consequent thinning of the glaciers presumably triggered the grounding line retreat of several tens of kilometers inland (

   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>). Both PIG and TG rest on inland-sloping bedrock below sea level, which makes them prone to the marine ice sheet instability, i.e., a self-sustaining discharge due to the increase in ice thickness at the grounding line during the retreat (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>). Numerical simulations support the hypothesis that an early stage of collapse has already begun at both sites (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>) and may lead to a 40-km unstable retreat of the PIG grounding line over the coming 20 years with an accelerated ice loss of 100 Gt year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> or even more (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>). In two of three simulations with different regional ice sheet models, the retreat is irreversible unless the basal melt rates are strongly reduced compared to present-day control conditions. Even after the grounding line reaches the bottom of the marine basin, the simulated rates of ice loss from PIG remain elevated at 60 to 120 Gt year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Numerical simulations of TG show an increased discharge in the later phase of retreat in about 200 to 900 years (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). This future retreat releases 361 Gt year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> of ice to the ocean, corresponding to a sea level rise of 1 mm year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> under a wide range of different assumptions regarding basal melt rates including present-day control conditions. The potential long-term sea level rise due to the instability of the marine ice sheet is estimated to be 1.2 m from the Amundsen Sea sector or 3.3 m if the entire marine part of West Antarctica was affected (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>). This scenario is independent of the question of whether natural oceanic variability or human activity caused the initiation of the instability (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most climate models indicate an increase in snowfall over Antarctica under future global warming (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>), although the underlying changes in the dynamics of the wind fields and ocean currents in the Southern Ocean need further studies (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). This presumed increase in snowfall is however found to be insufficient to stop the decay of PIG (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>). The sensitivity to increased snow accumulation was also investigated for TG (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). A 20% linear increase in accumulation may stabilize the retreat of TG under low basal melt rates but can only delay the onset of the rapid collapse of the ice sheet under higher melt rates. The long-term evolution of the potential disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) may be affected by several further processes. For instance, isostatic rebound of the glacial bed during ice sheet retreat is suggested to delay or limit its retreat (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>). In contrast, hydrofracturing of ice shelves (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>) and a corresponding reduction in ice shelf buttressing might amplify an ongoing instability. In addition, the currently debated marine ice cliff instability (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>) could accelerate ice sheet decay. Whether the instability was caused by human interference or is part of longer-term natural cycle (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>) requires further studies. A number of different techniques have been suggested to stall the self-amplifying discharge from the WAIS (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we investigate the option to stabilize both glaciers by pumping ocean water onto the critical area conducting regional simulations with the three-dimensional Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM). The model applies a superposition of the shallow ice (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>

   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>) that ensures a smooth transition between the different flow regimes of an ice sheet, ranging from bed-frozen inland ice over well-lubricated, fast-flowing ice streams to free-floating ice shelves (see Materials and Methods). Stress transmission across the grounding line allows for the effect of ice shelf buttressing (
