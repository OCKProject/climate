   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>, vectors), which act as an effective Rossby wave source (RWS; Methods) in the subtropics by anomalously advecting the mean meridional gradient of absolute vorticity that maximises along about 25°S
   <span class="sup">

   </span>. An anticyclonic RWS emerges off the west coast of Australia in association with the southward divergent flow from the enhanced convection in the eastern Indian Ocean (purple contours lettered “H” in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). Similarly, the anomalous northward divergent in-flow driven by suppressed convection in the western Indian Ocean and more pronouncedly in the western Pacific produced cyclonic RWS centred approximately at 65°E (“L1”) and 165°E (“L2”), respectively.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The anticyclonic RWS in the eastern Indian Ocean (“H” in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>) appears to drive an anticyclonic streamfunction anomaly off the northwest coast of Australia (“A1” in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), and the cyclonic RWS off the northeast coast of Australia (“L2” in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>) drives a cyclonic streamfunction anomaly (“C” in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). These subtropical streamfunction anomalies are then associated with wave trains that arc poleward and eastward into the SH higher latitudes. Wave activity flux anomalies (vectors in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>; Methods), which track the group velocity of the Rossby wave train, indicate that the RWS in the eastern Indian Ocean is the source of the wave train that arcs poleward to the west of Australia, and then eastward across the Southern Ocean along the waveguide of the high latitude westerly jet
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>. The cyclonic RWS in the western Pacific is similarly associated with a wave train that propagates poleward and eastward in the western Pacific, avoiding the region around New Zealand where meridional gradient of absolute vorticity becomes negative (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) and so prohibits Rossby wave propagation

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>. This wave train perhaps is partially refracted back to the tropics in the eastern Pacific (indicated by the equatorward pointing wave activity flux vectors). However, the two wave trains appear to constructively add to the cyclonic-anticyclonic anomalies to the southwest and southeast of South America, thus contributing to the zonal wavenumber 3 pattern along 60°S. Divergence of wave activity flux in the southern Indian Ocean indicates an additional anticyclonic source of the extratropical Rossby wave train (labelled “A2” in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). This additional wave source has previously been shown to typically develop during negative IOD years, resulting from feedback of altered transient eddies in the high latitude storm track onto the seasonal mean anomalous circulation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extratropical circulation anomalies are similarly signed throughout the depth of the troposphere (i.e. compare Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a> with the implied circulation centres near the surface from Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), consistent with theoretical considerations for forcing of extratropical circulation anomalies by tropical convection
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
   </span>, and so are indicative of the anomalous winds at the surface that would directly impact sea ice.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role played by IOD and ENSO in promoting the Rossby wave trains that affected SIE during Sep–Oct 2016 is clarified by multiple regression of winds, outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and streamfunction onto indices of the IOD (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> middle panels) and ENSO (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> bottom panels) using the historical record 1979–2015. For display, the resulting regressions are scaled by the magnitude of the IOD and ENSO indices in 2016 (Methods). This method successfully isolates the anomalous convection, RWS, and wave train emanating from the tropical Indian Ocean associated with the IOD and from the tropical Pacific associated with ENSO. During 2016, the wave train emanating from the Indian Ocean has stronger amplitude and spans both the eastern and western hemispheres compared to the wave train emanating from the Pacific associated with La Niña. The sum of these two patterns explains about half of the high latitude anomalies observed during Sep–Oct 2016 (figure not shown). The other half plausibly comes from internal variability that cannot be described by the simple regression model.
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis presented in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> indicates that the record negative IOD played a key role in generating the wave-3 pattern at high latitudes that affected SIE around the breadth of Antarctica during Sep–Oct 2016. The weak La Nina conditions in the Pacific played a more secondary role by contributing constructively to the anomalous circulation to the south of South America. The stronger forcing from the tropical Indian Ocean is supported by comparable regression results using reforecasts from a coupled model (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The results are also consistent with that obtained with an atmosphere-only model experiment with a specified convective heating representing precipitation anomaly in September–November 2016 in the eastern Indian/western Pacific Ocean

We argue that this low SAM was driven by the combined effects of the downward coupling from the polar stratosphere due to a significant weakening of the polar vortex during October–December 2016 and the passing of an Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) during November 2016.

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). This weakening of the polar vortex is viewed as an earlier than normal breakdown of the vortex that typically occurs in late spring (compare the anomalous zonal winds to the climatological zonal winds in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). This coupling of the weakened surface circumpolar westerlies during Nov–Dec to the preceding weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex during October is confirmed in the historical record (Supplementary Figure

  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results also suggest the record decline of SIE at the end of 2016 was largely the result of naturally occurring variability. This conclusion is bolstered by the subsequent return to near normal SIE by mid 2018 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). However, we cannot exclude a possible role of anthropogenic forcing. For instance, ongoing warming of the tropical IO in austral autumn and winter
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
   </span> appears to have contributed to the formation of the extreme negative IOD in 2016
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span>. Anthropogenic forcing is considered a major contributor to this warming trend
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
   </span>. Thus, anthropogenic forcing may have contributed to the record IOD convective anomalies that developed during 2016. Furthermore, the chance of low SAM events like that in Nov–Dec 2016 are tightly tied to warming events in the polar stratosphere which may become more likely in the future as a result of the mending of the Antarctic ozone hole. Ozone depletion and the increase of the greenhouse gases have both contributed to the recent trend towards high SAM in austral summer
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span>. As the Antarctic ozone hole begins its recovery

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
   </span>, more frequent occurrence of low SAM might be expected compared to the past 40 years.
