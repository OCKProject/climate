  </span> with some enhancements to the ensemble generation strategy. Reforecasts have been conducted for start dates over 1990–2012 with 11 ensemble members. We have used reforecasts initialized on 01 September and extending through December here.

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bias corrected reforecast anomaly is formed by removing the reforecast climatology from individual reforecasts. The linear regression is then applied to the Sep–Oct mean reforecast anomaly (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) or daily anomaly over Sep–Dec (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4b</a>) as in the observational analyses.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are 253 individual reforecasts (23 years×11 members) initialized on 01 September. We compared results using reforecast members with that using ensemble means, and find they are similar. We present results using reforecast members here taking advantage of large samples.</p>
