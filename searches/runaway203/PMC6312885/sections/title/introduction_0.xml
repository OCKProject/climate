 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea-ice extent (SIE) over the two poles shows contrasting trends based on satellite observations since 1979. Arctic SIE has decreased substantially
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span> whereas Antarctic SIE has exhibited a small but significant increase
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Climate models, when forced with all major natural and anthropogenic forcings over the same period, simulate SIE reduction in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions, inconsistent with the observed Antarctic SIE increase
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Several mechanisms have been suggested for the weak positive Antarctic SIE trend, such as internal variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, decadal modulation by the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, cooling of the Southern Ocean surface due to the observed strengthening of the westerly winds and positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) resulting from ozone depletion
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span> and freshening of the ocean surface thus acting to reduce the upwelling of warmer subsurface waters
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. However, there is no consensus as to the cause of the upward trend.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On shorter time scales, internal modes of variability such as El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and SAM have been identified for having played important roles in influencing seasonal variations of SIE
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. The primary processes for these climate modes to influence SIE are through induced changes in atmospheric heat transport and sea-ice drift resulting from changes of the atmospheric circulation around Antarctica. The circulation anomalies often manifest in a zonally symmetric pattern in response to SAM or wave like structures in response to ENSO. The influence of ENSO on Antarctic sea-ice is primarily through the atmospheric Rossby wave trains forced by anomalous tropical convection that accompanies anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Pacific
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. ENSO strongly co-varies with the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) mode in austral spring September-November, which also drives a Rossby wave train that emanates into higher latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (SH)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> and can also influence SIE

  </span>.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Antarctic SIE began a rapid decline from September 2016
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) resulting in record low anomalies by late austral spring, which then partially recovered back to near normal by austral autumn 2017. The unprecedented decline in SIE during spring 2016 raises the following question: What were the processes that promoted the decline? Was the decline a temporary shift or the beginning of a long-term downward trend as predicted by the climate models? Was the cause natural variability or a response to increasing greenhouse gases? Several studies
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> have highlighted the role played by atmospheric circulation anomalies for driving the SIE decline in 2016. During September–October (Sep–Oct) the atmospheric circulation exhibited a wave number 3 pattern in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics, that acted to decrease sea-ice regionally where the anomalous surface flow was toward the pole

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. The circumpolar westerlies then weakened more zonally uniformly during November–December (Nov–Dec) indicative of a strong low SAM pattern, which acted to increase warm Ekman transport toward the pole

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we investigate the causes of these unusual circulation patterns during September–December 2016 that resulted in record low SIE by the end of 2016. We are especially interested in discerning the roles of internal atmosphere-ocean variability and the possible contribution from global warming. Because of the development of two distinctive circulation patterns during this extended spring season, we discuss Sep–Oct and Nov–Dec periods sequentially
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. The Sep–Oct and Nov–Dec SIE anomalies since 1979 are shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>. The SIE in Sep–Oct 2016 (red line) was the third lowest (−0.59 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) since 1979, slightly weaker than the record low in 1986 (−0.84 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). The SIE in Nov–Dec 2016 (blue line) was a record low (−2.14 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), far stronger than the second lowest in 1986 (−1.12 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). These record low and near-record low values in 2016 are in contrast with the record high values that occurred in 2013.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While previous studies have emphasised the persistent warming of the polar Southern Ocean from the El Niño of 2015

  </span>(Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) as an important driver for this record sea ice decline, here we introduce the key role played by anomalous conditions in the tropical Indian Ocean (IO) and western Pacific associated with a record negative IOD event during austral spring 2016

  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1f</a>) during Nov–Dec emerged after the tropical Madden Julian Oscillation in early November acted to curtail the IOD-forced convective anomalies and associated wave-3 circulation pattern and a dramatic weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex beginning in October then extended downward to the surface during Nov–Dec.
