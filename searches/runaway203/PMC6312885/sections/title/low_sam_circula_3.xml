 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although a significant decline of the SIE occurred in Sep–Oct 2016, the most drastic decline occurred during Nov–Dec 2016 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). This rapid decline was associated with development of a low SAM (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>)

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The low SAM of late 2016 was unexpected because La Niña usually acts to promote high SAM
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. So why did a strong low SAM develop during Nov–Dec 2016 when La Niña conditions persisted? We argue that this low SAM was driven by the combined effects of the downward coupling from the polar stratosphere due to a significant weakening of the polar vortex during October–December 2016 and the passing of an Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) during November 2016.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stratospheric polar vortex variations and their downward coupling to the surface are a key driver of variations of the SAM in austral spring to summer
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. In early spring 2016, anomalous upward propagation of planetary wave activity from the upper troposphere into the stratosphere weakened the polar vortex in the upper stratosphere substantially
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. This weakened vortex propagated downward to the surface (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>), promoting low SAM and weakened circumpolar surface westerlies during Nov–Dec (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). This weakening of the polar vortex is viewed as an earlier than normal breakdown of the vortex that typically occurs in late spring (compare the anomalous zonal winds to the climatological zonal winds in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). This coupling of the weakened surface circumpolar westerlies during Nov–Dec to the preceding weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex during October is confirmed in the historical record (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4a</a>) and is also supported in reforecasts with a coupled model (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4b</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We note in late October–November 2016 a higher concentration of the polar stratospheric ozone with a substantially smaller ozone hole was observed (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/stratosphere/sbuv2to/gif_files/ozone_hole_plot.png" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/stratosphere/sbuv2to/gif_files/ozone_hole_plot.png</span>). The enhanced polar stratospheric ozone in these months can also be associated with low SAM in subsequent months
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>, with a strong coupling between the polar vortex and ozone anomalies.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During early November 2016, a strong MJO traversed the IO that acted to suppress convection in the eastern IO and enhance convection over the western Pacific (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). This MJO event thus acted to rapidly weaken the SST anomalies (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6a</a>) and tropical convective anomalies (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6b</a>) associated with the negative IOD
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, which were the source of the wave-3 pattern during Sep–Oct 2016. Thus the MJO helped to enable the more zonally uniform weakening of the circumpolar surface westerlies, in response to the earlier than normal breakdown of the polar stratospheric vortex, to emerge in Nov–Dec 2016.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though the circulation anomalies associated with SAM are predominantly annular, its impact on sea-ice is non-annular
  <span class="sup">

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Once low SAM was established in Nov 2016, SIE further decreased in the IO, Pacific, and Weddell Sea sectors (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>; Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study suggests that the record low sea-ice concentration during September–December 2016, which previously has been primarily attributed to anomalous atmospheric circulation

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>, was largely a result of the sequential occurrence of tropical and stratospheric forcing. This included record strength negative IOD during Sep–Oct followed by an unusually early breakdown of the stratospheric polar vortex which resulted in record weakening of the surface circumpolar westerlies during Nov–Dec. Although the strength of the negative IOD and the weakened circumpolar westerlies are not well separated individually from their previous records (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1e, f</a>), their sequential combination during Sept–Oct and Nov–Dec 2016 is clearly an outlier (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>).

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results also suggest the record decline of SIE at the end of 2016 was largely the result of naturally occurring variability. This conclusion is bolstered by the subsequent return to near normal SIE by mid 2018 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). However, we cannot exclude a possible role of anthropogenic forcing. For instance, ongoing warming of the tropical IO in austral autumn and winter
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span> appears to have contributed to the formation of the extreme negative IOD in 2016
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Anthropogenic forcing is considered a major contributor to this warming trend
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. Thus, anthropogenic forcing may have contributed to the record IOD convective anomalies that developed during 2016. Furthermore, the chance of low SAM events like that in Nov–Dec 2016 are tightly tied to warming events in the polar stratosphere which may become more likely in the future as a result of the mending of the Antarctic ozone hole. Ozone depletion and the increase of the greenhouse gases have both contributed to the recent trend towards high SAM in austral summer
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. As the Antarctic ozone hole begins its recovery

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>, more frequent occurrence of low SAM might be expected compared to the past 40 years.
