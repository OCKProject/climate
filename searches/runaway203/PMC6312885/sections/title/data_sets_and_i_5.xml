 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We regridded the above data sets to a common 1.5° × 1.5° latitude–longitude grid before diagnosing, and used 1979–2015 mean as reference for deriving anomalies.</p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sea-ice extent (SIE) is defined as the sum of areas covered by grids whose sea ice concentration is at least 15%.</p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use SST Niño 3.4 (averaged SST anomaly over 170°W–120°W, 5°N–5°S) to represent ENSO and name it as SST-Nino3.4. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode index (DMI) for SST is calculated as the anomalous SST difference between the western equatorial Indian Ocean box (50°E–70°E and 10°S–10°N) and the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean box (90°E–110°E and 10°S–0°N). We name it as SST-DMI. To represent the strength of convective activity in the Indian Ocean we introduce a new index in the same manner as the SST-DMI but using OLR as input. We name this index as OLR-DMI. The SST-DMI and OLR-DMI are highly anti-correlated (

For better representing SAM impact on Antarctic sea-ice, an alternative zonal wind index is introduced. This index is defined as the zonal and meridional averaged zonal wind at 850 hPa. The meridional average is from 60°S to 65°S. We choose this latitudinal band because the annual and zonal average of the Antarctic sea-ice edge, defined as the equatorward position of 15% contour of SIC, is near 65°S. We name this index as U
  <sub>60–65S</sub>. The correlation 
  <span class="italic">r</span> between monthly U
  <sub>60–65S</sub> and the CPC SAM index over 1979–2015 ranges from 0.89–0.91 for different seasons (for Nov–Dec
