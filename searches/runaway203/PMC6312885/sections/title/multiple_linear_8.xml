 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A multiple linear regression method was used to explore the influence of ENSO and IOD on the Rossby wave sources and wave activity flux. The two predictors are SST-Nino3.4 representing ENSO and the SST-DMI representing the IOD. The diagnostic produces two regression patterns: one is associated with influence from ENSO, and the other from IOD.</p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c–f</a> the multiple regressions were carried out using Sep–Oct mean anomalies over 1979–2015. Further we scaled the resulting regression patterns with the observed amplitude of SST-DMI (−1.66 °C) and SST-Nino3.4 (−0.78 °C) in 2016 to better reflect respective ENSO and IOD contributions to the Rossby wave sources and wave activity flux for Sep–Oct 2016.
