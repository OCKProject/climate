  <p>Rossby wave train and source during September–October 2016. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> 200 hPa divergent wind anomaly (vectors, scale in upper right, m s

   <span class="sup">−2</span>) for Sep–Oct 2016. 
   <span class="bold">c</span>–
   <span class="bold">f</span> are same as 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> but displayed fields are derived by multiple linear regression onto the DMI index (
   <span class="bold">c</span>, 
   <span class="bold">d</span>) and Nino34 SST index (
   <span class="bold">e</span>, 
   <span class="bold">f</span>) using historical data for the period 1979–2015 (see Methods). The anomalies in 
   <span class="bold">c</span>, 
   <span class="bold">d</span> and 
   <span class="bold">e</span>, 
   <span class="bold">f</span> are scaled by the observed magnitude of the DMI and Nino34 index, respectively, in Sep–Oct 2016. Contouring/shading is as in 
   <span class="bold">a</span> and 
   <span class="bold">b</span>, except RWS interval is 2 × 10
   <span class="sup">−11</span> s
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, and eddy streamfunction interval is 1 × 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> m
   <span class="sup">2</span>s. Anomalies and regression coefficients are shown only for 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.10 using two-sided 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-test. For clarity, divergent wind weaker than 0.8 ms
   <span class="sup">−1</span> in 
   <span class="bold">a</span>, and weaker than 0.3 ms
   <span class="sup">−1</span> in 
   <span class="bold">c</span> and

   <span class="sup">2</span>s
   <span class="sup">−2</span> in 
   <span class="bold">b</span>, and weaker than 0.1 m
   <span class="sup">2</span>s
   <span class="sup">−2</span> in 
   <span class="bold">d</span> and 
   <span class="bold">f</span> are masked. In the Southern Hemisphere, negative streamfunction anomaly corresponds to positive geopotential height anomaly and thus is coloured in reds; similarly, positive streamfunction anomaly is coloured in blues.
