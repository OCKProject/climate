 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Researchers continue to improve models for projecting individual glacier changes. For example, several studies have used the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) to project changes in Greenland glaciers, including Store Gletscher in western Greenland [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>•]. These projections incorporate ocean-induced terminus melt and up-to-date subglacial topography and bathymetry, which is key to determining rates of ice loss.
