 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sophisticated dynamical ice sheet models are used to estimate future Greenland mass changes resulting from modified SMB and ice flow [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. These models can be run either in standalone mode with prescribed climate forcing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>•], or within coupled climate models [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. The models are validated by comparison to observed ice sheet area, thickness, and velocity, and are starting to be used to hindcast recent changes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>•]. Computer models can also simulate aggregated mass losses from the Earth’s glaciers [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. Compared to ice sheet models, global glacier models typically have simplified dynamics, focusing on SMB changes or process understanding.
