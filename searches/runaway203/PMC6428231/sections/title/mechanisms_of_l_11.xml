 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The warming atmosphere and ocean are the foundational cause for accelerating Arctic ice loss, but it is useful to consider the specific mechanisms driving ice loss. Understanding these mechanisms is particularly important for the challenge of understanding ice loss 
  <span class="italic">rates</span>. Ice loss fits into two broad categories: loss due to changes in SMB and loss due to iceberg calving, often called dynamic ice loss. SMB changes arise from variations in solar and longwave radiation, air temperature, and the amount and phase of precipitation (rain or snow). Other surface processes, like refreezing of surface melt water in the glacier firn [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>•] or increased surface melt due to a lower albedo (e.g., from algae growth [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] or changes in ice crystal size [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]), also affect SMB.

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solid ice discharge requires a marine connection. The rate of ice discharge is determined by the speed of glacier motion and the advance or retreat of the glacier ice front (a.k.a., terminus). Ice front stability can be influenced by ocean temperature and melt at the terminus and by glacier thinning from surface or bottom melt [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Topography and buttressing are also primary controls on the progression and rate of ice loss for marine-terminating glaciers [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Retrograde slopes that become deeper up-glacier increase retreat and ice loss, while buttressing from floating ice can enhance stability, and even small-scale topographic highs can act as pinning points [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>•]. Vertical fjord geometry also plays a role, with narrow fjord areas stabilizing glacier position [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the GrIS and other large marine-connected ice caps and glaciers, the timescales and range of variability for SMB and dynamic discharge are different. SMB has higher year-to-year variability than solid ice discharge because it can respond quickly to atmospheric changes. For example, record GrIS melt years with exceptional mass loss in 2010 and 2012 helped to shift the SMB-to-discharge ratio from roughly 50:50 during 2000–2005 to 68:32 during 2009–2012 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Due to increased ablation and limits on increasing ice discharge, the future contribution of SMB changes relative to solid ice discharge is expected to increase across the Arctic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>].
