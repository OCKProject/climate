 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perennial firn aquifers, liquid water bodies in the firn, were found in southeast Greenland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>] on the heels of research highlighting the potential storage capacity of firn [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>]. These studies contributed to an increased focus on the hydrological systems of glaciers and ice sheets, and subsequent research shows that firn aquifers are dynamic storage environments [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>]. Runoff retention in firn, however, is limited both by pore space and by development of near-surface ice lenses, which cut off access to open pore space [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>•]. Early speculation that firn storage may substantially reduce near-term meltwater runoff from Greenland (including its peripheral glaciers and ice caps) seems to have been dashed by these recent findings, with a tipping point in firn capacity perhaps reached as early as 1997 [
