 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The limited length of observational records continues to pose a challenge for assessing long-term trends, particularly before the satellite era. Data recovery from old photos, application of field techniques to map previous ice extents, and model hindcasts are helping to fill out the record [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>]. Analysis reaching back to 1900, for example, indicates that Greenland mass loss rose substantially during 2003–2010 (186.4 ± 18.9 Gt/year) as compared to 1900–1983 (75.1 ± 29.4 Gt/year) and 1983–2003 (73.8 ± 40.5 Gt/year) [
