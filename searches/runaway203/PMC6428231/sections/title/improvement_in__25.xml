 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since even small scale (&lt; 1 km wide) features can alter retreat rates, subglacial topography is a key dataset for projecting ice loss rates. Improved knowledge of other subglacial properties (e.g., geothermal heat flux and basal drag) and ice thickness changes across space and time are also critical for accurately modeling rates of change.</p>
