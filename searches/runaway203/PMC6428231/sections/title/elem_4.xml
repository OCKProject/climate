  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>••, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>••], of which about 97% is stored in the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Land ice loss is accelerating due to rapid system-wide changes in Arctic climate, predominantly caused by human greenhouse gas emissions. Across the Arctic, temperatures are rising much faster than the global mean; during 1880–2012, the Arctic warmed ~ 3.5 °C compared to 0.85 °C for the Earth overall (1880–2012) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>••]. Arctic climate change is causing variations in ocean temperature and changing atmospheric and cloud conditions. These changes influence land ice and, together, are melting substantial amounts of ice and raising sea levels across the globe. In this brief review, we focus on the scientific results and advances over the last 3–5 years, remaining challenges for understanding land ice loss from the Arctic, and the implications for sea level rise.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land ice is a single component of the larger sea level rise budget, but an increasingly important one [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Current global average sea level rise is the combined result of steric changes caused by thermal expansion of ocean water and barystatic changes caused by the melting of land ice and a relatively small contribution from changes in land water storage. The primary influence of land ice loss is an increase in ocean water mass as solid ice mass is removed from land and added to the ocean. Many studies of total sea level change use ocean surface height or Earth gravity field measurements to examine sea level rise as a whole [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>•,

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Parsing the different contributors helps us to understand the rates of past, present, and future sea level rise, as well as how local and regional sea level rise will differ from the global average due to factors such as the location of ice loss, differences in land subsidence, and variations in oceanic and atmospheric circulation. Arctic land ice loss is and will continue to be a primary contributor to sea level rise. Other ice-covered regions, especially the Antarctic Ice Sheet, are also making a growing contribution to sea level rise but are not considered in this paper.

  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measuring mass change in glaciers and ice sheets is not straightforward. A variety of techniques are well established, however, and measurements of Arctic ice loss are in good agreement [

The advent of satellite monitoring in the 1990s was a major advance for studying large ice areas, and our ability to estimate ice mass loss has correspondingly improved in the beginning of the twenty-first century. Long-term in situ monitoring projects and paleo-glaciological studies have helped to extend the historical record and provide upper and lower limits on sea level rise from past land ice loss. Below, we briefly outline the techniques most commonly used to determine mass balance. All have advantages and disadvantages, discussed in more detail elsewhere [

While separating ocean mass change from land ice mass change and correcting for vertical land motion requires careful processing, gravity measurements produce high-quality data on ice mass changes, especially for large ice areas like Greenland [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>].

Laser and radar altimetry data from airborne (e.g., Operation IceBridge, PROMICE) and satellite (e.g., ICESat, Cryosat2) platforms is useful for small and large ice areas [

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. It can be difficult, however, to retrieve altimetry measurements over rugged, steeply sloped ice sheet margins, and processing must account for radar penetration into the surface snow or firn. Relying on remote sensing instruments, these records are concentrated within the first two decades of the twenty-first century.

   <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mass change of an ice body is the difference between the input (mainly snow accumulation through precipitation) and the output (surface melting and runoff, along with the discharge of solid ice to the ocean). Scientists calculate this mass budget by combining data or modeling of the surface mass balance (SMB)—the difference between accumulation and ablation at the ice surface—with information about ice dynamics, such as iceberg calving. (Meltwater that refreezes in the snowpack is not part of the SMB, since it does not alter the mass.) The result is not a measure of total mass but of mass change over some period (usually on annual or longer time scales) [

   <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in length, volume, and mass have been monitored routinely for a small number of individual glaciers, some for more than a century. Those glaciological data (e.g., in situ stake measurements) and geodetic observations have been compiled by the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) for several hundred glaciers, including many in the Arctic. Although labor-intensive and limited in spatial coverage (hence not ideal for ice sheets), these measurements provide a high-fidelity record of glacier mass balance changes from the early twentieth century through the present [

   <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another technique applied to glaciers and ice caps is volume-area scaling [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Based on dimensional analysis, glacier volume can be estimated from area and length, which are easier to measure. While there are large uncertainties in converting area and length changes to mass changes, this method can take advantage of multi-decadal records for hundreds of the Earth’s glaciers.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mechanisms of Land Ice Loss</div>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The warming atmosphere and ocean are the foundational cause for accelerating Arctic ice loss, but it is useful to consider the specific mechanisms driving ice loss. Understanding these mechanisms is particularly important for the challenge of understanding ice loss 
   <span class="italic">rates</span>. Ice loss fits into two broad categories: loss due to changes in SMB and loss due to iceberg calving, often called dynamic ice loss. SMB changes arise from variations in solar and longwave radiation, air temperature, and the amount and phase of precipitation (rain or snow). Other surface processes, like refreezing of surface melt water in the glacier firn [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>•] or increased surface melt due to a lower albedo (e.g., from algae growth [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>] or changes in ice crystal size [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]), also affect SMB.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solid ice discharge requires a marine connection. The rate of ice discharge is determined by the speed of glacier motion and the advance or retreat of the glacier ice front (a.k.a., terminus). Ice front stability can be influenced by ocean temperature and melt at the terminus and by glacier thinning from surface or bottom melt [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>•, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. Topography and buttressing are also primary controls on the progression and rate of ice loss for marine-terminating glaciers [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>•, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Retrograde slopes that become deeper up-glacier increase retreat and ice loss, while buttressing from floating ice can enhance stability, and even small-scale topographic highs can act as pinning points [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>•]. Vertical fjord geometry also plays a role, with narrow fjord areas stabilizing glacier position [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the GrIS and other large marine-connected ice caps and glaciers, the timescales and range of variability for SMB and dynamic discharge are different. SMB has higher year-to-year variability than solid ice discharge because it can respond quickly to atmospheric changes. For example, record GrIS melt years with exceptional mass loss in 2010 and 2012 helped to shift the SMB-to-discharge ratio from roughly 50:50 during 2000–2005 to 68:32 during 2009–2012 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Due to increased ablation and limits on increasing ice discharge, the future contribution of SMB changes relative to solid ice discharge is expected to increase across the Arctic [

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ice loss from Greenland accelerated over the beginning of the twenty-first century and will continue to be the largest source of Arctic land ice loss. The ice sheet was likely close to a balanced state during the 1970s and 1980s but transitioned into negative mass balance beginning in the early to mid 1990s [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>••, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Ice loss during 2003–2013 averaged 280 ± 58 Gt/year [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>], which is consistent with a wide range of mass loss studies [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>••]. This decadal average, however, masks the more important point: Greenland ice loss has accelerated rapidly. Acceleration during 2003–2013 was 25 ± 1.2 Gt/year
   <span class="sup">2</span> [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>], and there is no indication that this trend will stop. Ice loss during 2009–2012, for example, was ~ 360–380 Gt/year [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. These losses translate into a mean 2003–2013 sea level rise contribution of 0.8 ± 0.2 mm/year. Contributions during the record year of 2012 reached as high as 1.2 ± 0.3 mm/year [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Since 2000, all sectors of the ice sheet have lost ice [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>••], though the southern portion of the GrIS is more sensitive to climate warming and may be further out of balance than the northern portion during coming decades [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Greenland transitioned to negative mass balance, changes in SMB and solid ice discharge contributed roughly similar amounts to mass loss [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Record melt years in 2010 and 2012, however, skewed this balance towards greater contributions from SMB [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>], with an expectation that this gap will widen in the future [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. The spatial pattern of ice loss and gain also varies across Greenland. Remote sensing data from the ice sheet interior suggest mass gain, with a 2007–2011 average additional mass accumulation of 41 ± 61 Gt/year for regions ≥ 1700 m above sea level [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>•]. This increase, however, is more than offset by enhanced ablation and solid ice discharge at lower elevations.
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modes of climate variability, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and atmospheric blocking events, all influence ice loss [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>•]. For example, the NAO modulates regional Greenland precipitation, with increased east coast precipitation in a negative NAO phase and increased west coast precipitation in a positive NAO phase [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Similarly, increasing surface melt in southwestern Greenland has been tied to a recent atmospheric shift towards more frequent meridional exchange events during atmospheric blocking over Greenland [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Shifts in the NAO have also been linked to decreased Greenland cloud cover from 1995 to 2009, increasing surface melt [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>], and to reduced glacier retreat in parts of the Russian High Arctic [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural climate variability was the primary driver in earlier Greenland ice loss. Records back to the nineteenth century show that there were periods of substantial Greenland glacier retreat and ice loss following the Little Ice Age (LIA; ending roughly 1890–1910) and during the 1930s–1940s warm period. However, glaciers at the start of the LIA were longer than today, reaching lower elevations and flatter terrain at their termini [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>], and thus were sensitive to small temperature changes. Natural variability will also influence mass balance in the future, and we should not be surprised by years of little or no mass loss (e.g., during 2013 in Greenland [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>••]). Because natural variability is now superimposed upon a dominant baseline trend of human-caused warming, however, there is no expectation of long-term (decadal or longer) cooling or opportunity for long-term glacier or ice sheet growth.

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arctic regions outside of Greenland are also losing substantial quantities of ice [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>••]. Alaska is currently the second largest contributor to Arctic ice loss (trailing well behind the main GrIS). GRACE measurements provide a range of ice loss estimates, from 68.8 ± 11.0 Gt/year during 2003–2010 for the Gulf of Alaska total [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>] to 36 ± 4 Gt/year in the northern Gulf of Alaska and 4 ± 3 Gt/year in the southern Gulf of Alaska during 2003–2013 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. Altimetry-based measurements during 1994–2013 give 75 ± 11 Gt/year ice loss [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>•], overall supporting the larger GRACE estimate. With 70% of Alaska ice loss attributable to land-terminating glaciers, it is clear that SMB is the primary cause of Alaskan ice mass loss [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. Like Alaska, Canadian Arctic ice loss is dominated by surface melting, which contributed ~ 92% of the total ice loss during 2003–2009 [

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">103</a>, 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">104</a>]. It remains challenging, however, to resolve sub-km processes on long time scales and to capture the full range of dynamics from narrow fast-flowing glaciers to large slow-moving regions. Second, models must accurately simulate migration of the grounding line (the boundary between grounded and floating ice), which requires not only high grid resolution but also accurate bed topography [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>•]. Third, models need to better represent key physical processes such as ice fracture and calving, surface darkening, englacial and subglacial hydrology, subaqueous melting, and sea ice and ice mélange buttressing.

   <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High-resolution models with more realistic physics will enable detailed simulations of small, distinct glacier regions. For example, modeling efforts project a slow, steady retreat for Greenland’s Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79 North), in contrast to a rapid multi-decade retreat for Zachariae Isstrøm once it loses its floating ice tongue, with subglacial topography acting as the primary control [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>•]. This type of capability needs to continue to expand towards capturing larger multi-glacier regions and, eventually, the full ice sheet. We may see Arctic-wide glacier projections within the coming decade, especially as model boundary conditions (e.g., bed topography) and parameterizations for ice-ocean interaction improve.
