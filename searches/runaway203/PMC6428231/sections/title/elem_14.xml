 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Substantial research, particularly over the last one to two decades, has focused on understanding and projecting Arctic ice loss, leading to the various estimates outlined above. Earlier papers have discussed progress along the way [

  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence has been mounting that glaciers are declining worldwide, with the few exceptions attributed to local differences in climate change response (e.g., increased precipitation). Recent statistical analysis confirms that local glacier retreat (occurring globally) provides categorical evidence of climate change [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>•, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>]. Quantifying the link between anthropogenic climate change and land ice loss supports the use of glacier and ice sheet retreat, and associated sea level rise, as a visually powerful example of the impacts of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.

  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The limited length of observational records continues to pose a challenge for assessing long-term trends, particularly before the satellite era. Data recovery from old photos, application of field techniques to map previous ice extents, and model hindcasts are helping to fill out the record [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>•, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>]. Analysis reaching back to 1900, for example, indicates that Greenland mass loss rose substantially during 2003–2010 (186.4 ± 18.9 Gt/year) as compared to 1900–1983 (75.1 ± 29.4 Gt/year) and 1983–2003 (73.8 ± 40.5 Gt/year) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>]. These efforts confirm that we are now in an era of exceptionally rapid global ice loss.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>], changing gravity fields [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>•], and continue to build a longer-term record of change. Spatially comprehensive datasets also provide accurate model boundary conditions. The value of consistent satellite-based glacier and ice sheet measurements is difficult to overstate, and these data play a central role in estimating mass change.

  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because surface mass balance will play an increasingly dominant role in Arctic ice loss, surface processes such as darkening have received increased focus. Recent work establishes that Greenland summertime surface albedo decreased significantly (0.02 per decade) during 1996–2012, in contrast to 1981–1996, which showed no significant albedo trend [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>••]. This darkening trend is projected to continue [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>••]. Likely contributors to darkening include snow grain growth, light-absorbing impurities (black carbon, organic carbon, dust), bare ice exposure, surface meltwater, and biological activity [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. Research continues to determine the relative importance of each, now and into the future [

  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perennial firn aquifers, liquid water bodies in the firn, were found in southeast Greenland [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>] on the heels of research highlighting the potential storage capacity of firn [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>]. These studies contributed to an increased focus on the hydrological systems of glaciers and ice sheets, and subsequent research shows that firn aquifers are dynamic storage environments [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>]. Runoff retention in firn, however, is limited both by pore space and by development of near-surface ice lenses, which cut off access to open pore space [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>•]. Early speculation that firn storage may substantially reduce near-term meltwater runoff from Greenland (including its peripheral glaciers and ice caps) seems to have been dashed by these recent findings, with a tipping point in firn capacity perhaps reached as early as 1997 [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">97</a>] sparked a surge in research on the coupling between marine-terminating glaciers and the ocean. Subaqueous melt has increased since the 1990s, as a result of increased subglacial discharge and warmer subsurface ocean water [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">98</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>], but the impact on individual glaciers varies due to local topography, calving rate, and ice front melt rate [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>]. Subaqueous melt also plays a major role in mass loss for floating ice tongues. Some ice tongues remain in the Arctic, though others (e.g., Greenland’s Jakobhavn Isbræ and Petermann Glacier) have recently decayed or retreated substantially.

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subglacial topography is a primary control on the rate and extent of glacier retreat in response to climate forcing. Fortunately, scientific efforts continue to measure subglacial topography and improve interpolation methods in unsampled regions [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">100</a>]. For Greenland, new measurements have been incorporated into the most recent subglacial map (using mass conservation for interpolation) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>••], and this map includes estimates of near-ice bathymetry, incorporating a new method for interpolating fjord geometry [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">101</a>]. Large uncertainties remain, however, in some areas of Greenland, and determining subglacial topography (and associated ice thickness) for small outlet glaciers remains problematic. Subglacial topography data for other areas of the Arctic varies in quality, and improved data continues to be a high science priority.

  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In translating land ice loss into sea level rise, the mass loss is commonly treated as total regional sums. However, the location of land ice loss (e.g., northern versus southern sectors of the GrIS) influences the location and magnitude of sea level rise. With recent improvements in projecting localized land ice loss and interpreting that loss into far-field sea level rise, local and regional sea-level estimates can be tied to the spatial partitioning of ice loss, reducing the range of predictions [

  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Together, these advances give a clearer view of ongoing Arctic ice losses, improve understanding of the processes that control ice loss rates, and aid translation of ice loss observations into actionable sea level projections for decision makers.</p>
