 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subglacial topography is a primary control on the rate and extent of glacier retreat in response to climate forcing. Fortunately, scientific efforts continue to measure subglacial topography and improve interpolation methods in unsampled regions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">100</a>]. For Greenland, new measurements have been incorporated into the most recent subglacial map (using mass conservation for interpolation) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>••], and this map includes estimates of near-ice bathymetry, incorporating a new method for interpolating fjord geometry [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">101</a>]. Large uncertainties remain, however, in some areas of Greenland, and determining subglacial topography (and associated ice thickness) for small outlet glaciers remains problematic. Subglacial topography data for other areas of the Arctic varies in quality, and improved data continues to be a high science priority.
