  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>], changing gravity fields [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>], and surface elevation and ice thickness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>••]. These data reveal the spatial variability of ice behavior [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>], improve our understanding of seasonal patterns of ice behavior [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>•], and continue to build a longer-term record of change. Spatially comprehensive datasets also provide accurate model boundary conditions. The value of consistent satellite-based glacier and ice sheet measurements is difficult to overstate, and these data play a central role in estimating mass change.
