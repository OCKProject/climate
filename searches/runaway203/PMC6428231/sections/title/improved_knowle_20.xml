  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>], but the impact on individual glaciers varies due to local topography, calving rate, and ice front melt rate [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>]. Subaqueous melt also plays a major role in mass loss for floating ice tongues. Some ice tongues remain in the Arctic, though others (e.g., Greenland’s Jakobhavn Isbræ and Petermann Glacier) have recently decayed or retreated substantially.
