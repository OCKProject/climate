 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in length, volume, and mass have been monitored routinely for a small number of individual glaciers, some for more than a century. Those glaciological data (e.g., in situ stake measurements) and geodetic observations have been compiled by the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) for several hundred glaciers, including many in the Arctic. Although labor-intensive and limited in spatial coverage (hence not ideal for ice sheets), these measurements provide a high-fidelity record of glacier mass balance changes from the early twentieth century through the present [

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another technique applied to glaciers and ice caps is volume-area scaling [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Based on dimensional analysis, glacier volume can be estimated from area and length, which are easier to measure. While there are large uncertainties in converting area and length changes to mass changes, this method can take advantage of multi-decadal records for hundreds of the Earth’s glaciers.
