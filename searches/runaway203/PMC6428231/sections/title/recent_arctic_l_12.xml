 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observational record of widespread Arctic (and global) land ice loss over the last two to three decades is well established, with significant contributions to global sea level rise. The magnitude of ice loss varies across the Arctic. Current GrIS contributions are roughly double those from other Arctic glaciers and ice caps. The ranking of recent (~2003–2009) Arctic mass loss from most to least is GrIS alone (~ 360 Gt/year), Alaska (~ 50 Gt/year), Greenland peripheral glaciers and ice caps (~ 38 Gt/year), North Canadian Arctic (~ 33 Gt/year), South Canadian Arctic (~ 27 Gt/year), Russian High Arctic and Iceland (~ 11 Gt/year each), and Svalbard (~ 5 Gt/year) [

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ice loss from Greenland accelerated over the beginning of the twenty-first century and will continue to be the largest source of Arctic land ice loss. The ice sheet was likely close to a balanced state during the 1970s and 1980s but transitioned into negative mass balance beginning in the early to mid 1990s [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>••, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Ice loss during 2003–2013 averaged 280 ± 58 Gt/year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>], which is consistent with a wide range of mass loss studies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>••]. This decadal average, however, masks the more important point: Greenland ice loss has accelerated rapidly. Acceleration during 2003–2013 was 25 ± 1.2 Gt/year
  <span class="sup">2</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>], and there is no indication that this trend will stop. Ice loss during 2009–2012, for example, was ~ 360–380 Gt/year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. These losses translate into a mean 2003–2013 sea level rise contribution of 0.8 ± 0.2 mm/year. Contributions during the record year of 2012 reached as high as 1.2 ± 0.3 mm/year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>]. Since 2000, all sectors of the ice sheet have lost ice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>••], though the southern portion of the GrIS is more sensitive to climate warming and may be further out of balance than the northern portion during coming decades [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Greenland transitioned to negative mass balance, changes in SMB and solid ice discharge contributed roughly similar amounts to mass loss [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. Record melt years in 2010 and 2012, however, skewed this balance towards greater contributions from SMB [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>], with an expectation that this gap will widen in the future [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. The spatial pattern of ice loss and gain also varies across Greenland. Remote sensing data from the ice sheet interior suggest mass gain, with a 2007–2011 average additional mass accumulation of 41 ± 61 Gt/year for regions ≥ 1700 m above sea level [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>•]. This increase, however, is more than offset by enhanced ablation and solid ice discharge at lower elevations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modes of climate variability, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and atmospheric blocking events, all influence ice loss [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>•]. For example, the NAO modulates regional Greenland precipitation, with increased east coast precipitation in a negative NAO phase and increased west coast precipitation in a positive NAO phase [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>]. Similarly, increasing surface melt in southwestern Greenland has been tied to a recent atmospheric shift towards more frequent meridional exchange events during atmospheric blocking over Greenland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Shifts in the NAO have also been linked to decreased Greenland cloud cover from 1995 to 2009, increasing surface melt [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>], and to reduced glacier retreat in parts of the Russian High Arctic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural climate variability was the primary driver in earlier Greenland ice loss. Records back to the nineteenth century show that there were periods of substantial Greenland glacier retreat and ice loss following the Little Ice Age (LIA; ending roughly 1890–1910) and during the 1930s–1940s warm period. However, glaciers at the start of the LIA were longer than today, reaching lower elevations and flatter terrain at their termini [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>], and thus were sensitive to small temperature changes. Natural variability will also influence mass balance in the future, and we should not be surprised by years of little or no mass loss (e.g., during 2013 in Greenland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>••]). Because natural variability is now superimposed upon a dominant baseline trend of human-caused warming, however, there is no expectation of long-term (decadal or longer) cooling or opportunity for long-term glacier or ice sheet growth.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arctic regions outside of Greenland are also losing substantial quantities of ice [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>••]. Alaska is currently the second largest contributor to Arctic ice loss (trailing well behind the main GrIS). GRACE measurements provide a range of ice loss estimates, from 68.8 ± 11.0 Gt/year during 2003–2010 for the Gulf of Alaska total [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>] to 36 ± 4 Gt/year in the northern Gulf of Alaska and 4 ± 3 Gt/year in the southern Gulf of Alaska during 2003–2013 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. Altimetry-based measurements during 1994–2013 give 75 ± 11 Gt/year ice loss [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>] and 50 ± 17 Gt/year during 2003–2009 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>•], overall supporting the larger GRACE estimate. With 70% of Alaska ice loss attributable to land-terminating glaciers, it is clear that SMB is the primary cause of Alaskan ice mass loss [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Canadian Arctic archipelago contains roughly one third of the Earth’s ice outside the AIS and GrIS [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>]. GRACE estimates show mass losses of 72 ± 4 Gt/year during 2004–2011, with 2004–2006 losses at the lower rate of 31 ± 8 Gt/year compared to 92 ± 12 Gt/year for 2007–2009 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. Like Alaska, Canadian Arctic ice loss is dominated by surface melting, which contributed ~ 92% of the total ice loss during 2003–2009 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. Total mass loss has been somewhat greater in the North Canadian Arctic (38 ± 2 Gt/year) than the South (22 ± 2 Gt/year), with greater acceleration in the North during 2003–2013 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. GRACE measurements for Ellesmere and Devon Island indicate that ice loss was minimal during 2002–2008 but accelerated after 2008 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>••]. The Canadian Arctic currently contributes ~ 0.17 mm/year to rising seas [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>••].
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Russian High Arctic contains roughly 20% of Arctic glacier ice outside of Greenland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>••], with glacier ice concentrated on the Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, and Franz Josef Land archipelagos. As with other Arctic regions, there was substantial ice loss and glacier retreat in the Russian Arctic during the first two decades of the twenty-first century as compared to the last quarter of the twentieth century (with earlier observations largely absent) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>]. Ice loss estimates from the Russian High Arctic during 2003–2009 range from 9.1 Gt/year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>] to 11 Gt/year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>•], with other research finding a regional mass balance of − 6.9 ± 7.4 Gt/year during 2004–2012 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. More than 80% of Russian High Arctic ice loss during 2003–2009 occurred in Novaya Zemlya [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>]. Currently, the Russian High Arctic contributes ~ 0.03 mm/year to sea level rise [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>••].
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Vatnajökull Ice Cap contains ~ 80% of the glacial ice in Iceland, with other small glaciated areas also mostly in the southeast [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>]. GRACE observations of Iceland show average losses of 10.9 ± 2.1 Gt/year during 2004–2012 (~ 0.03 mm/year of sea level rise), with a notable negative trend over the period [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. This estimate compares well with altimetry-based calculations of 10 ± 2 Gt/year during 2003–2009 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>•]. The 2004–2012 average is a substantial increase from field-based estimates of 2.4 ± 2.2 Gt/year of ice loss during 1961–2003, though the extrapolation required for this calculation introduces substantial uncertainty [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Svalbard has had the smallest mass loss of the regions discussed here. Surface mass balance estimates over 2003–2009 give a loss of 5 ± 2 Gt/year [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>•], and total mass balance estimates over 2004–2013 (including both ice front ablation and SMB) indicate losses of 13.4 Gt/year, corresponding to 0.037 mm/year of sea-level rise [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>]. Using a climate reanalysis-forced model to determine Svalbard mass changes over 1957–2014 suggests that the current negative mass balance regime began in roughly 1980 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>]. Greater mass loss is projected in the future [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>,
