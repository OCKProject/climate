 <div class="caption">
  <p>Expanded views of climatic events and phases within the ~36 Myr cycle extrema. The term ‘phase’ opposes to the term ‘event’: ‘event’ indicates abrupt, severe change, whereas ‘phase’ indicates gradual/progressive trend in climate change that could reach an optimum (see below). I also used the term ‘episode’ to designate either event or phase. 
   <span class="bold">(a)</span> The gradual entry of the Earth into the Pliocene-Pleistocene ice age (IA) as expressed in the trend (40% weighted average). Note that there is no trend during the 100-kyr-cycle dominated climate of the past ca. 800 ka. 
   <span class="bold">(b)</span> Gradual variations within the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, MMCO (35% weighted average). 
   <span class="bold">(c)</span> Abrupt change within the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) including the Oi-1 glacial event (15% weighted average). 
   <span class="bold">(d)</span> Gradual variations within the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, EECO (35% weighted average). Note that the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, PETM, corresponds to a deviation from the long-term cycling within the EECO, and is the most abrupt, severe event in the Cenozoic era.
