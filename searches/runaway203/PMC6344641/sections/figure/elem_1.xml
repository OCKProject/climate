   <span class="sup">18</span>O data of the interval from 0 to 115 Ma (see Methods) and of its time-equivalent astronomical variations. 
   <span class="bold">(a)</span> Upper panel: Spectrum of the detrended δ

   <span class="sup">18</span>O after the detrend (50% weighted average of the series is removed). Significant spectral periods are shown across vertical grey bars. 
   <span class="bold">(b)</span> Upper panel: Spectrum of lowpass filtered (&gt;1 Myr), composite astronomical time series of the interval 0 to 115 Ma (see Methods), the power axis is a logarithmic scale for comparison with spectra in ‘a’, lower panel: Spectrum of the same astronomical time series (power in linear scale) but over the interval from 0 to 146 Ma (Cenozoic and Cretaceous time). The most prominent astronomical periods and origins of some of them are shown across vertical grey bars, periods indicated by asterisk may represent minor components. Note that the ~9 Myr δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O cyclicity originates from the interfering astronomical terms 2 and 2.6 Myr (see Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). The 16.3 Myr δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O period may correspond to a harmonic or may originate from the couple interfering terms 2 Myr vs 2.3 Myr and 2.3 Myr vs 2.6 Myr.
