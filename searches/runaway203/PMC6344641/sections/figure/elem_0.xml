   <span class="sup">18</span>O data (third-order polynomial fit shown in ‘a’ is removed) with two smoothing fits: a 14% weighted-average fit to highlight the 36 Myr cycles, and a 4% weighted-average fit to highlight both the ~9 and ~36 Myr cycles. The well known climatic events are shown: IA: Pliocene-Pleistocenbe Ice Age, MMCO: Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, Mi-1 and Oi-1: Oligocene-Miocene and Eocene-Oligocene major glacial events, MECO: Mid-Eocene Climatic Optimum, EECO: Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, PETM: Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, K/T: Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary, EMaC: Early Maastrichtian Cooling episode, OAE2 and OAE1b: Oceanic Anoxic Events.
