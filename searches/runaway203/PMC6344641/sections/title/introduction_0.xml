 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earth’s past climate has varied quasi-periodically from hundred to billion years, and these variations were driven by celestial dynamics over a large frequency band

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. In particular, Earth’s climate during the Cenozoic-Late Cretaceous (past 115 million years, Ma) experienced long-term (multi-million year, multi-Myr) changes punctuated by severe, short-lived events

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. The multi-Myr climatic variations have often been considered irregular (acyclic) in nature on the very long term
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. This has led to the hypothesis that these changes were mainly driven by Earth’s interior dynamics and plate tectonic motions assuming that these processes are acyclic in nature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, although more recent studies point to the cyclic behavior of large plate tectonic motions

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. The climatic events have been intensively investigated in terms of their heavy impacts and consequences on Earth’s superficial systems, in particular the resulting profound modifications in ocean and terrestrial environments, expressed as perturbations in the sedimentary biogeochemical cycles

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Delineating the cyclic versus acyclic nature of multi-Myr climatic variations and their potential link with the climatic events is of paramount importance in deciphering the origin of events and thus their causal mechanisms. However, the study of multi-Myr climatic variations requires the acquisition of high-resolution data covering several million years, hence hampering the characterization of long-term cycling in previous studies

  </span>. New advancements in laboratory analytical techniques together with large collaborative projects allow today the availability of a highly resolved 115-Myr-long climate record from sedimentary benthic foraminifera δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O (see Methods). The δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O record indicates variations in deep-sea temperature as well as changes in ice volume
