  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Comparison of δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C data shows a coupling between climate and carbon cycle at the ~9 Myr cycle band, especially during icehouse, i.e. the past 34 Ma (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). A strong decoupling between them is remarkably noted within the interval from 50 to 65 Ma as follows. While the δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C document the two strongest ~9 Myr cycles Cb7 and Cb8 of the early Cenozoic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O has exceptionally only one oscillation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>, see also Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>).

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The origin of ~9 Myr cyclicity has previously been attributed to the modulation of 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycle band
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Here I investigate additional statistical tests to support the modulation at the 2.4 Myr cycle band, but with possible contribution from both eccentricity and obliquity terms (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>, and Supplementary Figures 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>). Prominent ~9 Myr geological oscillations have been detected in carbon-cycle and sedimentological proxies of Cenozoic and Mesozoic strata

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, I note four ~9 Myr oscillations grouped in each ~36 Myr cycle (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b,c</a>), suggesting a relationship between these two climatic cyclicities. Previous studies ascribed the ~36 Myr climatic variability to another dimension of astronomical forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. In particular, the ~36 Myr period has been attributed to the vertical passage of the Solar System through the Galactic midplane that modulates the flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) on Earth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Despite our limited knowledge on the gravitational potential of the Galaxy, there is some consensus that the Solar System vertically oscillates across the Galactic midplane, with a half-period of about 36 Myr
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. This effective 36 Myr half-period corresponds to the motion of the Solar System when it moves down- and upwards the galactic midplane. This would induce significant change in GCR flux on Earth, especially when crossing the galactic midplane. This would favor the formation of cloud layer from the incidental GCR flux on Earth, hence resulting in variations of Earth’s albedo and the consequent climate change

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. Yet, the impact of cosmic ray on climate remains a controversial subject
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. Another possible hypothesis is that Earth’s interior dynamics may resonate every 36 Myr inducing global climate change, although recent studies pointed to different periodicities of 25 to 50 Myr
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span> and 56 Myr
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. A combined effect from the aforcited mechanisms on climate is presumably
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. The most intriguing result in time-series analysis of δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O climatic proxy is the record of both ~9 and ~36 Myr oscillations, sharing very likely the same forcing process. While the ~9 Myr periodicity may represent a Milankovitch origin, the ~36 periodicity could be forced by solar system vertical motion, that could in turn modulate Earth’s incident (Milankovitch) insolation, or may correspond to a not resolved Milankovitch band. Although I draw attention to climate and astronomy linkage at the scale of ~9 and ~36 Myr periods, we must caution that the effect of tectonics on climate at this timescale remains well plausible

 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along climate-proxy variations in the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras (past 0–250 Ma) were recognized and widely studied a number of climatic events
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. The studied interval includes some of them (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). Features and nature of Earth’s system responses to these perturbations differ from one event to another
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, however, tectonic-volcanic mechanisms were thought to be the principal, common cause for most of the events
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, I show that most of Cenozoic–Cretaceous climatic events and phases (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> for definition of ‘event’ versus ‘phase’) during the past 115 Ma fall into extremes in amplitudes of the ~9 and ~36 Myr cyclicities (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For instance, the so-called Oi-1 and Mi-1 glacial episodes are close to the ~9 Myr cycle extremes (Ox4, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). The Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO), which represents a warming phase, bounds ~9 Myr Ox2 and Ox3 δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O oscillations (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> caption for ‘Ox’ cycle numbering). Importantly, some of the events coincide with extremes in the ~36 Myr cycling, thus, they would be with greater magnitudes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The three cooling/glacial episodes at Pliocene-Pleistocene Ice Age (IA), Eocene-Oligocene glacial event (Oi-1) and Early Maastrichtian Cooling phase (EMaC) correspond to maxima of the ~36 Myr δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O cycles. The two warming phases of Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO) and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) coincide with the ~36 Myr cycle minima. Finally, the globally recognized Oceanic Anoxic Event OAE-2 occurs around a minimum of the ~36 Myr δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O cyclicity. In contrast, the early Cenozoic hyperthermals including the most pronounced Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) event do not match extremes in the long-term cycling. The relative variance of the ~36 Myr δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O cyclicity is more than three times higher than that of the ~9 Myr cyclicity. This implies that events (and phases) matching only extremes in the ~9 Myr cycles are with lesser intensities compared to events (and phases) in relation with the ~36 Myr oscillations. However, Earth’s climate response to the forcing processes at the ~9 and ~36 Myr cycle bands from astronomy, for example, could not be direct, because insolation (or GCR) change at these very longer timescales should be weak (see below).
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most striking result is the match between ~9 and ~36 Myr cycle extremes and most of the Cenozoic-Cretaceous events. This result hints at a coupling between Earth’s climate cycling and perturbations. The ~9 and ~36 Myr cyclicities could have an astronomical and/or a tectonic origin (see above). The events have been postulated to be caused by tectonics, volcanism, pCO
  <sub>2</sub> trend, etc.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I suggest that among the events in relation with long-period cyclicities some of them may have been mainly related to cyclic process, others may have been the result of combined effects of acyclic and cyclic processes. The IA, MMCO, EECO and possibly EMaC
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> show gradual variations (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), thus they may mainly be the result of a cyclic forcing. The Oi-1 and OAE-2
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> show abrupt changes (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), thus they may occur acyclically, but could also be triggered by a cyclic mechanism. Large-scale (multi-Myr) Milankovitch astronomical forcing would induce negligible changes in insolation (or GCR) budget on Earth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, hence a nonlinear mechanism is required to explain the match between the long-period astroclimatic cycles and events. Energy transfer process from higher to lower frequency driving forces has previously been suggested
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, but this process cannot argue the match between the cycles and events. An astronomically forced gravitational distortion of Earth’s viscose mantle in boundary conditions may explain the potential link between cycle extremes and events at the multi-Myr timescales. Astronomical control of gravitational deformation (e.g., dynamical ellipticity)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span> of the mantle at boundary conditions would result in intensification of mantle convection, and the occurrence of climate events, which have been argued to be paced by processes from Earth’s interior dynamics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Also, feedback responses of Earth’s interior dynamics to astronomically driven climate and Earth’s surface processes have equally been suggested even at the shorter Milankovitch timescales
