  <span class="sup">18</span>O data shows two prominent cyclicities of ~9 and ~36 Myr (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Other low-frequency cyclicities are also present, in particular, 1.3 Myr, 1.6 Myr, a triplet peaks of 2.3, 2.5 and 2.8 Myr, and a 4.7 Myr peak (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), which are close to Milankovitch astronomical periods (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The 1.3 Myr corresponds to the 1.2 Myr obliquity modulation term. The 1.6 Myr matches the eccentricity term. The triplet corresponds to combined eccentricity and obliquity terms of 2, 2.3 and 2.6 Myr (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). Finally, the 4.7 Myr is close to the 4.6 Myr eccentricity peak. Even though spectrally well detected and strikingly close to Milankovitch frequency band (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) the periods from 1 to 5 Myr could be altered by the stacking process of the data. Data from single sites document with high fidelity some of these periods

  </span>. In contrast, longer periods (&gt;5 Myr) are notably preserved in the compiled δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O data. In the present study, I focus on the prominent cyclicities of ~9 and ~36 Myr, and their possible link with the geologically well known climatic events. Another potential low-frequency (16 to 18 Myr) cycle could also be seen in the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O power spectra (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), but will not be discussed below.

    <p>Expanded views of climatic events and phases within the ~36 Myr cycle extrema. The term ‘phase’ opposes to the term ‘event’: ‘event’ indicates abrupt, severe change, whereas ‘phase’ indicates gradual/progressive trend in climate change that could reach an optimum (see below). I also used the term ‘episode’ to designate either event or phase.
