 <p>We acknowledge the staff of the Canadian Forces Service for maintaining the Alert station, W. Zhang for technique and logistic support at the Environment and Climate Change Canada, D. Veber for the calibration of the filter sampler at Alert, A. Platt for being responsible at Alert site operation, and C. Taylor for scientific and management support. We thank the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat technical staff in Abisko, T. Logan and A. Kristofferson for logistical support and sampling, B. Wanhatalo for construction of the sampling platform, P. Crill (Stockholm University) for help during the initiation of the operation, and M. Kruså for logistical and technical support. We would also like to thank W. Brower and J. Ivanoff of the Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corporation for sample collection and field assistance, along with F. Helsel, D. Lucero, and J. Zirzow of Sandia National Laboratory for site access at Barrow. Thanks are extended to the Norwegian Polar Institute staff at the Zeppelin Observatory above Ny-Ålesund; O. Hermansen and A. Bäcklund for technical support and logistics; and H. E. Fjeld, A.-C. Nielsen, and M. K. Janssen for sampling. We also thank S. A. Matvienko and the technical staff from the Russian Academy of Sciences sampling and logistic support in Tiksi, and E. N. Kirillova for help with translations.
