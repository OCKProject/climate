 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All stations exhibited clear seasonality in BC sources, with a dominant contribution from fossil fuel–based emissions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>). The annual mean radiocarbon-based “fraction biomass burning” (
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub> = 1 – “fraction fossil fuel”) of EC for the circum-Arctic was 39 ± 10%, excluding Barrow, for which there exists less than a full year’s coverage, and 29 ± 16% including Barrow. The 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub> values for the single sites ranged from 15 to 42% (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Variations are best described in seasonal patterns (table S1). Northward transport of pollutants carried predominantly fossil fuel emissions in the polluted winter (December-January-February; 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub> of 10 to 40%), whereas biomass burning sources were relatively more important during the pristine summer months (June-July-August; 33 to 68%) (
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>). The mean contribution of biomass burning to the Arctic EC was 25 ± 16% in the polluted winter and 42 ± 19% in the much cleaner summer (table S1). Barrow showed the same seasonal variation in 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub> as Abisko, Tiksi, and Zeppelin sites, but the fossil fuel fraction of BC was generally higher
  <sub>.</sub> The surface boundary layer in Barrow is usually isolated from wildfires in central Alaska by the Brooks Range, separating the leeward tundra and wetland of the North Slope from the rest of boreal Alaska. Biomass burning plumes are lofted at the Brooks Range and do not always descend again to the surface within the North Slope. Most of the stations had relatively long periods of overlapping data, except for Alert. There, only the first two samples (i.e., composites) overlap with the final two Tiksi composites while having almost identical sampling times. In terms of 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub>, this bridging period shows a consistent transition from the preceding Tiksi into Alert observations. However, the succeeding 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub> seasonality at Alert (40 ± 5%) is much weaker and oscillates around the annual Arctic mean 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub> determined in this study (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). A possible explanation for Alert’s weak seasonality could be its location, which is furthest from BC sources among the Arctic stations. The low annual variation in accumulation mode particles (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>) at the most remote site, Alert, suggests that arriving aerosols are more mixed during their longer transport compared to the other sites, creating a relatively constant 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub> signal.
