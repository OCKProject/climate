 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the model simulations agreed fairly well with this extensive set of observed circum-Arctic concentrations, thus providing important observational support for model-based mitigation plans. In contrast, however, the model-derived source apportionments (e.g., expressed as 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub>) were in less agreement with observed 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub>. This discrepancy is likely due to (i) misallocation of anthropogenic BC sources within the Asian regions, (ii) missing anthropogenic sources (

  </a>), and (iv) uncertainties in atmospheric transport modeling. However, there is good agreement between the model and observations when comparing fossil-only BC concentrations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4G</a>), at least for the sites where there are no missing meteorological data [due to the increase of vertical model resolution of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in 2013] or absent local emissions in the inventory. This suggests that improved estimates of biomass emissions, including wildfires and domestic activities, are an important factor for further constraining the impact of BC on Arctic climate. The observational data show that both fossil and biomass emissions contribute substantially to the levels of BC in the Arctic, but with opposite seasonal trends. This is reliable and essential information for informed policy decisions toward targeted emission reductions, and in support of collaboration and alliance between small clubs of countries.
