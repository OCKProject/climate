 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two available outputs from FLEXPART are the “potential emission sensitivity” function and a “source contribution function.” The latter can be obtained when FLEXPART is coupled to an emission inventory, such as ECLIPSE. The potential emission sensitivity is proportional to particles’ residence time, in units of seconds per volume (or area), in a particular model grid cell. Close to the surface (0- to 100-m altitude), the potential emission sensitivity is also called footprint emission sensitivity (

  </a>). The source contribution function, with units of mass per second, is a measure for the quantity of how much a source in an emission inventory grid cell would contribute to the total concentration at a receptor site. That way, both the geographical sources and the measured concentrations—the product of potential emission sensitivity and source contribution function—can be simulated for an observational site. Reversely, a latitudinal cutoff can be calculated, pointing to a fraction [e.g., 90% (

  </a>)] of BC emissions that come north or south of that boundary. The FLEXPART model indicates that main source regions for 90% of the simulated annual anthropogenic (non-open biomass burning) BC in the circum-Arctic were north of 42° latitude. This includes all Arctic council members (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States), most of Europe, some post-Soviet states (Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Ukraine), and northern China. The remaining ~10% BC south of 42°N originated mostly from China. Together, for the selected annual periods and stations, the modeled total BC from anthropogenic and natural sources were 38 ± 25% European (including western Russia), 36 ± 25% Asian, and 3 ± 11% North American, with the remainder (23 ± 24%) coming from global open biomass burning (table S2). Wildfires that affect the Arctic occur to a big part in Asia (

  </a>). Barrow was the only receptor site where the transport model projected significant impacts from anthropogenic American sources (17 ± 11%). The influences from Asian emissions were relatively high at Alert (50 ± 16%), Barrow (43 ± 21%), Tiksi (41 ± 25%), and Zeppelin (41 ± 12%), whereas European emissions dominated at Abisko (84 ± 6%) and Zeppelin (57 ± 14%) and were pronounced at Alert (27 ± 10%). By assigning these source contributions, it is also worth noting that the countries and regions mostly responsible for emissions (China, Europe, Russia, and the United States) would also benefit most from mitigation efforts in the short term, with regard to socioeconomic impact (health benefits and avoided crop loss) (
