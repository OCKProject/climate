 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EC and organic carbon (OC) concentrations were determined by a thermal-optical transmission (TOT) analyzer (instrument #227, Sunset Laboratory, Tigard, OR) using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 5040 protocol (

   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>). This method is known to potentially overcorrect charring fraction relative to other methods and to underestimate the EC content (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>). During charring, parts of the OC could also end up in the EC fraction in the form of pyrogenic carbon, which would then influence the isotopic composition of the EC fraction. This effect was evaluated by a sensitivity analysis in a previous study, which concluded that the radiocarbon-derived fraction of biomass burning could be overestimated by a maximum of 7%, in extreme cases (

   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). The detection limit for EC was based on the OC concentration of the field blanks, which had ~100 ng C cm
  <span class="sup">−2</span> OC (this roughly translates to 2 ng C m
  <span class="sup">−3</span> for Zeppelin samples, which had the lowest EC concentrations measured). EC could not be detected in any of the blanks.
