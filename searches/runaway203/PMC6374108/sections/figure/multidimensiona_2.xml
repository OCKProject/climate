  <p>The colored squares show the endmember ranges for the different EC sources of biomass burning (green) and the fossil fuels: gas flaring (blue), liquid fossil fuels of Russian origin (brown), liquid fossil fuels of “regular” (defined as American, Chinese, and western European emission) origin (dark cyan), and coal (black). Data from Barret

   <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
    <span class="italic">18</span>
   </a>) are marked with a black asterisk. From light to dark coloring: Abisko, Alert, Barrow, Tiksi, and Zeppelin. The degree of shading in the circles indicates the EC concentration for each sample (right shading bar). The areas of the circles indicate the sampling time in days from 1 to 120. Samples for which no δ
   <span class="sup">13</span>C data were available (e.g., all Zeppelin data) are placed on the 
   <span class="italic">y</span> axis. Uncertainties and error bars are not shown (can be received from tables in the Supplementary Materials) and are smaller than the diameter of the circles.
