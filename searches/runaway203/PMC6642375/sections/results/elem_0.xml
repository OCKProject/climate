  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weddell Sea.</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Weddell Sea, monthly minimum ice extent is always in February, as in the Southern Ocean as a whole, but monthly maximum ice extent varies more frequently from its typical September timing, being in August in 1992, 1994, 2004, and 2017 and in October in 1997, 2002, 2015, and 2018 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
    <span class="italic">A</span>
   </a>). Interestingly, the highest Weddell Sea monthly average ice extent in the 40-y record, in September 1980, was followed the next summer by among the lowest February and March ice extents (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
    <span class="italic">A</span>
   </a>), and, similarly, relatively high September values in 1987, 1992, and 2016 were all followed by below average February extents the next year. With other high September ice extents (e.g., in 2007) not being followed by particularly low February extents, this illustrates interannual variability and the difficulty of forecasting ice extents months in advance based simply on current ice extents. High ice extents with low ice concentrations could bring about particularly effective decay seasons, as could winds and ocean currents transporting to the region more warm air and water than normal. Similar to the Southern Ocean as a whole, the Weddell Sea experienced overall ice extent increases, on a yearly average basis, through 2014, although less convincingly (
   <a rid="t01" ref-type="table" href="#t01">Table 1</a>, with an R value of 1.88 versus the Southern Ocean’s R value of 5.25) and with the increases continuing, slightly, to 2015 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Indian Ocean is the one sector in which the average annual cycle of monthly ice extents peaks in October rather than September. Still, its average annual cycle shares with the other sectors a February minimum, making for the most asymmetric of these average cycles, with an 8-mo growth period and a 4-mo decay period (

    <span class="italic">A</span>

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig06" href="#fig06">Fig. 6

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig06" href="#fig06">Fig. 6
    <span class="italic">B</span>

Further interannual variability can be illustrated by the contrast between the September 2007 record high ice extent being followed the next summer by a February also with an unusually high ice extent, versus the high September 1996 ice extent being followed by a low February ice extent (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig06" href="#fig06">Fig. 6

This phenomenon of high September ice extents being followed sometimes by high and sometimes by low February ice extents is mentioned also in the Weddell Sea section and could be illustrated with many more examples on the sector plots. What happens during the decay season varies greatly depending on the surrounding atmospheric and oceanic conditions.

In 11 y, its month of minimum ice coverage was March rather than February, whereas no other sector had more than 4 y with a minimum month other than February.

However, the major contrast between the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas sector and the rest of the Southern Ocean is that it had an overall downward trend in ice extents for most of the record, followed by an overall upward trend.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig07" href="#fig07">Fig. 7
    <span class="italic">C</span>
   </a>), and although the upward trend since 2007 did not result in record high yearly ice extents (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig07" href="#fig07">Fig. 7
    <span class="italic">C</span>
   </a>), the record high monthly ice extent in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas sector did come late in the record, in September 2015, despite the early decades of overall decreasing sea ice coverage (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig07" href="#fig07">Fig. 7
    <span class="italic">A</span>
   </a>). The record low ice extent came in March 2010, in line with the general decrease in ice coverage in the first 3 decades of the record and the general increase in ice coverage since then (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the Southern Ocean as a whole, the 40-y sea ice extent trends remain positive for each of the 12 mo (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig08" href="#fig08">Fig. 8</a> and 
   <a rid="t02" ref-type="table" href="#t02">Table 2</a>), and hence also for each of the 4 seasons. However, the trend for November is close to 0 and far from statistical significance, at 1,100 ± 6,700 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, and every 40-y monthly trend is far below the trend for the 36-y 1979–2014 period before the recent sea ice declines (
   <a rid="t02" ref-type="table" href="#t02">Table 2</a>). [All of the monthly trends for the full Southern Ocean were statistically significant at least at the 95% level, and most were also significant at the 99% level, for the 36-y record; for the 40-y record, only 4 remain statistically significant at the 95% level and none are statistically significant at the 99% level (
   <a rid="t02" ref-type="table" href="#t02">Table 2</a>).] Through 2014, the Indian Ocean, Western Pacific, and Ross Sea all also had positive trends in each month (with ranges of 2,700–8,500 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y
   <span class="sup">−1</span> in the Indian Ocean, 200–5,700 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y

   <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y
   <span class="sup">−1</span> in the Ross Sea), but now, with the full 40-y record, only the Indian Ocean retains that commonality with the full Southern Ocean (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig08" href="#fig08">Fig. 8</a>). The Western Pacific and Ross Sea now both have 10 mo with positive trends and 2 mo with negative or 0 trends (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig08" href="#fig08">Fig. 8</a>). The Weddell Sea has negative trends in winter and spring but positive trends in summer and autumn. Once again, the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas sector is out of line with the rest of the Southern Ocean, as all 12 of its monthly trends were negative earlier (
   <a rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" href="#r8">8</a>), but now with the 40-y record, its summer and autumn values remain negative, whereas its ice extent trends in winter are positive and in autumn are mixed (
