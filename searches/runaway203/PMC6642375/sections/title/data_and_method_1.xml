 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data used throughout this paper come from a satellite-based multichannel passive-microwave data record begun in late 1978 following the October 24, 1978 launch of the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) on NASA’s Nimbus 7 satellite. The SMMR data are used in this study for 1979 through mid-August 1987, followed by data from a sequence of the US Department of Defense’s Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) special sensor microwave imager (SSMI) instruments, the first of which was launched on the DMSP F8 satellite on June 18, 1987, and the follow-on DMSP SSMI sounder (SSMIS) instruments, the first of which was launched on the DMSP F16 satellite on October 18, 2003. Details on the intercalibration between the data from successive instruments, to obtain a consistent long-term record, can be found in reports by Cavalieri et al. (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite passive-microwave data have major advantages over other data for studies of changes in the extent and distribution of the Antarctic sea ice cover in recent decades. First, satellites allow monitoring of the full Antarctic sea ice cover every 1 or 2 d. Second, the satellite passive-microwave record extends back to the 1970s. Third, the microwave signal from sea ice is quite distinct from the microwave signal from liquid water. Fourth, the microwave radiation is emitted from within the Earth/atmosphere system, rather than being reflected sunlight; hence, the measurements can be made irrespective of day or night conditions. Fifth, at appropriate microwave wavelengths, the microwave radiation from the surface can travel through most cloud covers, allowing measurements under cloudy as well as cloud-free conditions. These advantages result in a 40-y record covering all seasons of the year and allowing determination of large-scale changes in the Southern Ocean sea ice cover that would not be feasible without the satellite passive-microwave data.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The microwave data were converted to sea ice concentrations (percent areal coverages of sea ice) in each pixel (∼25 km × 25 km) of the gridded satellite data through the NASA team algorithm described in detail by Gloersen et al. (
  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>). Sea ice extents were then calculated by summing, throughout the region of interest, the areas of each pixel with a calculated sea ice concentration of at least 15%. Ice extents are calculated for each day of available data; yearly and monthly averages are calculated by averaging the daily ice extents for the year or month, respectively. Summer averages are calculated by averaging the daily extents for January, February, and March; autumn averages are calculated by averaging the daily extents for April, May, and June; winter averages are calculated by averaging the daily extents for July, August, and September; and spring averages are calculated by averaging the daily extents for October, November, and December.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the sea ice cover has a prominent annual cycle, long-term trends in sea ice extents are more clearly depicted after removing the annual cycle. This is done here both through yearly averaging, which removes considerable additional information as well as the annual cycle (e.g., monthly interannual variability, amplitude of the annual cycle, seasonality of the trends), and through the more information-retaining monthly deviations, calculated by subtracting from the individual month’s ice extent the average of the ice extents for that particular month throughout the 40-y record. For example, the monthly deviation for January 1979 is the ice extent for January 1979 minus the average of the ice extents for the 40 months of January 1979–2018.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trend lines are calculated for the monthly, seasonal, yearly, and monthly deviation datasets through standard linear least squares, and the standard deviations (SDs) of the trends are calculated based on the technique described by Taylor (
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>). The ratio (R) of the trend magnitude to its SD is given to provide a rough indication of the relative statistical significance of the trends, with higher R values suggesting greater significance. More specifically, if assuming a 2-tailed 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test and 38 degrees of freedom for the 40-y sea ice record, R values above 2.024 would signify statistical significance at a 95% level or above and R values above 2.712 would signify statistical significance at a 99% level or above; the corresponding values for a 36-y record, also discussed below, are 2.032 and 2.728 for 95% and 99% significance, respectively. In view of the imperfect nature of tests of statistical significance when applied to the real world (
