 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas is the sector most out of line with the rest of the Southern Ocean, although sharing with each of the sectors the existence of substantial interannual variability (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig07" href="#fig07">Fig. 7</a>). In 11 y, its month of minimum ice coverage was March rather than February, whereas no other sector had more than 4 y with a minimum month other than February. The large variability in its month of maximum ice extent is more in line with the variability in the other sectors, being July in 2 y, August in 14 y, September in 20 y, and October in 4 y (

  </a>). However, the major contrast between the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas sector and the rest of the Southern Ocean is that it had an overall downward trend in ice extents for most of the record, followed by an overall upward trend. This contrast corresponds well with the marked regional warming recorded on the Antarctic Peninsula, adjacent to the Bellingshausen Sea, for the early decades of the 40-y record (
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>), a warming not recorded elsewhere on the continent, and the subsequent cooling over the Antarctic Peninsula (
  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>). The yearly average ice extents in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas reached their minimum in 2007 (

   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>), and although the upward trend since 2007 did not result in record high yearly ice extents (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig07" href="#fig07">Fig. 7
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>), the record high monthly ice extent in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas sector did come late in the record, in September 2015, despite the early decades of overall decreasing sea ice coverage (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig07" href="#fig07">Fig. 7
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>). The record low ice extent came in March 2010, in line with the general decrease in ice coverage in the first 3 decades of the record and the general increase in ice coverage since then (
