 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Indian Ocean is the one sector in which the average annual cycle of monthly ice extents peaks in October rather than September. Still, its average annual cycle shares with the other sectors a February minimum, making for the most asymmetric of these average cycles, with an 8-mo growth period and a 4-mo decay period (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>), 4 y earlier than the peak for the Southern Ocean as a whole. A decrease in yearly average ice extents from 2010 to 2011 was followed by a rebound in the next 3 y and then a 2-y decrease resulting in the Indian Ocean record minimum yearly ice extent in 2016, before rebounding somewhat in 2017 and 2018 (
