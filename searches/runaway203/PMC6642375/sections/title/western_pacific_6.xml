 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like the Southern Ocean as a whole, the Western Pacific Ocean has a February minimum and a September maximum in its average annual cycle of sea ice extents, although in the Western Pacific case, the October ice is nearly as extensive as the September ice and the August ice is not far behind (

  <span class="italic">Inset</span>). The month of ice extent minimum in the Western Pacific was February in each year except 1980, 1985, 1986, and 2017, when it was March, and the more variable month of maximum was August in 8 y, September in 15 y, and October in 17 y (

  </a>). The largest deviations from normal came in September and October of 1989, when the ice cover was far less extensive than the average September and October ice covers (

  </a>). The second highest yearly ice extent came decades earlier, in 1982, which also contained the 2 highest monthly values of the 40-y record, the highest in September 1982 and the second highest in October 1982 (
