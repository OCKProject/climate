 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ice covers of each of the 5 sectors of 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a> and of the Southern Ocean as a whole have experienced considerable interannual variability over the past 40 y (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Figs. 2</a>–
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig07" href="#fig07">7</a>). In fact, the Southern Ocean and 4 of the 5 sectors (all except the Ross Sea) have each experienced at least one period since 1999 when the yearly average ice extents decreased for 3 or more straight years only to rebound again afterward and eventually reach levels exceeding the extent preceding the 3 y of decreases (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Figs. 2</a>–
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig07" href="#fig07">7</a>). This illustrates that the ice decreases since 2014 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>) are no assurance that the 1979–2014 overall positive trend in Southern Ocean ice extents has reversed to a long-term negative trend. Only time and an extended observational record will reveal whether the small increase in yearly average ice extents from 2017 to 2018 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>) is a blip in a long-term downward trend or the start of a rebound. Still, irrespective of what happens in the future, the 2014–2017 ice extent decreases were quite remarkable compared not only with the rest of the 40-y Antarctic record but with the Arctic record as well.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The decline in yearly average Antarctic sea ice extents from 2014 to 2017 (followed by a slight rebound) was at a linear least squares rate of −729,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, well exceeding the rate of change for either hemisphere in any other 4-y period during the 40 y (1979–2018) of the satellite multichannel passive-microwave record (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig09" href="#fig09">Fig. 9</a>). The widely publicized sea ice decreases in the Arctic, even with their worrisome acceleration in the early 21st century, have never experienced (in the 40-y 1979–2018 record) a 4-y period with a rate of decrease in yearly average ice extents exceeding in magnitude a value of −240,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig09" href="#fig09">Fig. 9
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>), less than a third of the Antarctic rate of loss from 2014 to 2017. In fact, the 2,027,000-km
  <span class="sup">2</span> decrease in yearly average Antarctic ice extents in the 3 y from their 2014 maximum (12,776,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) to their 2017 minimum (10,749,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>) exceeds the loss in Arctic yearly average ice extents in any period of 33 y or less in the 40-y satellite multichannel passive-microwave record. Based on the same SMMR/SSMI/SSMIS data source used for the Antarctic, the Arctic ice cover had its 40-y peak yearly average ice extent in 1982, at 12,400,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, and its minimum in 2016, at 10,135,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, for a reduction of 2,265,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in 34 y. So, in 3 y, from 2014 to 2017, the Antarctic experienced a reduction of 89% of the total decrease of the Arctic yearly average ice extents from their maximum in 1982 to their minimum in 2016. The slope of the linear least squares fit to the 40-y Arctic yearly average ice extents is −54,740 ± 3,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, which comes to a total loss of 2,134,860 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> over the entire 40-y record. In just the 2014–2017 period, the Antarctic sea ice cover lost 95% of this amount.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The one other several-year period during the time frame of modern instrumental records with an estimated loss of hemispheric sea ice coverage comparably as rapid as that in the Antarctic in 2014–2017 was also in the Antarctic, although before the start of the 40-y record of multichannel passive-microwave data, coming instead in the mid-1970s. Calculations based on a variety of datasets, including satellite data, yielded 12-mo running means in Antarctic sea ice extents that show rates of decrease of ∼600,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for the 4 y from the start of 1973 to the start of 1977 and for the 3-y subset from the start of 1974 to the start of 1977 (
  <a rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" href="#r29">29</a>). This yields an areal loss of Antarctic sea ice extents in 4 y exceeding the total loss suffered by the Arctic sea ice cover in the entire 40-y 1979–2018 satellite multichannel passive-microwave record and raises the question of whether the Antarctic sea ice might be more amenable than the Arctic sea ice to very rapid (nonannual-cycle) decreases. Certainly the geographies of the 2 polar regions are vastly different, with the Arctic sea ice cover largely confined by surrounding continents and the Antarctic sea ice wide open to water to the north, contributing to large differences also in oceanic and atmospheric circulations and offering food for thought on what might or might not be causing the differing rates of change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies have examined the extreme Antarctic sea ice retreat in late 2016 and have related it to surrounding atmospheric and oceanic conditions (

  <a href="#r32">*</a>
  <a href="#r33">*</a>–
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>). Among the likely influences discussed are the following: 1) a strong northerly atmospheric flow causing rapid ice retreat in the Weddell Sea (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>); 2) an unusually negative southern annular mode in November 2016 causing rapid ice retreat in the Ross Sea and elsewhere (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>
  <a href="#r31">*</a>
  <a href="#r32">*</a>
  <a href="#r33">*</a>–
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>); 3) the extreme El Niño that peaked months earlier, in December 2015 through February 2016, contributing to unusually warm ocean waters in the Bellingshausen, Amundsen, and eastern Ross Seas, anomalous warmth that persisted into the austral spring (
  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>); 4) a persistent zonal wave 3 atmospheric circulation around Antarctica contributing to reduced sea ice extents in the Indian Ocean, Ross Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, and western Weddell Sea (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>
  <a href="#r33">*</a>–
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>); and 5) a weakened polar stratospheric vortex weakening the surface-level circumpolar westerlies and contributing to reduced sea ice extents in the Indian and Pacific Oceans (
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>). None of the studies suggests that a single cause resulted in the extreme Antarctic sea ice retreat in 2016, all instead recognizing multiple influences, both atmospheric and oceanic.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The case studies focusing on Antarctic sea ice retreat in late 2016 illustrate well the interconnected global climate system, as they tie the sea ice changes not just to circumstances in the vicinity of the sea ice but also to events in the tropical and midlatitude oceans, the tropical and midlatitude atmosphere, and the upper atmosphere (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>
  <a href="#r31">*</a>
  <a href="#r32">*</a>
  <a href="#r33">*</a>–
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>). However, the sea ice retreats in late 2016 occurred in just a few months of the 2014–2017 period of extreme rates of Antarctic sea ice decreases. I hope that the 40-y record discussed in this paper will encourage further studies into the atmospheric and oceanic conditions that could have led to the extremely rapid 2014–2017 decline of the Antarctic sea ice cover, the comparably rapid decline in the mid-1970s, and the uneven but overall gradual increases in Antarctic sea ice coverage in the intervening decades. More broadly, the environmental datasets may be nearing the point where they are long enough and rich enough to enable the linking of several of the modes and dipoles and oscillations now spoken of separately, just as the El Niño and Southern Oscillation phenomena were linked together years ago as ENSO; once that further linkage happens, the understanding of Earth’s very interconnected climate system, including the sea ice cover, could be markedly enhanced.
