 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the Southern Ocean as a whole, the quite prominent annual cycle has minimum monthly ice extent always (for the 40 y of the dataset, 1979–2018) occurring in February and always well under 5 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and maximum ice extent occurring in September in all years except 1988, when it was in October, and always well over 17 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>). The monthly deviations and yearly averages depict clearly the overall upward trend in ice extents until 2014, when the yearly averages reached a record high of 12.8 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, and marked decreases in the subsequent 3 y (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2 
   <span class="italic">B</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>), leading to a record low monthly average sea ice extent of 2.29 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in February 2017 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>) and a record low yearly average sea ice extent of 10.75 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in 2017 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). Despite the marked decreases in ice extent following the 2014 record high, the least squares trends remain positive, although at roughly half the magnitude of the 1979–2014 trends (
  <a rid="t01" ref-type="table" href="#t01">Table 1</a>). Specifically, the 1979–2018 trend of 11,200 ± 2,100 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for the monthly deviations is only 50.7% of the 22,100 ± 2,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y
  <span class="sup">−1</span> slope of the trend line for 1979–2014, and the 1979–2018 trend of 11,300 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>⋅y
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for the yearly averages is only 50.4% of the trend for 1979–2014 (
  <a rid="t01" ref-type="table" href="#t01">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 5 sectors also all exhibit a strong annual cycle with monthly ice extent minima frequently in February and maxima frequently in September, although with much greater interannual variability than for the Southern Ocean as a whole. The following sections for the individual sectors highlight some of the regional and interannual variability in the Southern Ocean sea ice cover.</p>
