 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Weddell Sea, monthly minimum ice extent is always in February, as in the Southern Ocean as a whole, but monthly maximum ice extent varies more frequently from its typical September timing, being in August in 1992, 1994, 2004, and 2017 and in October in 1997, 2002, 2015, and 2018 (

  </a>). Interestingly, the highest Weddell Sea monthly average ice extent in the 40-y record, in September 1980, was followed the next summer by among the lowest February and March ice extents (

   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>), and, similarly, relatively high September values in 1987, 1992, and 2016 were all followed by below average February extents the next year. With other high September ice extents (e.g., in 2007) not being followed by particularly low February extents, this illustrates interannual variability and the difficulty of forecasting ice extents months in advance based simply on current ice extents. High ice extents with low ice concentrations could bring about particularly effective decay seasons, as could winds and ocean currents transporting to the region more warm air and water than normal. Similar to the Southern Ocean as a whole, the Weddell Sea experienced overall ice extent increases, on a yearly average basis, through 2014, although less convincingly (

   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). The Weddell Sea experienced marked ice extent decreases from 2015–2018, falling just short of reaching its record minimum yearly ice extent set in 1999 (
