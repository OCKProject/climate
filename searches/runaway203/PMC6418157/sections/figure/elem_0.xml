  <p>Sensitivities to changes in SO
   <sub>2</sub> and BC emissions. Global mean instantaneous aerosol radiative forcing (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) and change in the mean surface air temperature (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) with emission perturbations of SO
   <sub>2</sub> (blue) and BC (red) from fuel sources relative to the present emissions simulated by MIROC-SPRINTARS. Error bars represent one standard deviation in annual mean values. Changes in surface air temperatures are from the simulations coupled with OGCM.
