  <p>Relationship between aerosol (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) instantaneous or (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) effective radiative forcing and changes in surface air temperatures. Each point shows individual simulated results with various scaling factors relative to present emission amounts, as shown in Methods, for sulphate (blue) and BC (red) aerosols by MIROC-SPRINTARS. Error bars represent one standard deviation in annual mean values. The correlation coefficients for the regression lines are 1.00 and 0.91Â in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) and 1.00 and 0.88 in (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) for sulphate and BC aerosols, respectively.
