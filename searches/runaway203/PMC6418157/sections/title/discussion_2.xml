 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reason for the weak response of the mean surface air temperature to BC perturbation is that instantaneous radiative forcing is largely compensated for by rapid adjustment (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The compensation consists of changes in the clear-sky radiative flux and cloud radiative effect at the TOA. Under the condition of reducing BC emission which weakens the atmospheric radiative heating associated with the instantaneous radiative forcing, the clear-sky radiative cooling weakens due to a decrease in water vapor. Reducing BC emission also makes atmosphere unstable, leading to decreases in low-clouds and increases in middle- and high-clouds, which results in a decrease in outgoing radiation. Both changes in the clear-sky radiative flux and cloud radiative forcing counteract the instantaneous radiative forcing in the BC case. As a result, only a fraction of the perturbed energy is left to drive the slow response accompanied by temperature change (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). In contrast, the instantaneous radiative forcing of sulphate is almost the same between the TOA and surface, causing little radiative heating/cooling in the atmosphere. Then the clear-sky radiative flux is unchanged. On the other hand, an imbalance in the radiation budget induced by sulphate is enhanced by the cloud radiative effect, which primarily consists of the aerosol-cloud interaction for water clouds (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The radiative forcing of sulphate from fuel sources due to the aerosol-cloud interaction is estimated to be −0.36 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> in this study, which is comparable to −0.45 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> by all anthropogenic aerosols in the latest IPCC Assessment Report

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The remarkable difference in TOA energy balance change between BC and sulphate arises from different vertical structures of the instantaneous radiative forcing, which induce rapid adjustments counteracting or enhancing the forcing through different energy redistributions into atmosphere and surface
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. This involves opposite effects of cloud responses that buffer and enhance the instantaneous radiative forcing for BC and sulphate cases, respectively. In the latter, the TOA energy imbalance is swelled by the radiative forcing due to the aerosol-cloud interaction and is not fully cancelled by slow response (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) implying energy exchange with ocean. These different characteristics of energy budget change is a basic mechanism responsible for different responses of the surface air temperature to the instantaneous radiative forcing. In the context of recent PDRMIP intercomparison, the temperature sensitivity to 5 times SO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions or sulfate concentrations relative to the present condition simulated by MIROC-SPRINTARS is within a range of uncertainty among multiple models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. The present results quantify sensitivities of the surface air temperature to varying emissions of BC and sulphate over realistic ranges to particularly highlight the weaker temperature response than would be expected from the BC-induced instantaneous radiative forcings at TOA. This is explained by the energy budget change that occurs not only at the TOA but also in the atmosphere and at the surface involving the latent and sensible heat fluxes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, which also cause changes to precipitation as well as temperature.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present results, together with recent multi-model findings
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, require re-investigation of the CCAC activity that is based on an integrated scientific assessment by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). In the assessment report
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, the temperature sensitivities to all the aerosol species per instantaneous radiative forcing are assumed to be the same as that of CO
  <sub>2</sub>. However, this assumption, with the weaker temperature sensitivity to BC emission change not considered, tends to overestimate the expected mitigation of global warming by reducing BC emission. Given that BC reduction is mandatory for avoiding an impact on human health, this study proposes that long-lived greenhouse gases and other SLCPs should be reduced more firmly for mitigating global warming.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The discussion above underscores an importance of considering rapid adjustment that substantially modulates the energy budget response to BC emission change. This is facilitated by using the effective radiative forcing, which includes the instantaneous radiative forcing and the rapid adjustment as defined in the fifth assessment report of the IPCC
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> and shown to be a better predictor of the temperature change. Indeed, the climate sensitivity parameters based on the effective radiative forcing simulated by MIROC-SPRINTARS are 0.43 and 0.31 °C W
  <span class="sup">−1</span> m
  <span class="sup">2</span> for sulphate and BC aerosols respectively, which shows a smaller discrepancy than that for instantaneous radiative forcing (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These findings imply that reducing atmospheric BC concentrations may not be effective for the decline in global surface air temperatures, although such reduction is crucial for air quality. Therefore, reducing emissions of well-mixed greenhouse gases, i.e. CO
  <sub>2</sub>, CH
  <sub>4</sub>, nitrous oxide (N
  <sub>2</sub>O), and halocarbons, as well as other SLCPs (CH
  <sub>4</sub>, tropospheric O
  <sub>3</sub>, and HFCs), is an essential mitigation measure in the pursuit of the goals within the Paris Agreement. However, heterogeneous spatial distributions of SLCFs can result in large changes in surface air temperatures in the mid- and high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Detailed analysis will be needed in future studies to investigate the effects of SLCFs on regional climate change.
