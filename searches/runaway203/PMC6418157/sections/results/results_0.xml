  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows how instantaneous radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and surface air temperatures change with perturbed emissions of SO
  <sub>2</sub> and BC from fuel sources. Although the global mean instantaneous radiative forcing values at the TOA simulated in this study (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) are somewhat lower than the maximum likelihoods shown in the latest IPCC Assessment Report
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>, they are within the uncertainty range. Assessment of the uncertainty should be extended to multi-model comparisons, such as the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom)

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>, in which the MIROC-SPRINTARS is participating. It is important when using a single-model approach to indicate almost linear trends in the instantaneous radiative forcing at the TOA with perturbed emissions for both sulphate and BC aerosols (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>).

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in surface air temperatures are traditionally and conveniently estimated from instantaneous radiative forcing, which is related to climate sensitivity. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> shows that if the climate sensitivity for BC is equal to that for sulphate aerosols, the mean change in the surface air temperature due to reducing BC emissions is expected to be approximately two-thirds of the change if SO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions increase. However, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a> shows that the simulated decrease in the global mean surface air temperature when reducing BC emissions is much smaller than expected, to the extent that for a realistic change in BC emissions the trend is lost in the interannual variability. It is notable that the relationship between the instantaneous radiative forcing and the change in the surface air temperature is almost linear for both sulphate and BC aerosols (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). The climate sensitivity parameter (i.e. the gradient of plots shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) estimated by MIROC-SPRINTARS for sulphate aerosols (1.3 °C W
  <span class="sup">−1</span> m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) is eight times larger than that for BC (0.16 °C W
  <span class="sup">−1</span> m
  <span class="sup">2</span>). This implies that instantaneous radiative forcing, used when assessing the effect on climate of BC, with climate sensitivity implicitly assumed to be the same as that of sulphate, does not serve as a good predictor of the temperature response.
