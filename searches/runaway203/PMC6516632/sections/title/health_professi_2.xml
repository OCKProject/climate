 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health professionals and the organizations that represent us must become tireless champions for these objectives and for the global agreements that will enable them—especially the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. In a world rife with rapidly eroding trust, we remain trusted honest brokers who place public interests above all others [
  <a rid="pmed.1002804.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pmed.1002804.ref012">12</a>]. In this role, we must educate and advocate with people in our communities, civic leaders, and policy makers in government and industry—in our city or county, our state, our nation, and on the global stage—until the objectives have been embraced and achieved. The only way to achieve these objectives is through policy changes that will prioritize human health and sustainable ecosystems and will shift the burden of pollution and other forms of ecosystem degradation back onto those who are responsible, drawing on the common-sense principle of “polluter pays.” The Australian National Climate and Health Framework provides a compelling example of what the health community can and must do [
  <a rid="pmed.1002804.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pmed.1002804.ref013">13</a>], as does the recent Call to Action on Climate and Health by Canada’s health professionals [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The voices of health professionals as champions and advocates for human health and sustainable ecosystems—in communities, states, nations, and global negotiations—is imperative. When our voices are absent, those most loudly heard by the public and policy makers are those of major corporations—especially fossil fuel companies whose business models are currently tied to the extraction and pollution that is directly harming human health and is jeopardizing the very possibility of continued human prosperity. The claim that, for the foreseeable future, the fossil fuel economy is the only viable economy is made in full knowledge that fossil fuel use causes irreparable harm to human health and to the earth’s climate system, on which all human life and prosperity depends.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Those with strong vested interests in the fossil fuel economy are likely to assert that we health professionals should “stick to our own lane” and stay out of complicated policy dialogues that we are ill-prepared to understand, much less advance. For us to acquiesce to that assertion would be irresponsible: protecting the health and well-being of people individually and collectively is our lane. We need not become experts in areas of policy outside our lane. Rather, we must only participate in the relevant policy discussions to ensure that the existentially important objectives we are advocating for are properly and fully considered. Failure to protect the health of people in this generation—and potentially the next hundred generations—is not an option.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, we should lead by example—in our practices, our hospitals, our health departments, and our own lives. Organizations have already arisen from within our ranks—including Health Care Without Harm, Practice Green Health, and My Green Doctor—that are helping countless numbers of our peers to lead by example. We should all embrace this opportunity—both because the practice of healthcare and public health should not continue contributing to the problem and because leading by example is the most effective form of leadership.</p>
