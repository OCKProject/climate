 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The planet is unequivocally warming due to human influence [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Whilst the basic physics of global warming is clear, the response of the atmospheric circulation at the regional scale is less well known [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>]. This poses a challenge to the attribution of past climate change to human influence and is a large source of uncertainty in climate projections. As Shepherd (2014) puts it: “nearly everything we have any confidence in when it comes to climate change is related to global patterns of surface temperature, which are primarily controlled by thermodynamics. In contrast, we have much less confidence in atmospheric circulation aspects of climate change, which are primarily controlled by dynamics and exert a strong control on regional climate” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. This is especially true for the high latitudes, where internal variability of the atmospheric circulation is a major source of uncertainty in projected climate change [

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This review forms part of a Topical Collection on Climate Change and Atmospheric Circulation. Here, we focus on the polar regions, but also consider relevant aspects of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation that are intimately connected to changes in the polar regions. Other papers in this Collection cover the tropical convergence zones [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>], monsoons [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>], subtropical highs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>] and blocking [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. Our review is not intended to cover all aspects of the polar circulation but, instead, focuses on selected areas of research where significant scientific advances have been made in the past 5 years. In the following sections, we report on progress in understanding the past and projected future climate change response of the following atmospheric circulation phenomena: the northern and southern stratospheric polar vortices, Arctic and sub-Antarctic cyclones, Arctic moist intrusions, and the Amundsen Sea Low. We also consider the dominant modes of atmospheric circulation variability in the extratropics of each hemisphere, namely the Northern Annular Mode and Southern Annular Mode. Rather than describing each of these circulation features now, we provide some background within the relevant sections. We deal first with the Arctic, then the Antarctic, and lastly, reflect on the differences and similarities between circulation changes in the two polar regions.
