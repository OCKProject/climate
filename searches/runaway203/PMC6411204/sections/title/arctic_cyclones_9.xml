 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A ubiquitous aspect of the polar and sub-polar regions of both hemispheres is the presence of many synoptic systems. These play a central role in transporting heat and moisture from the midlatitudes into the polar regions. In recent times, the analysis of cyclonic activity has attracted increased attention. Part of the reason for this is that reduced sea ice is allowing increased human activity in the Arctic, for example shipping, and for which storminess is an important consideration. An issue that arises in this context is that there is no clear objective definition of what comprises a cyclone or its intensity. The fact that there are numerous state-of-the-art automated cyclone identification algorithms available reflects the existence of this ambiguity. Detection algorithms based on different physical assumptions and approaches have been shown to produce broadly consistent findings but with some deviations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. A related matter is that a cyclone investigation can be undertaken with a choice of reanalysis data set. The basic fields (e.g. mean sea level pressure) are, in the main, quite coherent across the sets, but they can show sizeable deviations in the vicinity of cyclones and fronts. Hence, when discussing diagnosed cyclone behaviour, it is important to appreciate what identification scheme was applied, and what reanalysis data set was used. These issues may be of particular relevance when undertaking cyclone analysis in the Arctic region. Simmonds and Rudeva (2014) found that 10 state-of-the-art cyclone identification schemes, applied to intense systems in the ERA-Interim reanalysis, were in substantial agreement as to the location of the centre of these storms, while showing considerable differences between the central pressures diagnosed by the algorithms of typically 5–10 hPa [

 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rudeva and Simmonds (2015) analysed cyclone behaviour in 34 years of data and found significant increases in winter cyclone frequency to the north of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and to the north of Greenland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. In summer, they revealed a quite different pattern of change, with negative trends north of the Beaufort Sea and positive trends centred over the Laptev Sea. Similar trend results were achieved by Zahn et al. (2018) who used a somewhat shorter period and four reanalyses [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]. They identified increasing winter cyclone frequency over most of the central Arctic Ocean and towards the Pacific, and decreasing winter cyclone frequency in the Barents Sea and north of the Russian coast. These cyclone frequency changes are consistent with observed winter changes in the frequency and longevity of high-latitude blocking [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>]. The contrasting regional trends were broadly consistent across the four reanalyses. They showed, however, that the magnitudes of trends differed in strength between reanalyses. When summed over the entire Arctic basin, the number of Arctic cyclones exhibits no significant linear trend in any season [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. Given the opposing regional trends mentioned above, this finding is perhaps not surprising.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arctic cyclone characteristics are correlated with key large-scale atmospheric indices, such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and NAM; however, these associations vary with season and none alone sufficiently explains cyclone variability or trends [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>]. The role that decreasing Arctic ice may be playing in these cyclone trends is a matter of considerable debate. Interaction between variability in Arctic sea ice and cyclones are complex, and apparent ice-cyclone associations appear dependent on data set resolution, and the identification method used [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>•]. Open water areas in the Arctic have led to increased transfer of heat and moisture from the ocean to the atmosphere, warming and moistening the Arctic atmosphere and increasing the 
  <span class="italic">potential</span> for cyclogenesis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. However, the effect of atmospheric moisture increases on cyclone behaviour is unclear and appears sensitive to the spatial resolution of the reanalysis dataset and/or how well current models represent moist processes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. What is becoming clearer is that investigations undertaken with higher resolution data sets reveal more cyclonic structures [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. For example, Tilinina et al. (2014) conducted a cyclone investigation using the high-resolution Arctic System Reanalysis and identified a considerably higher number of cyclones over the Arctic [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>•]. They found the set allowed for more accurate description of the life cycle of the most intense Arctic cyclones, compared to the global reanalyses. At higher resolution, cyclones had lower central pressures, faster deepening and stronger winds on average. Trends in such intense Arctic cyclones are attracting much interest, and there are suggestions that these features are becoming more frequent [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>]. The so-called Great Arctic Cyclone of August 2012 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>] broke the then-record of the lowest central pressure of all Arctic August storms since 1979 and this record still stands.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Turning now to future projections of Arctic cyclones, Day et al. (2018) conducted experiments with the CESM1-CAM5 climate model under a high GHG emission scenario [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>••]. They compared Arctic cyclone properties during 2071–2080 with those revealed over 1990–2005 in their historical simulation and found the response to vary with season. In winter, they found a significant reduction in both the number and intensity of storms, and a strong decrease in the frequency with which strong cyclones occur. The cyclone decrease was particularly marked in a band from Greenland to the Norwegian Sea, consistent with observed increases in high-latitude blocking near Greenland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>]. By contrast they identified an increase in cyclone activity in the summer season and a rise in the frequency of strong storms. Their analysis allowed them to posit that this strong seasonality was associated with changes in the high-latitude meridional temperature gradient. In winter, this gradient is weakened as a result of amplified Arctic warming, while it is strengthened in summer because of the enhanced warming of high latitude continents compared to the Arctic Ocean.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A similar analysis, but using a different cyclone identification scheme, was conducted by Crawford and Serreze (2017) but they focussed on the summer season and on changes in the Arctic frontal zone [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>]. This zone is a tight band of strong horizontal temperature gradients and hence, baroclinicity, which develops along the Arctic Ocean coastline. They found that the strengthening of the frontal zone in June is accompanied by increases in cyclone activity along some parts of this zone, but little change in cyclone numbers over the Arctic basin.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The complex role of baroclinicity has been further explored by Tamarin-Brodsky and Kaspi (2017) in connection with the poleward shift, from 1980–1999 to 2080–2099, of storm tracks in climate models forced by increased GHG emissions from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>••]. They demonstrated that cyclones are not only formed more poleward in a warmer climate, but they also propagate more poleward until they reach their peak intensity. However, within the Arctic basin, they show that the CMIP5 models exhibit a winter decrease in cyclone numbers.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regional climate models have also been used to investigate possible future change in Arctic cyclone characteristics. Cyclone changes from 1980–1999 to 2080–2099 were modelled by Akperov et al. (2015) using the HIRHAM model under a midrange GHG emission scenario [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>]. They found greater Arctic cyclone numbers in the warm season and fewer in the cool season, though neither of these changes was statistically significant. However, they detected clear changes in intensity and size of cyclones for both seasons.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, observed and projected changes in the Arctic atmospheric circulation are of fairly modest magnitude compared to naturally occurring climate variability. We now turn our attention to the Southern Hemisphere, where the combined effects of GHG increases and stratospheric ozone depletion have led to clearer circulation changes over recent decades.</p>
