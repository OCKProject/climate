 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent decades, significant and robust large-scale changes have been observed in atmospheric circulation over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>]. These changes are of major importance in terms of impacts on the broader coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice system across Antarctica and the Southern Ocean [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>]. The dominant pattern of lower- and mid-tropospheric circulation variability at high southern latitudes is the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) or Antarctic Oscillation. A more positive phase of SAM is associated with anomalously low atmospheric pressure over Antarctica and higher pressure at lower latitudes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>]. In recent years, more direct diagnostics of the circumpolar mid-latitude southern near-surface westerlies (hereinafter the westerly jet) have become an important part of quantifying and understanding SAM-related changes in hemispheric-scale circulation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>]. Strengthening and/or poleward shifting of the westerly jet are associated with a more positive SAM index and vice versa.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The depletion of stratospheric ozone and resulting strengthening of the polar vortex in the late twentieth century caused a major shift in Southern Hemisphere tropospheric climate, inducing a more positive SAM index mainly in the summer season (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>]. The causal chain for this starts with the fact that ozone absorbs solar radiation, and therefore in sunlit seasons, the depletion of stratospheric ozone induces local radiative cooling of the polar stratospheres [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>]. In response to cooling, the stratospheric polar vortex strengthens as changes in the vertical shear of zonal wind adjust to maintain thermal wind balance. Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion is most pronounced in late winter/early spring since the chemical reactions responsible are linked to polar stratospheric clouds that form in the very cold conditions of the polar night [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>]. Consequently, there is a strong seasonality in polar ozone-related stratospheric cooling trends, which are most pronounced in early spring. In observations, the resulting stratospheric circulation anomalies propagate downwards gradually during spring to exhibit the strongest impact in summer [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>]. Identifying the precise mechanisms for this downward propagation is still a topic of debate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>]. Despite uncertainty over the mechanisms, there is strong consensus that stratospheric ozone depletion has had an impact on tropospheric circulation based on evidence from both observations and modelling, and both in terms of the detection of the shift and its attribution to ozone depletion [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">96</a>]. This consensus has been increased in recent years due to the more widespread use of atmospheric models that extend high enough to include most of the stratosphere (so-called high top models), which more consistently reproduce the stratospheric impacts and downward propagation of circulation anomalies associated with stratospheric ozone depletion [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">97</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">98</a>]. However, the precise mechanisms for the transfer of signals from the stratosphere to the surface are still a subject of debate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>]. Accurate modelling and improved understanding of mechanisms are important for accurately simulating the relative contribution from other factors that can influence the SAM. In particular, increasing GHG have likely re-enforced the recent ozone-induced SAM increases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>]. The proportion of this contribution is, however, difficult to establish since multi-decadal climate variability has also been implicated as an important contributor to decadal time-scale SAM index trends [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">100</a>]. For example, a key role for decadal cooling of the western tropical Pacific has been identified as contributing to observed positive austral summer and autumn SAM index trends that have occurred since the end of rapid ozone depletion in the late 1990s [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">101</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed changes in the SAM cannot be mapped simply onto changes in westerly jet strength, since changes in jet latitude and width also contribute to recent SAM trends [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>]. This is consistent with recent idealised model studies showing that shifting and strengthening of the westerly jet respond differently to different drivers and across different seasons [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">102</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">103</a>••]. For example, a key aspect of behaviour that emerges from such atmospheric model experiments is that tropospheric heating on either side of the westerly jet acts to induce a change in jet strength, but heating collocated with the jet itself acts to shift the meridional temperature gradient maximum and the associated jet [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">103</a>••]. Ocean coupling does not appear necessary for simulating the jet shift. However, the patterns of warming and cooling under climate change are complex and include coupled ocean-atmosphere-ice feedbacks, the details of which are the subject of on-going research.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Looking to the future, further change is likely across a range of emission scenarios, but the character and even sign of these changes depends on a delicate balance between the relative contributions from a range of drivers. The CMIP5 models include either prescribed or simulated stratospheric ozone recovery over the twenty-first century to near pre-ozone-hole levels by 2100. Therefore, climate models exhibit a cancellation between SAM index decreases associated with stratospheric ozone recovery and SAM index increases associated with increased GHG and global warming. The most up-to-date studies indicate an approximate cancellation of effects for medium emission scenarios, mainly in summer (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), but for high emission scenarios, a dominance of GHG driving overall SAM increases across all seasons by the year 2100 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">104</a>]. However, for a given scenario, the CMIP5 models still produce a wide range in projected changes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>]. Diversity across different climate models in simulations of future changes in the SAM has been linked to a range of different processes including: uncertainties in the representation of shortwave radiative forcing (associated with clouds) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">105</a>]; the representation of eddy feedbacks [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">106</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">107</a>]; and uncertainties associated with the response of the coupled ocean-atmosphere-ice system across different timescales [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" href="#CR108">108</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111" href="#CR111">111</a>]. In terms of the coupled system, recent research has shown that the jet strength component of projected westerly change is highly correlated with biases in Antarctic sea ice across the CMIP5 models [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" href="#CR112">112</a>]. Models with excessive sea ice in their baseline climate simulate more retreat in the future and more polar amplification. This stronger polar amplification weakens the lower-tropospheric temperature gradient across the storm track and acts to cancel out some of the strengthening of the westerlies that occurs due to other processes (in particular, increasing upper-tropospheric temperature gradients). This indicates a potential avenue for constraining future projections of the westerlies based on observed baseline climate, although improved understanding of the mechanisms involved is required.
