 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is informative to briefly compare and contrast the two polar regions. Despite differing geography, the atmospheric circulations of the northern and southern hemispheres share a number of common features, including stratospheric polar vortices, tropospheric westerly jets and associated storm-tracks. There is broad hemispheric symmetry in how the polar circulation responds to well-mixed GHG. In both regions, increased GHG acts to shift poleward the westerly jets and storm-tracks, leading to more positive NAM and SAM indices.</p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A major source of hemispheric asymmetry is the role of stratospheric ozone depletion, which is much larger in the Antarctic. In recent decades, the reinforcing effects of increasing GHG and ozone depletion have led to a robust Southern Hemisphere circulation changes, especially in austral summer. Anticipated ozone recovery may also exert a strong influence, but in the opposite sense, partly or fully offsetting changes to the increasing GHG. Another key difference over recent decades has been the contrasting changes in sea ice. Whilst Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly, there has been a small overall increase in Antarctic sea ice [

Arctic amplification is understood to be important influence on winter circulation change in the Northern Hemisphere [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. In contrast, the Southern Ocean has warmed slower than the global average. Although models suggest that Antarctic amplification will occur over the coming centuries, due to slow adjustment of the ocean circulation, its emergence is delayed relative to the Northern Hemisphere [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137" href="#CR137">137</a>]. Accordingly, sea ice loss and polar amplification appear to be more important in modulating near-term circulation change in the Arctic than in the Antarctic.
