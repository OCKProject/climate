 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) is a climatological low-pressure centre, which migrates seasonally west towards the Ross Sea in winter and east towards the Bellingshausen Sea in summer [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" href="#CR117">117</a>]. It is a key influence on variability of Antarctic-wide zonal wave numbers 1 and 3 since it forms one of the troughs of climatological wave-3 and also occurs in the vicinity of the ridge of wave-1 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" href="#CR118">118</a>]. Regionally, changes in the depth and location of the ASL have a major impact on the climate of West Antarctica [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" href="#CR119">119</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" href="#CR120">120</a>] and it is therefore important in the broader context of understanding observed trends in regional sea ice and West Antarctic ice sheet mass balance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" href="#CR121">121</a>].

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses of past variability indicate that the ASL has deepened in recent decades in association with the increasingly positive polarity of the SAM. However, the drivers of change in the ASL are particularly complex to understand since it is situated in the region of largest atmospheric pressure variability in the Southern Hemisphere [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" href="#CR122">122</a>]. Consistent with this, observations and model results show that a significant part of changes in the post-1979 modern satellite era can be linked to tropical variability. Most notably, El Niño and La Niña are associated with weakening and intensification of the ASL, respectively, in association with a Rossby wave train from the central Pacific that is most prominent in winter. This Rossby wave train is a key explanation for the occurrence of the Pacific South American Pattern (PSA), which is a winter-dominated pattern of troughs and ridges that connects ENSO variability in the tropical Pacific with West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" href="#CR123">123</a>] and in particular, the depth of the ASL [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" href="#CR117">117</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" href="#CR119">119</a>]. However, more recently, the importance of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in spring has been highlighted in association with a wave train propagating from further west in the tropical Pacific that is consistent with a deepening of the ASL linked to the recent trend towards a negative polarity of the PDO [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" href="#CR124">124</a>]. The importance of tropical variability relative to external drivers such as GHG in explaining recent trends was highlighted by Schneider and Deser (2017), who found that historically forced climate model simulations only reproduced observed ASL deepening when tropical sea surface temperature variability was constrained to observed variability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" href="#CR125">125</a>••]. Some climate models do, however, exhibit significant deepening of the ASL in response to stratospheric ozone depletion alone [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" href="#CR126">126</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127" href="#CR127">127</a>], so it is possible that both tropical drivers and stratospheric ozone have contributed significantly.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Looking at future climate change projections, Hosking et al. (2016) found that out of a subset of 11 CMIP5 models, selected based on skill at representing the ASL, the majority simulate a poleward migration of the ASL over the twenty-first century austral summer and autumn [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128" href="#CR128">128</a>•]. Although less consistent, around half of the selected models also exhibit eastward shifts in autumn and winter. These changes are less consistent than the hemispheric-scale strengthening and poleward shift of the westerly jet that are simulated across the CMIP5 ensemble under the same future scenario, thus illustrating the greater uncertainty in projections of smaller-scale regional circulation change around Antarctica.
