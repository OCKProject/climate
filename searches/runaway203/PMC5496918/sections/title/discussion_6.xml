 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We attribute the reduction of autumn Arctic surface warming and the reduction in surface-based Arctic amplification to summer sea ice loss. The processes involved include, among others, a reduced ice-albedo feedback and reduced capability of sea ice to moderate ocean-atmosphere exchange. This is a plausible explanation because the timing of peaks in Arctic SAT growth rate, Arctic SIA loss rate, and Arctic amplification coincide (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c,d</a>). The ice-albedo feedback (as part of the surface-albedo feedback) has been cited as a principal reason for Arctic amplification of anthropogenic climate change

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, it coexists with other (partly-dependent) feedback mechanisms known to cause Arctic amplification. They include sea ice processes unrelated to albedo (involving modified sea surface temperature), the atmospheric lapse rate feedback
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>, temperature effects
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>, and surface albedo change due to adaption processes in clouds, snow cover and vegetation

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future research should investigate the causal link between the loss of summer Arctic sea ice, concomitant albedo decrease, ocean heat uptake, ocean surface warming, and long-wave radiation, and the reduction in Arctic amplification seen in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>. For example, recent work
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span> describes the link between sea ice loss and surface ocean warming, emphasizing the importance of the timing of ice retreat. In the 2010s ice retreat occurs earlier in the marginal shelf seas of the Arctic compared to the 1980s, which enables greater warming there. In the central Arctic Ocean, ice retreat commences late in summer, after August 1, when the net heat flux into the ocean is weaker and increasing winds stir the ocean more strongly. For a significant impact on Arctic amplification, these regions need to become ice-free at least six weeks earlier to substantially warm over the summer
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. Since the Arctic has already transitioned into a state of predominantly first-year ice
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> we hypothesize that this timing sensitivity is most effective in the 2010s, adding to the current peak in Arctic amplification.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CMIP5 models considered here exhibit realistic sea ice properties compared to the NSIDC data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. We select these models because our focus is on the presently-occurring transition from the perennial to the seasonal ice regime, and the associated peak in Arctic amplification. Clearly, uncertainty grows projecting into the future. Indeed, the set of CMIP5 models selected here may not have the most realistic projections

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless, the real Arctic sea ice system passed into the seasonal regime recently (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), as summer ice diminishes. The Arctic sea ice feedback mechanisms are therefore also decreasing. The CMIP5 models that capture such changes in Arctic sea ice exhibit an Arctic amplification history smoothed over 30 years that reaches a maximum in 2012. The model Arctic amplification then declines over a few decades as the sea ice feedback mechanisms fade away. On this basis, it is reasonable to suppose that the amplification of global warming in the real Arctic is also peaking.
