 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Corresponding sea ice volume estimates from PIOMAS and the CMIP5 models are in Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI5</a>. PIOMAS sea ice volume shows declines in both winter- and summer-time extremes through the whole record. The rate of decline exceeds that of sea ice extent (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) because sea ice volume depends on the product of sea ice area and thickness, which are both declining. The PIOMAS seasonality number for sea ice volume (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) shows a rapid increase from about 0.75 in the 1980s to about 1.5 by the end of the record, mainly because the seasonal mean has decreased (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI3</a>). Two recent model estimates of Antarctic sea ice volume seasonality numbers appear in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>; from a forced ice-ocean simulation

  </span> and using assimilation

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>, essentially similar to the PIOMAS. For most of the last decade, the PIOMAS seasonality numbers have been in the same range as the Antarctic estimates. The PIOMAS Arctic-Subarctic sea ice volume seasonality exceeds the highest Antarctic 
  <span class="italic">Se</span> in 2012, however. The CMIP5 multi-model mean sea ice volume seasonality numbers agree well with the PIOMAS estimates although they under-estimate the rate of increase in the 2010s. The RCP8.5 sea ice volume projections enter the seasonally-episodic regime (
