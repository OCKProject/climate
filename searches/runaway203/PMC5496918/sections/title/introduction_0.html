      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence for Arctic sea ice decline comes from multiple sources, including satellite
         data, 
         <span>in situ</span> observations, and coupled climate models. For example, the linear trend in northern
         hemisphere monthly-mean sea ice extent in summer and autumn is −6.6 ± 1.2% per decade
         on average (for 1979–2012
         <span><a>1</a>, 
            <a>2</a></span>; see also Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>). The corresponding rate of decline in winter and spring is much lower at −2.1 ± 0.5%
         per decade. Arctic sea-ice is also getting thinner
         <span><a>3</a>, 
            <a>4</a></span>. The mean thickness at the time of minimum extent has decreased from 3.02 m (during
         1958–1976, from submarine data), to 1.43 m (during 2003–2007, based on ICESat satellite
         data). As a consequence of decreasing extent and thickness, Arctic sea ice volume
         is dropping too
         <span><a>5</a></span>, by 20% for the mean volume of the 2000s compared to 1980–2000 (based on the PIOMAS
         sea ice assimilation product; see also Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rate of Arctic sea ice decline projected by coupled climate models in the 21st
         century varies greatly
         <span><a>6</a>, 
            <a>7</a></span>. Many models still have difficulties to simulate a trend similar to the observed
         rapid ice loss
         <span><a>8</a>, 
            <a>9</a></span>. Nevertheless, a subset of models among those at the Coupled Model Intercomparison
         Project phase 5 (CMIP5) demonstrate realistic sea ice declines (Figs 
         <a>1a</a>, 
         <a>2a</a>, 
         <a>SI4</a> and 
         <a>SI5</a>). Moreover, the sea ice decline has been attributed to anthropogenic CO
         <sub>2</sub> forcing in the atmosphere, not internal variability or unforced instability due to
         ice-albedo feedback
         <span><a>10</a>, 
            <a>11</a></span>. On the basis of this evidence, the Arctic sea ice system will switch from a regime
         of perennial (year-round) ice cover to seasonal cover (mainly in winter) in the 21st
         century
         <span><a>6</a>, 
            <a>12</a>–
            <a>14</a></span>. For example, sea ice projections in the fourth assessment of the Intergovernmental
         Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that a large part of the Arctic Ocean will
         be seasonally ice-covered by the end of the twenty-first century
         <span><a>7</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify this change in seasonality, attention has focused on when the Arctic will
         be ice-free in summer. Typically, this question is addressed by estimating when September
         sea ice extent is less than 10
         <span>6</span> km
         <span>2</span> (about 15% of the 1980s value) for at least five consecutive years
         <span><a>8</a>, 
            <a>9</a>, 
            <a>15</a>, 
            <a>16</a></span>. For example, analysis of sea ice projections in the fifth IPCC assessment climate
         models
         <span><a>16</a></span> suggests that this threshold will be reached in 2054–2058 under a high emission scenario
         (the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario, RCP8.5
         <span><a>17</a></span>). Under a medium-mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) September sea ice extent is projected
         to reach 1.7 × 10
         <span>6</span> km
         <span>2</span> in the early 2060s, followed by a leveling off
         <span><a>16</a></span>. Nevertheless, model-based estimates of when the Arctic will be ice-free in September
         are associated with substantial uncertainty
         <span><a>8</a>, 
            <a>9</a>, 
            <a>14</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although an important issue, this threshold approach emphasizes the final stages of
         the transition, when the summer sea ice is about 85% gone. It does not address the
         earlier stages of the transition which involve dramatic changes to the Arctic climate
         system. Furthermore, the ice-free-summer threshold is a binary criterion that cannot
         measure the continuous transition in the sea ice seasonal cycle. It relies on a somewhat
         arbitrary (albeit reasonable, see Fig. 
         <a>3</a>) definition of “ice-free;” namely the 10
         <span>6</span> km
         <span>2</span> threshold on summer ice extent. The date at which the Arctic is declared to be ice
         free depends on this threshold in an obvious way.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we propose a novel, non-dimensional number to quantify seasonality as
         an objective, continuous indicator of Arctic change. We then apply it to the Arctic-Subarctic
         sea ice system and explore the implications for Arctic amplification of global warming.
         The key findings are that the Arctic-Subarctic sea ice system is now as seasonal as
         the Antarctic sea ice system, and we expect that surface-based autumn Arctic amplification
         will peak in the present decade.
