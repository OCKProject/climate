  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observations and CMIP5 model simulations of the Arctic-Subarctic, i.e. the total northern hemisphere, sea ice extent and the corresponding seasonality numbers are shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. 
   <span class="italic">Sea ice extent</span> is defined as the total area enclosed by the 15% sea ice concentration contour. The observations are from the monthly National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC; see Methods) satellite sea ice index

   <span class="sup">6</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span> in 2007 and 2012. In contrast, the winter-time sea ice maxima losses are smaller. Prior to the satellite observations, sea ice estimates are taken from a recent product
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span> of gridded historical ice observations (see Methods), which show weaker trends.
  </p>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> also shows sea ice extent data from the Polar Science Center Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span>). The PIOMAS estimates cover the same time period as the NSIDC data, but the seasonal range is less; mainly because they underestimate the winter-time maxima in sea ice extent. The summer-time PIOMAS minima are also typically greater than from the NSIDC data, but they nearly coincide since 2007.
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The associated sea ice extent seasonality numbers appear in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>. Prior to 2000, the NSIDC data exhibit seasonality numbers around 0.75. This means that the seasonal range (winter maximum minus summer minimum) in sea ice extent was about 75% of the mean sea ice extent. The seasonality numbers from the PIOMAS estimates are also in the perennial regime (
   <span class="italic">Se</span> &lt; 1; Supplementary Information), but are lower, around 0.55. Although the PIOMAS sea ice extent means are smaller than those from the NSIDC data, the NSIDC seasonal ranges are larger (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), which dominates the seasonality number (Eq. (
   <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>)). Since 2000, the seasonality numbers from both the NSIDC and the PIOMAS have increased, mainly because the seasonal range has increased (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI3</a>). The NSIDC seasonality number peaked above one in 2007 and 2012, the years of record low summer sea ice extents. The PIOMAS seasonality number matches the NSIDC value much closer since 2007.
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For comparison, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a> also shows the seasonality number for NSIDC sea ice extent in the Antarctic. In this case, 
   <span class="italic">Se</span> ≈ 1.3 with no obvious trend over the last century (prior to the satellite observations, sea ice estimates are taken from the HadISST product
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span>, although other studies have not quantified the seasonality with an objective metric like 
   <span class="italic">Se</span>. The Arctic-Subarctic sea ice extent is now approaching the same degree of seasonality, with fluctuations, and in 2012 it peaked at 
   <span class="italic">Se</span> = 1.16, overlapping the envelope of Antarctic values. The seasonality number for NSIDC 
   <span class="italic">sea ice area</span> (the total area covered by ice) for the northern and southern hemispheres is shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a> with thin brown lines. Sea ice area 
   <span class="italic">Se</span> is very well correlated with 
   <span class="italic">Se</span> for sea ice extent. It is greater, however, by about 0.19 on average. The reason is that the mean sea ice area is less than the mean sea ice extent in general, so the denominator in (1) is smaller for sea ice area. Still, the northern hemisphere sea ice area seasonality now overlaps the Antarctic values, as it does for sea ice extent.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results from fifteen CMIP5 coupled climate models are also shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. We use historical and RCP8.5 projections from those models that exhibit realistic Arctic sea ice area during the period of overlap with the NSIDC data considering various validation metrics
   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
   </span>. Specifically, these models meet criteria on realism of their September ice extent, their trend in September ice extent, their monthly climatology and the magnitude of their seasonal cycle. For the 20th century, the multi-model mean shows realistic sea ice extent cycles between 8 and 16 × 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span> (results from the individual model runs are in Figs 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI4</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI6</a>). The selected CMIP5 models all show declines in sea ice extent at the end of the 20th and throughout the 21st centuries. They project that summer minimum sea ice extent will fall below 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span> by about 2070. As in the observations, the CMIP5 winter-time (March mean) declines are smaller than those in the summer-time (September mean). The rates of decline are smaller than the NSIDC data in the summers of the 2010s.
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sea ice extent seasonality number for the CMIP5 multi-model mean is around 0.7 for 1900 to 1995, then increases (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The CMIP5 model seasonality number trends over the period of NSIDC data are realistic, as is the pattern of sea ice extent when 
   <span class="italic">Se</span> passes one (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, turquoise area). The inter-annual variability in the sea ice extent seasonality number of the CMIP5 models selected is also realistic compared to the NSIDC data (0.064 compared to 0.068). The CMIP5 multi-model mean seasonality number moves to the seasonal regime in the 2020s, however, about ten years after the NSIDC data mainly because they under-estimate the loss of sea ice extent in the 2010s.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dominant factor in controlling 
   <span class="italic">Se</span> for the Arctic for the observational period is the annual minimum in sea ice extent (namely, the

   <span class="italic">extent</span>). Indeed the linear correlation coefficient between these variables is −0.97 for the NSIDC data. The linear correlation fails for multi-year sea ice extent less than about 2 × 10

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Corresponding sea ice volume estimates from PIOMAS and the CMIP5 models are in Figs 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI5</a>. PIOMAS sea ice volume shows declines in both winter- and summer-time extremes through the whole record. The rate of decline exceeds that of sea ice extent (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) because sea ice volume depends on the product of sea ice area and thickness, which are both declining. The PIOMAS seasonality number for sea ice volume (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) shows a rapid increase from about 0.75 in the 1980s to about 1.5 by the end of the record, mainly because the seasonal mean has decreased (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI3</a>). Two recent model estimates of Antarctic sea ice volume seasonality numbers appear in Fig.

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
   </span>, essentially similar to the PIOMAS. For most of the last decade, the PIOMAS seasonality numbers have been in the same range as the Antarctic estimates. The PIOMAS Arctic-Subarctic sea ice volume seasonality exceeds the highest Antarctic 
   <span class="italic">Se</span> in 2012, however. The CMIP5 multi-model mean sea ice volume seasonality numbers agree well with the PIOMAS estimates although they under-estimate the rate of increase in the 2010s. The RCP8.5 sea ice volume projections enter the seasonally-episodic regime (

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea ice influences, among other variables, Arctic SAT by moderating both absorption of insolation at the surface and property exchange between the ocean and atmosphere. As sea ice retreats during the melt season it exposes the darker ocean to direct insolation, which then warms locally over the summer, causing further ice retreat. Seasonally, the warmer ocean accelerates ice melt and delays re-freezing. Inter-annually, less sea ice survives summer melt and the shorter freezing season promotes overall thinner ice which is more prone to retreat during the next melt season. This positive ice-albedo feedback is an important process under global warming
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>, 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>, 
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sea ice cover also impedes heat and moisture fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere. In autumn and winter the open ocean can significantly warm the atmosphere in the absence of sea ice
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
   </span>. In conjunction with advection from lower latitudes of warm and moist air, this was a key factor leading to unusual high surface temperatures in the Arctic in autumn 2016
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
   </span>. Moreover, it shows that Arctic amplification is influenced by non-local processes. Sea ice retreat, and its consequences, may cause it to vary in time, however. For example, the positive ice-albedo feedback is most effective when a thin ice cover exists because it requires the contrast between dark open water that warms and bright sea ice that rapidly melts. Due to the topographic enclosure of the Arctic Ocean by land, sea ice retreat is limited and the ice-albedo feedback will disappear once the ocean becomes ice-free in the sunlit season. To the extent that the ice-albedo feedback influences Arctic amplification, Arctic amplification should be greatest during the time of fastest year-to-year ice retreat.
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate this idea further we focus on two quantitative diagnostics. We study the decadal increase in autumn mean surface air temperature (SAT) north of 70°N (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>, dashed lines) and the decline in summer minimum sea ice area (SIA; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). By limiting the area of interest to north of 70°N we focus on processes related to the Arctic Ocean, such as sea ice coverage and enhanced upper ocean heat storage. Other processes involved in Arctic amplification, such as variations in snow cover on land, are not explicitly considered, although they are represented in the climate models. The CMIP5 model RCP8.5 projections are examined after applying a 30-year boxcar filter to reduce the influence of model-specific interannual to decadal variability. The rates of change of both Arctic summer SIA and autumn SAT peak in the decade of the 2010s (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>, blue and light blue lines). In contrast, the rate of change of global mean autumn SAT increases to a plateau after 2060 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>, indigo line).
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We quantify the peak effectiveness of sea ice feedbacks using the year of greatest combined summer sea ice retreat and subsequent autumn warming (see Methods and Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI7</a>). This peak occurs in 2012 for the CMIP5 multi-model mean and is shown with a black vertical dashed line in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b–d</a>. At the same time autumn Arctic SAT warming reaches a maximum and so does Arctic amplification, measured by an Arctic amplification factor, which reaches a magnitude of 3.0 in 2015 for the ensemble mean (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). We define the Arctic amplification factor as the ratio of Arctic mean to global mean SAT anomaly. This variable varies with time to quantify the secular change in the amplification magnitude. SAT anomalies are computed with respect to the period 1960–1980. Autumn Arctic SIA decline stays high for another ten years before diminishing after 2030.
  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, the peak year in sea ice feedback effectiveness coincides with the year that the CMIP5 multi-model mean passes from the perennial to the seasonal regime for sea ice area (
   <span class="italic">Se</span> = 1, coloured circles on Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). And it precedes both the time when half the September sea ice area is lost and when the commonly-used 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span> threshold is reached (in years 2024 and 2050, respectively, for the CMIP5 multi-model mean). This finding suggests that the seasonality number is closely related to the effectiveness of sea ice feedbacks in modulating Arctic amplification. The multi-model mean Arctic amplification factor decreases significantly after 2015 reaching a value of 2.4 toward the end of the study period in 2085 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Processes such as the ice-albedo feedback preferentially accelerate summer sea ice melt, increasing the seasonal range, namely, the numerator in (1). They also facilitate an inter-annual decrease of the mean ice thickness and area, thus decreasing the denominator of (1). Both effects increase the seasonality number, with greatest impact when sea ice processes are most effective, i.e. when there is still a contrast between ice-covered and open ocean in the Arctic. Thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that the change from the perennial to the seasonal regime occurs when sea ice feedbacks are most effective. For these reasons, we speculate that the decisive transition of the Arctic climate and eco-systems will occur during the next decade, long before the threshold of an ice-free Arctic is reached.</p>
