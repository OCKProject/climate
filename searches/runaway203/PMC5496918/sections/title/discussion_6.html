      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We attribute the reduction of autumn Arctic surface warming and the reduction in surface-based
         Arctic amplification to summer sea ice loss. The processes involved include, among
         others, a reduced ice-albedo feedback and reduced capability of sea ice to moderate
         ocean-atmosphere exchange. This is a plausible explanation because the timing of peaks
         in Arctic SAT growth rate, Arctic SIA loss rate, and Arctic amplification coincide
         (Fig. 
         <a>4c,d</a>). The ice-albedo feedback (as part of the surface-albedo feedback) has been cited
         as a principal reason for Arctic amplification of anthropogenic climate change
         <span><a>35</a>, 
            <a>41</a>, 
            <a>44</a></span>. Nevertheless, it coexists with other (partly-dependent) feedback mechanisms known
         to cause Arctic amplification. They include sea ice processes unrelated to albedo
         (involving modified sea surface temperature), the atmospheric lapse rate feedback
         <span><a>45</a></span>, temperature effects
         <span><a>46</a></span>, and surface albedo change due to adaption processes in clouds, snow cover and vegetation
         <span><a>34</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future research should investigate the causal link between the loss of summer Arctic
         sea ice, concomitant albedo decrease, ocean heat uptake, ocean surface warming, and
         long-wave radiation, and the reduction in Arctic amplification seen in Fig. 
         <a>4</a>. For example, recent work
         <span><a>47</a></span> describes the link between sea ice loss and surface ocean warming, emphasizing the
         importance of the timing of ice retreat. In the 2010s ice retreat occurs earlier in
         the marginal shelf seas of the Arctic compared to the 1980s, which enables greater
         warming there. In the central Arctic Ocean, ice retreat commences late in summer,
         after August 1, when the net heat flux into the ocean is weaker and increasing winds
         stir the ocean more strongly. For a significant impact on Arctic amplification, these
         regions need to become ice-free at least six weeks earlier to substantially warm over
         the summer
         <span><a>47</a></span>. Since the Arctic has already transitioned into a state of predominantly first-year
         ice
         <span><a>48</a></span> we hypothesize that this timing sensitivity is most effective in the 2010s, adding
         to the current peak in Arctic amplification.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CMIP5 models considered here exhibit realistic sea ice properties compared to
         the NSIDC data
         <span><a>14</a>, 
            <a>16</a></span>. We select these models because our focus is on the presently-occurring transition
         from the perennial to the seasonal ice regime, and the associated peak in Arctic amplification.
         Clearly, uncertainty grows projecting into the future. Indeed, the set of CMIP5 models
         selected here may not have the most realistic projections
         <span><a>49</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless, the real Arctic sea ice system passed into the seasonal regime recently
         (Figs 
         <a>1</a> and 
         <a>2</a>), as summer ice diminishes. The Arctic sea ice feedback mechanisms are therefore
         also decreasing. The CMIP5 models that capture such changes in Arctic sea ice exhibit
         an Arctic amplification history smoothed over 30 years that reaches a maximum in 2012.
         The model Arctic amplification then declines over a few decades as the sea ice feedback
         mechanisms fade away. On this basis, it is reasonable to suppose that the amplification
         of global warming in the real Arctic is also peaking.
