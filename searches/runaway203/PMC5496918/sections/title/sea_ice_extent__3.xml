 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observations and CMIP5 model simulations of the Arctic-Subarctic, i.e. the total northern hemisphere, sea ice extent and the corresponding seasonality numbers are shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. 
  <span class="italic">Sea ice extent</span> is defined as the total area enclosed by the 15% sea ice concentration contour. The observations are from the monthly National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC; see Methods) satellite sea ice index
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. They show the well-known decline in summer-time sea ice extent in recent years, from annual minima around 7 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in the early 1980s to record-breaking lows of about 4.3 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and 3.6 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in 2007 and 2012. In contrast, the winter-time sea ice maxima losses are smaller. Prior to the satellite observations, sea ice estimates are taken from a recent product
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> of gridded historical ice observations (see Methods), which show weaker trends.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> also shows sea ice extent data from the Polar Science Center Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>). The PIOMAS estimates cover the same time period as the NSIDC data, but the seasonal range is less; mainly because they underestimate the winter-time maxima in sea ice extent. The summer-time PIOMAS minima are also typically greater than from the NSIDC data, but they nearly coincide since 2007.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The associated sea ice extent seasonality numbers appear in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>. Prior to 2000, the NSIDC data exhibit seasonality numbers around 0.75. This means that the seasonal range (winter maximum minus summer minimum) in sea ice extent was about 75% of the mean sea ice extent. The seasonality numbers from the PIOMAS estimates are also in the perennial regime (
  <span class="italic">Se</span> &lt; 1; Supplementary Information), but are lower, around 0.55. Although the PIOMAS sea ice extent means are smaller than those from the NSIDC data, the NSIDC seasonal ranges are larger (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), which dominates the seasonality number (Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>)). Since 2000, the seasonality numbers from both the NSIDC and the PIOMAS have increased, mainly because the seasonal range has increased (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI3</a>). The NSIDC seasonality number peaked above one in 2007 and 2012, the years of record low summer sea ice extents. The PIOMAS seasonality number matches the NSIDC value much closer since 2007.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For comparison, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a> also shows the seasonality number for NSIDC sea ice extent in the Antarctic. In this case, 
  <span class="italic">Se</span> ≈ 1.3 with no obvious trend over the last century (prior to the satellite observations, sea ice estimates are taken from the HadISST product
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>; see Methods). The Antarctic sea ice system is well-known to be in the seasonal regime
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, although other studies have not quantified the seasonality with an objective metric like 
  <span class="italic">Se</span>. The Arctic-Subarctic sea ice extent is now approaching the same degree of seasonality, with fluctuations, and in 2012 it peaked at 
  <span class="italic">Se</span> = 1.16, overlapping the envelope of Antarctic values. The seasonality number for NSIDC 
  <span class="italic">sea ice area</span> (the total area covered by ice) for the northern and southern hemispheres is shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a> with thin brown lines. Sea ice area 
  <span class="italic">Se</span> is very well correlated with 
  <span class="italic">Se</span> for sea ice extent. It is greater, however, by about 0.19 on average. The reason is that the mean sea ice area is less than the mean sea ice extent in general, so the denominator in (1) is smaller for sea ice area. Still, the northern hemisphere sea ice area seasonality now overlaps the Antarctic values, as it does for sea ice extent.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results from fifteen CMIP5 coupled climate models are also shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. We use historical and RCP8.5 projections from those models that exhibit realistic Arctic sea ice area during the period of overlap with the NSIDC data considering various validation metrics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Specifically, these models meet criteria on realism of their September ice extent, their trend in September ice extent, their monthly climatology and the magnitude of their seasonal cycle. For the 20th century, the multi-model mean shows realistic sea ice extent cycles between 8 and 16 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (results from the individual model runs are in Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI4</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI6</a>). The selected CMIP5 models all show declines in sea ice extent at the end of the 20th and throughout the 21st centuries. They project that summer minimum sea ice extent will fall below 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> by about 2070. As in the observations, the CMIP5 winter-time (March mean) declines are smaller than those in the summer-time (September mean). The rates of decline are smaller than the NSIDC data in the summers of the 2010s.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sea ice extent seasonality number for the CMIP5 multi-model mean is around 0.7 for 1900 to 1995, then increases (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The CMIP5 model seasonality number trends over the period of NSIDC data are realistic, as is the pattern of sea ice extent when 
  <span class="italic">Se</span> passes one (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, turquoise area). The inter-annual variability in the sea ice extent seasonality number of the CMIP5 models selected is also realistic compared to the NSIDC data (0.064 compared to 0.068). The CMIP5 multi-model mean seasonality number moves to the seasonal regime in the 2020s, however, about ten years after the NSIDC data mainly because they under-estimate the loss of sea ice extent in the 2010s.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dominant factor in controlling 
  <span class="italic">Se</span> for the Arctic for the observational period is the annual minimum in sea ice extent (namely, the 
  <span class="italic">multi-year</span>
  <span class="italic">sea ice</span>
  <span class="italic">extent</span>). Indeed the linear correlation coefficient between these variables is −0.97 for the NSIDC data. The linear correlation fails for multi-year sea ice extent less than about 2 × 10
