 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NSIDC data product comprises merged satellite passive microwave measurements from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder, the older DMSP Special Sensor Microwave/Imager, and the Nimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer. The NASA Team algorithm is used to derive sea ice concentrations. These data (version 2.1 for the monthly sea ice index data, version 1.1 for the daily data) are available since November 1978. Prior to that time, we use the Walsh

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea ice extent is defined as the area of ocean enclosed by the 15% sea ice concentration contour, which is computed from the sea ice distribution. Sea ice area is the integrated area covered by ice. It is a metric that avoids the non-linearity inherent in sea ice extent, but has a larger observational uncertainty. The correlation coefficient for northern hemisphere sea ice extent and sea ice area is 0.94. Sea ice volume is the area-integrated product of sea ice concentration (ice-covered area fraction) and thickness and is harder to estimate than either sea ice extent or area because of the uncertainty in ice thickness.</p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NSIDC satellite data contain various uncertainties, but they all cause small errors compared to the inter-annual changes and the decadal trend seen in the seasonality number in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>. First, a region near 90°N is unobserved by the satellites (the so-called “pole-hole”). Various assumptions exist to extrapolate the sea ice concentration over the unobserved region, but they do not affect the seasonality number. Second, uncertainty in sea ice concentration for individual grid cells in the daily sea ice images (between 5 and 15%, depending on season) causes uncertainty in the seasonality number that is smaller than the thickness of the line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>. Consistently, the uncertainty on total sea ice extent is 2–3 × 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (W. Meier, Personal Communication), which gives an uncertainty in 
  <span class="italic">Se</span> of a few parts in a thousand. Finally, different algorithms exist to process the satellite data, but they do not cause large uncertainty in the seasonality number: for example, the NASA Bootstrap sea ice product (version 2.1)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span> gives an 
  <span class="italic">Se</span> timeseries that differs from that of the NSIDC data in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a> by 0.028 (smaller) on average, a standard deviation of 0.016, and a correlation coefficient of 0.993.
