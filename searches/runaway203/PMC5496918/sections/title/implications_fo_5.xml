  </span>. We illustrate the impact of the transitioning of the Arctic sea ice cover to the seasonal regime on the climate system by a simple example: the role of the ice cover in Arctic amplification. Arctic amplification is the faster rate of Arctic warming compared to the global average (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>), which is most prominent in autumn and winter
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. While Arctic amplification can be found throughout the troposphere, it is strongest at the surface
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. Several studies show that sea ice plays a major role in surface Arctic amplification

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea ice influences, among other variables, Arctic SAT by moderating both absorption of insolation at the surface and property exchange between the ocean and atmosphere. As sea ice retreats during the melt season it exposes the darker ocean to direct insolation, which then warms locally over the summer, causing further ice retreat. Seasonally, the warmer ocean accelerates ice melt and delays re-freezing. Inter-annually, less sea ice survives summer melt and the shorter freezing season promotes overall thinner ice which is more prone to retreat during the next melt season. This positive ice-albedo feedback is an important process under global warming

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sea ice cover also impedes heat and moisture fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere. In autumn and winter the open ocean can significantly warm the atmosphere in the absence of sea ice
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. In conjunction with advection from lower latitudes of warm and moist air, this was a key factor leading to unusual high surface temperatures in the Arctic in autumn 2016
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. Moreover, it shows that Arctic amplification is influenced by non-local processes. Sea ice retreat, and its consequences, may cause it to vary in time, however. For example, the positive ice-albedo feedback is most effective when a thin ice cover exists because it requires the contrast between dark open water that warms and bright sea ice that rapidly melts. Due to the topographic enclosure of the Arctic Ocean by land, sea ice retreat is limited and the ice-albedo feedback will disappear once the ocean becomes ice-free in the sunlit season. To the extent that the ice-albedo feedback influences Arctic amplification, Arctic amplification should be greatest during the time of fastest year-to-year ice retreat.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate this idea further we focus on two quantitative diagnostics. We study the decadal increase in autumn mean surface air temperature (SAT) north of 70°N (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>, dashed lines) and the decline in summer minimum sea ice area (SIA; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). By limiting the area of interest to north of 70°N we focus on processes related to the Arctic Ocean, such as sea ice coverage and enhanced upper ocean heat storage. Other processes involved in Arctic amplification, such as variations in snow cover on land, are not explicitly considered, although they are represented in the climate models. The CMIP5 model RCP8.5 projections are examined after applying a 30-year boxcar filter to reduce the influence of model-specific interannual to decadal variability. The rates of change of both Arctic summer SIA and autumn SAT peak in the decade of the 2010s (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>, blue and light blue lines). In contrast, the rate of change of global mean autumn SAT increases to a plateau after 2060 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>, indigo line).
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We quantify the peak effectiveness of sea ice feedbacks using the year of greatest combined summer sea ice retreat and subsequent autumn warming (see Methods and Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI7</a>). This peak occurs in 2012 for the CMIP5 multi-model mean and is shown with a black vertical dashed line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b–d</a>. At the same time autumn Arctic SAT warming reaches a maximum and so does Arctic amplification, measured by an Arctic amplification factor, which reaches a magnitude of 3.0 in 2015 for the ensemble mean (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). We define the Arctic amplification factor as the ratio of Arctic mean to global mean SAT anomaly. This variable varies with time to quantify the secular change in the amplification magnitude. SAT anomalies are computed with respect to the period 1960–1980. Autumn Arctic SIA decline stays high for another ten years before diminishing after 2030.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, the peak year in sea ice feedback effectiveness coincides with the year that the CMIP5 multi-model mean passes from the perennial to the seasonal regime for sea ice area (
  <span class="italic">Se</span> = 1, coloured circles on Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). And it precedes both the time when half the September sea ice area is lost and when the commonly-used 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> threshold is reached (in years 2024 and 2050, respectively, for the CMIP5 multi-model mean). This finding suggests that the seasonality number is closely related to the effectiveness of sea ice feedbacks in modulating Arctic amplification. The multi-model mean Arctic amplification factor decreases significantly after 2015 reaching a value of 2.4 toward the end of the study period in 2085 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Processes such as the ice-albedo feedback preferentially accelerate summer sea ice melt, increasing the seasonal range, namely, the numerator in (1). They also facilitate an inter-annual decrease of the mean ice thickness and area, thus decreasing the denominator of (1). Both effects increase the seasonality number, with greatest impact when sea ice processes are most effective, i.e. when there is still a contrast between ice-covered and open ocean in the Arctic. Thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that the change from the perennial to the seasonal regime occurs when sea ice feedbacks are most effective. For these reasons, we speculate that the decisive transition of the Arctic climate and eco-systems will occur during the next decade, long before the threshold of an ice-free Arctic is reached.</p>
