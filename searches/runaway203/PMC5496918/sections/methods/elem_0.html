         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NSIDC data product comprises merged satellite passive microwave measurements from
            the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder,
            the older DMSP Special Sensor Microwave/Imager, and the Nimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel
            Microwave Radiometer. The NASA Team algorithm is used to derive sea ice concentrations.
            These data (version 2.1 for the monthly sea ice index data, version 1.1 for the daily
            data) are available since November 1978. Prior to that time, we use the Walsh 
            <span>et al</span>.
            <span><a>19</a></span> gridded monthly sea ice data which synthesizes the (sparse) records of sea ice extent,
            primarily from hand-drawn charts
            <span><a>50</a></span>. Similarly, we use HadISST data
            <span><a>21</a></span> for the Antarctic before the satellite era. The PIOMAS product
            <span><a>20</a></span> blends ice concentration and sea-surface temperature data with a dynamical sea ice
            and ocean circulation model.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea ice extent is defined as the area of ocean enclosed by the 15% sea ice concentration
            contour, which is computed from the sea ice distribution. Sea ice area is the integrated
            area covered by ice. It is a metric that avoids the non-linearity inherent in sea
            ice extent, but has a larger observational uncertainty. The correlation coefficient
            for northern hemisphere sea ice extent and sea ice area is 0.94. Sea ice volume is
            the area-integrated product of sea ice concentration (ice-covered area fraction) and
            thickness and is harder to estimate than either sea ice extent or area because of
            the uncertainty in ice thickness.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NSIDC satellite data contain various uncertainties, but they all cause small errors
            compared to the inter-annual changes and the decadal trend seen in the seasonality
            number in Fig. 
            <a>1b</a>. First, a region near 90°N is unobserved by the satellites (the so-called “pole-hole”).
            Various assumptions exist to extrapolate the sea ice concentration over the unobserved
            region, but they do not affect the seasonality number. Second, uncertainty in sea
            ice concentration for individual grid cells in the daily sea ice images (between 5
            and 15%, depending on season) causes uncertainty in the seasonality number that is
            smaller than the thickness of the line in Fig. 
            <a>1b</a>. Consistently, the uncertainty on total sea ice extent is 2–3 × 10
            <span>4</span> km
            <span>2</span> (W. Meier, Personal Communication), which gives an uncertainty in 
            <span>Se</span> of a few parts in a thousand. Finally, different algorithms exist to process the
            satellite data, but they do not cause large uncertainty in the seasonality number:
            for example, the NASA Bootstrap sea ice product (version 2.1)
            <span><a>51</a></span> gives an 
            <span>Se</span> timeseries that differs from that of the NSIDC data in Fig. 
            <a>1b</a> by 0.028 (smaller) on average, a standard deviation of 0.016, and a correlation coefficient
            of 0.993.
