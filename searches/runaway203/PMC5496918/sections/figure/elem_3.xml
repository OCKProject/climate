  <p>Sea ice trends and peak Arctic amplification in CMIP5 historical runs and RCP8.5 projections. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Autumn (September to November) Arctic (north of 70°N) mean surface air temperature (SAT; dashed lines) and global mean SAT (solid lines). Temperatures are anomalies with respect to the relevant 1960–1980 mean and smoothed by a 30-year boxcar filter. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Arctic September mean sea ice area (SIA) from the CMIP5 models (colored lines) and the multi-model mean (black line). Colored circles mark the year in which each model run passes through 
   <span class="italic">Se</span> = 1. The vertical black dashed line marks the multi-model mean peak year of sea-ice-related feedbacks (also shown in (
   <span class="bold">c</span>,
   <span class="bold">d</span>); see Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">SI7</a>). The lower horizontal gray dashed line marks the commonly-used 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span> threshold of an ice-free Arctic. The upper horizontal gray dashed line marks 50% of the 1960–1980 SIA value. (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Rates of SIA and SAT change based on the 30-year running mean smoothed multi-model mean time series shown in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>, 
   <span class="bold">b</span>). (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) Time series of the Arctic amplification factor defined as the ratio of Arctic to global SAT anomalies as shown in (
   <span class="bold">a</span>).
