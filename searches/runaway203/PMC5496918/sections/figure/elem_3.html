         <p>Sea ice trends and peak Arctic amplification in CMIP5 historical runs and RCP8.5 projections.
            (
            <span>a</span>) Autumn (September to November) Arctic (north of 70°N) mean surface air temperature
            (SAT; dashed lines) and global mean SAT (solid lines). Temperatures are anomalies
            with respect to the relevant 1960–1980 mean and smoothed by a 30-year boxcar filter.
            (
            <span>b</span>) Arctic September mean sea ice area (SIA) from the CMIP5 models (colored lines) and
            the multi-model mean (black line). Colored circles mark the year in which each model
            run passes through 
            <span>Se</span> = 1. The vertical black dashed line marks the multi-model mean peak year of sea-ice-related
            feedbacks (also shown in (
            <span>c</span>,
            <span>d</span>); see Fig. 
            <a>SI7</a>). The lower horizontal gray dashed line marks the commonly-used 10
            <span>6</span> km
            <span>2</span> threshold of an ice-free Arctic. The upper horizontal gray dashed line marks 50%
            of the 1960–1980 SIA value. (
            <span>c</span>) Rates of SIA and SAT change based on the 30-year running mean smoothed multi-model
            mean time series shown in (
            <span>a</span>, 
            <span>b</span>). (
            <span>d</span>) Time series of the Arctic amplification factor defined as the ratio of Arctic to
            global SAT anomalies as shown in (
            <span>a</span>).
