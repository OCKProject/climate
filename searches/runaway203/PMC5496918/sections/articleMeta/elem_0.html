         <p>The loss of Arctic sea ice is a conspicuous example of climate change. Climate models
            project ice-free conditions during summer this century under realistic emission scenarios,
            reflecting the increase in seasonality in ice cover. To quantify the increased seasonality
            in the Arctic-Subarctic sea ice system, we define a non-dimensional seasonality number
            for sea ice extent, area, and volume from satellite data and realistic coupled climate
            models. We show that the Arctic-Subarctic, i.e. the northern hemisphere, sea ice now
            exhibits similar levels of seasonality to the Antarctic, which is in a seasonal regime
            without significant change since satellite observations began in 1979. Realistic climate
            models suggest that this transition to the seasonal regime is being accompanied by
            a maximum in Arctic amplification, which is the faster warming of Arctic latitudes
            compared to the global mean, in the 2010s. The strong link points to a peak in sea-ice-related
            feedbacks that occurs long before the Arctic becomes ice-free in summer.
