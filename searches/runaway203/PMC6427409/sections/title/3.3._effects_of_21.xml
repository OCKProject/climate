  <sub>4</sub> Fluxes
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the uncertainty of future meteorological data is high, in order to study the effects of climate factors on CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes, the correlation analysis and regression analysis of historical meteorological data and CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission fluxes at each station in the study area were carried out. From 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f012" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f012">Figure 12</a>, CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes increased with the increase of Tmax, Tmin, and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration, and were significantly correlated with them (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). The CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes decreased first and then increased with the increase of rainfall and Rad, and the correlation between them was not significant. Therefore, the increase of Tmax, Tmin, and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration at each station in the study area from 1960 to 2015 (
  <a rid="ijerph-16-00692-t003" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-00692-t003">Table 3</a>) promoted the increase of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes. Compared with historical average, the Tmin, Tmax, and the atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration in the 2070s period increased by 1.90 °C, 2.17 °C, and 92.80 ppm (
  <a rid="ijerph-16-00692-t003" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-00692-t003">Table 3</a>), respectively, resulting in a 92.8 kg C/ha increase in CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes, which was an increase of 64%. Under RCP 8.5 in the 2070s, the Tmin, Tmax, and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration increased by 3.71 °C, 3.86 °C, and 172.69 ppm (
  <a rid="ijerph-16-00692-t003" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-00692-t003">Table 3</a>), respectively, resulting in an increase of 172.69 kg C/ha in CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes, with an increase of 118%, which was greater than that under RCP 4.5. The above analysis showed that increasing temperature and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration can accelerate CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to further study the effects of atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature on CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes, the four simulation scenarios are as follows: (1) the atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature do not change; (2) the atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration increases, but the temperature does not change; (3) the atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration does not change, but the temperature changes; and (4) both the atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature change. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f013" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f013">Figure 13</a> showed the response of SOC content in the 0–20-cm soil layer, biomass (including leaf, stem, and root), and CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes to climate changes under RCP 4.5 in the site experiment. Increased atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration and successive years of stubble returning would lead to the increase of SOC content in the 0–20-cm soil layer and the accumulation of plant biomass year by year. The decomposition of SOC would be promoted by the increase of air temperature, and the plant biomass will be increased in the coming 20 years. Compared with scenario one, the CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes in scenario two, scenario three, and scenario four increased by 13.74%, 16.31%, and 32.78% at the end of the simulation. CO
  <sub>2</sub> enhanced the root system of crops through plant photosynthesis [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-16-00692">47</a>], provided more metabolic substrates for CH
  <sub>4</sub> production, and increased the aerenchyma of plants by increasing the biomass, thus providing a channel for CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions [
  <a rid="B48-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-16-00692">48</a>]. Previous studies have shown that CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes had a significant correlation with the biomass of crops [
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-16-00692">49</a>]. Increasing soil temperature would promote the decomposition of SOC and increase the activity and amount of methanogens. Compared with CH
  <sub>4</sub> production, the CH
  <sub>4</sub> oxidation process is less affected by temperature [
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-16-00692">50</a>]. Under future climate scenarios, atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature will affect the CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes of paddy field through the joint effects of soil and plant.
