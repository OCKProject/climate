  <sub>4</sub> Fluxes under Historical Climate.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial distribution of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes and its climatic tendency in the study area from 1960 to 2015 is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f007" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f007">Figure 7</a>. CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes ranged from 98.27 kg C/ha to 215.94 kg C/ha, with an average of 145.56 kg C/ha. CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2010s were 125.80 kg C/ha, 146.42 kg C/ha, and 170.57 kg C/ha, respectively. CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission fluxes showed a decreasing trend from west to east. The high-value areas were mainly distributed in the western part with an average of more than 175 kg C/ha. The low-value areas were mainly distributes in the northern area, with an annual average value of less than 120 kg C/ha. The climatic tendency was between 8.78–14.43 kg C/ha/(10a) with an average of 11.88 kg C/ha/(10a). The average CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes from 26 meteorological stations in the study area showed a fluctuating and increasing trend (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f008" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f008">Figure 8</a>). Among them, the northern and western parts increased at a higher rate, with a climatic tendency rate of more than 14 kg C/ha/(10a).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the 1970s to the 1990s, the CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes showed an increasing trend. The climatic tendency was between 9.87–13.40 kg C/ha/(10a), with an average of 11.42 kg C/ha/(10a). Among them, the climatic tendency in the central part was relatively low, while the climatic tendency in the eastern, southern, and western regions were relatively high. From the 1990s to the 2010s, the average climatic tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes was slightly higher than that of the 1970s–1990s, and the climatic tendency was between 8.62–17.37 kg C/ha/(10a), with an average of 12.62 kg C/ha/(10a). In the eastern region, the increasing rate slowed down, while in the northern part, the increasing rate increased dramatically. The climatic tendency of the northern part was greater than 17 kg C/ha/(10a).
