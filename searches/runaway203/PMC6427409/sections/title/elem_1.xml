  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heilongjiang Province is located in the northeast of China (121°11′–135°05′ E, 43°26′–53°33′ N), which is the highest-latitude province in China. It belongs to the continental monsoon climate in the cold and temperate zones. The frost-free period is relatively short. The crop growing season lasts from early May to early October. The total land area of Heilongjiang Province is 4.73 × 10
   <span class="sup">5</span> ha, and the agricultural land area accounts for 83.5% of the total land area of Heilongjiang Province. The annual average temperature is 2.9 °C, the annual average rainfall is 526 mm, the soil is fertile, and the organic matter is high, which is conducive to the growth of crops. The sixth accumulated temperature zone in Heilongjiang Province is not suitable for rice cultivation; therefore, it is not the study area in this paper [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The LARS-WG (Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator) is a random weather generator that can be used to simulate the historical and future meteorological data of a single station. It is a dimensionality reduction tool based on the GCM to generate local-scale climate scenarios. It uses the daily meteorological data of a given location to calculate a set of parameters for fitting probability distribution and their correlations. A synthetic weather time series of arbitrary length is generated by using the randomly selected values from the appropriate distribution [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate data based on a GCM are widely regarded as the most acceptable model for studying climate change. Under different GCM scenarios, the magnitude of variation of meteorological factors is uncertain. Therefore, two RCPs under four GCMs in CMIP5 supported by LARS-WG 6.0 are selected to simulate future climate change. The main information of the four GCMs used is shown in

The annual average temperature is 2~3 °C, the annual average rainfall is 500~600 mm, and the frost-free period is 128 days. The soil is loam. The bulk density of 0–10-cm soil is 1.26 g/cm
    <span class="sup">3</span>, the clay content is 21%, the porosity is 0.45%, the organic matter content is 41.8 g/kg, and the pH is 6.4. The rice variety was “Longqing 3” (

Except for mid-season drainage from 1 July to 7 July 2017, the water layer was maintained in paddy fields during the rice growth period. The chemical fertilizers that were used were urea (N 46%), superphosphate (P

Sensitivity analysis help to better understand the sensitivity of the model to various parameters and provide support for the calibration and validation. Therefore, sensitivity analysis of the DNDC model was performed to evaluate the response of simulation results to input parameters [

    <a rid="B22-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-16-00692">22</a>]. Climate, soil, and crop parameters of the site experiment were taken as the initial conditions for sensitivity analysis, and a single input parameter was changed within the default range of the DNDC model system, while all the other input parameters remained unchanged. Each input parameter was run 500 times to ensure the reliability of the results. For those more sensitive factors, attention should be paid during the model simulation to improve the reliability of the data.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DNDC model needs meteorological data, soil data, crop parameters, and farmland management measures to simulate CH
    <sub>4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields. In this study, the annual CH
    <sub>4</sub> fluxes from 26 meteorological stations in the study area were simulated by the DNDC model. For CH
    <sub>4</sub> fluxes from 2021 to 2080, the average values of four GCMs under two RCPs were calculated respectively, and then, the spatial and temporal variations of CH
    <sub>4</sub> fluxes were expressed by spatial interpolation. The period 1960–2015 was divided into three periods: 1960–1979 (1970s), 1980–1999 (1990s), and 2000–2015 (2010s). The period 2021–2080 was divided into 2021–2040 (2030s), 2041–2060 (2050s), and 2061–2080 (2070s).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the simulation of the period 1960–2015, the daily meteorological data of 26 meteorological stations in Heilongjiang Province from 1960 to 2015 were selected, including daily Tmax, Tmin, average relative humidity, average wind speed, and rainfall. For the simulation of 2021–2080, the daily meteorological data of 26 meteorological stations were output by LARS-WG, including daily Tmax, Tmin, rainfall, and Rad. Considering the change of CO

Paddy cultivation in different regions of the study area were derived from the “
    <span class="italic">Compilation of Paddy Field Irrigation Experiment Data in Heilongjiang Province</span>”, which included the date of paddy field preparation and paddy puddling, transplanting, mid-season drainage, fertilization regime, and harvest date of 30 experiment stations in 542 experimental years from 1952 to 2002. In order to reduce the uncertainty of the simulation results, the following assumptions were made in this study. (1) Transplanting was used for rice planting. The cultivation techniques of rice seedlings nurseries in upland bed in Heilongjiang Province began in the 1950s, and were well promoted with the development of plastic film technology in the 1960s and 1970s. This technology is in line with the cold rice cultivation environment and rice growth physiology. (2) There was no change in rice transplanting and harvesting time. Due to seedlings nursery and upland bed cultivation technology, the rice transplanting date was more flexible and less affected by temperature. Farmers in different regions depended on experience to determine fixed transplanting and harvesting dates. (3) The stubble remained 10% after harvest. In the historical period, the straw harvested in the study area was used for living fuel and animal feed. Currently, crop straw burning is prohibited in Heilongjiang Province. In the future, straw will be developed into new energy, decorative materials and other uses. (4) Setting up mid-season drainage. This technology has been widely used by farmers in the study area because it reduces the ineffective tillering of rice, improves the fertilizer utilization rate, improves soil aeration, and effectively reduces CH
