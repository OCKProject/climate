  <sub>4</sub> Fluxes
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparisons of the CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes observed in the site experiment with those simulated by DNDC are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f003" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f003">Figure 3</a>. Except for individual differences, the simulation results of DNDC are in good agreement with the observed results. Regression analysis shows that the regression coefficient R
  <span class="sup">2</span> is 0.89, the slope of regression equation is close to one, and the intercept is relatively small. The correlation between simulated and observed values was very high (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). The RMSE value and EF value are 0.35 and 0.87, respectively. The RMSE value is relatively small, and the efficiency coefficient of the model is high, which indicates that the simulation value can well reflect the actual change rule of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes. In conclusion, DNDC can well simulate and predict the seasonal variation of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes in this study area.
