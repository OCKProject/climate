 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Paddy fields are important source of greenhouse gas emissions, and CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields accounts for about 20% of global anthropogenic CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions annually [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-00692">1</a>]. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), due to the increasing human population, the rice yield needs to increase by 40% by the end of the 2030s [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-00692">2</a>]. This suggests that paddy fields will continue to be an important anthropogenic CH
  <sub>4</sub> source worldwide [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-00692">3</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from the paddy fields mainly depends on a series of biochemical processes in the soil such as CH
  <sub>4</sub> production, CH
  <sub>4</sub> oxidation, and pathways of gas transportations such as plant-mediated transport, molecular diffusion, and ebullition [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-16-00692">4</a>,
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-00692">5</a>]. These processes are affected by many environment factors, and climatic factors are among the key controlling and driving factors [
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-16-00692">6</a>]. Climate change affects CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy ecosystems by changing crop growth and the soil environment. Changes in temperature change the activity of methanogens in soil [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-00692">7</a>]. Different levels of rainfall change the soil moisture and aeration status, and further affect CH
  <sub>4</sub> production and oxidation [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-00692">8</a>]. Increasing atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration contributes to crop biomass accumulation and provides more carbon sources for CH
  <sub>4</sub> production in soil [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-00692">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-16-00692">10</a>]. Changes in solar radiation will affect crop growth through crop photosynthesis, thereby affecting the crop transmission of CH
  <sub>4</sub> [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-00692">11</a>,
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-00692">12</a>]. Increased atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration due to human activities will have a greater impact on climate change in the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-00692">13</a>,
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-00692">14</a>]. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, significant warming was estimated under different representative concentration paths (RCPs) during the 21st century by 1.3~6.1 °C [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-16-00692">15</a>]. The temperature in China was expected to increase at a rate of 0.06~0.63 °C per decade, and rainfall was also expected to increase by 0.52~1.85 per decade [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-16-00692">16</a>]. These changes of climatic factors would definitely affect the CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies on the effects of climate factors on the spatiotemporal distributions of CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields can be found in the literature, which mostly have been concentrated in Asian countries. For example, the study by Katayanagi et al. [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-00692">8</a>] indicated a decreasing trend of CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission from rice paddies from north to south in Japan, considering organic carbon input, water management regimes, and the drainage rates of Japan’s seven administrative regions from 1990 to 2012. Minamikawa et al. [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-00692">17</a>] pointed out that the CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from the rice paddies of six experiment sites in central Thailand increased by different ranges, and also showed a big spatial distribution from 2001 to 2060 under four RCPs under different water management practices. In China, Li et al. [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-00692">18</a>] found that Chinese fields emitted 6.4~12.0 Tg C per year within a continuous flooding scenario under 1990 climate land-use conditions by modeling CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions using DNDC, while southern China showed larger CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions than other parts, and in another paper, an increasing trend of CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission of rice paddies in China from 2000 to 2020 by different management scenarios was also found [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-00692">19</a>]. However, no big changes of CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from rice fields in China between 1991–2010 was found in a study by Verburg et al. [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-00692">20</a>]. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-00692">21</a>] modeled CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from irrigation rice cultivation of five regions in China and predicated that the CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission amount from 2010 to 2050 would increase by 1.2 kg ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and that the increase in northeastern China was more significant than in other areas. At a smaller scale, Zhang et al. [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-16-00692">22</a>] characterized the spatial dynamics of CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from rice paddies of Sanjiang Plain in the years 1990, 2000, and 2010; he found that big spatial differences and annual average differences of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes existed, due to the different climate conditions between the years.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the previous studies pointed out that climate changes would cause spatiotemporal distribution changes of CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields. In the large-scale studies of China, most studies tended to concentrate on CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from the rice paddies of the southern areas. As a result, CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in northeast China have sometimes been neglected; few papers have studied the impacts of climate change on CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions through combining a global climate model (GCM) with different RCPs. Heilongjiang Province is located in the cold region of northeast China, and is sensitive to climate change [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-16-00692">23</a>], which will inevitably affect CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in cold regions. The rice planting area in Heilongjiang Province of China has increased greatly since the 1990s; however, changes to the rice-planting areas in other provinces of China have been relatively small. According to statistics, the rice-planting area in Heilongjiang Province increased by 249% from 1990 to 2015, reaching 3.15 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> ha [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-00692">24</a>,
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-16-00692">25</a>]. Relevant studies have shown that the suitable planting boundary of rice in Heilongjiang Province will continue to expand northward under future climate change [
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-16-00692">26</a>,
  <a rid="B27-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-16-00692">27</a>]. Therefore, with the gradual increase of the rice-planting area in Heilongjiang Province, the study of the impacts of climate change on spatiotemporal distributions of CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in Heilongjiang Province need to be introduced as a matter of concern. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date, most of the studies on CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields in the cold region of Heilongjiang Province have been site experiments. These experiments revealed the mechanism of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields in cold regions and provided reliable data support [
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-16-00692">28</a>,
  <a rid="B29-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-16-00692">29</a>,
  <a rid="B30-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-16-00692">30</a>]. However, it was difficult for these site experiments to estimate CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions over a larger area, and the temporal and spatial variation of CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in cold regions under climate change is still unclear. Therefore, the estimation of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes must rely on the model to expand the sample number of regional CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes, and then assess the potential mitigation measures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes in the rice paddies in Heilongjiang Province, firstly, the daily meteorological data of 26 stations in Heilongjiang Province from 1960 to 2015 were used to calibrate and validate the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) dimensionality reduction meteorological model and generate the climate data for 2021–2080 in Heilongjiang Province under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Secondly, the DNDC model was calibrated and validated by the CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes data of a site experiment, and the sensitive factors affecting CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes were analyzed by sensitivity analysis. Finally, the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes in Heilongjiang Province in the past and future under different climate scenarios were simulated by the DNDC model, and the effects of climate factors on CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission fluxes were discussed. The purpose of this study was to provide a basis for the establishment of a greenhouse gas emission inventory of paddy fields in cold regions.
