 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taking the mean of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes from 1960 to 2015 as the background value of historical CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes, the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes in the study area under future climate change were studied. From 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f009" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f009">Figure 9</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f010" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f010">Figure 10</a>, it can be seen that under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes ranged from 160.00 to 318.68 kg C/ha and 167.15 to 442.07 kg C/ha between 2021–2080, with average values of 213.46 kg C/ha and 252.19 kg C/ha, respectively. Compared with historical background values, CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes increased by 67.50 kg C/ha and 106.23 kg C/ha between 2021–2080 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The average CH
  <sub>4</sub> flux under RCP 8.5 increased more than that under RCP 4.5. The spatial distribution of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 between the future was similar to the historical distribution of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes, and it tended to decrease from west to east. However, under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, the climatic tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes between 2021–2080 ranged from 10.89 to 18.46 kg C/ha/(10a) and 24.21 to 44.02 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively. The average climatic tendencies were 13.40 kg C/ha/(10a) and 29.86 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively. Compared with the historical climatic tendency, the climatic tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes increased by 1.52 kg C/ha/(10a) and 17.98 kg C/ha/(10a) respectively between 2021–2080 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The climatic tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes under RCP 8.5 was higher than that under RCP 4.5. The spatial distribution of the climatic tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes was different from that between 1960–2015. The climatic tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes decreased from west to east between 2021–2080. The high-value area was mainly distributed in the west, while the low-value area was mainly distributed in the east.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under RCP 4.5, the CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes of each GCM in different periods were quite different, while the difference of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes of each GCM in different periods was small under RCP 8.5 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f011" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f011">Figure 11</a>). Under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, the climatic tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes in the 2030s–2050s ranged from 12.45 kg C/ha/(10a) to 24.34 kg C/ha/(10a) and 21.11 kg C/ha/(10a) to 35.59 kg C/ha/(10a), with an average of 16.34 kg C/ha/(10a) and 24.09 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively. The climatic tendency distribution of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 was similar. However, the climatic tendency under RCP 8.5 was higher than that under RCP 4.5. In the 2050s–2070s period, the climatic tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 ranged from 7.31 kg C/ha/(10a) to 10.51 kg C/ha/(10a) and 20.31 kg C/ha/(10a) to 44.33 kg C/ha/(10a), with an average of 8.61 kg C/ha/(10a) and 28.86 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively. Compared with the 2030s–2050s stage, the climatic tendency under RCP 8.5 continued to increase spatially and temporally, with a big increase in the central part, while the increase in the northern part was smaller. However, the climatic tendency under RCP 4.5 tended to decrease, and was even less than the climatic tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes in the historical period. The decreases in the north and west parts were larger. Overall, the spatial distribution of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes in the 2030s, 2050s, and 2070s stages under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 showed a decreasing trend from west to east temporally, and showed a continuous increasing trend spatially. The climatic tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes varied greatly in different periods. Under RCP 4.5, the climate tendency of CH
  <sub>4</sub> flux decreased, while under RCP 8.5, the climate tendency increased.
