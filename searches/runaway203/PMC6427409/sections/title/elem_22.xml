  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, the temporal and spatial distribution of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields in cold regions of Heilongjiang Province under historical and future conditions were studied. The high-latitude record of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields simulated by the DNDC model was refreshed. The dynamic process of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields in this region was well simulated by the calibration and validation of the site experiment. Compared with previous studies, some similarities and differences exist. Zhang et al. [
   <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-00692">7</a>,
   <a rid="B51-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-16-00692">51</a>] studied the CH
   <sub>4</sub> flux dynamics of Sanjiang Plain in eastern Heilongjiang Province from 1990 to 2010 by the DNDC model. Sensitivity analysis showed that CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes were more sensitive to temperature, soil clay content, and SOC, but less sensitive to rainfall, soil bulk density, and pH, which was consistent with the results of this study, but he did not carry out a sensitivity analysis on crop parameters. His research results showed that the average CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes in 1990, 2000, and 2010 were 71 kg C/ha, 137 kg C/ha, and 180 kg C/ha, respectively. In this study, the average CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes in 1990, 2000, and 2010 were 138 kg C/ha, 189 kg C/ha, and 199 kg C/ha, respectively, which were higher than the results of the previous study. The main reason may be due to the difference of the site experiment results for DNDC model validation. The average CH
   <sub>4</sub> flux of the site experiment used in this study was larger than that of his study. Therefore, in regional simulation, the calibration and validation of the model has a greater effect on the simulation results. In future regional simulation, multi-site experiments should be carried out in order to calibrate and validate the model and thus increase the reliability of the simulation. The results from another paper of Zhang’s showed that CH
   <sub>4</sub> flux from paddy fields in Sanjiang Plain is mostly concentrated in the range of 50 to 600 kg C/ha, which is larger than that in this study area. The main reason is that the soil database used in this study is different from that in this paper. The spatial distribution of simulation results is quite different when using grid data to construct regional simulation. Zhang et al. [
   <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-00692">21</a>] pointed out that CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes under A1B and B1 scenarios in the three northeastern provinces from China (including, Heilongjiang Province, Jilin Province, and Liaoning Province) would increase from 160 kg C/ha to 200 kg C/ha between 2010–2050, which is similar to the change of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes under RCP 4.5 in this paper. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories recommended a CH
   <sub>4</sub> baseline emission factor of 1.3 kg CH
   <sub>4</sub>/ha/d for estimating CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in regions or countries [
   <a rid="B46-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-16-00692">46</a>,
   <a rid="B52-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-16-00692">52</a>]. The growth period of rice in Heilongjiang Province is about 115 days, so the calculated CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes is 112.13 kg C/ha, which is less than the results of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes at all of the historical periods in this study. This is mainly because the SOC in the black soil in Heilongjiang Province is higher compared with other regions, which provided a greater carbon source for CH
   <sub>4</sub> production. In this study, many ecological driving factors affecting greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields, such as climate, soil, and farmland management measures, were considered. Therefore, compared with the method recommended by the IPCC, the method adopted in this study has greatly improved the estimation of regional CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. There are few studies of CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in Heilongjiang Province under future climate conditions. This study pointed out that CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes and the climatic tendency of northern Heilongjiang Province under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 conditions were relatively small. With the increase of accumulated temperature in the study area under climate change, the appropriate development of rice cultivation in this area would have better CH
   <sub>4</sub> emission reduction advantages than other areas.

   <sub>4</sub> Emissions
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study pointed out that the changes of atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature were the main climatic factors affecting CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields in cold regions. Tokida et al. [
   <a rid="B53-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-16-00692">53</a>] conducted a two-year experiment in Iwate Prefecture, Japan (39°38′ N). The effects of increasing atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration (background concentration +200 ppm) and soil temperature (background temperature +2 °C) on CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy fields were studied. This was similar to the atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration at RCP 4.5 and the amplitude of elevated temperature at the end of the simulation in this study. The atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration, Tmin, and Tmax in the 2070s stage increased by 1.90 °C, 2.17 °C, and 172 ppm, respectively (
   <a rid="ijerph-16-00692-t003" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-00692-t003">Table 3</a>). His results showed that increasing atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations, soil temperatures, and their combination increased CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes by 26%, 44%, and 88%, respectively, which were larger values than the increase of 13.74%, 16.31%, and 32.78% in scenarios two, three, and four in this study under RCP 4.5, respectively. The climate conditions in his experimental area were similar to those in this study, but the latitude was lower than that in this study area. Higher temperatures are more conducive to CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. In his study, soil and surface water were heated directly to increase temperature, which is different from the temperature increase effect of 60 years that was used in this study. Under actual global warming conditions, soil temperature increases gradually, and SOC decreases gradually without the artificial addition of carbon sources. However, the initial soil condition of each treatment in his study was the same; therefore, the CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes might be overestimated. In addition, although the temperature of the soil increased the biomass of the aboveground part, it accelerated the senescence of the root system, and reduced the biomass of the root system by 8%. This may provide more substrates for the production of CH
   <sub>4</sub>. Due to the heating method, the mid-season drainage was also not set in his experiment, which further overestimated CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. Tokida’s results and previous studies also pointed out that increasing CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration increased the plant biomass, while CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes were positively correlated with both, and increased CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. Van et al. [
   <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-00692">3</a>] pointed out through a meta-analysis that the increase of CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration (range 463 to 780 ppm) resulted in an increase of 43.4% in CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields. The results of this study are similar to those of previous studies. Kazumori et al. [
   <a rid="B27-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-16-00692">27</a>] used an improved DNDC-Rice model to analyze the effects of RCP 4.5 on SOC content in a 30-cm soil layer, the biomass of the aboveground part, and the CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes in double-cropping paddy fields in Suphan Buri, Thailand, from 2000 to 2060. The results showed that increasing atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration alone could increase soil SOC content, biomass, and CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes, which were the same as the results of this study. However, in his study, the increase of temperature did not improve the soil SOC content and the biomass of the aboveground parts, which was different from the results of this study. It may be that the tropical climate of Thailand is more conducive to the decomposition of soil SOC. Meanwhile, the soil in this study is frozen or thawed for most of the time except for the crop-growing season, which is conducive to the accumulation of soil SOC. Furthermore, a high temperature will produce temperature stress on rice plants, which is not conducive to crop growth, leading to a decline in the biomass above ground. Neither this study nor Kazumori’s studies considered the effects of crop varieties on CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. The study results showed that the rice cropping system in Heilongjiang Province has shown its adaptability to climate change, and the planting boundary tends to expand northward [
   <a rid="B26-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-16-00692">26</a>]. Later-maturing varieties gradually replace early-maturing varieties, which will inevitably increase the biomass of the aboveground parts and roots of rice, and increase the plant litter, stubble incorporated and the root exudates of rice plants. As DNDC sets the biomass and yield response with the increase of atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration but not with the increase of temperature, the simulation results of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes in this study may be larger for historical periods, but smaller for future periods, resulting in the overall low climatic tendency for CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. Due to the climate, soil, and crop differences, the CH
   <sub>4</sub> flux response on atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature across different regions is not consistent.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.3. Uncertainty and Prospect</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many uncertainties in the simulation of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes in this study. For example, in the construction of regional simulation, although the meteorological, soil, crop parameters, and agricultural management measures adopted by 26 meteorological stations were representative in the local area, the distributions of relevant parameters between the meteorological stations were still very uncertain. The related parameters would also change with the effect of climate change. For example, this paper adopted the management system of rice experiment stations, but in the actual agricultural production, the management system was more flexible. In the years of low temperature, the mid-season drainage was not carried out to ensure the tiller number of rice. This increased CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. With the increase of accumulated temperature in different regions, rice varieties were constantly renewing, and the change of rice varieties would also lead to the difference of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes [
   <a rid="B54-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-16-00692">54</a>]. This study simulated the CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes according to a mid-season drainage condition, without considering effect of irrigation pattern change. Zhang et al. [
   <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-00692">21</a>] pointed out that CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes decreased from 144 kg C/ha to 99 kg C/ha from 1960 to 1970 due to the large-scale popularization of mid-season drainage technology in rice-growing areas in China, and then increased due to the effects of yield and organic fertilizer. In addition, the deficiencies of the model may also lead to differences in the simulation results. As we mentioned above, DNDC does not set parameters for the adaptability of crop biomass with the increase of accumulated temperature, which may lead to differences in estimating CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. This paper pointed out that the cold black soil region under climate change would become an important CH
   <sub>4</sub> emission source in China’s agricultural system. With the increase of the rice area in Heilongjiang Province, more site experiments are needed to provide a theoretical basis and data support for the regional estimation of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes, and also calibrate and validate the model to improve the accuracy of the estimation of regional CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes.
