 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DNDC model needs meteorological data, soil data, crop parameters, and farmland management measures to simulate CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields. In this study, the annual CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes from 26 meteorological stations in the study area were simulated by the DNDC model. For CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes from 2021 to 2080, the average values of four GCMs under two RCPs were calculated respectively, and then, the spatial and temporal variations of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes were expressed by spatial interpolation. The period 1960–2015 was divided into three periods: 1960–1979 (1970s), 1980–1999 (1990s), and 2000–2015 (2010s). The period 2021–2080 was divided into 2021–2040 (2030s), 2041–2060 (2050s), and 2061–2080 (2070s).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the simulation of the period 1960–2015, the daily meteorological data of 26 meteorological stations in Heilongjiang Province from 1960 to 2015 were selected, including daily Tmax, Tmin, average relative humidity, average wind speed, and rainfall. For the simulation of 2021–2080, the daily meteorological data of 26 meteorological stations were output by LARS-WG, including daily Tmax, Tmin, rainfall, and Rad. Considering the change of CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration under climate change, the background CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration in 1960 was 317 ppm and the growth rate was 1.58 ppm/a. For future climate simulation, the atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> background concentrations were 411 ppm and 415 ppm under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 in 2021, respectively, and 531 ppm and 758 ppm in 2080, respectively [

Paddy cultivation in different regions of the study area were derived from the “
  <span class="italic">Compilation of Paddy Field Irrigation Experiment Data in Heilongjiang Province</span>”, which included the date of paddy field preparation and paddy puddling, transplanting, mid-season drainage, fertilization regime, and harvest date of 30 experiment stations in 542 experimental years from 1952 to 2002. In order to reduce the uncertainty of the simulation results, the following assumptions were made in this study. (1) Transplanting was used for rice planting. The cultivation techniques of rice seedlings nurseries in upland bed in Heilongjiang Province began in the 1950s, and were well promoted with the development of plastic film technology in the 1960s and 1970s. This technology is in line with the cold rice cultivation environment and rice growth physiology. (2) There was no change in rice transplanting and harvesting time. Due to seedlings nursery and upland bed cultivation technology, the rice transplanting date was more flexible and less affected by temperature. Farmers in different regions depended on experience to determine fixed transplanting and harvesting dates. (3) The stubble remained 10% after harvest. In the historical period, the straw harvested in the study area was used for living fuel and animal feed. Currently, crop straw burning is prohibited in Heilongjiang Province. In the future, straw will be developed into new energy, decorative materials and other uses. (4) Setting up mid-season drainage. This technology has been widely used by farmers in the study area because it reduces the ineffective tillering of rice, improves the fertilizer utilization rate, improves soil aeration, and effectively reduces CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions [
