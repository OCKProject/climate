 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The historical and future changes of climate parameters in the study area are shown in 
  <a rid="ijerph-16-00692-t003" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-00692-t003">Table 3</a>. During the 1970s–2010s, the daily Tmin, daily Tmax, annual rainfall, and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration showed an increasing trend, while the annual Rad showed a decreasing trend. During the 2030s–2070s, the predicted daily Tmin, daily Tmax, annual rainfall, and atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration continued to increase, and the increase of four meteorological parameters under RCP 8.5 was greater than that under RCP 4.5. However, the annual Rad continued to decrease, and the reduction under RCP 8.5 was greater than that under RCP 4.5.
