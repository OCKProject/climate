 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many uncertainties in the simulation of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes in this study. For example, in the construction of regional simulation, although the meteorological, soil, crop parameters, and agricultural management measures adopted by 26 meteorological stations were representative in the local area, the distributions of relevant parameters between the meteorological stations were still very uncertain. The related parameters would also change with the effect of climate change. For example, this paper adopted the management system of rice experiment stations, but in the actual agricultural production, the management system was more flexible. In the years of low temperature, the mid-season drainage was not carried out to ensure the tiller number of rice. This increased CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes. With the increase of accumulated temperature in different regions, rice varieties were constantly renewing, and the change of rice varieties would also lead to the difference of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes [
  <a rid="B54-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-16-00692">54</a>]. This study simulated the CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes according to a mid-season drainage condition, without considering effect of irrigation pattern change. Zhang et al. [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-00692">21</a>] pointed out that CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes decreased from 144 kg C/ha to 99 kg C/ha from 1960 to 1970 due to the large-scale popularization of mid-season drainage technology in rice-growing areas in China, and then increased due to the effects of yield and organic fertilizer. In addition, the deficiencies of the model may also lead to differences in the simulation results. As we mentioned above, DNDC does not set parameters for the adaptability of crop biomass with the increase of accumulated temperature, which may lead to differences in estimating CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes. This paper pointed out that the cold black soil region under climate change would become an important CH
  <sub>4</sub> emission source in Chinaâ€™s agricultural system. With the increase of the rice area in Heilongjiang Province, more site experiments are needed to provide a theoretical basis and data support for the regional estimation of CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes, and also calibrate and validate the model to improve the accuracy of the estimation of regional CH
  <sub>4</sub> fluxes.
