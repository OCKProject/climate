   <sub>4</sub> Fluxes
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparisons of the CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes observed in the site experiment with those simulated by DNDC are shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f003" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f003">Figure 3</a>. Except for individual differences, the simulation results of DNDC are in good agreement with the observed results. Regression analysis shows that the regression coefficient R
   <span class="sup">2</span> is 0.89, the slope of regression equation is close to one, and the intercept is relatively small. The correlation between simulated and observed values was very high (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.001). The RMSE value and EF value are 0.35 and 0.87, respectively. The RMSE value is relatively small, and the efficiency coefficient of the model is high, which indicates that the simulation value can well reflect the actual change rule of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. In conclusion, DNDC can well simulate and predict the seasonal variation of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes in this study area.

   <sub>4</sub> Fluxes
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The response of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes to climate factors was studied by fluctuating 10% of the air temperature, rainfall, and atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration. As shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f004" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f004">Figure 4</a>, higher air temperature and higher atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration promote the increase of CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. This may be because the increase of air temperature is beneficial to the decomposition of soil organic matter and the activity of methanogens [
   <a rid="B7-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-16-00692">7</a>]. Increased atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration provides more metabolic substrates for methane production [
   <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-00692">9</a>,
   <a rid="B10-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-16-00692">10</a>]. The change of annual rainfall has little effect on CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes. With the decrease of rainfall, the CH
   <sub>4</sub> flux increases slightly.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sensitivity analysis of soil parameters showed that soil clay content was the most sensitive factor affecting CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes, followed by soil porosity and SOC (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f005" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f005">Figure 5</a>). Soil with high clay content limits CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes due to the adsorption of clay, which limits the use of dissolved organic carbon by microorganisms. The increase of porosity will promote the oxidation of methanogens to produce CH
   <sub>4</sub>, and SOC will provide more substrates for methanogens to produce CH
   <sub>4</sub>. Since paddy fields are flooded most of the time during the rice-growing period, the change of soil moisture and dryness is small, and the soil condition is relatively stable; therefore, the effects of soil bulk density, field water capacity, and pH on CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes are small [
   <a rid="B22-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-16-00692">22</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sensitivity analysis of crop parameters showed that CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes were more sensitive to maximum yield, plant C/N ratio, and thermal degree days for maturity (TDD), but less sensitive to the N fixation index (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f006" href="#ijerph-16-00692-f006">Figure 6</a>). With the increase of the above parameters, CH
   <sub>4</sub> fluxes showed an increasing trend. This is because with the increase of TDD, more dry matter can be accumulated in crops with the same proportion of biomass distribution in different parts of the plant. Increasing the maximum yield also increases biomass accumulation in plants, since it is beneficial for increasing plant droppings and root exudates, which provides more carbon sources for CH
   <sub>4</sub> production. Increasing the plant C/N ratio also provides more carbon sources for methanogens.
