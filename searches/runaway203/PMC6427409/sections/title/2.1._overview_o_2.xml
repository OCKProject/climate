  <span class="sup">5</span> ha, and the agricultural land area accounts for 83.5% of the total land area of Heilongjiang Province. The annual average temperature is 2.9 °C, the annual average rainfall is 526 mm, the soil is fertile, and the organic matter is high, which is conducive to the growth of crops. The sixth accumulated temperature zone in Heilongjiang Province is not suitable for rice cultivation; therefore, it is not the study area in this paper [
