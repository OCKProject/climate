 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The LARS-WG (Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator) is a random weather generator that can be used to simulate the historical and future meteorological data of a single station. It is a dimensionality reduction tool based on the GCM to generate local-scale climate scenarios. It uses the daily meteorological data of a given location to calculate a set of parameters for fitting probability distribution and their correlations. A synthetic weather time series of arbitrary length is generated by using the randomly selected values from the appropriate distribution [

The LARS-WG 6.0 used in this paper combines the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report for climate prediction. The process of weather generation is divided into the following three steps [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(2) Model validation: The synthetic meteorological data with the same statistical characteristics as the historical meteorological data were generated by the parameter files of historical meteorological data in the process of model calibration. According to the comparison between the statistical characteristics of historical meteorological data and synthetic meteorological data, the simulation capability and applicability of the LARS-WG model were evaluated.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(3) Generation of synthetic meteorological data: The synthetic meteorological data corresponding to the GCM climate scenario are generated by using the parameter files in the calibration process of the model.</p>
