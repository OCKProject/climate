 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An off-line radiative transfer model was used to calculate aerosol optical properties and activation to form cloud droplets, and thus to estimate the aerosol direct and indirect radiative effects. The concentration, number, and mixing state of aerosols were taken from that calculated in the IMPACT model. NewSOA particles were regarded as internally mixed particles of organics and sulfate. The refractive indices and hygroscopicity of the internal mixtures within each aerosol type were calculated by volume-weighting of each of the individual aerosol species. KÃ¶hler theory together with the soluble fraction of each aerosol type was used to predict the amount of water associated with the aerosol, which was also considered to affect the particle size and refractive indices. The model was introduced in detail by ref.
