  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2.2 coupled with the University of Michigan IMPACT aerosol model with resolution of 1.9° × 2.5° to simulate SOA and five other externally mixed aerosol types. Fifteen aerosol species/types were simulated in the model, including sulfate in three modes (i.e., nucleation (&lt;5 nm), Aitken (5–50 nm), and accumulation (&gt;50 nm)), soot from biomass burning (bSoot, i.e., primary organic aerosol and black carbon from biomass burning), soot from fossil fuel and biofuel burning (fSoot, i.e., primary organic carbon and black carbon), and dust and sea salt, the latter two of which were each carried in four separate bins with varying radii. The basic model description and setup can be found in ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>. An explicit gas phase chemical mechanism for the formation of semi-volatile organic products, including the oxidation of isoprene, α-pinene, and aromatics, is included
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
   </span>. Lower volatility compounds like oligomers form when semi-volatile organics are incorporated into the aerosol phase. SOA formation from aqueous phase reactions of glyoxal and methylglyoxal and the kinetic uptake of IEPOX, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal were included
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
   </span>. The mechanism of organic nitrate formation was updated based on ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
   </span>. SOA formed by these gaseous and aqueous phase reactions are distributed to preexisting aerosol
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
   </span>, resulting in SOA being internally mixed with sulfate, bSoot, fSoot, dust, and sea salt.
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The above model was extended by adding the formation of extremely low volatility HOMs from α-pinene oxidation and their nucleation. Diacyl peroxide is suspected to be the one kind of HOM that is able to nucleate based on the experimental evidence
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
   </span>. The oxidation product of pinanediol was observed in new particle formation experiments
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span> and in field measurements of nucleation events
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
   </span>. Pinic acid and pinanediol were showed to form new particles through quantum chemistry calculations
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
   </span>. Therefore, we include diacyl peroxide, pinic acid, pinanediol, and some oxidation products of pinanediol as HOMs that are able to nucleate in the model. Diacyl peroxide and pinic acid were formed by the ozonization of α-pinene
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span>, while pinanediol was formed by the oxidation of the products of the reaction of α-pinene and hydroxyl radical
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
   </span>. All HOMs were simulated through explicit gaseous and particle phase reactions according to experimental results
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span> and the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>. The concentration of HOMs depends on the emissions of α-pinene, its atmospheric oxidation rate, and temperature. The detailed chemical reactions for the formation of HOMs that were added to the model are listed in the Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>. New particle formation by binary sulfuric acid–water nucleation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
   </span> was extended to include the HET, NON, and ION mechanisms. The rate of HET was parameterized following ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
   </span>, while the rate of NON and ION were parameterized following ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
   </span>. The ionization rate in the model was estimated using the method outlined in ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
   </span>, which was used to calculate the rate of ION. The organic nucleation rates were adjusted from the temperature of the CLOUD experiments (278 K) to other temperatures by multiplying by exp(−(T-278)/10)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
   </span>. The new particles formed from organic nucleation (newSOA) grew to the Aitken and accumulation mode by condensation of SVOC produced as described in the above references and by condensation of sulfuric acid. NewSOA also coagulated with each other as well as with other preexisting aerosols, at which point they were no longer counted as newSOA. Gas phase HOMs that did not nucleate new particles could condense on newSOA and other aerosols. The newSOA were also removed by dry and wet deposition based on their particle size and hygroscopicity.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Radiative transfer model</div>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An off-line radiative transfer model was used to calculate aerosol optical properties and activation to form cloud droplets, and thus to estimate the aerosol direct and indirect radiative effects. The concentration, number, and mixing state of aerosols were taken from that calculated in the IMPACT model. NewSOA particles were regarded as internally mixed particles of organics and sulfate. The refractive indices and hygroscopicity of the internal mixtures within each aerosol type were calculated by volume-weighting of each of the individual aerosol species. Köhler theory together with the soluble fraction of each aerosol type was used to predict the amount of water associated with the aerosol, which was also considered to affect the particle size and refractive indices. The model was introduced in detail by ref.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulation scheme</div>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PD scheme used PD emissions, climate, and land use. The PIemi scheme was run with emissions from 1750 but with the climate and land use from the PD. The PIall scheme was run with the same anthropogenic emissions as in PIemi but with climate and land use in the PI. The PD anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions are adopted from those used in Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) with Chemistry for 2000
   <span class="sup">

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
   </span> which is embedded in the CESM. The BVOC emission rates depend on the light, temperature, leaf area index (LAI), and fractional coverage of plant functional types (PFT). The monthly mean time-varying LAI and PFT take into account the anthropogenic land use/land cover change for PD (year 2000) and PI (year 1850)

   </span>. The concentration of CO
   <sub>2</sub> is set to 367.0 ppm for the PD and 284.7 ppm for the PI. The simulation of climate is determined by sea surface temperatures, the sea ice distribution, and CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration. Each model simulation was performed for 5 years with a 1-year spin-up. We used 5 years of monthly average aerosol concentrations together with the first year of 4 hourly meteorological conditions to calculate the radiative effects
