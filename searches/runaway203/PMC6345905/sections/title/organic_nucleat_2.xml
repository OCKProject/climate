  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>. BVOC emissions are largest in the tropics, causing the SOA in models to peak there (Supplementary Fig.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. However, nucleation within the Amazon PBL is almost never observed

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Moreover, airborne observations over the Amazon Basin show that there are high aerosol number concentrations in the upper troposphere (UT) between 8 and 15 km altitude with concentrations often exceeding those in the PBL by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Our explicit chemical mechanism allows BVOC to be transported to the UT, where further oxidation forms extremely low volatility HOMs. The low temperatures, high ionization rates, and a low condensation sink in the UT offer a conducive environment for nucleation. As a result, the profile of aerosol number concentration in the Amazon region (dashed box, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) peaks near 12 km reproducing these airborne observations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). The number concentration shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> is dominated by Aitken mode particles (&gt;95%) formed from the growth of nucleation-mode particles

  <sub>4</sub> ratio in the UT aerosol over the Amazon is 10.3, comparable to the observed mean value 13.8 ± 4.6
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>, more than 80% of the total Aitken particle number is initially formed as a result of organic nucleation with the percentage increasing with altitude, while nucleation of sulfate represents only about 10%.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model follows the formation of new particles from organics as a result of three mechanisms: heteromolecular nucleation of sulfuric acid and organics (HET), neutral organic nucleation (NON) and ion-induced organic nucleation (ION). The mass of SOA formed as a result of organic nucleation (newSOA) and the organics that condense on them explains 17% of the total global average burden of SOA with a high percentage (&gt;30%) in some oceanic and remote regions (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The Amazon is the most important region producing new organic particles and has the highest organic nucleation rate primarily because of the high emissions of α-pinene and the high production of HOMs from α-pinene oxidation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3a</a>). Over 90% of newSOA over the Amazon is associated with ION, while globally it explains 60.0% (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3d</a>). However, HET occurs more widely than ION and dominates the rate of organic nucleation in many areas (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3b</a>). NON is responsible for only 1.1% of newSOA. Organic nucleation increases the global average newSOA number by 9425 cm
  <span class="sup">−3</span> and the number concentration in the PBL by 6572 cm
  <span class="sup">−3</span> (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The column number of newSOA in the nucleation mode is highest in the Amazon (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4a</a>) but the highest number concentration in the PBL occurs downwind of the Amazon (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4b</a>). However, fewer newSOA particles grow to the accumulation mode size in the tropics than in most other regions (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4e</a>). The average mass ratio of condensed sulfuric acid to organics in each of the three modes is shown in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>. The global average mass of sulfuric acid in the nucleation and Aitken mode particles in newSOA is larger than that of organics. Thus, condensed sulfuric acid and water are responsible for most of the growth of small newSOA particles after organics drive the formation of new particles, consistent with some laboratory and field measurements
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Organics also contribute to the growth of the small particles, especially over the Amazon with its high concentrations of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC), so that the concentration of organics on newSOA is comparable to that of sulfuric acid. As newSOA particles grow, the decrease of the Kelvin effect with increasing size allows relatively more SVOC to condense in regions with large organic sources
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. This allows the mass of organics in the accumulation mode of newSOA to become larger than that of sulfuric acid except for regions impacted by pollution in the Northern Hemisphere (NH, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5c</a>).
