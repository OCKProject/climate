   </span>. Moreover, airborne observations over the Amazon Basin show that there are high aerosol number concentrations in the upper troposphere (UT) between 8 and 15 km altitude with concentrations often exceeding those in the PBL by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
   </span>. Our explicit chemical mechanism allows BVOC to be transported to the UT, where further oxidation forms extremely low volatility HOMs. The low temperatures, high ionization rates, and a low condensation sink in the UT offer a conducive environment for nucleation. As a result, the profile of aerosol number concentration in the Amazon region (dashed box, Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) peaks near 12 km reproducing these airborne observations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). The number concentration shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> is dominated by Aitken mode particles (&gt;95%) formed from the growth of nucleation-mode particles

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model follows the formation of new particles from organics as a result of three mechanisms: heteromolecular nucleation of sulfuric acid and organics (HET), neutral organic nucleation (NON) and ion-induced organic nucleation (ION). The mass of SOA formed as a result of organic nucleation (newSOA) and the organics that condense on them explains 17% of the total global average burden of SOA with a high percentage (&gt;30%) in some oceanic and remote regions (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). The Amazon is the most important region producing new organic particles and has the highest organic nucleation rate primarily because of the high emissions of α-pinene and the high production of HOMs from α-pinene oxidation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span> (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3a</a>). Over 90% of newSOA over the Amazon is associated with ION, while globally it explains 60.0% (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3d</a>). However, HET occurs more widely than ION and dominates the rate of organic nucleation in many areas (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3b</a>). NON is responsible for only 1.1% of newSOA. Organic nucleation increases the global average newSOA number by 9425 cm
   <span class="sup">−3</span> and the number concentration in the PBL by 6572 cm
   <span class="sup">−3</span> (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The column number of newSOA in the nucleation mode is highest in the Amazon (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4a</a>) but the highest number concentration in the PBL occurs downwind of the Amazon (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4b</a>). However, fewer newSOA particles grow to the accumulation mode size in the tropics than in most other regions (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4e</a>). The average mass ratio of condensed sulfuric acid to organics in each of the three modes is shown in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>. The global average mass of sulfuric acid in the nucleation and Aitken mode particles in newSOA is larger than that of organics. Thus, condensed sulfuric acid and water are responsible for most of the growth of small newSOA particles after organics drive the formation of new particles, consistent with some laboratory and field measurements
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>. Organics also contribute to the growth of the small particles, especially over the Amazon with its high concentrations of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC), so that the concentration of organics on newSOA is comparable to that of sulfuric acid. As newSOA particles grow, the decrease of the Kelvin effect with increasing size allows relatively more SVOC to condense in regions with large organic sources
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
   </span>. This allows the mass of organics in the accumulation mode of newSOA to become larger than that of sulfuric acid except for regions impacted by pollution in the Northern Hemisphere (NH, Supplementary Fig.

   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>. However, the source of SOA is very sensitive to changes in climate and land use
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
   </span>. Here we calculate SOA in the PI atmosphere including changes in anthropogenic emissions, climate, and land use (PIall) and compare our results with simulations that only include changes in anthropogenic emissions (PIemi). We also compare simulations with and without organic nucleation (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The net change of natural precursor emissions (i.e., isoprene, α-pinene, and limonene) reflects the integrated competition between increased surface temperature and decreased vegetation (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>), while the natural emissions in PIemi are similar to those in the PD. The emissions of α-pinene increase in most areas in the Amazon and central Africa where organic nucleation is most efficient (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6b</a>). Overall, this causes the global vertically averaged pure organic nucleation rate to increase by 44% in the PD compared to PIall (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). There are many more newSOA particles growing to the Aitken and accumulation modes in the PD than the PI due to the significant increase of sulfuric acid in the PD. As a result, the column and PBL number concentration of SOA in the Aitken mode increase by 19 and 43% in the PD compared to PIall, while the column and PBL number concentration of SOA in the accumulation mode in the PD is larger than that in PIall by factors of 11.4 and 7.6, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). The large increase in the number concentration of accumulation mode newSOA in the PD may be caused by the underestimation of SOA in our model (Supplementary 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>), which leads to a very low baseline in the number of newSOA in the accumulation mode in PIall. The tropospheric burden of ozone is increased by 33 and 46% in the PD compared to PIemi and PIall, which is similar to the difference between the PD and 1850 from ensemble multi-model results (~30%)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span>. Due to the smaller oxidation rate and smaller concentration of sulfuric acid in PIemi, the HET and ION nucleation rates in PIemi are 78 and 5% smaller than those in the PD, although the emission of α-pinene is similar. The column number concentration of Aitken and accumulation mode newSOA in PIemi are 1.1% and 16.7% larger than those in PIall because of the larger α-pinene emission in the tropics in the PIemi compared to PIall. However, the burden of total SOA in PIall is 14 and 13% larger than that in PD and PIemi, respectively, (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>) due to the larger emission of SOA precursors, especially that of isoprene, in PIall (Supplementary Fig.

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we evaluate the radiative effects of SOA with and without organic nucleation and with and without climate and land use change in both the PD and PI atmosphere. Previous studies did not evaluate the influence of organic nucleation on the direct radiative forcing (DRF)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
   </span>. Our model indicates that the PD direct radiative effect (DRE) of SOA is 25% larger due to organic nucleation (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The burden of total SOA in PIall is 13% larger than that in PIemi, resulting in the 19% larger global average DRE of SOA in PIall compared to PIemi (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). The size distribution of newSOA also influences the DRE of SOA. The burden of newSOA contributes 45 and 48% to the total SOA burden in PIemi and PIall, respectively. Although the burden of newSOA in PIall is 22% larger than that in PIemi, the total surface area of newSOA in PIall is only 3.4% larger than that in PIemi due to changes in the size distribution. Moreover, the difference in organic nucleation caused by climate and land use change can alter the concentration of sulfate indirectly. The sulfuric acid condensed on newSOA (SO4SOA) is decreased by 4% in PIall compared to PIemi (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). As a result, the additional sulfuric acid gas in PIall promotes new particle formation of sulfate and the growth of more new sulfate particles to a larger size. The column number concentration of new sulfate in the Aitken and accumulation modes in PIall is 15% and 4.5% larger than that in PIemi, respectively (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). As a result, the DRF of anthropogenic aerosol is estimated to be −0.384 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> using PIall but −0.410 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> using PIemi (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a, b</a>). Thus, the anthropogenic aerosol DRF is decreased by 6.3% when changes in climate and land use are included. The difference in DRF of anthropogenic aerosols comes from the combined effects of changes in the total SOA burden and the size distributions of new sulfate particles and newSOA. The total surface area of new sulfate and newSOA in PIall is 7.8% larger than that in PIemi, causing a smaller forcing. Without organic nucleation, the DRF of anthropogenic aerosol using PIall is −0.469 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, which is 22% larger than the DRF with organic nucleation (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11</a>). This is because the total new aerosol surface area decreases by 17% in the PI atmosphere due to the decrease in the total aerosol number concentration.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The AIE of SOA is much more sensitive to the inclusion of organic nucleation since it strongly depends on the change in the aerosol number concentration as well as the size distribution. The AIE of SOA is small without organic nucleation (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Organic nucleation produces newSOA and some grow to CCN size and increase cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC). In addition, the large number concentration of newSOA decreases water supersaturations drastically due to enhanced condensation. SOA enhances the global average accumulation mode particle number concentration in the PBL by 22 cm
   <span class="sup">−3</span> (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) and the CDNC at the top of water liquid clouds by 1.32 × 10

   <span class="sup">−2</span> in the PD (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">13a</a>). However, in regions of the NH where the number concentration of sulfate is large, the CDNC at the top of liquid water clouds decreases due to SOA because the maximum supersaturation is significantly reduced by the newSOA and this suppresses many of other particles from being activated to cloud droplets. SOA with organic nucleation results in a positive AIE of SOA in the regions of the NH in the PD (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">13a</a>). SOA also lowers the supersaturation in the PI atmosphere, but the CDNC always increases due to SOA because of the low number concentrations of other aerosols. Organic nucleation results in a column number of newSOA in the accumulation mode of 2.8 × 10
   <span class="sup">10</span> and 2.4 × 10
   <span class="sup">10</span> m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> for PIemi and PIall, respectively (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The SOA in PIemi causes an increase in the CNDC by 9.91 × 10

   <span class="sup">−3</span> at the top of liquid water clouds (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12b</a>), while in PIall the CDNC increases by 9.69 × 10
   <span class="sup">6</span> m
   <span class="sup">−3</span> due to the smaller number concentration of newSOA (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12c</a>). As a result, the AIE due to SOA in PIall is 8.3% smaller than that in PIemi (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">13b, c</a>). However, the column number concentration of new sulfate particles in the Aitken and accumulation modes in PIall increases by 15 and 4.5%, respectively, compared to PIemi due to smaller amounts of sulfuric acid condensed on newSOA in PIall. As a result, climate and land use change enhance the preindustrial value of the AIE of SOA. The indirect radiative forcing (IRF) of anthropogenic aerosol is −1.675 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> using PIall (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), which is 3.5% smaller than the forcing (−1.735 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>) using PIemi (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>). Without organic nucleation, the IRF of anthropogenic aerosol is −1.878 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> using PIall (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">14</a>). Thus, the inclusion of organic nucleation leads to a 11% smaller IRF of anthropogenic aerosol, which is much smaller than the 27% reduction indicated in ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
   </span>. Some of this difference is due to our use of a temperature dependence for the nucleation rate. For example, Gordon et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
   </span> found a 17% reduction of IRF when they used the same temperature dependence as we use (see also Supplementary 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3.1</a>). However, some is due to the fact that the organic nucleation in our model primarily occurs in the upper troposphere so that only 4.3 and 6.0% of the total accumulation mode newSOA occurs in the PBL for the PD and PIall, respectively. In contrast, organic particles mostly form near the surface using the methods in ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
   </span>, which may overestimate the influence of organic nucleation in the PI atmosphere and thus its influence on the IRF.

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study demonstrates the importance of climate, land use change, and organic nucleation for the evaluation of anthropogenic aerosol RF. Organic nucleation has a large and complex influence on the aerosol size distribution as well as on the activation of particles to form cloud droplets. Here we show that organic nucleation leads to a 12.5% reduction in the direct plus indirect RF between the PD and PI atmosphere. Moreover, the total RF is further reduced by 4.0% when we include the effects of climate and land use change. Thus, we find a 16% smaller forcing due to anthropogenic aerosols as a result of including organic nucleation, land use change and climate change.</p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The calculation of SOA and the RF is uncertain in part because of poorly defined chemical formation mechanisms. We currently have limited knowledge of the explicit chemical reactions that lead to the production of extremely low volatility HOMs, although there should be many ways that these form
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span>. Here, we included those HOMs that have been shown to contribute to nucleation in quantum chemical calculations, but it is possible that there are other HOMs that contribute to nucleation and will be identified in the future. The use of different HOMs that lead to nucleation is expected to contribute to a large uncertainty in the RF estimation associated organic nucleation. Most experiments indicated that HOMs are produced through H-shift and peroxy radical autoxidation of monoterpenes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span>, although some experiments regarded HOMs as a first-generation product from precusor gases, while others include them after a series of oxidation steps
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
   </span>. Here, we have primarily focused on α-pinene as a precursor to HOM. Exocyclic monoterpenes like β-pinene mostly react with OH and do not form HOMs, so while excluding the production of HOMs from exocyclic monoterpenes adds some uncertainty, it is not likely to be large compared to other uncertainties. The suppression of new particle formation by isoprene has been detected in some field and chamber experiments
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>. However, it is not clear how isoprene and its oxidation products may change the oxidation chemistry of terpenes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
   </span>. Including isoprene suppression could reduce the number of new organic particles in the PBL further. The temperature dependence of the nucleation rate used in our model is based on a quantum chemical calculation and could cause some uncertainty in the newSOA number concentration. As shown in Supplementary 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3.1</a>, the total RF of anthropogenic aerosol is increased by 5.3% without the temperature dependence. The growth rate of newSOA is another important uncertainty that affects the RF estimate. When the low volatility products formed from isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX), glyoxal and methylglyoxal contribute to the growth of newSOA, the total RF is increased by 12% (see Supplementary 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3.2</a>). The emissions of aerosols in the PI atmosphere have large differences depending on different models. For example, Hamilton et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
   </span> used several fire emissions data sets to suggest that the cloud albedo forcing might be reduced by 35% when larger fire emissions are used in the PI atmosphere. Larger emissions would also alter our results by adding additional condensation sinks. In addition, uncertainties in the change in land use and vegetation type will also alter the BVOC emissions, leading to an uncertainty in the baseline of SOA in the PI atmosphere
