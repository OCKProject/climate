 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Organic nucleation provides a way to form particles in the PI atmosphere with its low levels of sulfuric acid, thereby changing the baseline for determining the RF by anthropogenic aerosols

  </span>. The uncertainty in aerosol concentrations in the PI atmosphere is the largest contributor to the uncertainty in estimates of RF
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Previous studies have determined the aerosol concentration in the PI atmosphere by only considering the change in anthropogenic emissions

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. However, the source of SOA is very sensitive to changes in climate and land use
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. Here we calculate SOA in the PI atmosphere including changes in anthropogenic emissions, climate, and land use (PIall) and compare our results with simulations that only include changes in anthropogenic emissions (PIemi). We also compare simulations with and without organic nucleation (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The net change of natural precursor emissions (i.e., isoprene, α-pinene, and limonene) reflects the integrated competition between increased surface temperature and decreased vegetation (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>), while the natural emissions in PIemi are similar to those in the PD. The emissions of α-pinene increase in most areas in the Amazon and central Africa where organic nucleation is most efficient (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6b</a>). Overall, this causes the global vertically averaged pure organic nucleation rate to increase by 44% in the PD compared to PIall (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>). There are many more newSOA particles growing to the Aitken and accumulation modes in the PD than the PI due to the significant increase of sulfuric acid in the PD. As a result, the column and PBL number concentration of SOA in the Aitken mode increase by 19 and 43% in the PD compared to PIall, while the column and PBL number concentration of SOA in the accumulation mode in the PD is larger than that in PIall by factors of 11.4 and 7.6, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). The large increase in the number concentration of accumulation mode newSOA in the PD may be caused by the underestimation of SOA in our model (Supplementary 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>), which leads to a very low baseline in the number of newSOA in the accumulation mode in PIall. The tropospheric burden of ozone is increased by 33 and 46% in the PD compared to PIemi and PIall, which is similar to the difference between the PD and 1850 from ensemble multi-model results (~30%)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. Due to the smaller oxidation rate and smaller concentration of sulfuric acid in PIemi, the HET and ION nucleation rates in PIemi are 78 and 5% smaller than those in the PD, although the emission of α-pinene is similar. The column number concentration of Aitken and accumulation mode newSOA in PIemi are 1.1% and 16.7% larger than those in PIall because of the larger α-pinene emission in the tropics in the PIemi compared to PIall. However, the burden of total SOA in PIall is 14 and 13% larger than that in PD and PIemi, respectively, (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>) due to the larger emission of SOA precursors, especially that of isoprene, in PIall (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>).
