         <p>Radiative feedbacks versus forcing efficacy. Differences in forcing efficacy (
            <span>a</span>) are largely explained by variance in the global-mean radiative gain from surface
            albedo and cloud feedbacks (
            <span>b</span>)—i.e., the additional top-of-atmosphere flux change from the feedback due to a unit
            of effective radiative forcing—across emissions regions. Error bars capture the standard
            error
