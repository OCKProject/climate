         <p>Patterns of surface air temperature response to identical aerosol emissions from eight
            regions. Spatial patterns of surface air temperature change in response to identical
            aerosol emission in each the eight regions are shown. Global mean temperature change
            (K) with standard error is shown in bottom left. Grid markings indicate regions that
            are not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level via
