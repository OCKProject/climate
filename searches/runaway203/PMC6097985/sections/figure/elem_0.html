         <p>Global and regional-mean temperature responses to identical aerosol emissions in different
            regions. Identical total annual emissions of sulfate and black carbon aerosol from
            eight major past, present, and potential future emitting regions (
            <span>a</span>) result in global-mean cooling spanning a 14x range (
            <span>b</span>, 
            <span>y</span>-axis), differing substantially in the degree to which that cooling is felt in the
            emitting region (
            <span>b</span>, 
            <span>x</span>-axis). Diagonal lines (
            <span>b</span>) indicate the ratio of regional- to global-mean cooling. Error bars in 
            <span>b</span> capture the standard error
