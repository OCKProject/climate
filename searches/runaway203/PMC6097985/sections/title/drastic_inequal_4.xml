 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the rate of global-mean cancellation between the absorbing and scattering aerosol burdens is somewhat correlated with the top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing generated by each emitting region, the relative top-of-atmosphere effective radiative forcings are not well correlated with the relative global mean temperature change (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), indicating a substantial divergence in forcing efficacy depending on emitting region. The forcing efficacy of each regional emission—i.e., the global-mean temperature change per unit top-of-atmosphere effective radiative forcing (captured in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a> and by placement relative to the diagonal lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>)—range from 0.24 ± 0.14 K(Wm

  <span class="sup">−1</span> to 1.3 ± 0.06 K(Wm
  <span class="sup">−2</span>)
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. This constitutes a factor of five range in forcing efficacy between emitting regions, roughly twice the relative range in estimated forcing efficacy between global historical aerosols and greenhouse gases

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Emissions from the U.S. and Western Europe have the largest forcing efficacies (1.32 ± 0.06 and 1.09 ± 0.07 K(Wm
  <span class="sup">−2</span>)
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively), producing outsized temperature responses for the effective radiative forcing they generate. Emissions from regions like Brazil, meanwhile, produce a comparable effective radiative forcing to emissions from Western Europe or the U.S., but generate much smaller global-mean temperature change (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). These efficacy differences highlight the shortcomings of using global-mean radiative forcing to estimate the climate effects of highly regionalized forcings.

    <p>Radiative feedbacks versus forcing efficacy. Differences in forcing efficacy (
     <span class="bold">a</span>) are largely explained by variance in the global-mean radiative gain from surface albedo and cloud feedbacks (
     <span class="bold">b</span>)—i.e., the additional top-of-atmosphere flux change from the feedback due to a unit of effective radiative forcing—across emissions regions. Error bars capture the standard error
