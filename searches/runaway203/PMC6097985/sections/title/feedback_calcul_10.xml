Use of radiative kernels generated within the same climate model as the simulations to which they are applied, as is the case here, is generally considered to be best practice for reducing errors associated with differences in radiative transfer codes between climate models

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The radiative kernel for a given feedback process consists of gridded monthly values of the radiative perturbation induced by a prescribed change in a given feedback process, such as surface albedo or atmospheric water vapor. These gridded kernels are then multiplied by the monthly change in the relevant feedback process for each of the regional emissions signals (see Simulations and analysis), normalized by the prescribed change used to derive the kernel. This process is used to calculate the feedbacks due to all process other than the cloud radiative feedback. The cloud radiative feedback is calculated using the adjusted cloud radiative effect method
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span>. In this method, a cloud radiative effect is calculated as the difference between the all-sky and clear-sky (i.e., non-cloud-permitting) top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance. This cloud radiative effect is then adjusted for potential contamination by non-cloud factors through subtraction of the kernel-calculated cloudy-sky (i.e., all-sky kernel minus clear-sky kernel) values of the other feedbacks. This method has been shown to provide a reliable estimate for cloud feedbacks relative to other, more computationally prohibitive, methods
