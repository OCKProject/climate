 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that differences in global-mean temperature response resulting from identical emissions emerge at each of several steps between initial emission and eventual temperature effect. Aerosol emissions impact temperature when their resulting atmospheric concentrations interact with atmospheric radiation, both directly and through aerosols’ rapid effects on cloud radiative properties and amount. These radiative interactions then modify the top-of-atmosphere energy balance, which creates a global-mean temperature change mediated by a series of feedback processes. Differences in the temperature change induced by each regional emission can emerge at each step in this process: from emission to atmospheric burden, from burden to top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing, and from top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing to temperature change.</p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total atmospheric aerosol burdens generated by the identical regional emissions are spread between 128–233 Gg of sulfate aerosol, 9.29–15.7 Gg of black carbon aerosol, and 23.1–54.2 Gg of organic carbon aerosol (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>; spatial distributions shown in Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>, and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>, respectively). However, the atmospheric burdens of the individual aerosol species generated by each regional emission are largely uncorrelated with the regional emissions’ relative potency at changing global-mean temperature (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). Thus, the disparity in temperature effects does not arise solely from a disparity in the atmospheric lifetime and resulting atmospheric burden of aerosols emitted from each region, but also through the differential generation of climate forcing and feedbacks by those burdens.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How do the aerosol burdens from each region’s emissions translate into radiative forcing, which in turn drives the global mean temperature change? The radiative effects of sulfate (a global-mean cooling agent), black carbon (a global-mean warming agent), and organic carbon (a global-mean cooling agent, though with minor shortwave absorbing properties) will counteract each other in driving the radiative forcing. This cancellation can be accommodated by using an aggregate measure of aerosol optical properties, such as aerosol optical depth. In order to capture the cancellation between the absorbing and scattering aerosol burdens, we calculate this as the ratio between the change in global-mean total aerosol optical depth and global-mean absorbing aerosol optical depth caused by each regional emission.</p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ratio of total to absorbing aerosol optical depth explains approximately 60% of the variance (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.60, 0.44–0.69) in global-mean top-of-atmosphere effective radiative forcing (ERF) from each regional emission (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). We calculate the ERF as the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance induced by the regional emission after the atmosphere and land surface has been allowed to respond (see Methods). The variance in ERF is thus largely explained by the rate of global-mean cancellation between the absorbing and scattering aerosol burdens resulting from each regional emission, arising from differences in aerosol mixing rates, relative altitudes, and other microphysical and radiative factors

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. The remaining variance may be explained by (1) the radiative environment in which the aerosol population is interacting, created by regional differences in climatological cloud cover or background aerosol; or (2) the particular cloud/convective environment in which the aerosols are placed and the influence this has on the manifestation of the aerosols’ indirect and semidirect effects on clouds

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. We find that the ratio of total aerosol optical depth to absorbing aerosol optical depth is approximately as well correlated with clear-sky ERF (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.58, 0.31–0.61) as it is with the total ERF, indicating that the presence or absence of climatological cloud does not substantially impact the translation of the atmospheric aerosol burdens into radiative forcing.
