  </span>, coupled to a mixed-layer ocean. Mixed-layer coupling provides benefits in decreased computational intensity compared to full-ocean coupling, and has been found to lead to similar responses to full ocean coupling in the CESM model suite using an earlier version of the CESM atmospheric model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. This similarity is expected to hold with use of CAM5
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. Simulations using CAM5 coupled to a slab ocean have been widely used in the peer-reviewed literature
