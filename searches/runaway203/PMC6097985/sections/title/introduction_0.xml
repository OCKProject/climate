 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global distribution of anthropogenic aerosol emissions has evolved substantially over the industrial era. In the mid-20th century, North America and Western Europe were the primary anthropogenic aerosol source regions, whereas today South and East Asian sources dominate anthropogenic aerosol emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Aerosol particles have direct negative impacts on air quality, human health, and agricultural productivity in the regions in which they are concentrated
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>, but also change regional and global climate through their interactions with solar radiation and clouds. In the global total, anthropogenic aerosols are estimated to have offset approximately a third of the global-mean greenhouse gas driven warming since the 1950s
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. However, because of aerosols’ relatively short atmospheric lifetime, their atmospheric distribution and temperature effects are heterogeneous and dependent on the distribution of emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. With this geographic redistribution of aerosol emissions, therefore, comes the potential for redistribution of their climate effects—a characteristic not present with long-lived greenhouse gases.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aerosols’ heterogeneous spatial distribution is recognized to influence their overall climate impact relative to more homogeneous climate forcers, like carbon dioxide
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Although carbon dioxide radiative forcing has some spatial structure associated with the climatological radiative environment
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>, the historical spatial distribution of aerosol forcing has been shown to generate a larger transient and equilibrium global-mean climate response than equivalent amounts of long-lived greenhouse gas forcing, as a result of historical aerosol forcing’s greater spatial coincidence with Northern Hemisphere land and polar regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. This difference in the rate at which aerosols’ top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing produces global-mean temperature effects relative to greenhouse gases’ is characterized by the efficacy of its radiative forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span> (i.e., global-mean temperature response divided by global-mean top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing), and is a major factor in determining the degree to which anthropogenic aerosols have offset greenhouse-gas driven warming over the historical period
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Localized aerosol concentrations also strongly influence regional temperature, rainfall, and circulation in emitting regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet, despite the acknowledged sensitivity of aerosols’ total climate impacts and the spatial distribution thereof to the spatial distribution of the aerosol emissions themselves, many scientific and policy discussions treat the climate effect of aerosol emissions from all regions as equal. Policy analysis continues to use single global-mean metric values, such as Global Warming Potential, to trade off the impacts of aerosol emissions from any region against greenhouse gas emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, despite studies demonstrating that, for certain aerosol species, this value may differ substantially depending on the emitting region
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. The reduced-form integrated assessment models used to analyze costs and benefits of climate policy similarly treat aerosol emissions from all regions as having the same capacity to affect global climate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Global-mean aerosol radiative forcing and its offsetting effects on greenhouse gas-driven warming, meanwhile, have not been widely recognized to be dependent on the evolution of global aerosol emissions’ spatial distribution
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scientific community has made great progress to date in building a theoretical framework for understanding the importance of the spatial heterogeneity in anthropogenic aerosol forcing. However, limitations remain in leveraging the existing literature to address key scientific and decision-making issues surrounding the differential role of aerosols emitted from different regions. Many studies assessing the temperature response to regionally distinct aerosol perturbations use radiative forcing or atmospheric aerosol concentrations as their unit of regional perturbation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. However, these units are not easily attributable to individual regions, as radiative forcing or atmospheric concentrations occurring in a given region may be attributable to aerosol emissions from well outside that region’s boundaries. This framing is additionally difficult to apply in decision-making contexts, as mitigation targets are generally set in terms of emissions rather than concentrations or radiative forcing. Several studies have looked at the effects of all aerosols within a given latitude band
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>, but this is not a geographic delineation along which mitigation decisions, emissions accounting, or conjunct trends in aerosol emissions occur. Other studies have assessed the relative effects of historical emissions or scalings thereon in different countries
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. However, these emissions are unequal and therefore cannot be used straightforwardly to create a quantitative framework for assessing the relative importance of aerosol emissions from different regions in the context of the climate metrics used in many scientific and policy frameworks.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we address a fundamental outstanding question underpinning both the consideration of aerosol emissions in climate policy and the analysis of their evolving role in global and regional climate change and climate sensitivity: can the temperature effects of a unit of aerosols emitted from any major emitting economy be considered equivalent? We analyze the relative climate effects of identical combined sulfate, black carbon, and organic carbon aerosol emissions—equivalent to China’s total annual year 2000 anthropogenic emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>—sourced from eight major past, present, or projected future emitting regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) in a global atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model (see Methods). These three aerosol species drive the vast majority of anthropogenic aerosol forcing over the historical period
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. They have historically varied in tandem at the national-scale, as economy-wide transitions have driven aerosol emissions changes over the historical period
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>, and are projected to continue to do so in future
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. This novel design provides a crucial advancement by allowing for a unique one-to-one comparison (cleanly interpretable in scientific and decision-making contexts) between aerosol emissions (the perturbation unit that most directly corresponds to mitigation decision-making) in several past, present, or projected future major emitting geopolitical regions (approaching the geographic delineations along which mitigation decisions and emissions accounting are conducted). Our results demonstrate substantial inequalities in both the magnitude and spatial distribution of temperature effects of aerosol emissions located in different major emitting economies. These divergent temperature effects are fundamentally driven by differences in the degree to which each region’s emissions and the resulting distribution of radiative effects generate remote feedback processes, and reveal new challenges for understanding and addressing the global and regional climate influence of aerosols.
