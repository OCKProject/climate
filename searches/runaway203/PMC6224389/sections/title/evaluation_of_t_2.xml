 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We apply the same lidar-based framework to observations and the model to consistently compare the observed and simulated short-term cloud feedbacks. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows substantial differences between the observed and simulated feedbacks. Unlike the simulations, the observed short-term LW cloud feedback is negative. It is a consequence of the anti-correlation between variations of surface temperature and LWCRE in the observations while there is a correlation between those variables in the present-day simulation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The simulated cloud feedback in the model is not correct because the model does not correctly reproduce cloud changes associated to surface temperature change. If we look at the decomposition of the total cloud feedback in cloud properties, we notice that the observed short-term LW cloud feedback is mainly driven by the opaque cloud cover variations between 2008 and 2014. Variations of the opaque cloud altitude do not play the dominant role for the observations, while it is the dominant component in the model. In fact, the model is able to reproduce the observed amplitude of the variations in the opaque cloud altitude, but significantly underestimates the observed amplitude of the variations in the opaque cloud cover. First investigations of this model underestimation suggest a lack from model to simulate cloud opacity interannual variations which transfer part of cloud from opaque cloud cover to thin cloud cover and conversely.
