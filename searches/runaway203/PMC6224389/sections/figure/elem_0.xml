  <p>Global ocean monthly mean anomaly of the LongWave Cloud Radiative Effect (LWCRE) between January 2008 and December 2014: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) observed by CERES (EBAF Ed. 4.0) and derived from space lidar observations, (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) simulated by the LMDZ general circulation model and derived from synthetic space lidar observations obtained with a lidar simulator plugged on the LMDZ model. The anomaly is the difference between the value of a month and the mean over the whole 2008–2014 period. Surface temperature anomaly from ERA-I for observations and from model output for simulations are shown in light gray. Coefficient correlation 
   <span class="italic">R</span>, standard deviations 
   <span class="italic">σ</span>, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are given at the bottom of subplots.
