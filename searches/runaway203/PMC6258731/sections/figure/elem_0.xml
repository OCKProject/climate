  <p>Nature of projected Arctic amplification. Surface temperature amplification for CMIP5 RCP8.5 models. Figure 1a shows the zonally-averaged temperature change normalized to global temperature change for each CMIP5 model (hereafter amplification factor). The solid black line in 
   <span class="bold">a</span> represents the ensemble mean amplification factor; the black dashed line represents the zonally-averaged inter-model standard deviation normalized by the global inter-model standard deviation. The boxed region in 
   <span class="bold">a</span> represents the Arctic domain 60–90°N used in this study. The inset in 
   <span class="bold">a</span> shows the seasonal cycle of the amplification factor for the Arctic domain. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> shows the vertical profile of ensemble mean temperature change by latitude
