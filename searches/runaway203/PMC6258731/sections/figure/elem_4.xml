  <p>Relationship between regional warming pattern and individual partial temperature contributions. Select partial temperature contributions are plotted against projected temperature change by year 2100 using individual grid boxes for (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) winter longwave clear-sky, (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) winter ocean heat storage, (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) winter surface turbulent flux, (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) summer surface albedo feedback, and (
   <span class="bold">e</span>) autumn cloud radiative effect. The bracketed ranges show the ensemble mean temperature change (black filled circle) and the Â±1 standard deviation for various Arctic regions; temperature changes for some individual models exceed this range
