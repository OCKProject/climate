   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> illustrates AA using the normalized temperature change—hereafter, amplification factor—defined as the ratio between the 1° zonally-averaged temperature change to global temperature change. All models simulate surface-based warming—at least 1.5 times global average warming—extending into the lower troposphere poleward of 75°N (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The solid black line in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> represents the ensemble mean amplification factor, which exceeds 2.5 at the pole. CMIP5 models also simulate a similar seasonality of AA (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, inset) with minimum warming (amplification factor &lt; 1) in summer and maximum warming in fall and winter (amplification factor &gt;2). Despite unanimous agreement in the existence of AA, models disagree on the magnitude and spatial characteristics.

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inter-model differences in projected Arctic warming exceed those for any other latitude. The Arctic domain (defined as 60°–90°N) shows increasing model differences at more northerly latitudes, approaching an amplification factor spread of 1.6–3.6 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). The dashed black line in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> represents the ratio between the 1° zonally-averaged inter-model standard deviation in temperature change to the global inter-model standard deviation—a measure of inter-model spread. This ratio approaches four times the global average moving poleward. The seasonal cycle of AA (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, inset) shows the largest model spread in winter (amplification factor between 2 and 4) and smallest in summer (amplification factor between 0.5 and 1.25).

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arctic warming projections display stark regional contrasts (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) where sea ice retreat regions exhibit the greatest warming and possess the largest model disagreement. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the annual and seasonal ensemble mean temperature and sea ice concentration (SIC) changes and the corresponding standard deviations across the ensemble. The Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas regions (see map, Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) exhibit the largest projected warming and sea ice loss; wintertime temperature projections exceed +20 K in both regions. The central Arctic Ocean shows the largest seasonality of the temperature response, warming by 15–20 K in fall/winter and less than 5 K in spring/summer. During all seasons, the smallest temperature changes between 1–4 K occur in the sea ice-free ocean regions of the North Atlantic, Norwegian Sea, and Davis Strait due to small surface energy budget changes consistent with reductions in ocean heat transport

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial warming pattern varies significantly between models; some show larger temperature increases over the central Arctic Ocean and others show the greatest warming in regions of the largest sea ice loss. In general, the inter-model spread is greatest in the sea ice retreat regions (Fig.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual contributions to Arctic amplification</div>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The presence of surface ice and the massive amounts of energy sequestered and released during water phase change indicates that the surface energy budget (SEB) is more relevant to the Arctic surface temperature than the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy budget. Previous work demonstrates that the surface and TOA perspectives can show opposite signs for the individual feedback contributions to warming, as Taylor et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
   </span> illustrated for clouds. Our SEB decomposition approach analyzes the energy flux changes and how they contribute to AA in each model (see Methods) by linearly decomposing the total surface temperature change into partial temperature contributions (PTCs). These terms include SAF, cloud radiative effect (CRE), changes in shortwave clear-sky radiation unrelated to SAF (SWCS), longwave clear-sky radiation (LWCS), ocean heat storage and transport (HSTOR), and surface turbulent fluxes (HFLUX, positive from atmosphere to ocean). In this decomposition, the LWCS term includes the effects of CO
   <sub>2</sub>, air temperature, and water vapor changes from both local and remote sources. We do not separate these effects as in previous work
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span> because biases due to the decomposition approach interfere with the assessment of inter-model differences. The HSTOR term represents the surface energy imbalance, including surface heat storage and ocean heat transport, computed as a residual (see Methods). Since the heat storage capacity of land is small compared to ocean, this term represents ocean heat content. Ocean heat transport, while potentially important to the inter-model spread, could not be assessed separately because few CMIP5 models archived the necessary output. This limits our ability to consider ocean heat storage and transport separately; however, previous work demonstrated that ocean heat storage in the mixed layer dominates changes in ocean heat transport in CMIP5 models over the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> century
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span>; thus, we consider HSTOR changes to be from ocean heat storage.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Annual mean PTCs and formulae are listed in Table 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">1</a>; PTCs are additive, each representing the individual feedback contributions to the total ensemble mean Arctic temperature change of 7.38 K by 2100 in RCP8.5. At least three times larger than any other feedback, the strongest annual surface warming contributions are from LWCS changes, 7.27 K. The SAF feedback exhibits the second strongest ensemble average annual warming contribution (1.82 K) and the cooling influence of HFLUX (−1.67 K) the third largest contributor.

   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">1</a>. LWCS and HSTOR exhibit the largest annual mean, domain-averaged standard deviation, 1.4 K and 1.2 K, respectively. Considering percent differences however, the HSTOR inter-model spread is 400%. Clouds represent the second largest percentage spread at ~125%. Different from other feedbacks, the ±1 standard deviation bounds for these two feedbacks includes zero indicating that models disagree on the annual mean magnitude and sign of these contributions.
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strong seasonality of the PTCs renders the annual mean picture potentially misleading. Despite a modest annual mean inter-model spread (~40%), the SAF shows the widest inter-model range in any month, between +2 to +13 K in July (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>). A strong correlation (
   <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.89) is found between annual mean albedo changes (peaking in summer) and AA (peaking in winter) even though the SAF seasonal cycle is out-of-phase with the maximum warming. The inter-model range in HSTOR (from −2 to −11 K) also maximizes in summer, aligning with the SAF inter-model spread. The inter-model spread in the CRE PTCs is the largest in fall (from +1 to +7 K) and smallest during summer. Models with the largest summer SAF do not exhibit the largest negative CRE PTC and therefore do not compensate for sea ice loss by simulating more reflective clouds. HFLUX exhibits its largest inter-model spread in winter (from −1 to −7 K) and smallest spread in summer (from −1 to +0.5 K). Seasonal cycles of the PTCs exhibit greater amplitude over ocean than land as in Laîné et al.

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4l</a>). The most striking feature is the contrast between the spatial variability of PTCs and their associated inter-model spread for radiative and non-radiative feedbacks, revealing in almost every case that the spatial variation of non-radiative feedbacks (HSTOR and HFLUX) is stronger than for radiative feedbacks (SAF, CRE, SWCS, and LWCS). The spatial contours in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> show that non-radiative feedbacks vary strongly across models, in sea ice-retreat regions the HSTOR standard deviation exceeds 10.0 in the annual mean, more than seven times the domain average, and also approaches 10.0 in the Barents/Kara Seas, more than five times the domain average. Thus, the inter-model spread in Arctic warming is strongly influenced by the non-radiative feedbacks (HSTOR and HFLUX) in sea ice-retreat regions.

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual SEB terms contribute differently to the regional warming pattern. LWCS (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>) and CRE (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5e</a>) PTCs indicate a direct relationship with the regional warming pattern, where larger PTCs are found in regions of larger warming. Models overwhelmingly agree on the relationship between the regional warming and LWCS PTCs. The correspondence between regional characteristics of LWCS and warming indicates a direct local relationship exhibiting very little inter-model spread and supported by the small spatial variation in the LWCS PTC ensemble standard deviation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4i</a>). The CRE PTCs exhibit a larger inter-model spread and smaller PTCs than LWCS. Regions that warm the most show a positive year-round CRE PTC.
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SAF PTCs suggest a different relationship with regional warming. The summer SAF PTCs’ dependence on regional warming (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>) resembles a ‘U-shape’—large PTCs in regions of small and large warming. Since regions that warm most in summer also warm most in fall/winter (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), this suggests that the regional warming pattern itself is partially independent of the SAF, also supported by Kim et al.

   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>) and HFLUX (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>) show monotonic relationships between PTCs and regional warming. HFLUX is negative (surface cooling) in regions that warm most and positive (surface warming) in regions that warm least, the opposite holds for HSTOR. Further, HFLUX and HSTOR PTCs are very close to zero in regions of modest warming, primarily land regions. This behavior indicates that changes in HFLUX control HSTOR and the regional surface heating/cooling rates. The largest inter-model spread in HSTOR and HFLUX PTCs are found in the regions of greatest warming (sea ice retreat regions) exhibiting an inter-model range exceeding 40 K. Overall, these results suggest that the regions that warm the most exhibit a strong summer SAF and fall/winter HFLUX and HSTOR PTCs.

     <p>Local and remote Arctic amplification processes. The local and remote mechanisms represent two process loops that contribute to Arctic amplification. In the remote mechanism, changes in the non-polar circulation increase atmospheric poleward heat transport warming, moistening, and producing a cloudier Arctic, increasing longwave downward radiation. The local mechanism represents the combined surface albedo (radiative) and ice-insulation (non-radiative) feedbacks whereby a less sea ice covered Arctic stores more sunlight in the ocean in summer supporting increased surface turbulent fluxes in fall/winter, which warms, moistens, and produces cloudier conditions and increases longwave downward radiation. The common influence of both the local and remote mechanisms on longwave downward radiation links the two mechanisms facilitating constructive interference and makes them challenging to separate. A line connecting warmer Arctic temperatures with non-polar circulation changes suggests a potential feedback, however the dashed line is used to indicate the current lack of consensus on the magnitude and influence of Arctic temperature changes on the mid-latitude circulation</p>

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and feedback contributions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) are found in sea ice retreat regions. These regions exhibit the largest summer SAF and fall/winter HFLUX/HSTOR PTCs, as well as the largest LWCS increases (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). The HFLUX and HSTOR PTCs also show the largest inter-model differences in sea ice retreat regions. These factors suggest that the local mechanism drives the inter-model spread.
  </p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The local mechanism links the SAF, HSTOR, and HFLUX terms through seasonal energy transfer. To test our hypothesis that differences in the local mechanism explain the AA inter-model spread, we identify a metric based upon the amplitude of seasonal energy exchanges—the seasonal ocean heat flux (OHF
   <sub>SEASONAL</sub>). OHF
   <sub>SEASONAL</sub> is defined as the difference between the month of minimum and maximum HSTOR and ΔOHF
   <sub>SEASONAL</sub> represents its change by 2100. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a</a> shows a statistically significant relationship between the ΔOHF
   <sub>SEASONAL</sub> and AA (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.89), supporting our hypothesis. Using ΔOHF
   <sub>SEASONAL</sub> as an observational constraint on projected AA may lack practical relevance if the signal emergence does not occur before warming. Conversely, the remote forcing mechanism, represented by ΔAPHT (see Methods), anticorrelates with AA suggesting that it dampens the inter-model spread (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7b</a>). Thus, the seasonal exchanges of energy related to the local feedback mechanism widen the inter-model spread in AA.

  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inter-model differences in sea ice retreat regions have non-local effects through the atmospheric circulation. Increased HFLUX warms, moistens, and produces clouds locally, increasing LWDN, deepening the OML, and contributing to a delayed fall sea ice freeze-up. The influence of local HFLUX changes on the Arctic-wide LWCS requires the atmospheric circulation to disperse this energy. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c, d</a> shows a statistically significant linear regression slope between model fall/winter HFLUX PTC in the Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas and the spatial pattern of ΔLWCS; models with a larger magnitude fall/winter HFLUX PTC in sea ice retreat regions generate a larger Arctic-wide LWCS PTC. Comparing Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c, d</a> indicates a larger Arctic-wide LWCS PTC due to ΔHFLUX in the Beaufort-Chukchi Seas, suggesting that the atmospheric circulation is more sensitive to a perturbation in this region. The anti-correlation between ΔOHF
   <sub>SEASONAL</sub> and ΔAPHT (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>) suggests that the inter-model differences in how this energy is dispersed are not from the large-scale circulation, but due to the local circulation. We infer that local atmospheric circulation differences contribute to the inter-model spread in AA by influencing how energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions is dispersed. Burt et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
   </span> hypothesize a possible mechanism whereby reduced fall/winter sea ice induces a thermal contrast between the Arctic Ocean and the colder Arctic continents driving a circulation response, termed a shallow winter monsoon, promoting stronger HFLUX.
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">OML depth modulates the seasonal energy transfer and can impact the inter-model spread in AA. Eight CMIP5 models that archived OML depth show very large inter-model differences in the relationships between OML depth, SIC, and HFLUX in Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas regions. A deeper OML contains a higher heat capacity supporting larger HFLUX and less sea ice (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>). Moreover, the average OML depth in the Barents/Kara Seas region ranges from 13 to 95 m in fall. Motivated by this inter-model spread and the relationship in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>, we hypothesized that the OML depth influences the inter-model spread in AA by modulating the seasonal energy transfer. However, we found no correlation between the mean state OML depth or its change with AA. The lack of correlation may indicate a bias in the model representation of OML dynamics, such as the known bias in upper ocean vertical mixing
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
   </span>. Despite the lack of correlation, this range of OML depth significantly influences the ability of the ocean to store energy and modulate surface turbulent fluxes, sea ice variability, and the atmospheric circulation. Therefore, an improved understanding of the causes and consequences of the inter-model spread in OML depth and its relationship with sea ice and surface turbulent fluxes is needed.
