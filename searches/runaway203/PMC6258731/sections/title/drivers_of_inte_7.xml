 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The largest inter-model differences in the warming response (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and feedback contributions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) are found in sea ice retreat regions. These regions exhibit the largest summer SAF and fall/winter HFLUX/HSTOR PTCs, as well as the largest LWCS increases (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). The HFLUX and HSTOR PTCs also show the largest inter-model differences in sea ice retreat regions. These factors suggest that the local mechanism drives the inter-model spread.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The local mechanism links the SAF, HSTOR, and HFLUX terms through seasonal energy transfer. To test our hypothesis that differences in the local mechanism explain the AA inter-model spread, we identify a metric based upon the amplitude of seasonal energy exchanges—the seasonal ocean heat flux (OHF
  <sub>SEASONAL</sub>). OHF
  <sub>SEASONAL</sub> is defined as the difference between the month of minimum and maximum HSTOR and ΔOHF
  <sub>SEASONAL</sub> represents its change by 2100. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a</a> shows a statistically significant relationship between the ΔOHF
  <sub>SEASONAL</sub> and AA (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.89), supporting our hypothesis. Using ΔOHF
  <sub>SEASONAL</sub> as an observational constraint on projected AA may lack practical relevance if the signal emergence does not occur before warming. Conversely, the remote forcing mechanism, represented by ΔAPHT (see Methods), anticorrelates with AA suggesting that it dampens the inter-model spread (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7b</a>). Thus, the seasonal exchanges of energy related to the local feedback mechanism widen the inter-model spread in AA.

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Models increase ΔOHF
  <sub>SEASONAL</sub> through a stronger summer SAF and a larger fall/winter HFLUX (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7c</a>). This seasonal energy transfer is amplified in sea ice retreat regions, such as the Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d, e</a>) and does not operate in ice-free ocean areas (not shown). Therefore, models accomplish a stronger seasonal transfer of energy through a larger summer SAF, storing heat in the ocean and enhancing fall/winter HFLUX in sea ice retreat regions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a> illustrates the series of relationships that contribute to the inter-model spread due to the local mechanism in sea ice retreat regions. First, the SAF and increased summer heat storage cannot directly increase HFLUX, rather increased summer heat storage supports a delayed fall sea ice freeze-up and a positive fall/winter air–sea temperature gradient (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>s</sub> − 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>a</sub>). Figure 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a> illustrates that models with less fall/winter sea ice produce larger HFLUX. Increased HFLUX is supported by stronger air–sea temperature gradients (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8b</a>) that are maintained by the atmospheric circulation through advection.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inter-model differences in sea ice retreat regions have non-local effects through the atmospheric circulation. Increased HFLUX warms, moistens, and produces clouds locally, increasing LWDN, deepening the OML, and contributing to a delayed fall sea ice freeze-up. The influence of local HFLUX changes on the Arctic-wide LWCS requires the atmospheric circulation to disperse this energy. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c, d</a> shows a statistically significant linear regression slope between model fall/winter HFLUX PTC in the Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas and the spatial pattern of ΔLWCS; models with a larger magnitude fall/winter HFLUX PTC in sea ice retreat regions generate a larger Arctic-wide LWCS PTC. Comparing Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c, d</a> indicates a larger Arctic-wide LWCS PTC due to ΔHFLUX in the Beaufort-Chukchi Seas, suggesting that the atmospheric circulation is more sensitive to a perturbation in this region. The anti-correlation between ΔOHF
  <sub>SEASONAL</sub> and ΔAPHT (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>) suggests that the inter-model differences in how this energy is dispersed are not from the large-scale circulation, but due to the local circulation. We infer that local atmospheric circulation differences contribute to the inter-model spread in AA by influencing how energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions is dispersed. Burt et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> hypothesize a possible mechanism whereby reduced fall/winter sea ice induces a thermal contrast between the Arctic Ocean and the colder Arctic continents driving a circulation response, termed a shallow winter monsoon, promoting stronger HFLUX.
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">OML depth modulates the seasonal energy transfer and can impact the inter-model spread in AA. Eight CMIP5 models that archived OML depth show very large inter-model differences in the relationships between OML depth, SIC, and HFLUX in Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas regions. A deeper OML contains a higher heat capacity supporting larger HFLUX and less sea ice (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>). Moreover, the average OML depth in the Barents/Kara Seas region ranges from 13 to 95 m in fall. Motivated by this inter-model spread and the relationship in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>, we hypothesized that the OML depth influences the inter-model spread in AA by modulating the seasonal energy transfer. However, we found no correlation between the mean state OML depth or its change with AA. The lack of correlation may indicate a bias in the model representation of OML dynamics, such as the known bias in upper ocean vertical mixing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>. Despite the lack of correlation, this range of OML depth significantly influences the ability of the ocean to store energy and modulate surface turbulent fluxes, sea ice variability, and the atmospheric circulation. Therefore, an improved understanding of the causes and consequences of the inter-model spread in OML depth and its relationship with sea ice and surface turbulent fluxes is needed.
