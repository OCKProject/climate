  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> illustrates AA using the normalized temperature change—hereafter, amplification factor—defined as the ratio between the 1° zonally-averaged temperature change to global temperature change. All models simulate surface-based warming—at least 1.5 times global average warming—extending into the lower troposphere poleward of 75°N (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The solid black line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> represents the ensemble mean amplification factor, which exceeds 2.5 at the pole. CMIP5 models also simulate a similar seasonality of AA (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, inset) with minimum warming (amplification factor &lt; 1) in summer and maximum warming in fall and winter (amplification factor &gt;2). Despite unanimous agreement in the existence of AA, models disagree on the magnitude and spatial characteristics.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inter-model differences in projected Arctic warming exceed those for any other latitude. The Arctic domain (defined as 60°–90°N) shows increasing model differences at more northerly latitudes, approaching an amplification factor spread of 1.6–3.6 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). The dashed black line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a> represents the ratio between the 1° zonally-averaged inter-model standard deviation in temperature change to the global inter-model standard deviation—a measure of inter-model spread. This ratio approaches four times the global average moving poleward. The seasonal cycle of AA (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, inset) shows the largest model spread in winter (amplification factor between 2 and 4) and smallest in summer (amplification factor between 0.5 and 1.25).

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arctic warming projections display stark regional contrasts (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) where sea ice retreat regions exhibit the greatest warming and possess the largest model disagreement. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the annual and seasonal ensemble mean temperature and sea ice concentration (SIC) changes and the corresponding standard deviations across the ensemble. The Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas regions (see map, Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) exhibit the largest projected warming and sea ice loss; wintertime temperature projections exceed +20 K in both regions. The central Arctic Ocean shows the largest seasonality of the temperature response, warming by 15–20 K in fall/winter and less than 5 K in spring/summer. During all seasons, the smallest temperature changes between 1–4 K occur in the sea ice-free ocean regions of the North Atlantic, Norwegian Sea, and Davis Strait due to small surface energy budget changes consistent with reductions in ocean heat transport

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial warming pattern varies significantly between models; some show larger temperature increases over the central Arctic Ocean and others show the greatest warming in regions of the largest sea ice loss. In general, the inter-model spread is greatest in the sea ice retreat regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e–h</a>), particularly the Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas.
