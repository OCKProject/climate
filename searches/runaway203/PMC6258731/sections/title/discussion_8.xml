 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate that the local AA mechanism—the combined sea ice albedo and ice insulation feedbacks—significantly contributes to the inter-model spread in AA. The remote AA mechanism is shown to dampen the inter-model spread.</p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conclude that models that transfer more energy from summer to fall produce a larger AA. This seasonal energy transfer is primarily accomplished by increased absorption and storage of solar insolation in summer and increased surface turbulent fluxes in fall/winter in sea ice retreat regions. Models simulating greater reductions in summer/fall sea ice and larger fall/winter surface turbulent fluxes produce more AA. Our results suggest that the local Arctic circulation and its response contribute to the inter-model spread in AA by dispersing the energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and reinforcing the local air–sea temperature gradients. Models that more widely disperse the energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions warm more. We found significant inter-model differences in ocean mixed layer depths and its relationships with sea ice concentration and surface turbulent fluxes that modulate seasonal energy transfer, yet do not correspond to the inter-model spread in AA. This lack of correlation suggests a bias in the model representation of the ocean mixed layer with the potential to significantly impact projected AA.</p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This explanation contains familiar arguments for the processes that drive the AA inter-model spread; however, the regional picture presented should not be overlooked. The local mechanism does not occur throughout the Arctic but is focused in regions of sea ice retreat. Neglecting the regional variation in AA mechanisms paints an incomplete picture, as the inter-model spread in warming possesses a regional structure. Only after considering the regional perspective does the importance of the local atmospheric circulation to AA become clear. Our results suggest that an atmospheric circulation change local to the Arctic may be an important factor in the inter-model spread. While much of the scientific literature attempts to explain inter-model differences in AA using atmospheric-only mechanisms, we contend that a complete theory of AA and its inter-model spread must consider the atmosphere-ocean-sea ice system. Our results indicate that the principle mechanisms driving the inter-model spread in AA operate on regional not Arctic-wide scales and that reductions in the inter-model spread in projected Arctic warming require an improved process representation of atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interactions in sea ice retreat regions.</p>
