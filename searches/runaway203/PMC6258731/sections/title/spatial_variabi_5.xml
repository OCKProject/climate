  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> suggest that the spatial pattern of warming and sea ice loss alters the mid-latitude circulation. Several recent studies indicate that local feedbacks in sea ice-retreat areas accelerate warming

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shows the ensemble mean annually-averaged PTCs (
  <span class="bold">a</span>–
  <span class="bold">f</span>) and the corresponding spatial inter-model standard deviation for each PTC (
  <span class="bold">g</span>–
  <span class="bold">l</span>). The largest model differences occur in seasonal sea ice regions where small differences in sea ice extent correspond to large differences in HSTOR (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4k</a>) and HFLUX (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4l</a>). The most striking feature is the contrast between the spatial variability of PTCs and their associated inter-model spread for radiative and non-radiative feedbacks, revealing in almost every case that the spatial variation of non-radiative feedbacks (HSTOR and HFLUX) is stronger than for radiative feedbacks (SAF, CRE, SWCS, and LWCS). The spatial contours in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> show that non-radiative feedbacks vary strongly across models, in sea ice-retreat regions the HSTOR standard deviation exceeds 10.0 in the annual mean, more than seven times the domain average, and also approaches 10.0 in the Barents/Kara Seas, more than five times the domain average. Thus, the inter-model spread in Arctic warming is strongly influenced by the non-radiative feedbacks (HSTOR and HFLUX) in sea ice-retreat regions.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sorting regional PTCs by the local warming amount (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>) indicates the most important terms driving the inter-model spread. Evident from Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, regions with the most warming exhibit the largest inter-model spread between the PTCs; the only exception being summer SAF (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>). Finding the largest inter-model spread in regions that warm the most may not seem surprising; however, this result is not guaranteed. This result supports our conclusion that the mechanisms driving the inter-model spread in AA operate regionally.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual SEB terms contribute differently to the regional warming pattern. LWCS (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>) and CRE (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5e</a>) PTCs indicate a direct relationship with the regional warming pattern, where larger PTCs are found in regions of larger warming. Models overwhelmingly agree on the relationship between the regional warming and LWCS PTCs. The correspondence between regional characteristics of LWCS and warming indicates a direct local relationship exhibiting very little inter-model spread and supported by the small spatial variation in the LWCS PTC ensemble standard deviation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4i</a>). The CRE PTCs exhibit a larger inter-model spread and smaller PTCs than LWCS. Regions that warm the most show a positive year-round CRE PTC.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SAF PTCs suggest a different relationship with regional warming. The summer SAF PTCs’ dependence on regional warming (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>) resembles a ‘U-shape’—large PTCs in regions of small and large warming. Since regions that warm most in summer also warm most in fall/winter (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), this suggests that the regional warming pattern itself is partially independent of the SAF, also supported by Kim et al.

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">HSTOR (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>) and HFLUX (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>) show monotonic relationships between PTCs and regional warming. HFLUX is negative (surface cooling) in regions that warm most and positive (surface warming) in regions that warm least, the opposite holds for HSTOR. Further, HFLUX and HSTOR PTCs are very close to zero in regions of modest warming, primarily land regions. This behavior indicates that changes in HFLUX control HSTOR and the regional surface heating/cooling rates. The largest inter-model spread in HSTOR and HFLUX PTCs are found in the regions of greatest warming (sea ice retreat regions) exhibiting an inter-model range exceeding 40 K. Overall, these results suggest that the regions that warm the most exhibit a strong summer SAF and fall/winter HFLUX and HSTOR PTCs.
