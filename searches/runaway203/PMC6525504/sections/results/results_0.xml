 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated parabolic relationship between temperature and economic growth means that long-term warming will generally increase growth in cool countries and decrease growth in warm countries (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>). For example, for cooler countries such as Norway, warming moves the country-mean temperature closer to the empirical optimum (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>), resulting in cumulative economic benefits (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). In contrast, for warm countries such as India, warming moves the country-mean temperature further from the optimum (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>), resulting in cumulative losses (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result, anthropogenic climate forcing has decreased economic growth of countries in the low latitudes and increased economic growth of countries in the high latitudes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2</a>). The median losses exceed 25% for the 1961–2010 period (relative to a world without anthropogenic forcing) over large swaths of the tropics and subtropics (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>), where most countries exhibit very high likelihood of negative impacts (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2 
   <span class="italic">C</span> and 
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>), including &gt;99% likelihood (

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S1
  </span>). The median gains can be at least as large in the high latitudes, where many countries exhibit &gt;90% likelihood of positive impacts. Many countries in the middle latitudes exhibit median impacts smaller than ±10%, along with greater uncertainty in the sign of the response (particularly in the northern hemisphere). Thus, the global-scale pattern is of cool countries benefitting and warm countries suffering, with temperate countries exhibiting the greatest uncertainty.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although this global pattern could be expected from the concave structure of the empirical temperature–growth relationship (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>), such an outcome is not determined for historical climate forcing, because internal climate variability creates uncertainty in the sign and magnitude of regional temperature change (e.g., refs. 
  <a rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" href="#r21">21</a> and 
  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>). However, because the mean temperature response is positive across all land areas (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>), and because the differences in temperature change between countries (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consistent with the strong spatial correlation between temperature and GDP (
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>), we find a positive relationship between current GDP and impact from historical warming, with lower per capita GDP generally associated with more negative impacts (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>). Furthermore, at a given level of wealth, warmer countries have tended to experience more negative impacts, while cooler countries have tended to experience less negative—or in some cases more positive—impacts. Because the majority of the world’s warmest countries are poor (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3 
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>), the majority of large negative impacts have been concentrated in poor countries (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3 
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>). Likewise, because the majority of the world’s richest countries are temperate or cool, the median likelihood is that the majority of rich countries have benefited.

  <a href="#r25">*</a>–
  <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>), we also find a positive relationship between per capita cumulative emissions and impact from historical global warming (

  </span>). For example, over the 1961–2010 period, all 18 of the countries whose historical cumulative emissions are less than 10 ton CO
  <sub>2</sub> per capita have suffered negative economic impacts, with a median impact of −27% (relative to a world without anthropogenic forcing) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). Likewise, of the 36 countries whose historical emissions are between 10 and 100 ton CO
  <sub>2</sub> per capita, 34 (94%) have suffered negative economic impacts, with a median impact of −24%. In contrast, of the 19 countries whose historical emissions exceed 300 ton CO

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The net effect of these economic impacts is that country-level inequality has very likely increased as a result of global warming (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>). For example, the ratio between the top and bottom population-weighted deciles [a common measure of economic inequality (
  <a rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" href="#r9">9</a>)] has become 25% larger (5th to 95th range of −6% to +114%) during the 1961–2010 period compared with a world without global warming, with ∼90% likelihood that the ratio has increased (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). Likewise, the ratio between the top and bottom population-weighted quintiles [another common measure (
  <a rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" href="#r9">9</a>)] has become 45% larger (5th to 95th range of +10% to +99%), with ∼99% likelihood that the ratio has increased. As a result, although overall between-country inequality has decreased substantially over the past half century (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase in inequality between countries has resulted primarily from warming-induced penalties in poor countries, along with warming-induced benefits in some rich countries (
