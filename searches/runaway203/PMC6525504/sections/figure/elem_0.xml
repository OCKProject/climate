  <p>Response of temperature and per capita GDP to global warming. (
   <span class="italic">A</span>) The ensemble-mean difference in annual temperature between the CMIP5 Historical and Natural forcing experiments during the IPCC’s historical baseline period (1986–2005). (
   <span class="italic">B</span>) The annual temperature for selected countries from historical observations [black; calculated as in Burke et al. (
   <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a>)] and the world without anthropogenic climate forcing (gray). Overlaid on the country-level temperatures are the response functions containing the 10th (red), 50th (orange), and 90th (yellow) percentile temperature optima, calculated across the 1,000 temperature optima generated by the bootstrap replication of the regression. The full distribution of temperature optima from ref. 
   <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a> is shown in the gray box; as in ref. 
   <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a>, darker red colors indicate cooler temperature optima and thus greater likelihood of negative impacts from warming. (
   <span class="italic">C</span> and 
   <span class="italic">D</span>) The impact of anthropogenic climate forcing on annual economic growth rate, and accumulated impact on per capita GDP, for Norway and India.
