  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biomarkers were analyzed at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. Between 4 and 7 g freeze-dried and homogenized sediment was extracted using an accelerated solvent extractor (DIONEX, ASE200; 100 °C, 5 minutes, 1000 psi) with dichlormethane:methanol (2:1) as solvent. For quantification, internal standards, 7-hexylnonadecane, (7-HND; 0.076 µl/sample), cholesterol-d
   <sub>6</sub> (10.5 µl/sample), and squalane (2.4 µl/sample), were added before analytical treatment. Separation of the extract into fractions hydrocarbon and sterol fraction was achieved via open-column chromatography with 5 ml 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane, and 6 ml 
   <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane:ethylacetate (4:1 v/v), respectively with silica gel (SiO
   <sub>2</sub>) as stationary phase. The latter fraction was silylated with 200 µl BSTFA (bis-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacet-amide) (60 °C, 2 h).

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compound analysis was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). IP
   <sub>25</sub> was analyzed using an Agilent 7890B GC coupled to an Agilent 5977A MSD using following heating program: 60 °C (3 min), 150 °C (rate: 15 °C/min), 320 °C (rate: 10 °C/min), 320 °C (15 min isothermal). Sterols (brassicasterol, 24-methylcholesta-5,22E-dien-3β-ol; campesterol, 24-methylcholest-5-en-3β-ol; β-sitosterol, 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3β-ol; dinosterol, 4α,23,24-trimethyl-5α-cholest-22E-en-3β-ol) were analyzed using an Agilent 6850 GC (30 m HP-5MS column, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 µm film thickness) coupled to an Agilent 5975C MSD (with 70 eV constant ionization potential, ion source temperature 230 °C). The GC oven was heated as follows: 60 °C (2 min), 150 °C (rate: 15 °C/min), 320 °C (rate: 3 °C/min), 320 °C (20 min isothermal). For both analyses, helium was used as carrier gas (1 ml/min constant gas flow). The injection volume was 1 µl (splitless). The identification and quantification of the IP
   <sub>25</sub> monoene and sterols were performed by comparison of GC retention times with those of reference compounds and published mass spectra

   <span class="italic">Lycopodium clavatum</span> tablet (batch #483216) was added prior to acid treatment. Occasionally mild ultrasonic treatment was applied before sieving at 10 µm and before mounting the organic residue (including dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs) on microscope slides. Slides were then counted using a light microscope at x400 magnification along non-overlapping traverses until at least 250 specimens were counted, or until the slide was completely scanned.
