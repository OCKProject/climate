  </span>. There remains a debate on the existence of perennial or seasonal sea ice in the Late Miocene Arctic Ocean

  <span class="sup">

  </span>. While circumstantial evidence from Early Pliocene palynological and biogenic opal records suggest that sea ice might have occurred in the Iceland Sea

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>), various mechanisms may have caused sea ice occurrence in the Iceland Sea. One important candidate causing sea ice to occur in the Iceland Sea is the East Greenland Current (EGC), which is today the main exporter of sea ice laden, lower salinity Arctic waters from the Arctic Ocean into the Nordic Seas (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). This surface current emerged in the Early Pliocene around 4.5 Ma
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, possibly bringing cool, fresher Arctic water and sea ice southward along the East Greenland coast into the Iceland Sea. Another mechanism for increasing sea ice formation in the Arctic is presented in the theory of ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>, which links the Early Pliocene closure/shoaling of the Central American Seaway (CAS; ~4.5 Ma) to intensified glaciations in the Northern Hemisphere. While the current consensus is that the CAS closure/shoaling was not a direct trigger for the glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere around 2.7 Ma (e.g. ref.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>), the proposed mechanism predicts the formation of sea ice in the Pliocene Arctic Ocean following enhanced northward heat and moisture supply in the North Atlantic region. This atmospheric moisture is transported via the westerlies to Eurasia, ensuring precipitation that feeds the northward draining Siberian rivers. These rivers then deliver more fresh water to the Arctic Ocean and thereby facilitate sea ice formation. Crucial evidence supporting freshening of the surface waters in the Russian Arctic is still lacking, but paleoclimatic records from the North Atlantic
