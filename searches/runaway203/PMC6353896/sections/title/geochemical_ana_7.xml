 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biomarkers were analyzed at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. Between 4 and 7 g freeze-dried and homogenized sediment was extracted using an accelerated solvent extractor (DIONEX, ASE200; 100 °C, 5 minutes, 1000 psi) with dichlormethane:methanol (2:1) as solvent. For quantification, internal standards, 7-hexylnonadecane, (7-HND; 0.076 µl/sample), cholesterol-d
  <sub>6</sub> (10.5 µl/sample), and squalane (2.4 µl/sample), were added before analytical treatment. Separation of the extract into fractions hydrocarbon and sterol fraction was achieved via open-column chromatography with 5 ml 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane, and 6 ml 
  <span class="italic">n</span>-hexane:ethylacetate (4:1 v/v), respectively with silica gel (SiO
  <sub>2</sub>) as stationary phase. The latter fraction was silylated with 200 µl BSTFA (bis-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacet-amide) (60 °C, 2 h).

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compound analysis was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). IP
  <sub>25</sub> was analyzed using an Agilent 7890B GC coupled to an Agilent 5977A MSD using following heating program: 60 °C (3 min), 150 °C (rate: 15 °C/min), 320 °C (rate: 10 °C/min), 320 °C (15 min isothermal). Sterols (brassicasterol, 24-methylcholesta-5,22E-dien-3β-ol; campesterol, 24-methylcholest-5-en-3β-ol; β-sitosterol, 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3β-ol; dinosterol, 4α,23,24-trimethyl-5α-cholest-22E-en-3β-ol) were analyzed using an Agilent 6850 GC (30 m HP-5MS column, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 µm film thickness) coupled to an Agilent 5975C MSD (with 70 eV constant ionization potential, ion source temperature 230 °C). The GC oven was heated as follows: 60 °C (2 min), 150 °C (rate: 15 °C/min), 320 °C (rate: 3 °C/min), 320 °C (20 min isothermal). For both analyses, helium was used as carrier gas (1 ml/min constant gas flow). The injection volume was 1 µl (splitless). The identification and quantification of the IP
  <sub>25</sub> monoene and sterols were performed by comparison of GC retention times with those of reference compounds and published mass spectra
