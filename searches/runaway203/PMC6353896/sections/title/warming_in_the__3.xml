 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An extended sea ice cover (high IP
  <sub>25</sub> and low brassicasterol) alternated with ice edge conditions (high IP
  <sub>25</sub> and high brassicasterol) in the Iceland Sea between 4.0 and 3.7 Ma (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2B</a>; Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1A</a>). Dinoflagellate cyst samples are either barren or show very low concentrations during this interval indicating limited productivity (Fig.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span> and hence possibly harsh conditions due to sea ice presence and/orlow SSTs. Indeed, Iceland Sea summer SSTs decreased further from ~8 to 3 °C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span> within this interval (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2D</a>), yet summers largely remained sea ice-free because alkenone production still occurred. At Yermak Plateau ODP Hole 910C, seasonal sea ice appeared shortly after 4.0 Ma

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, while at ODP Hole 911A, a single sample around 3.8 Ma with high IP
  <sub>25</sub> and low brassicasterol concentrations suggests an extended sea ice cover. One sample in ODP Hole 911A could indicate a permanent sea ice cover around 3.5 Ma (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2C</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1B</a>), but taking the data from ODP Hole 910C into account, a seasonally sea ice covered Yermak Plateau seems more likely.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>, namely the northward heat (and associated moisture) transport in the North Atlantic and the enhanced formation of sea ice in the Arctic. Essential for enhanced sea ice formation is a freshening of the Arctic Ocean. It was proposed that the moisture source for this freshening originates from increased northward heat and moisture transport in the North Atlantic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. This is evident in the reconstructed high SSTs in the eastern North Atlantic

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> and Norwegian Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> around 4.0 Ma (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2D</a>). There is currently no corroborating data that atmospheric moisture was consequently transported via the westerlies from the Atlantic region to the Eurasian continent where it fed northward-draining rivers, which ultimately freshened the Arctic Ocean to promote sea ice formation. However, our new data do provide evidence that shortly after the rapid temperature increase in the eastern North Atlantic and Norwegian Sea, a major expansion of sea ice cover occurred in the Arctic and extended to the Fram Strait and the Iceland Sea (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2B, 2C</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3C</a>). Further testing of this theory will require gathering data that documents the moisture transport to Siberia, the freshening of the Arctic Ocean via Siberian rivers and consequent sea ice formation.
