  <span class="italic">Lycopodium clavatum</span> tablet (batch #483216) was added prior to acid treatment. Occasionally mild ultrasonic treatment was applied before sieving at 10 µm and before mounting the organic residue (including dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs) on microscope slides. Slides were then counted using a light microscope at x400 magnification along non-overlapping traverses until at least 250 specimens were counted, or until the slide was completely scanned.
