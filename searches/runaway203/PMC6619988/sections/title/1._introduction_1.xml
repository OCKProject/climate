 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The topics of climate change and renewable energy are often linked in policy discussions and scientific analysis. Mitigation of increasingly severe impacts from anthropogenic climate change (ACC) will require steep reductions in fossil fuel burning, and corresponding shifts to energy from renewable sources that produce less greenhouse gases—such as electricity generated by wind, solar or tidal power. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions therefore becomes a key argument favoring renewable-energy development.[
  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref001">1</a>] It is not the only argument, however. Renewable energy offers economic advantages including lower costs as well as new jobs, and income to producers or landowners.[

  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref004">4</a>] Compared with coal or oil, it tends to generate less pollution of land, air and water. Decentralized renewable energy such as rooftop solar also promises some degree of consumer independence. These non-greenhouse arguments appeal to many of the same people concerned about climate change, but they can also reach beyond, to some who reject the reality of ACC. At the same time, the perceived impacts of large-scale energy developments such as wind farms can inspire local opposition from people who otherwise might support action on climate change.[

  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref010">10</a>] Thus, renewable energy has potentially broader appeal, but sometimes also broader-based opposition, compared with public concern about climate change.

  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref012">12</a>] Among US political leaders and public, on the other hand, partisan divisions remain wide. [
  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref013">13</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref014">14</a>][

  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref016">16</a>]. Conservatives are much less likely than moderates or liberals to agree with scientists that ACC is occurring, or that anything should be done to slow it down. The association between climate-change views and sociopolitical identity is so strong, statistically, that climate-change questions might effectively serve as proxies for political identity itself.[
  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref017">17</a>] Renewable-energy opinions also correlate with sociopolitical identity, but that relationship is somewhat weaker for several reasons. Renewable-energy cost, employment or independence arguments appeal to some conservatives; and large-scale energy developments such as wind farms may stir resistance focused on local impacts, regardless of views about climate. Moreover, climate change has been most intensively targeted for opposition by conservative media and elites.[

  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref019">19</a>] Appealing to politically mixed audiences, advocates for renewable energy often choose to emphasize cost, employment, income or energy-independence benefits, downplaying those related to climate.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How similar or different are the social bases of support for renewable-energy development, compared with those for concern about climate change? Is public opinion shifting similarly on both topics? In a recent paper we explored these questions using data from four US survey projects—three regional and one national in scope. The nationwide survey took place in 2016, with stages just before and after the presidential elections. The three regional surveys involve places with recent and controversial wind energy developments, as described by Hamilton et al.[
  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref023">23</a>] One of the regional surveys, in the North Country of northern New England, occurred in summer of 2017. The other two regional projects, in northeast Oregon and New Hampshire, each involved a series of surveys carried out over multiple years—2011 to 2015 in Oregon, and 2010 (climate) or 2012 (renewable energy) to 2017 in New Hampshire.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we elaborate earlier analyses, drawing on new data (more than 3,000 additional interviews) that extend the Oregon and New Hampshire timelines through fall 2018. We also draw on a larger set of historical data from New Hampshire, so the total now exceeds 18,000 interviews for some analyses. Extended timelines broadly confirm earlier results, while enabling new analyses including tests for public-opinion impacts from the disastrous hurricane seasons of 2017 and 2018, detailed breakdowns that find similarities in the 2018 social profiles of renewable-energy and climate views in two different regions, comparisons of trend lines for different age groups across each issue and each region, and more precise estimates of interactions as well as distinct age and trend effects.</p>
