 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strimling et al., analyzing responses to “moral issue” questions on the US General Social Survey over the past 40 years, find a common theoretical explanation that fits divergent trends.[
  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref044">44</a>] Public opinion has become more favorable toward positions whose moral foundations involve fairness and harm, values favored by liberals and conservatives alike. Opinion has not moved as much on issues whose moral foundations involve authority, loyalty or purity, values favored mainly by conservatives. This moral-issue analysis does not address environmental, economic or policy-effectiveness issues, which have central importance for energy and climate. Fairness and harm values have also been prominent in discourse on energy and climate, however, so the Strimling et al. moral dynamic might contribute to the upward trends observed in our study as well.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The strong effect sociopolitical identity exerts on US public opinion about climate change is well known, and confirmed once again here. Despite divergence in the rationales regarding climate and renewable-energy development, we see that sociopolitical identity has major impacts on energy views too—but those impacts are somewhat weaker. The education×politics interaction effect, describing a partisan gap that widens with education, appears less pronounced on renewable energy as well. These muted partisan divisions indicate that renewable-energy views are less closely bound to sociopolitical identity, in public opinion as in elite communication such as the campaigns against climate science.[

  <a rid="pone.0217608.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217608.ref019">19</a>] Substantively, some conservatives who reject the scientific consensus on climate change nevertheless embrace renewable energy on other grounds, such as employment or income benefits, or contributions to energy independence. At the same time, some moderates or liberals, who agree in principle on the need for greenhouse gas reductions, oppose developments such as wind farms that will have local impacts. Expansion of low-carbon renewable energy remains an essential step for climate-change mitigation, but might be motivated by different arguments in some contexts, and while also requiring more local efforts at public engagement—as renewable-energy proponents tend to be well aware.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results include several new findings as well: no visible impacts on public opinion from five disastrous hurricanes that struck the US in just two seasons, 2017 and 2018; and detailed correspondences between the social bases of renewable energy support, and of ACC acceptance, across two very different US regions. Those results highlight stability, but other findings hint at future change. First, there are consistent age effects. In the most recent surveys more than 90 percent of New Hampshire respondents age 18 to 29 favor renewable energy, as do 77 percent in northeast Oregon. Those fractions are 13 or 17 points higher than they are among people over age 65. The generation gap is even wider (16 or 21 points) regarding climate change. Age has significant positive effects on both climate and energy views even after controlling for sex, education, political identification and year of survey. Assuming no change in people’s individual views, gradual cohort replacement could raise public acceptance of renewable energy and other climate-change mitigation steps. If voter participation rates among young adults rise, as some observers expect, the balance might shift more quickly.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A separate result is that, over the period of observation, support for renewable energy and acceptance of anthropogenic climate change have been gradually rising. For each series in both datasets, the increase exceeds 10 percentage points, with renewable energy climbing at slightly faster rates than climate. It is worth noting that these trends are established in models that already account for respondent age, so they do not reflect possible cohort shifts noted above. By the same token, the age effects estimated in those models are independent of overall trends. We see distinct age and temporal patterns in terms of separate upward trends within each age group. These trends add further reason, besides the certainty of cohort replacement and the possibility of more voting by young adults, to think that public support for action on these issues will grow.</p>
