  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The determination of the period that corresponds to the thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C rise in temperature is different under different models or different RCP scenarios (RCP4.5, 6.5 and 8.5). This determination is also closely dependent on the definition of the pre-industrial period. The periods 1861–1880, 1861–1900 and 1871–1900 have all been used as reference periods for the climate state in pre-industrial times in previous studies

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
   </span>. Considering the difference in start times for the historical simulations in the various models, the average of 1861–1880 was used as the reference period in the present study, which is consistent with the approach of the IPCC
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span>. The MME indicates that the global average surface temperature during the pre-industrial period was approximately 14.2 °C. The data used for the analysis were the monthly surface temperature datasets from the 17 CMIP5 global climate models. Most of the models are able to reproduce the increase in surface temperature over the past 50 to 100 years
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
   </span>, and the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.71 between 12 such models and Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Time-Series (TS, version 3.21)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span>. Because surface temperature does not necessarily continue to immediately rise once it reaches a threshold, we define the year that the global mean surface temperature reaches the 1.5 °C or and 2.0 °C threshold as follows: (1) the first year that reaches the threshold in ascending order of time and (2) the first year that reaches the threshold and is maintained for five consecutive years, similar to the approach of Zhang 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> present the statistical results from individual models. The results indicate the time that the global mean surface temperature reaches the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds. The results also clearly show that the simulation time in different RCP scenarios taken to reach the thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C under different RCP scenarios are quite different from one another, especially for RCP2.6. Since each model in CMIP5 represents a possible future, some models (such as NorESM1-M in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) are not excluded in this study. The results shown in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> also show that over half of the models would not reach the 2 °C threshold in the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> century. Because the data in most of the RCPs cover the period of 2006–2100, years beyond 2100 are marked as 2100, which causes the maximum, median and upper quartiles to overlap. The results of the MME (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) show that the threshold of 1.5 °C occurs in 2027, 2026 and 2023, respectively, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. However, the global mean surface temperature under RCP2.6 does not reach the 2 °C threshold until the end of the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> century and only reaches about 1.9 °C by 2100. Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the 2 °C threshold is reached in 2046 and 2037, respectively, which agrees with previous studies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. We note clear differences in the timing of the 2 °C threshold being reached under the three RCPs. For instance, the stronger the radiation force, the sooner the threshold of 2 °C is reached, although this relationship is not evident for the 1.5 °C threshold in these RCPs. A possible reason for this observation is that the present global mean surface temperature is close to the threshold of the 1.5 °C scenario, and radiation has a delayed effect on surface temperature. Consequently, there is little difference between radiative forcing and the year in which global average surface temperature rises to 1.5 °C.

Comparing the permafrost extent estimated by the two datasets, the estimations based on the MME showed a better performance in the northern islands of North America than the estimations based on the reanalysis data. However, the estimations based on the MME underestimate the permafrost in southern North America, which may be related to the difference in permafrost extent between the two datasets.

Relative to the historical period, these represent reductions in permafrost extent of 23.58%, 24.10% and 25.55%, respectively. However, uncertainty is evident because of the large discrepancies among the models’ performance on temperature simulation over cold regions. When the global mean surface temperature reaches the 2 °C threshold, permafrost areas in the NH would be 10.38 × 10

   <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively, in RCP4.5 (2046–2055) and RCP8.5 (2037–2046). These would, respectively, constitute reductions relative to the historical period of 36.08% and 37.62%, respectively, for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Compared to the historical period, the most obvious degradation occurs in northern Mongolia and southern Russia, and the southern permafrost boundary moves northwards by about 3° to 4° between the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds under RCP4.5. It must be noted that the global mean surface temperature under RCP2.6 does not rise by 2 °C until the end of the 21

The projected reductions in permafrost area under the three RCPs vary between 23% and 26% at the 1.5 °C threshold and range from 36% to 38% at the 2.0 °C threshold.
