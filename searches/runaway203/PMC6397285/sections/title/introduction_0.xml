 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frozen ground is composed of various ice-rich soils and rocks, which are the products of lithosphere–soil–atmosphere interactions during the process of material exchange. Permafrost is a key component of the cryosphere, which occupies around a quarter of the Earth’s land area in the Northern Hemisphere

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Because of its high sensitivity to, and feedback relationship with, the climate, permafrost plays a critical role as an indicator of global climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. As the global surface temperature has continued to rise over the recent decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, the risk of permafrost degradation has also increased. The degradation of the permafrost may affect the climate system via many factors such as local ecological balance, hydrological processes, energy exchange and the carbon cycle, as well as the engineering infrastructure in cold regions and even extreme weather events

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the last 100 years, global climate has warmed distinctly, with the global surface temperature increasing by 0.74 °C ± 0.18 °C between 1906 and 2005
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. In particular, over the past 30 years, the Earth has experienced a period of rapid warming. The increase in observed global average surface temperature between 1880 and 2012 was 0.85 (0.65–1.06) °C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. However, the magnitude of warming shows remarkable regional differences. Regions of significant warming include the high latitudes of the NH, including Arctic and high-elevation areas such as the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. Warming in these areas is the most significant over this period, reaching up to 2.5 °C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. Global warming is naturally amplified in the Arctic, where a slight increase in mean annual air temperature can result in a change of state for large regions of frozen ground, in terms of both active layer thickness and area

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global warming may lead to a reduction in the extent and volume of the cryosphere, which will, in turn, have a positive feedback effect on warming

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Under the influence of global warming, permafrost temperature has evidently shown an increasing trend since 1980 in most parts of the NH
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. However, because of the spatial differences found in climate change itself, as well as the heterogeneity of soil properties, there remain regional differences in soil temperatures, permafrost boundaries and active layer thicknesses (ALT)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. A number of studies have reported these regional variations in the effects of global warming on the permafrost layer. For example, the temperature at a depth of 20 m in the permafrost has increased at a rate of 0.13 °C/a in northern Alaska since the 1980s
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. The temperature at a depth of 6 m in the permafrost increased by an amount between 0.12 °C and 0.67 °C on the high-altitude Qinghai–Tibet Plateau over the period 1996–2006
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. In northern Europe, permafrost temperature increased by an amount between 0.3 °C and 2 °C between 1971 and 2010
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Degradation of the permafrost has also been observed in many other regions, especially in Siberia, Sweden, Canada and Alaska
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. In Russia’s Vorkuta region, a permafrost layer 10 to 15 m thick melted completely between 1975 and 2005, and the southern limit of the permafrost shifted 80 km northwards
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. ALT deepened by approximately 20 cm in Russia between 1956 and 1990
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. The lower altitudinal limit of mountain permafrost has risen by 25 m over the last 30 years at Xidatan in the interior of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ongoing increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is resulting in frequent occurrences of extreme weather and climate events, glacier retreat, sea level rise and deteriorating human health. Therefore, a 2 °C increase in global surface temperature from pre-industrial levels is considered to be a risk-level threshold
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Consequently, if the rise in global surface temperature cannot be restricted to 2 °C, human society will probably face major climate-related disasters induced by global warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. The Paris Climate Agreement (2015) proposed a goal of reducing greenhouse gas levels and emphasised that global mean surface temperature increases should be restricted to 2 °C, or even 1.5 °C, compared to the pre-industrial level. Predicting the response of various components of the Earth’s system to a temperature rise of 2 °C has received much attention

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. As a modulator of the Earth’s climate, the cryosphere is a particularly crucial component. Anisimov and Nelson
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> investigated permafrost distribution in the NH using a frost index under a global mean temperature rise of 2 °C and doubling of CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels. Their projected permafrost extent was 18.34 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span>, 18.74 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> and 19.17 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively, as obtained using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) model and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) model. The near-surface permafrost area in the NH has been estimated using Community Climate System Model Version 4 (CCSM4), revealing that, the permafrost areas during the 2030–2049 period would be 9.3 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span>, 9.0 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span>, 8.1 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> and 8.7 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. Slater and Lawence
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span> compared the permafrost extent estimated by soil temperature and surface frost index in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. Their results show that permafrost estimation based on CMIP5 models has evident uncertainty, which is closely related to the different structure and parameterisations in different land surface models (LSMs). Furthermore, current models still have limitations in representing subgrid-scale permafrost distribution (e.g. sporadic and isolated permafrost) because of parameterisation uncertainty regarding the occurrence of soil freeze or thaw in LSMs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Koven 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span> suggested that the model differences can be traced to the differences in the coupling between either near-surface air and shallow soil temperatures or shallow and deeper (1 m) soil temperatures. Wang 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> suggested that the permafrost over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau will significantly degrade in the Bayan Har Mountains and Tanggula Mountains by 2050 under the high-emission scenario. Although previous studies have demonstrated that the permafrost will degrade because of temperature rises caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the likely extent of permafrost degradation under a particular risk-level threshold remains to be determined.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have mainly focused on the permafrost projection in the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century in different RCP scenarios. However, the relation between future permafrost extent and temperature rise at a specified threshold is still not fully addressed. This study focuses on what degree or how large in extent would the permafrost degradation response be to global warming under global temperature rise at risk-level thresholds of 1.5 °C, perhaps a maximum threshold of 2 °C. This is an important issue to the global community and is helpful for making adaptation and countermeasure policies.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To more objectively estimate permafrost distribution over the Northern Hemisphere, the Kudryavtsev method
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span> and the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) were applied to the 17 CMIP5 global climate models to project the variability of NH permafrost extent when surface temperatures reach thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. The validation of the periods that correspond to thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C is described in Section 2. Section 3 considers the permafrost area over the NH simulated by the CMIP5 models, including the present-day permafrost area and future permafrost area projected under the scenarios of 1.5 °C and 2 °C of temperature increase. Finally, Section 4 summarises key findings. The specific datasets and methods used in this study are described in the Methods section.
