 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study used data from 17 CMIP5 models to identify the period corresponding to thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C rises in temperature above pre-industrial levels and estimated the permafrost area and rate of reduction in the NH using the Kudryavtsev method under present and future climate scenarios. The main conclusions of this study are presented below.</p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MME analysis showed that the year in which the 1.5 °C rise in global mean surface temperature would be reached would be 2027, 2026 and 2023, respectively, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. However, under RCP2.6, the global mean surface temperature would not reach the 2 °C threshold during the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century, reaching only about 1.9 °C by 2100. Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the 2 °C threshold is reached around the middle of the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century (2046 and 2037, respectively). Low radiative forcing would slow the temperature increase.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under continuous global warming from the 1.5 °C threshold to the 2 °C threshold, the projected southern permafrost boundary shifts 1° to 4° northwards under three RCPs. Compared with the historical period (1986–2005), the most significant degradation occurs in northern Mongolia and southern Russia. Under RCP2.6, the extent of permafrost remains almost stablely existed. When the global mean surface temperature reaches the 1.5 °C threshold, the projected permafrost area in the Northern Hemisphere is about 12.81 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. By the end of the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century, the permafrost extent in the Northern Hemisphere is about 12.65 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. If the global economy keeps increasing at the current rate (e.g. under RCP4.5), the permafrost areas corresponding to the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds, respectively, are 12.33 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> and 10.38 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. This represents a decrease of 1.95 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, or 15.8%, between the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds. If human society does not take any action to decrease emissions (e.g. under RCP8.5), the degradation of the permafrost is more significant, showing permafrost areas corresponding to the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds, respectively, of 12.09 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> and 10.13 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. This represents a decrease of 1.96 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, or about 16.2%, between the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds. Relative to the historical period (1986–2005), the permafrost area at the 1.5 °C threshold decreases by 23.58%, 24.1% and 25.55% under the three RCPs. For the 2 °C threshold, increased radiative forcing leads to a greater decline in permafrost area, showing decreases of 22.11%, 36.08% and 37.62%, respectively, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is inevitable that the reduction in permafrost area will lead to a change in surface energy balance and consequently to changes in land–atmosphere interactions that will probably generate ongoing environmental deterioration and unpredictable changes to the climate. However, the results of this study seem slightly hopeful for the permafrost environment, since two-thirds of permafrost will remain under RCP8.5 (2037–2046) at a threshold of 2 °C rise, some permafrost will even remain in some of the Earth’s colder areas until the end of the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century

  </span>. It should be noted that the results of this study do not imply that regions of seasonal frozen ground will expand because of higher winter temperatures. Moreover, although we adopted the results of MME and considered vegetation and soil moisture variability, uncertainties still remain, such as the use of CMIP5 data and lack of precise observations of the soil type and organic matter.
