      <p>The ability to forecast sea ice (both extent and thickness) and weather conditions
         are the major factors when it comes to safe marine transportation in the Arctic Ocean.
         This paper presents findings focusing on sea ice and weather prediction in the Arctic
         Ocean for navigation purposes, in particular along the Northeast Passage. Based on
         comparison with the observed sea ice concentrations for validation, the best performing
         Earth system models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) program
         (CMIP5â€”Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5) were selected to provide ranges
         of potential future sea ice conditions. Our results showed that, despite a general
         tendency toward less sea ice cover in summer, internal variability will still be large
         and shipping along the Northeast Passage might still be hampered by sea ice blocking
         narrow passages. This will make sea ice forecasts on shorter time and space scales
         and Arctic weather prediction even more important.
