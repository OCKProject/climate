         <p>Sea ice conditions along the NEP. The upper left panel illustrates the path of the
            NEP with the distance traveled from Northern Norway to the Bering Strait in color
            code. The remaining three panels illustrate model projections of the daily sea ice
            thickness in 2040 for each of the three ensemble members of DEXP8.5 along this path.
            The vertical axis shows time (month), and the horizontal axis shows the distance along
            the NEP from the starting point in Northern Norway (left) to the Bering Strait (right)
