         <p>PIOMAS net sea ice production over the past 35 years computed from sea ice growth
            minus sea ice melt every year (i.e., the black curve minus the green curve in Fig. 
            <a>2</a>). The cyan curve represents the 5-year running mean values. The red curve really
            demonstrates the importance of the sea ice volume interannual variability superimposed
            over the long-term trend (cyan curve). Results cover the entire northern hemisphere
            (northern hemisphere defined as encompassing Arctic and Subarctic sea ice-covered
            regions)
