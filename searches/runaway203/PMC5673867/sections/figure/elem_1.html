         <p>PIOMAS-simulated April (winter/blue) and September (summer/red) Arctic sea ice volume
            for the past 35 years. The green curve indicates the amount of sea ice melting between
            April and September each year. The black curve indicates the amount of sea ice freezing
            between September and April the following year. Results cover the entire northern
            hemisphere (northern hemisphere defined as encompassing Arctic and Subarctic sea ice-covered
            regions)
