  <p>Comparison between PIOMAS sea ice volume in April each year over the past 35 years and sea ice volume based on Freezing Degree Days (FDD) using either a linear or a quadratic approximation from which sea ice volume production can be estimated. Sea ice volume is calculated using the spatial distribution of FDD based on ERA-Interim 2-m air temperature reanalysis data covering the whole northern hemisphere</p>
