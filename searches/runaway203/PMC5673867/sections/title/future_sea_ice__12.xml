 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to helping improve the understanding and prediction of the coupled climate system, model simulations in the framework of ACCESS have been used to provide guidance on what range of future sea ice conditions may be encountered in areas where it affects human activities, such as shipping. Here we make use of the DEXP8.5 experiment with finer spatial resolution, zooming into the regions most relevant for long-distance shipping in the Arctic. We focus on the sea ice conditions in near-coastal areas and along potential shipping routes, in terms of sea ice concentration, thickness, and the length of periods with ice conditions that are favorable for shipping. As different ship types have different limits regarding their capability to navigate in different sea ice thickness and concentration conditions, we analyze the number of days for which sea ice thickness (sit) and sea ice concentration (sic) fall below specific thresholds relevant for shipping. The analysis is based on daily mean sic and sit from experiment DEXP8.5. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> shows the number of days per year below these thresholds as an ensemble mean over the period 2026–2040. The model experiment suggests that there will be a considerable lengthening of the navigable season. For example, along the NEP in the period 2015–2040 there are more than 40 days with sic below 40% and sit below 0.5 m
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6" href="#Fn6">6</a> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). However, the number of days is the sum of all ‘low ice condition’ days, which are not necessarily taking place in a row, so to allow easy passage.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative view on the ice conditions as they are relevant for shipping is presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>. It shows the daily sea ice thickness of DEXP8.5 for each ensemble member along the NEP for the year 2040. The graphs exemplify that despite the largely ice-free passage in each of the three ensemble runs over an extended period of one to three months in summer, there may be still blockages at key locations. Those are the Vilkitsky (km 2600) and the Dmitry–Laptev Strait (km 5000), in or east of which even thin and mobile ice may pile up or be stacked to block the passage. While it is unclear how likely such blockages will be in a future Arctic, Gerdes and Köberle (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2007</a>) speculated that persistent large-scale wind patterns in the Earth system models may lead to such situations, too, and it is unclear how realistic those might be. The results presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> also show the large internal variability in the system, leading to different realizations of the sea ice situation despite the same forcing for the three ensemble members. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows a different way to understand the sea ice development along the NEP, by presenting the number of days with sic and sit being below a certain threshold along the entire NEP contrasting the period 2006–2020 with 2026–2040. The mean number of days with «low ice conditions» as well as the ensemble spread increases considerably for the later time period. The «low ice» period starts one month earlier and ends one month later in the later time period. Moreover, the length of the period with sit &lt; 1.5 m increases by four months, lasting from May to February.

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model results and the analysis in terms of parameters relevant for shipping suggest that despite an overall increase of navigability in the Arctic, still a lot of variability of sea ice cover needs to be taken into account over the coming decades. This will make a reliable weather forecast, which is also the prerequisite for a short-term sea ice prediction, even more important.</p>
