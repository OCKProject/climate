 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the main objectives of ACCESS concerned the future evolution of Arctic sea ice concentration and thickness, in particular in areas of potentially increased human activities in future, such as along shipping routes. However, the attempt to project this development into the future faces large uncertainties such as the actual development of future greenhouse gas emissions, the unavoidable uncertainties due to natural variability and errors of the Earth system models, our only tools to attempt a projection of the climate system development (e.g., Hawkins and Sutton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" href="#CR200">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the course of the activities of the IPCC process for the most recent report (CMIP5), more than 30 global Earth system models were used to project the development of the global climate, assuming a set of different scenarios for the potential future release of greenhouse gases (Taylor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2012</a>).
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" href="#Fn1">1</a> For the Arctic regions, these models provide a large range of possible future environments, part of which may be due to model errors. This leads to the question of which of these simulations can be deemed the most realistic. A way to attempt at an answer is to subsample these model experiments to only make use of those that perform the best in comparison with observed historical data, in our case with sea ice observations. Since sea ice concentration derived from satellites provides relatively long, large-scale ‘observational’ record, it has been used here to select CMIP5 models. A detailed description of the selection process can be found in the 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0951-5" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Electronic supplementary material</span>. In our studies, we make use of the four best performing model experiments to provide information on the possible range of sea ice extending for the next three decades 2010–2040 (for further information, see Riemann-Campe et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2014</a>; Petrick et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2017</a>). However, the spatial resolution of the Earth system models is too coarse for the purpose of evaluating near-coastal shipping routes such as the NEP (see 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0951-5" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">supplementary material</span> for additional information) and we need to derive information on finer spatial scales. Previous studies which analyzed sea ice along shipping routes based on CMIP5 model results derived projections on finer spatial scales by re-gridding the original coarser CMIP5 model grids (e.g., Laliberte et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2016</a>; Khon et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2017</a>) or they applied a statistical bias correction method to overcome the problematic coarse resolution (Melia et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2016</a>). While such approaches have the advantage of allowing the analysis of a large number of experiments, they are unable to create information at spatial scales below the original CMIP5 model resolution, as for example the conditions in narrow straits. Here we apply a different approach using a ‘dynamical downscaling’: we use the atmospheric results from ensemble simulations of the best performing CMIP5 model, the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology’s Earth system model (MPI-ESM-LR; Notz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2013</a>), to drive a regional, coupled sea ice and ocean model with a higher spatial resolution for a downscaling experiment (DEXP8.5) covering a historic period and the upcoming decades (1950–2040).
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" href="#Fn2">2</a> In contrast to the studies mentioned above, this approach offers the advantage of fully resolved physics on the finer grid, though at the price of much higher effort, reducing the number of possible experiments.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So how does the development of Arctic sea ice differ between the different model experiments: the regional MITgcm, which is used for the downscaling experiment DEXP8.5, and the MPI-ESM-LR, which had been picked as the best performing of the CMIP5 models in terms of sea ice extent? In addition to the spatial resolution, the Earth system model MPI-ESM-LR and the regional downscaling model used for the experiment DEXP8.5 differ in a number of parameterizations of physical processes, which also affects the simulation of sea ice concentration, extent, and thickness. Here we find that regional downscaling model in DEXP8.5 produces thicker sea ice than the MPI-ESM-LR, leading to an overall higher sea ice volume. Integrated sea ice volume is shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> for both MPI-ESM-LR and DEXP8.5. Since observations of sea ice volume (or thickness for that matter) do not exist over a longer period, both simulations are compared to results from PIOMAS version 2.1 (Zhang and Rothrock 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2003</a>). PIOMAS is a coupled sea ice–ocean model that is based on an assimilation of satellite-derived ice concentration data and sea surface temperature (Schweiger et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2011</a>).
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3" href="#Fn3">3</a> PIOMAS covers the period of 1979–2016. It should be stressed that due to the natural variability of the climate system, fully coupled Earth system models cannot be expected to simulate the exact timing of observed sea ice volume fluctuations. This is different for coupled sea ice–ocean models like PIOMAS, which are driven by observed atmospheric data. The ensemble mean of DEXP8.5 (3 members) exhibits about 2000 (5000) km
  <span class="sup">3</span> higher sea ice volume than the ensemble mean of MPI-ESM-LR (3 members) in March (September) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Ensemble members of both sets of models exhibit a steady long-term decrease of sea ice volume in both winter and summer seasons during the historical period, and stronger fluctuations occur for shorter periods. However, the rate of sea ice volume decrease is much greater for PIOMAS than for both MPI-ESM-LR and DEXP8.5 model experiments. Both MPI-ESM-LR and DEXP8.5 model experiments show a lower winter sea ice volume than PIOMAS during the historical period. The much weaker trend for the 1990s to the 2000s might be an indication for internal variability superimposed on the greenhouse gas-induced long-term trend, but could also be a consequence of model errors.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PIOMAS simulates the northern hemisphere sea ice volume seasonal cycle showing a similar trend in winter (April) and summer (September) over the past 35 years (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Over the past 35 years, the Arctic sea ice volume simulated by PIOMAS for April reduced from 32 000 km
  <span class="sup">3</span> to about 22 000 km
  <span class="sup">3</span> corresponding to a sea ice loss of 10 000 km
  <span class="sup">3</span> at the end of recent winters compared to earlier winters. Remarkably, PIOMAS indicated a similar trend in summer with 16 000 km
  <span class="sup">3</span> Arctic sea ice volume at the end of the melting season (September) 35 years ago, versus 4000 km
  <span class="sup">3</span> during more recent years corresponding to a sea ice volume decrease of 12 000 km
  <span class="sup">3</span> at the end of recent summers compared to earlier summers. According to this simulation, the total sea ice volume at the end of the summer season today is only 25% of what it was 35 years ago and corresponds to a summer sea ice extent half the size as before, combined with an overall thinning of sea ice by half over the same period.

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the winter sea ice volume maximum and the summer sea ice volume minimum, we can easily deduce the ice growth from October to April and the ice melt from May to September, for each year over the past 35 years. It is interesting to compare sea ice growth (black curve in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) from sea ice melt (green curve in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Both sea ice growth and sea ice melt are slightly increasing by about 2000 km
  <span class="sup">3</span> over the 35-year period indicative of a stronger seasonal cycle. Still, compared to the sea ice loss both at the end of the winter (10 000 km
  <span class="sup">3</span>) and at the end of the summer (12 000 km
  <span class="sup">3</span>) over the same period of time (past 35 years), this increase for sea ice growth and sea ice melt is 5–6 times less and is simply resulting from the fact that there is more and more open water to freeze up in each fall–winter season.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another interesting result is shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> indicating the net sea ice production obtained by subtracting ice melt from ice growth each year (i.e., subtracting the green from the black curve in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The 5-year running mean values (green curve in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) indicate a negative net sea ice mass balance starting from the mid-80s and slightly enhancing up to the present with a rate of a few 100 km
  <span class="sup">3</span> every year over the past 35 years superimposed to a 4-year oscillation. This results from the fact that the sea ice growth is increasing at a lower rate than the sea ice melt, creating a net negative sea ice mass balance. For most of the 35-year period, the net ice production is negative since the mid-80s when it was at equilibrium. The main reason for the drastic sea ice loss cannot be attributed to a moderate melt increase in summer but rather to a drastic reduction in winter sea ice growth from October to April each year and that cannot compensate for sea ice melt from May to September anymore.

The red curve really demonstrates the importance of the sea ice volume interannual variability superimposed over the long-term trend (cyan curve).

 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since PIOMAS is assimilating surface air temperature (Schweiger et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2011</a>), it is interesting and useful to calculate the amount of sea ice volume directly resulting from freezing during the entire freezing period extending from September to October until April to May the following year, for each year. Based on the 2-m standard air temperature provided by the ERA-Interim reanalysis, we calculated the number of Freezing Degree Days (FDD) over the entire Arctic Ocean for the past 35 years.
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5" href="#Fn5">5</a> During the early 80s, the amount of sea ice calculated from FDD was significantly lower than the sea ice volume produced by PIOMAS in winter (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). This was due to the abundance of multiyear ice (MYI) during the early 80s that FDD could not account for. During more recent years, PIOMAS and FDD estimations are both producing a similar amount of sea ice. This is a remarkable result. The similarity is due to a disappearance of MYI during recent years as also confirmed by the better fit for the FFD linear approximation with PIOMAS rather than the quadratic approximation, which is more appropriate for thicker ice. Remaining differences between the two could be attributed to the ocean heat flux not taken into account in sea ice volume based on FDD, but also likely due to model errors. The ocean effect is particularly important in the marginal ice zone.

    <p>Comparison between PIOMAS sea ice volume in April each year over the past 35 years and sea ice volume based on Freezing Degree Days (FDD) using either a linear or a quadratic approximation from which sea ice volume production can be estimated.

 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The similarity between PIOMAS and FDD sea ice volume winter production, including the long-term trend as well as the interannual and interdecadal variability, is striking. This not only shows the robustness of the used methods, but also suggests that in the northern hemisphere as a whole, the surface air temperature driving freezing is a major factor for the sea ice volume development, as reflected in both the PIOMAS and the FDD-based sea ice volume estimations. The reason that PIOMAS and FDD winter ice volumes match each other after 2000 is likely the fact that the ice cover is very thin throughout the year in much of the Arctic Ocean. The albedo feedback in summer plays a significant role in ice melt and in storing heat in the upper ocean. When fall comes, the heat stored in the upper ocean gets lost through leads and tends to suppress ice growth. Thinner ice responds to cooling temperature in a more linear fashion because heat conduction in thin ice is more of a linear process. This means that winter ice growth is more closely correlated with air temperature. Thus, the closeness of PIOMAS sea ice volume and FDD-based sea ice volume in variability and magnitude in recent years indicates that the air temperature change has been the dominant factor at the pan-Arctic scale.</p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the trend for the past 35 years continues, then both PIOMAS and FDD suggest that a complete Arctic sea ice melting would more likely occur within a 10-year time frame compared to a 20-year time frame for MPI-ESM-LR and DEXP8.5, both exhibiting a much weaker trend in the recent past one or two decades. Both PIOMAS and FDD use 2-m air temperature, which has an increasing trend likely linked to natural variability and anthropogenic forcing. The change in ice volume (winter growth versus summer melt) corresponds to Arctic warming superimposed to natural interannual variability. There is more likely no precise time prediction when Arctic will be summer ice free because of the interannual fluctuations. The natural variability of the Arctic sea ice cover, superimposed on a long-term trend due to anthropogenic climate change, plus model uncertainties, makes a prediction of a precise timing for a quasi-ice-free Arctic in summer uncertain. This kind of prediction is marginally important compared to the real situation where 75% of the Arctic sea ice has already melted away at the end of the summer. More likely, it will not take very long (one or two decades) to melt away the remaining 25% of Arctic sea ice by the end of the summer season and this is what really matters for a number of critical issues such as shipping activities and other human activities across the whole Arctic Ocean.</p>
