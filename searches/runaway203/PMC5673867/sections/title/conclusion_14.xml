 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As far as Arctic navigation is concerned, sea ice extent, sea ice concentration, and sea ice thickness really matter. From a climatic point of view, sea ice volume combining sea ice extent, concentration, and thickness is the key element. Based on one of the most pertinent IPCC Earth system models for predicting Arctic sea ice extent, concentration, and thickness and referring to the best available Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) and newly estimated sea ice volume deduced from Freezing Degree Days (FDD), we evaluated potential model predictive capacity for supporting marine transportation across the Arctic Ocean for the next three decades. Both PIOMAS and FDD confirm a drastic Arctic sea ice volume loss of about 75% at the end of the summer season (September) when comparing sea ice volume for recent years with those obtained 35 years ago. This results from a 50% reduction of both sea ice extent and sea ice thickness over the entire Arctic Ocean and over a 35-year time period. Both PIOMAS and FDD sea ice volume-based estimations confirm that the drastic Arctic sea ice volume reduction (and consequently sea ice extent and sea ice thickness) is mainly due to a decrease in winter ice growth which does not compensate for ice loss in summer ice melt anymore. CMIP5 climate simulations confirm the trend for sea ice reduction during most of the years extending over the next 30 years facilitating marine transportation across the Arctic Ocean. Earth system models still have deficits though. The long-term trend of sea ice volume indicated in the assimilated PIOMAS model is stronger than that found in the Earth system models used in the current project. It is unclear how much of the PIOMAS trend is due to climate change and how much is due to internal variability which Earth system models would not necessarily show in the same time period. Observational data show that sea ice variability at the interannual and intradecadal time scale is quite significant. The same variability is not yet properly simulated by Earth system models. This even holds for the seasonal cycle. Earth system models need to improve sea ice production during winter and sea ice melting during summer, also impacting sea ice thickness. Finally, higher resolution is clearly needed when it comes to support planning safe marine transportation across the Arctic Ocean along the Northeast Passage (NEP) and/or the Northwest Passage (NWP), e.g., when taking into account critical narrow passages for ship navigation. Weather forecasts for operational use are also suffering from undersampled radiosondes coverage that is falling drastically at high latitudes. For supporting Arctic operations with better weather forecasting capabilities in the near future, it is recommended to improve both regional and seasonal coverage of drifting buoys by a factor of 3 and an increase of operation/launch of radiosondes to 4 times per day.</p>
