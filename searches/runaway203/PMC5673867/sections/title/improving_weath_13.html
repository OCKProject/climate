      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Improving weather forecasting for operational activities in the Arctic</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The possibilities in the Arctic for increasing activities such as ship traffic and
         resource exploitation also mean that operators need to deal with risks related to
         the physical Arctic environment (weather, ocean, sea ice). Operational challenges
         include risk factors such as low temperature, occurrence of high winds, fog, and darkness
         during the winter season. Marine operations might additionally be influenced by ocean
         waves, icing from sea sprays, and the presence of sea ice and icebergs. These environmental
         factors may occur in combination, thus increasing the operational challenges. In remote
         areas, the infrastructure and capability to manage difficult situations, hazards,
         or accidents may be distant or even unavailable in many cases.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This emphasizes a need for risk management for operators in the Arctic (Emmerson and
         Lahn 
         <a>2012</a>). Weather forecasting is one element of risk mitigation, helping operators to have
         knowledge of weather-related risk in advance through forecasting capabilities at time
         ranges from a few hours to days ahead. Weather forecasts are also input to ice forecasting,
         so it contributes to dealing with risks connected to ocean conditions.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forecasts from short-range Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are the main
         tool in such forecasting. Work undertaken at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute
         (MET Norway) as a part of ACCESS has assessed the forecasting capabilities in the
         Atlantic sector of the Arctic by investigating the forecast performance of the global
         ECMWF (European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting) NWP and the regional
         HIRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model) model previously run at MET Norway. Pressure
         at mean sea level (MSLP) is a meteorological quantity not easily felt, unlike wind
         or temperature, but still the pressure field is closely connected to the weather systems.
         For instance, away from topography, the wind is closely connected to the pressure
         gradient through the so-called geostrophic relation. Pressure is much less influenced
         by local topographic and surface conditions than wind or temperature, and thus comparing
         pressure verification statistics at different locations is very well suited for getting
         a picture of how the NWP models are able to capture the main large-scale weather system
         variations.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
         <a>8</a> shows root mean square errors for MSLP of the HIRLAM regional NWP model. For this
         sector of the Arctic, there is a striking general decrease in forecast quality when
         moving northwards. This is seen in spite of the fact that the day-to-day pressure
         variability (not shown here) is comparatively small at the highest latitude stations.
         
         <div><span>Fig. 8</span><div>
               <p>Decreasing quality of weather prognosis going northward illustrated by the root mean
                  square errors (hPa). Left: Errors in pressure (root mean square errors vs observations)
                  for HIRLAM forecasts in the range from 18 to 42 h. Right: The same dataset with root
                  mean square error in pressure (hPa) for forecasts against latitude

            <div></div>
         </div>
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A candidate for explaining the decline in the quality toward the North would be the
         corresponding decrease in the observation density of the conventional meteorological
         observing network. The NWP forecasts depend on determining the initial state of the
         atmosphere using observations in the so-called data assimilation. For surface observation
         data, there is a general gap in pressure observations over parts of the sea ice domain
         and parts of the ocean domain as there is only limited coverage from drifting buoys.
         There is almost no coverage of near-surface wind observations over sea ice. The wind
         coverage over ocean is good due to satellite scatterometers providing surface wind
         observations (see, e.g., Figa-Saldana et al. 
         <a>2002</a>) and over populated continents due to conventional surface meteorological stations.
         Surface pressure gradients and near-surface winds are closely linked in the Arctic
         through the geostrophic relationship. However, where only pressure gradient information
         is available through wind observations, the absolute value of the pressure field would
         need to be settled thanks to an extended coverage of surface pressure information.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the period of the ACCESS project, a novel state-of-the-art convection resolving
         regional NWP system covering a high-latitude area, the so-called AROME-Arctic model,
         was implemented at MET Norway. This is a version of the HARMONIE-AROME
         <a>7</a> model and runs at a horizontal resolution of 2.5 km grid length. For applying observations
         to update the model initial state for the forecasts, the AROME-Arctic model uses three-dimensional
         variational assimilation system (3D-VAR) for atmospheric and optimum interpolation
         (OI) for surface data assimilation. This system was used to perform observing system
         experiments (OSE) including all available surface and upper-air conventional observations
         and radiance observations from NOAA and METOP satellites. These experiments indicated
         that
         
         <div>
            <div>
               <p>the present upper-air conventional (radiosondes, aircraft) observations in the area
                  are too scarce to have a significant effect on forecasts;

               <p>satellite remote sensing data for vertical profiling of the atmosphere (sounding data)
                  play an important role in improving forecasts quality. This clearly highlights that
                  satellite information will be important also in the future evolution of the Arctic
                  observing system and that enhancing the extraction of information from such satellites
                  could be a key area.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the satellite sensors mentioned above are on polar-orbiting satellites, which
         have the property that the density of the ground tracks increases poleward, thus giving
         good coverage in the Arctic. Our ability to benefit from satellite information in
         analyses and forecasts of numerical weather prediction systems evolves with time,
         and there is a potential for further enhancing our methods for exploiting already
         existing satellite sensors. Efforts in this direction would not require new satellite
         programs and could be a way of improving forecasting with further research at relatively
         limited cost. Key areas which we believe have a potential for improving information
         from satellite remote sensing (sounding) instruments for NWP in the Arctic are as
         follows:
         
         <div>
            <div>
               <p>Accounting for the surface contribution to the signal over sea ice: Sounding channels
                  with significant contribution to the measured signal from Arctic Ocean sea ice surfaces
                  are usually rejected in the data assimilation. If we could account for the contribution
                  from the surface by drawing information on emissivity and emitting temperature in
                  new ways, it will enable us using more channels providing temperature and moisture
                  information in the lower troposphere (see, e.g., Tonboe et al. 
                  <a>2013</a>; Karbou et al. 
                  <a>2014</a>).
                  
               </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Better ability to describe and account for the cloud contribution to the signals:
                  Clouds are ubiquitous in the Arctic and assimilation of satellite sounding data relies
                  on a « cloud clearing » procedure before assimilation which has a goal to only allow
                  assimilation of channels without cloud contribution to the signal. There is a potential
                  for improving the reliability of cloud clearing and also for novel methods to exploit
                  the cloudy signals (following, for instance, the ideas for «all-sky» assimilation
                  demonstrated by Geer et al. 
                  <a>2010</a>).

         </div>
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finding scenarios for new satellite missions or programs is expensive and subject
         to well-established long-term processes and thorough investigations in the international
         satellite agencies. One can hope that further evolution of the satellite observing
         system will help fill the observation gap in the Arctic, but this can only happen
         in the long term (WIGOS 
         <a>2013</a>). Here we will mention some possible extensions of the conventional observing network,
         which could be practically and even economically realistic to implement in a shorter
         time range, although it would still require some funding scheme and possibly international
         cooperation.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When looking for options for such extensions, it is attractive to look for alternatives
         with the lowest cost relative to the impact on forecast. There is extensive literature
         on the impact of observations or observation types on NWP forecast quality; however,
         few studies consider also the cost of each observation to rank observation types according
         to impact per cost. Nevertheless, Eyre and Reid (
         <a>2014</a>) made the first attempt to investigate this in a global forecasting context. This
         study pointed to many uncertainties and needs for refinements of the methodology,
         but the results showed drifting ocean surface buoys to be the conventional observation
         type with the largest impact per cost globally (see also Andersson and Sato 
         <a>2012</a>). This is probably related to the fact that they are often deployed at locations
         where few other observations are available. Also conventional aircraft observations
         showed good impact per cost, and radiosondes showed moderate impact per cost on average.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three-dimensional nature of the atmosphere and previous experience certainly indicate
         that profile information (sounding) is important. A relatively cheap way to obtain
         more conventional sounding data is to perform more frequent radiosonde launches at
         already existing launch sites (at least twice per day or four times per day). There
         are a few existing radiosondes stations with staff and necessary infrastructure at
         some remote Arctic islands. Since basic infrastructure for these launch sites are
         already in place, increasing the number of launches per day at these sites could be
         a good solution to provide cost-efficient extended data coverage. Our investigation
         showed that guaranteeing at least two launches per day of radiosonde at already existing
         sites provides benefit for the updated initial state (analysis) and forecasts of geopotential
         and humidity, while four times launch per day provides a further significant beneficial
         impact on analysis and forecast of all verified parameters.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the indications from Eyre and Reid (
         <a>2014</a>), we should look at the option of increasing the number of surface buoys. Even if
         that study was for observations globally, it seems reasonable to also expect a good
         impact of these observations in the Arctic, based on the decrease in the observation
         density of the conventional meteorological observing network when going northwards,
         and lack of satellite information on surface pressure. Deploying extra buoys in the
         Arctic has been done in campaigns in the past, so it should be possible to implement
         it if more funding is made available through some permanent program. Scenarios could
         include increasing the number of drifting surface buoys measuring the air pressure
         in the Arctic domain by factors two, three, or four. Surface pressure information
         is important to assimilation for the dynamics of the atmosphere and such buoys are
         usually also equipped with temperature sensors providing additional information of
         interest. We tried to define the optimal network distribution based on the accuracy
         of the forecasts issued from the analyses using the different scenarios for surface
         buoy networks. Increasing the number of buoys by a factor of four did not show any
         overall improvements in accuracy of forecasts for mid- and high troposphere compared
         to forecasts issued from analyses using three times more buoys. Meanwhile, the accuracy
         of forecasts issued from the analyses using two times more surface buoys is less than
         that of those issued using three times more buoys. We conclude that three times more
         buoys represents a cost-efficient distribution of buoys inside our model domain in
         the context of our state-of-the-art regional forecasting system.
