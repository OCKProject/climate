  <p>Overlap of extreme impact (high, low) and trend (fast increase, decrease) in cumulative impacts. Regions of low (&lt;20
   <span class="sup">th</span> quantile) and high (&gt;80
   <span class="sup">th</span> quantile) cumulative impact in 2013 were combined with regions where annual cumulative impacts were decreasing (trend ≤0, lighter colors represent non-significant trends) or quickly increasing (trend &gt;80
   <span class="sup">th</span> global quantile, corresponding to a slope estimate of 0.085, all significant trends). Trend estimates were calculated using a linear regression model from 2003–2013 cumulative human impacts. Density plot on right shows the distribution of values across latitude.
