 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All data are represented at ~1 km resolution with a WGS84 Mollweide projection. Nearly all source data used to derive the stressor layers had native coarser resolution (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>), and were therefore resampled/reprojected using nearest neighbor estimates of cell values. Using the nearest neighbor approach preserves the values of the original data, and assumes the coarse-scale value is evenly distributed across all 1 km cells within that region. The coarser scale pattern is essentially recreated and finer resolution information is preserved where and when it is appropriate.

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the WGS84 Mollweide projection because it preserves area so data towards the poles are not visually over-represented.</p>
