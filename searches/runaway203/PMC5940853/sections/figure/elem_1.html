         <p>Processes influencing the contrail formation stage. Exhaust plumes produced by combusting
            fuel–air mixtures at high temperature and pressure within turbofan jet engines contain
            gaseous and particulate matter. Particles types present in the freely expanding and
            cooling plumes (jet regime) comprise emitted soot particles and aqueous aerosol particles
            formed in the exhaust (Box 
            <a>1</a>) along with entrained ambient aerosol particles. When turbulent mixing (arrows) and
            the associated cooling produces plume supersaturation over liquid water (
            <span>s</span><sub>w</sub> &gt; 0), copious plume particles turn into water droplets (grey) that freeze and grow
            rapidly by uptake of water vapour forming a visible contrail. This happens when the
            ambient temperature, 
            <span>T</span>, falls below the formation threshold, 
            <span>Θ</span>. In soot-rich exhaust, most droplets contain soot inclusions. Droxtals, frozen water
            droplets with faceted surfaces, and hexagonal prisms and columns likely developing
            from them may provide a realistic representation of small ice crystals in fresh contrails,
            but no direct observational evidence for their shapes is available. Plumes from multiple
            aircraft engines merge with two wing tip vortices, forming an inhomogeneous wake.
            The further evolution of ice crystals depends largely on fluid-dynamical processes
            (vortex regime). The downward motion of the vortex pair warms the air causing ice
            crystal sublimation in the lower part of the wake. A small contrail fraction is released
            from the jets remaining at flight level and enhanced by detrainment of air from the
            lower wake. Ice crystals present in the upper wake continue to grow by uptake of entrained
            ice-supersaturated (
            <span>s</span><sub>i</sub> &gt; 0) ambient water vapour. Few minutes past emission, the organised flow pattern
            collapses and mixes with ambient air (dissipation regime). Ice crystal images adapted
