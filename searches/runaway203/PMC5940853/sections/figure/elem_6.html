         <p>Global annual mean radiative forcing due to aircraft-induced clouds. RF due to 
            <span>a</span> persistent contrails alone and 
            <span>b</span> together with contrail cirrus from selected studies and assessments sorted by publication
            date since 1999. Purely observational global estimates derive from extrapolating local
            aircraft and regional satellite data. Pure model estimates are based on or rely upon
            global model simulations. Uncertainty ranges evaluated across several methodologies
            are taken from comprehensive assessments. IPCC 1999 assessed persistent contrail RF
            to be 20 (5–60) mW m
            <span>−2</span> for air traffic in the year 1992 (ref. 
            <span><a>4</a></span>), followed by two studies summarising knowledge in the subsequent decade
            <span><a>11</a>,
               <a>73</a></span>. A narrower range, 8–20 mW m
            <span>−2</span>, was provided for the year 2000 after correcting older estimates that include off-line
            radiative transfer simulations with prescribed contrail coverage and mean optical
            depth for undetectable contrails
            <span><a>67</a></span>. Taken together, subsequent climate model simulations and extrapolation from in situ
            and satellite observations yielded 3–16 mW m
            <span>−2</span> for air traffic in 2002–2006 (refs. 
            <span><a>63</a>,
               <a>69</a>,
               <a>71</a>,
               <a>142</a></span>). Relying in part on extrapolation and scaling data from earlier years, the IPCC
            most recently assessed contrail RF to be 10 (5–30) mW m
            <span>−2</span> (ref. 
            <span><a>10</a></span>) for 2011. Refs. 
            <span><a>4</a>,
               <a>11</a>,
               <a>73</a></span> provided possible RF ranges due to AIC. Ref. 
            <span><a>6</a></span> estimated for the first time global AIC RF to be 38 mW m
            <span>−2</span> for air traffic in the year 2002 using a climate model that tracks AIC explicitly;
            an improved model version
            <span><a>70</a></span> estimated 56 mW m
            <span>−2</span> for 2006. AIC RF values 50 mW m
            <span>−2</span> and 60 mW m
            <span>−2</span> were predicted for 2006 based on an off-line model that tracks contrail segments
            forming along flight tracks in combination with weather forecast and climate host
            models
            <span><a>52</a>,
               <a>88</a></span>. In a climate model that regards contrails as a source term for natural clouds, ref.
            
            <span><a>69</a></span> reported a global AIC RF of 13 mW m
            <span>−2</span> for the same reference year. The IPCC best estimate of global net RF due to AIC for
            air traffic in the year 2011—associated with low confidence—is 50 mW m
            <span>−2</span> (ref. 
            <span><a>10</a></span>), corresponding to more than half of the total aviation RF, with a 90% uncertainty
            range, 20–150 mW m
            <span>−2</span>. This most recent best estimate does not include indirect effects of aircraft particle
            emissions on natural clouds
