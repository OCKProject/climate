         <p>Variability in contrail optical depth. Probability distributions (PDF) of contrail
            optical depth, OD, and (top) the cumulative distribution (
            <span>a</span>) simulated by an idealised contrail model. The model PDF (
            <span>b</span>) was obtained (i) by solving an equation governing the evolution of the ice crystal
            size distribution accounting for mixing-induced dilution, shear-induced spreading,
            sedimentation and growth by vapour uptake and (ii) by imposing on this solution variability
            in meteorological factors described by probability distributions (inset) of air temperature,
            
            <span>T</span>, ice supersaturation (accounting for unresolved vertical air motion variability),
            
            <span>s</span><sub>i</sub>, vertical shear of horizontal winds, 
            <span>σ</span>, and thickness of ice supersaturated layers, Δ
            <span>z</span>, all constrained by atmospheric observations and numerical weather analyses. Simulation
            results
            <span><a>65</a></span> are compared with satellite observations
            <span><a>56</a></span> of contrails over the eastern North Pacific in the year 2001. According to the model
            analysis
            <span><a>66</a></span>, the measurements detected only 39% of all contrails over the whole OD range, 49%
            are subvisible (OD &lt; 0.02) and 11% are not optically thin (OD &gt; 0.3). By comparing
            simulated and observed PDF, detection efficiencies, 
            <span>ε</span>, were inferred: 11.5% for data in the range 0&lt; OD ≤ 0.05; 49% for 0.05 &lt; OD ≤ 0.1;
            94.5% for 0.1 &lt; OD ≤ 0.2; and 100% for OD &gt; 0.2, partly overlapping with values derived
            with other methods and in other conditions
            <span><a>59</a></span>. After adjusting the model PDF for inefficient detection using these efficiencies
            (horizontal arrow), it replicates the observed cumulant (stepped curve). Overall,
            applying the detection efficiency curve is consistent with a single cut-off OD value
            of 0.04, the upper limit OD value of the hatched area marking undetected (and partly
            invisible) contrails. The mean OD of all simulated contrails is 0.15, translating
            into 0.29 when corrected for non-detectable contrails. The corrected OD is roughly
            in line with the observed mean value, 0.24, that overestimates the model mean value
            of all contrails by ≈63%
