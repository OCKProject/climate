         <p>Sublimation-induced ice crystal losses in aircraft wakes. Dependence of the fraction
            of ice crystals escaping complete sublimation during the vortex regime versus nucleated
            ice crystal number emission index taken from LES simulations for a large aircraft
            at cruise and low (0.1), medium (0.2) and high (0.3) ambient ice supersaturation (Table
            A2 Block 4 in ref. 
            <span><a>43</a></span>). The magnitude of sublimation losses depends on aircraft engine thrust settings
            affecting soot particle numbers as well as on aircraft weight affecting the vertical
            depth of the wake; ambient conditions including ice supersaturation, air temperature
            and its vertical gradient and turbulence levels; and level of plume ice supersaturation
            and number, mean size and spread of the contrail ice crystal size distribution in
            the late jet regime. Substantial losses have been attributed to the Kelvin effect
            <span><a>31</a></span>, marking an increase in supersaturation over the surfaces of small particles relative
            to ambient values. Although this increase is very small (0.001–0.1) for µm-sized ice
            crystals, it becomes important in aircraft wake vortices for high ice crystal number
            concentrations causing rapid sublimation rates
