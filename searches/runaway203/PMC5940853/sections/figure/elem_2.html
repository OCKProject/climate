         <p>Nucleation of ice crystals in jet aircraft exhaust plumes. Ice crystal number emission
            index (per kilogram of fuel burnt) in the jet regime as a function of the number emission
            index of emitted soot particles simulated by a parcel model
            <span><a>37</a></span>. Two results are shown for an ambient temperature, 
            <span>T</span>, close to a contrail formation threshold temperature, 
            <span>Θ</span> ≈ 225 K, frequently found in extratropical cruise conditions, and a rather low temperature
            12 K below this value. At intermediate ambient temperatures, nucleated ice crystal
            numbers increase due to enhanced water activation of either soot or ultrafine aqueous
            plume particles (Box 
            <a>1</a>). An approximate range of current in-flight soot emission indices is indicated (hatched
            area). In soot-rich exhaust, the number of soot particles that can be water-activated
            and freeze increases with decreasing ambient temperature that in turn increases plume
            cooling rates and levels of plume supersaturation over liquid water. As 
            <span>T</span> approaches 
            <span>Θ</span> in soot-poor exhaust, ambient aerosol particles mixed into exhaust plumes are the
            only source of contrail ice crystals, as increasingly fewer plume particles can be
            activated owing to diminishing plume supersaturation; the number concentrations of
            ambient particles are much lower in contrails than current soot emission levels. The
            plume cooling rate determines the time of water activation of entrained ambient particles,
            hence, the number of ice crystals derived from them. In soot-poor exhaust, ultrafine
            aqueous plume particles are formed in large numbers in the fresh exhaust, if the fuel
            contains sufficient amounts of condensable vapours besides water vapour. Those small
            particles are predicted to contribute significantly to ice crystal formation at low
            ambient temperatures well below average values at cruise levels (
            <span>T</span> ≈ 218 K in the extratropics and 
            <span>T</span> ≈ 228 K in the tropics). If the formation of ultrafine particles cannot be avoided,
            ice crystal numbers are lowest in an intermediate range of soot emissions, 10
