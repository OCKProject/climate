         <p>Aviation radiative forcing components. 
            <span>a</span> Aviation as a percentage of total global radiative forcing (RF) due to human activities
            in the year 2011 relative to pre-industrial times, 2.29 (1.13–3.33) W m
            <span>−2</span> (ref. 
            <span><a>7</a></span>). 
            <span>b</span> Forcing components within the aviation fraction, of which aircraft-induced clouds
            (AIC) account for more than half. AIC and carbon dioxide (CO
            <sub>2</sub>) estimates represent 2011 emission levels
            <span><a>10</a></span>; the latter contribution has been obtained by extrapolating the year 2005 value
            <span><a>11</a></span> using the corresponding increase in scheduled air traffic distance (Table 7.SM.2
            in ref. 
            <span><a>10</a></span>). RF estimates for all aviation components together for the same year and emission
            levels superseding 2005 values are not available
            <span><a>13</a></span>. Aircraft emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO
            <sub><span>x</span></sub>) cause positive and negative RF contributions, values here calculated based on refs.
            
            <span><a>107</a>,
               <a>139</a></span>. Small direct RF contributions from aircraft water vapour
            <span><a>140</a></span> and particle emissions
            <span><a>14</a></span> together nearly cancel out and are therefore not shown. No scientific consensus has
            been reached regarding the sign of RF due to modification of natural clouds by particle
            emissions. Therefore, the RF caused by those ‘indirect’ effects is not considered
            here, but may be of opposite sign and as large as that of AIC. 
            <span>c</span> Breakdown of AIC radiative forcing into contrail cirrus and persistent contrails based
            on ref.
