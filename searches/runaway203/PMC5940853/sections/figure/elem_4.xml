  <p>Factors affecting the development of aircraft-induced clouds. Areal cloud coverage increases due to vertical shear of horizontal wind components. Turbulent mixing (entrainment) forces ice crystal concentrations to decrease (dilute) over time. Ice crystal sizes increase by uptake (deposition) of water vapour from ice-supersaturated layers. Sustained deposition growth causes ice crystal shapes (habits) to deviate from initial isometry. The shapes of ice crystals, which are only poorly known and illustrated as droxtals, hexagonal prisms and columns, bullet rosettes and aggregates, affect their size-dependent growth and fall rates and optical properties. Ice crystals with maximum dimensions &gt;30 µm settle (sediment) due to gravity with fall speeds &gt;100 m h
   <span class="sup">−1</span> and sublimate in warmer or drier air, while smaller crystals remain around the flight levels due to negligible fall speeds as long as some supersaturation can be maintained depending on the meteorological situation. The efficiency of sedimentation depends on the depositional growth rate, i.e., on ice supersaturation, the rate of cooling of air, and on ice crystal size, habit and number concentration. Sedimentation increases the vertical extent of AIC, which, in turn, enhances the rate of spreading and therefore coverage in a sheared flow. Sustained warming and drying due to large-scale subsidence dissolves AIC entirely. Ice crystal images adapted from ref.
