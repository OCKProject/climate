         <p>Options to mitigate the climate effect of aircraft-induced clouds. Options are categorised
            into short-term and long-term solutions. Long-term options are further distinguished
            as drop-in (easily replaceable) and non-drop-in approaches. Mitigation options may
            also be categorised according to their influence in the two stages of AIC evolution.
            Most options, including technological options addressing alterations of aircraft engine
            architecture and airframe/engine integration, affect the formation stage (red) by
            reducing or modifying particle emissions or affecting nucleation and sublimation of
            contrail ice crystals in aircraft exhaust plumes and wakes. Only two options affect
            the spreading stage (blue), requiring sound predictive capability of ice supersaturated
            areas (air traffic management, ATM) or producing short-lived contrails in the dry
            lower stratosphere (supersonic flight) with negligible radiative impact
