      <p>Aircraft-produced contrail cirrus clouds contribute to anthropogenic climate change.
         Observational data sets and modelling approaches have become available that clarify
         formation pathways close to the source aircraft and lead to estimates of the global
         distribution of their microphysical and optical properties. While contrail cirrus
         enhance the impact of natural clouds on climate, uncertainties remain regarding their
         properties and lifecycle. Progress in representing aircraft emissions, contrail cirrus
         and natural cirrus in global climate models together with tighter constraints on the
         sensitivity of the climate system will help judge efficiencies of and trade-offs between
         mitigation options.
