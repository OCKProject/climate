 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robust predictions of changes in climate that result from AIC rely to a large degree on the ability to transfer the process understanding outlined above into models that are not capable of treating the formation stage explicitly due to a lack of spatial or temporal resolution. This goal can be reached by allying findings from observations with local scale, process-oriented models. While first attempts have been made to devise simulations addressing formation stage processes prior to IPCC 1999 (ref. 
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. The ice nucleation process in contrails has been simulated assuming that the kinetics of water droplet and ice crystal formation are not affected by turbulent plume mixing and in which supersaturation is not resolved at scales (≈0.1–1 cm) below which molecular diffusion removes spatial gradients of water vapour and temperature. Water droplet formation followed by homogeneous freezing defines a minimal microphysical framework. By invoking a heterogeneous (solid surface assisted) ice nucleation mode involving bare exhaust soot particles, it is possible to tune these nucleation rates to trigger rapid formation of copious ice crystals preventing water supersaturation from occurring. However, this violates the water saturation constraint.

  </span>. In soot-rich exhaust, ice crystal and soot particle numbers increase nearly in proportion. Near the contrail threshold, only few ice crystals form, since low plume supersaturation diminishes water activation of soot particles. Ice crystal numbers decrease about 100-fold from soot-rich to soot-poor conditions, approaching constant low values set by the number of particles in the contrail environment. Ice crystal numbers increase at low ambient temperatures in soot-poor exhaust due to water activation and subsequent freezing of abundant aqueous plume particles (Box 
  <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">1</a>). While one observational case study is consistent with those predictions
  <span class="sup">

     <span class="italic">Θ</span> ≈ 225 K, frequently found in extratropical cruise conditions, and a rather low temperature 12 K below this value. At intermediate ambient temperatures, nucleated ice crystal numbers increase due to enhanced water activation of either soot or ultrafine aqueous plume particles (Box 
     <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">1</a>). An approximate range of current in-flight soot emission indices is indicated (hatched area). In soot-rich exhaust, the number of soot particles that can be water-activated and freeze increases with decreasing ambient temperature that in turn increases plume cooling rates and levels of plume supersaturation over liquid water. As 
     <span class="italic">T</span> approaches 
     <span class="italic">Θ</span> in soot-poor exhaust, ambient aerosol particles mixed into exhaust plumes are the only source of contrail ice crystals, as increasingly fewer plume particles can be activated owing to diminishing plume supersaturation; the number concentrations of ambient particles are much lower in contrails than current soot emission levels. The plume cooling rate determines the time of water activation of entrained ambient particles, hence, the number of ice crystals derived from them. In soot-poor exhaust, ultrafine aqueous plume particles are formed in large numbers in the fresh exhaust, if the fuel contains sufficient amounts of condensable vapours besides water vapour. Those small particles are predicted to contribute significantly to ice crystal formation at low ambient temperatures well below average values at cruise levels (
     <span class="italic">T</span> ≈ 218 K in the extratropics and 
     <span class="italic">T</span> ≈ 228 K in the tropics). If the formation of ultrafine particles cannot be avoided, ice crystal numbers are lowest in an intermediate range of soot emissions, 10

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Computational fluid dynamics simulations are capable of predicting contrail properties past ice crystal formation in greater detail within limited spatial domains. While it is computationally too expensive to treat ice nucleation explicitly in large-eddy simulation (LES) codes, they have been employed to study effects of aircraft wake development on ice crystals. In this regard, LES have provided valuable insights into systematic dependencies of ice crystal losses on aircraft-dependent and atmospheric variables.</p>

The magnitude of sublimation losses depends on aircraft engine thrust settings affecting soot particle numbers as well as on aircraft weight affecting the vertical depth of the wake; ambient conditions including ice supersaturation, air temperature and its vertical gradient and turbulence levels; and level of plume ice supersaturation and number, mean size and spread of the contrail ice crystal size distribution in the late jet regime. Substantial losses have been attributed to the Kelvin effect

Although this increase is very small (0.001–0.1) for µm-sized ice crystals, it becomes important in aircraft wake vortices for high ice crystal number concentrations causing rapid sublimation rates

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Advances in research in the last two decades do not abrogate the need to measure more accurately physical and chemical properties of aerosol particles and ice crystals in the size range 1–1000 nm and to re-examine model predictions of ice crystal size distributions in and vertical extensions of contrails with better informed models at the end of the formation stage. These variables serve as initial conditions of AIC in the spreading stage and have important repercussions regarding the transition of contrails into contrail cirrus. It is important to ascertain model predictions by which sublimation decreases differences in nucleated ice crystal numbers induced by changes in soot emissions.</p>
