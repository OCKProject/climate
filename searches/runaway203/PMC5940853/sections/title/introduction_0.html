      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Condensation trails (contrails) are line-shaped ice clouds generated by jet aircraft
         cruising in the upper troposphere at 8–13 km altitude. Depending on surrounding atmospheric
         conditions, contrails can be short- or long-lived. Long-lived contrails are those
         that remain for at least 10 min—defined by the World Meteorological Organization as
         Cirrus homogenitus
         <span><a>1</a></span>—and are the only man-made type of ice clouds. Depending on whether or not they retain
         their linear shape, they have been referred to as persistent contrails and contrail
         cirrus, respectively, or together as aircraft-induced clouds (AIC). A change in global
         cloudiness due to AIC creates an imbalance between incident radiation from the Sun
         and upwelling radiation from the Earth’s surface and atmosphere, resulting in a radiative
         forcing (RF) of climate that induces a tendency to change the temperature structure
         in the lower atmosphere.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Widespread recognition of a possible large-scale climatic influence of contrails dates
         back to several decades
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>3</a></span>. Prior to 1990, quantitative interpretation was hampered by a lack of knowledge of
         the properties of contrail cirrus, processes involved in their formation and tools
         and technologies to observe and represent them in models. A special report by the
         Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) summarised and assessed in 1999 the
         scientific progress made regarding the climate impact of aviation
         <span><a>4</a></span>. While studies had begun to explore extensively the physical characteristics of persistent
         contrails, observational data on contrail cirrus were, and still are, very scarce,
         since it is difficult to distinguish them visually from naturally occurring high ice
         clouds (cirrus) owing to their irregular shape
         <span><a>5</a></span>, especially if their history is not known. Therefore, the IPCC special report did
         not provide a best central estimate of contrail cirrus RF. The resulting scientific
         uncertainty limited projections of the climate impact of aviation as a whole and prevented
         the formulation of options for mitigation. Since that report, climate model simulations
         have shown that RF due to contrail cirrus greatly exceeds that from persistent contrails
         <span><a>6</a></span>, making contrail cirrus the most important contribution to AIC and to RF associated
         with aviation. However, knowledge gaps still exist regarding the transition of contrails
         into contrail cirrus, optical properties determining their radiative response and
         the sensitivity of the climate system.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential magnitude of the problem has given impetus to the need for improved
         understanding. The majority of RF driving climate change is due to anthropogenic emissions
         of warming (greenhouse) gases, most prominently carbon dioxide (CO
         <sub>2</sub>), and aerosol particles. In addition to CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions, civil aviation affects the climate through a number of non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> climate forcing agents that are unique to this sector of transportation. Taken together,
         in the year 2011, these agents caused 4% of the total global RF from all human activities
         (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). AIC represent the largest aviation RF component—comparable to RF induced by natural
         variations of the energy input from the Sun
         <span><a>7</a></span>—followed by aviation CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions and within AIC, contrail cirrus account for 80% of the RF.

                  been reached regarding the sign of RF due to modification of natural clouds by particle
                  emissions. Therefore, the RF caused by those ‘indirect’ effects is not considered
                  here, but may be of opposite sign and as large as that of AIC.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite significant improvements in aviation technology and operation efficiency
         <span><a>8</a>,
            <a>9</a></span>, the steady increase in air travel volume—about 50% in terms of scheduled air traffic
         distance from 2000 to 2011 (ref. 
         <span><a>10</a></span>)—has led to concerns about the growing impact of aviation on climate. Depending on
         the economic projections and aircraft emission scenarios, aviation fuel usage and
         therefore CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions may double by 2050 (ref. 
         <span><a>11</a></span>). Some scenarios predict 3–4-fold increases
         <span><a>12</a></span>. When scaled to fuel usage, AIC RF relative to that of aviation CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions stays constant. However, such a scaling disregards non-linearity in atmospheric
         response to cloud changes. Exactly how this contribution will evolve also depends
         on changes in regional air traffic patterns and climate
         <span><a>10</a>,
            <a>11</a>,
            <a>13</a></span>. To eliminate AIC from the aviation climate equation, the research community needs
         to address knowledge gaps by advancing the scientific understanding of contrail cirrus
         and providing an assessment of options to mitigate the climate impact of AIC
         <span><a>14</a></span>. If the objective is to minimise the aviation contribution to climate change on long
         time scales (relating to centuries), then reductions in CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions are much more important than mitigating non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> effects. However, persistent contrails and contrail cirrus have much shorter life
         times than CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions (hours versus centuries) and are therefore amenable to rapid mitigation.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This review brings together and draws upon knowledge on understanding their lifecycle
         and effects on Earth’s radiation budget since IPCC 1999. Determining conditions with
         predominant meteorological or microphysical control of contrail cirrus, connecting
         their radiative effects with global temperature change and exploring mitigation solutions
         will help develop appropriate technological and operational responses to reduce the
         climate impact of aviation as a whole and inform decision-making.
