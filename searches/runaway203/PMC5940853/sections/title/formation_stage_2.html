      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The formation stage unfolds behind engines of cruising aircraft and lasts for about
         10 min (ref. 
         <span><a>18</a></span>). Through a combination of models, laboratory and in situ measurements, the last
         two decades have seen significant advances in identifying and understanding thermo-,
         fluid-dynamical and microphysical processes in the formation stage. Understanding
         these processes is essential to model and predict initial AIC properties.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrails begin to form when jet engine exhaust plumes expand and their constituents
         mix with surrounding ambient air (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). In line with aircraft observations
         <span><a>4</a></span>, a thermodynamic mixing model
         <span><a>19</a></span> has shown that temperatures typically below 233 K (≈−40 °C) provide a threshold below
         which either short-lived or long-lived contrails appear behind jet aircraft cruising
         above ≈8 km (formation constraint). Contrail occurrence is predicted with confidence,
         if ambient pressure and relative humidity, water vapour and heat emissions, and propulsive
         characteristics of aircraft engines are known. The underlying definition of threshold
         temperatures rests on the assumption that exhaust plumes surpass water saturated conditions
         (water saturation constraint). The thermodynamic approach is not capable of predicting
         formation (nucleation) pathways and microphysical properties of ice crystals in contrails.

               <p>Processes influencing the contrail formation stage. Exhaust plumes produced by combusting
                  fuel–air mixtures at high temperature and pressure within turbofan jet engines contain
                  gaseous and particulate matter. Particles types present in the freely expanding and
                  cooling plumes (jet regime) comprise emitted soot particles and aqueous aerosol particles
                  formed in the exhaust (Box 
                  <a>1</a>) along with entrained ambient aerosol particles. When turbulent mixing (arrows) and
                  the associated cooling produces plume supersaturation over liquid water (
                  <span>s</span><sub>w</sub> &gt; 0), copious plume particles turn into water droplets (grey) that freeze and grow
                  rapidly by uptake of water vapour forming a visible contrail. This happens when the
                  ambient temperature, 
                  <span>T</span>, falls below the formation threshold, 
                  <span>Θ</span>. In soot-rich exhaust, most droplets contain soot inclusions. Droxtals, frozen water
                  droplets with faceted surfaces, and hexagonal prisms and columns likely developing
                  from them may provide a realistic representation of small ice crystals in fresh contrails,
                  but no direct observational evidence for their shapes is available. Plumes from multiple
                  aircraft engines merge with two wing tip vortices, forming an inhomogeneous wake.
                  The further evolution of ice crystals depends largely on fluid-dynamical processes
                  (vortex regime). The downward motion of the vortex pair warms the air causing ice
                  crystal sublimation in the lower part of the wake. A small contrail fraction is released
                  from the jets remaining at flight level and enhanced by detrainment of air from the
                  lower wake. Ice crystals present in the upper wake continue to grow by uptake of entrained
                  ice-supersaturated (
                  <span>s</span><sub>i</sub> &gt; 0) ambient water vapour. Few minutes past emission, the organised flow pattern
                  collapses and mixes with ambient air (dissipation regime). Ice crystal images adapted

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aerosol particles types present in aircraft exhaust plumes comprise emitted soot particles,
         nanometre-sized (ultrafine) aqueous aerosol particles formed within the plumes and
         particles mixed (entrained) into the plumes from the ambient air (Box 
         <a>1</a>). In the cooling plumes, these particles interact with condensable vapours—mainly
         emitted water vapour—and ionised gas molecules. The different particle types compete
         for supersaturated vapour in water droplet formation; for current emissions, soot
         particles figure most prominently in droplet formation. Although water droplets are
         initially present in contrails, they are unstable since the upper troposphere stays
         below liquid water saturation
         <span><a>20</a>,
            <a>21</a></span>. Laboratory studies
         <span><a>22</a>–
            <a>24</a></span> demonstrate that only after water droplets have formed does substantial ice nucleation
         occur, with rates of homogeneous (pure liquid) droplet freezing increasing dramatically
         with decreasing temperature (phase constraint). The presence of ice crystals in contrails
         is supported by ample observational evidence
         <span><a>25</a></span>. An analysis of aircraft observations shows that many (&gt;10,000 cm
         <span>−3</span>) small (&lt;1 µm) ice crystals need to form within a wingspan behind cruising aircraft
         to make contrails visible already at formation
         <span><a>26</a></span> (visibility constraint). This is possible since plume cooling rates driven by turbulent
         mixing
         <span><a>27</a></span> are high and plume particles acting as water condensation nuclei are abundant
         <span><a>28</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
         <a>2</a> indicates that properties of persistent contrails are further developed through circulatory
         airflow patterns (vortices) appearing behind aircraft wings. Plumes from multiple
         aircraft engines merge with the vortex pair, forming an inhomogeneous wake. The further
         evolution of ice crystals depends on the interaction between jet plumes and wake vortices.
         The vortex pair, in which most of the contrail is captured, descends some 100 m below
         the flight level. This downward motion leads to a partial loss of ice crystals due
         to sublimation in the lower part of the wake. Ice crystals present in the upper wake
         continue to grow by uptake of entrained ice supersaturated water vapour. After few
         minutes of contrail age, the wake-averaged ice crystal size distribution contains
         signatures of nucleation, growth and sublimation. Eventually, flow instability triggered
         by turbulence causes the organised flow pattern to collapse and mix with ambient air,
         terminating the formation stage. Evolution of ice crystals in engine plumes and aircraft
         wakes depend on ambient conditions and on the type of aircraft and jet engines, as
         borne out by fluid-dynamical simulations
