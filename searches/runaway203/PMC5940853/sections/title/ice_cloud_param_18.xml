 <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the one hand, instrumental challenges pose significant limitations in measurements of microphysical and optical properties of contrail cirrus. This heightens the role of models (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>) in providing RF estimates. On the other hand, improved scientific understanding is required before embarking on parameterisation.

 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local scale process and fluid-dynamical models systematically explore how plume turbulence and wake dynamics affects nucleation and properties of contrail ice crystals (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and how predictions of nucleated ice numbers (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) and sublimation losses (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) relate to aircraft measurements. Cloud-resolving and regional models—driven with appropriate meteorological boundary conditions and combined with optical parameterisations capturing the SW response of µm-sized ice crystals—analyse large atmospheric regions based on collocated aircraft and satellite measurements to better judge AIC RF and the radiative significance of natural cirrus perturbed by contrails. These models capture variability in ice supersaturation and are employed to drive LES to gain more detailed understanding of the contrail-to-contrail cirrus transition. Global models use information regarding properties of thin ice supersaturated layers (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>) derived from high-resolution simulations or radiosonde data

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" href="#CR122">122</a>
  </span> to improve their representation of AIC supporting areas
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. They also use parameterisations of formation stage processes to initialise AIC properties and rely on progress in simulating the formation of natural cirrus more realistically

  </span>.

 <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global models represent much of the system complexity, but account for processes and their variability affecting RF only to a degree, depending on the model’s representation of clouds. They track atmospheric motion and clouds with ≈10 min time steps and represent them with coarse spatial resolution. This means that formation and effects of clouds must be parameterised. Cloud microphysical and optical variables evolve on unresolved temporal and spatial scales. The connection of unresolved processes to resolved (large-scale) model variables is not always obvious. With higher resolution, fewer parameterisations are required. The prospect to perform in the near-term global studies that resolve explicitly the regional scales crucial for AIC development
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" href="#CR123">123</a>
  </span> is very promising. More aircraft travelling in the same regions may not necessarily lead to more AIC coverage due to overlap effects and merging with natural cirrus, thus limiting increases in RF for higher air traffic volume. Moreover, AIC and natural cirrus do not evolve independently
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. A new generation of high-resolution global models explores such effects in the spreading stage with increased confidence.
 </p>
 <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Improving and validating AIC in global models requires an integrative analysis framework that unravels crucial cloud-controlling factors and conditions. Propitious weather conditions leading to large radiative impact of contrail outbreaks are tied to synoptic-scale, enhanced moisture transport and uplift (cooling), in which moderately high ice supersaturation at the same time minimises sedimentation losses and maximises OD by generating ice crystals within an optimal size range
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>, reminiscent of the ‘Goldilocks principle’. A suitable framework combines aircraft and active remote sensing observations and local and regional models to study characteristics of and linkages between individual processes (bottom-up) with passive remote sensing observations, and global models to explore large-scale constraints arising from the coupled dynamics-aerosol-cloud-radiation system (top–down).
