 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate sensitivity parameter serves as a measure of the RF-induced change in globally averaged, equilibrium surface temperature (Box 
  <a rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec7">2</a>). Climate sensitivities for persistent contrails have been derived from equilibrium climate change simulations with two different global models, yielding 0.43 K (W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>)
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>
  </span>) and 0.3 K (W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>)
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>
  </span>), meaning that contrails induce a smaller global temperature change per unit RF than CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. In combination with the most recent IPCC uncertainty range in contrail RF of 5–30 mW m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>), these contrail climate sensitivities imply a global warming contribution of 0.00115—0.03 K. Both studies agree that this temperature response is only weakly correlated geographically with air traffic and dismiss previously suggested influences of contrails on decadal temperature trends over the U.S.A.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>
  </span>. Without specifying the AIC contribution, ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
  </span> simulated for 2006 aviation operations a lower-limit global surface temperature increase of 0.01 K due to all aircraft climate forcings together.
 </p>
 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contrail climate sensitivities mentioned above are at the low end of the overall climate sensitivity uncertainty across climate models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, 0.4–1.2 K (W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>)
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Combining the latter range with the most recent (year 2011) uncertainty range for AIC RF, 20–150 mW m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, leads to a highly uncertain equilibrium global warming contribution of 0.008–0.18 K due to AIC. This may be compared to the range 0.014–0.042 K due to accumulated aviation CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions alone inferred from the associated RF of 35 mW m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), as well as to the estimate of 0.85 (0.65–1.06) K, the global temperature increase due to all anthropogenic activities accumulated over the period 1880 to 2012 (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>
  </span>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More effort is required to understand the causes of spread in AIC RF estimates across different global climate models and methodologies. Total uncertainty estimates should account for correlations between uncertainties due to different processes. Besides a more complete representation (parameterisation) of AIC, an improvement of the representation of natural cirrus in global models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span> is also needed to simulate AIC RF and its dependence on future air traffic patterns and climate change with greater confidence. Understanding forcing-response relationships in the climate system to better quantify surface air temperature changes warrants further scientific scrutiny
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>
  </span>. In particular, time series of AIC RF and climate sensitivity estimates for contrail cirrus are needed to better constrain the contribution of AIC to global warming.
