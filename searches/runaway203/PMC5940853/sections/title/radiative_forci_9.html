                  date since 1999. Purely observational global estimates derive from extrapolating local
                  aircraft and regional satellite data. Pure model estimates are based on or rely upon
                  global model simulations. Uncertainty ranges evaluated across several methodologies
                  are taken from comprehensive assessments. IPCC 1999 assessed persistent contrail RF
                  to be 20 (5–60) mW m
                  <span>−2</span> for air traffic in the year 1992 (ref. 
                  <span><a>4</a></span>), followed by two studies summarising knowledge in the subsequent decade
                  <span><a>11</a>,
                     <a>73</a></span>. A narrower range, 8–20 mW m
                  <span>−2</span>, was provided for the year 2000 after correcting older estimates that include off-line
                  radiative transfer simulations with prescribed contrail coverage and mean optical
                  depth for undetectable contrails
                  <span><a>67</a></span>. Taken together, subsequent climate model simulations and extrapolation from in situ
                  and satellite observations yielded 3–16 mW m
                  <span>−2</span> for air traffic in 2002–2006 (refs. 
                  <span><a>63</a>,
                     <a>69</a>,
                     <a>71</a>,
                     <a>142</a></span>). Relying in part on extrapolation and scaling data from earlier years, the IPCC
                  most recently assessed contrail RF to be 10 (5–30) mW m
                  <span>−2</span> (ref. 
                  <span><a>10</a></span>) for 2011. Refs.

                     <a>11</a>,
                     <a>73</a></span> provided possible RF ranges due to AIC. Ref. 
                  <span><a>6</a></span> estimated for the first time global AIC RF to be 38 mW m
                  <span>−2</span> for air traffic in the year 2002 using a climate model that tracks AIC explicitly;
                  an improved model version
                  <span><a>70</a></span> estimated 56 mW m
                  <span>−2</span> for 2006. AIC RF values 50 mW m
                  <span>−2</span> and 60 mW m
                  <span>−2</span> were predicted for 2006 based on an off-line model that tracks contrail segments
                  forming along flight tracks in combination with weather forecast and climate host
                  models
                  <span><a>52</a>,
                     <a>88</a></span>. In a climate model that regards contrails as a source term for natural clouds, ref.
                  
                  <span><a>69</a></span> reported a global AIC RF of 13 mW m
                  <span>−2</span> for the same reference year. The IPCC best estimate of global net RF due to AIC for
                  air traffic in the year 2011—associated with low confidence—is 50 mW m
                  <span>−2</span> (ref. 
                  <span><a>10</a></span>), corresponding to more than half of the total aviation RF, with a 90% uncertainty
                  range, 20–150 mW m
                  <span>−2</span>. This most recent best estimate does not include indirect effects of aircraft particle
                  emissions on natural clouds

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until 2011, a best central estimate of RF due to contrail cirrus including RF due
         to persistent contrails was not available. This caused large uncertainty in aviation
         RF as a whole. After IPCC 1999, AIC RF estimates have been based on associating air
         traffic with regional trends in cirrus coverage without proof of causality and by
         assuming equal radiative efficiencies of contrails and contrail cirrus
         <span><a>11</a>,
            <a>15</a>,
            <a>72</a>,
            <a>73</a></span>. The first RF estimate for persistent contrails and contrail cirrus was based on
         a global climate model that represents AIC as a separate cloud class
         <span><a>6</a>,
            <a>70</a>,
            <a>74</a></span>. An offsetting feedback of AIC on natural clouds due to humidity and (to a lesser
         degree) temperature changes was estimated with large uncertainty to reduce the direct
         AIC RF by almost 20% (ref. 
         <span><a>6</a></span>). The RF values compiled in Fig. 
         <a>7</a> have not been corrected for this feedback. One climate model
         <span><a>69</a></span> reports much lower AIC RF for 2006 aircraft operations than others, possibly because
         in the model contrails, while evolving consistently with the hydrological cycle, are
         undifferentiated from other clouds. The same model predicts an increase in AIC RF
         from 2006 to 2050 by a factor of seven due to a non-uniform regional increase in air
         traffic and different sensitivities for the forcing in different regions
         <span><a>75</a></span>. While model-based central estimates of AIC RF converged over time, results for current
         traffic levels are not available and the level of scientific uncertainty remains large.
