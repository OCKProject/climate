 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mixing and associated cooling of jet plumes with surrounding air progresses, ambient aerosol particles are gradually mixed into them and exposed to moister and warmer plume air. Ultrafine aqueous particles (UAPs) are generated from gaseous emissions before ice crystals form. UAPs partition into a larger mode that formed on ionised molecules (chemi-ions)

  </span> and an electrically neutral mode too small to contribute significantly to ice nucleation. Fuel combustion produces condensable vapours including water vapour, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, and low-volatile hydrocarbons. Sulphuric acid is produced by oxidation of emitted sulphur oxides and is highly water-soluble. Nitric acid is produced by oxidation of emitted nitrogen oxides and is only taken up by UAPs that are sufficiently diluted (water rich)

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incomplete combustion of carbonaceous phases present in aviation fuel produces aromatic compounds that merge to form elementary spherules. These solid black carbon (soot) aerosol particles grow further into fractal clusters mostly in the size range 10–100 nm and with numbers 10

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>
  </span>. The fractal morphology of soot particles affects the relationship between total soot particle mass and number emissions. Their number and chemical state as well as the size gap between soot and UAP modes vary depending on engine type, engine power setting and type of fuel

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aerosol particles attract water molecules depending on their solubility and on relative humidity. Hygroscopic properties of liquid and mixed (liquid–solid) particles are determined by the chemical nature of the solutes. Insufficient knowledge of the size distribution and the surface-to-vapour interfacial energy (surface tension) renders model predictions of UAP activation into nearly pure water droplets uncertain. Hygroscopic properties of soot particles are mainly determined by chemical oxidants, condensation and particle scavenging processes in the jet exhaust plume producing thin aqueous coatings affecting their droplet formation (water activation) behaviour. In liquid water-supersaturated conditions, the largest and most soluble aerosol particles preferably activate into water droplets. Below contrail formation threshold temperatures, vigorous plume cooling rates (&gt;10 K s
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) generate high supersaturation capable of activating the rather insoluble soot particles
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Modern jet engines extract more heat for propulsion
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">133</a>
  </span>, meaning that plumes stay cooler and therefore develop higher supersaturation for similar water vapour emissions. Activation of plume particles ceases when the newly formed droplets start to quench the supersaturation due to condensational growth. This happens along with homogeneous water droplet freezing at plume temperatures 229–232 K (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first particles to freeze are the water droplets originating from the largest soot particles and the more water soluble but much less abundant (equivalent to 10
  <span class="sup">12</span>–10
  <span class="sup">13</span> (kg-fuel)
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) ambient particles. UAPs contribute to the pool of water droplets only if plume supersaturation is high enough to overcome the size (Kelvin) barrier for activation, i.e., if soot particles are removed from the exhaust to an extent that they no longer act as the primary condensational sink for water vapour and if temperatures fall significantly below formation threshold temperatures
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. Desulphurising jet fuel decreases the size of UAPs and turns them into less potent droplet forming agents.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laboratory studies suggest that exhaust water vapour by itself will neither form water droplets nor ice crystals
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. About one third of aviation soot particles achieved a surface coverage of significant amounts of soluble material and activated into water droplets; ice formation set in at a relative humidity only slightly below liquid water saturation, where liquid water starts to nucleate ice homogeneously in UAPs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. However, the frozen soot fraction was very small (&lt;5%), consistent with small amounts (1% by volume) of soluble coatings as found in other measurements
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Together, these findings support the notion of homogeneous droplet freezing as the predominant ice nucleation mode in fresh contrails.
