Purely observational global estimates derive from extrapolating local aircraft and regional satellite data. Pure model estimates are based on or rely upon global model simulations. Uncertainty ranges evaluated across several methodologies are taken from comprehensive assessments. IPCC 1999 assessed persistent contrail RF to be 20 (5–60) mW m

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until 2011, a best central estimate of RF due to contrail cirrus including RF due to persistent contrails was not available. This caused large uncertainty in aviation RF as a whole. After IPCC 1999, AIC RF estimates have been based on associating air traffic with regional trends in cirrus coverage without proof of causality and by assuming equal radiative efficiencies of contrails and contrail cirrus

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>
  </span>. An offsetting feedback of AIC on natural clouds due to humidity and (to a lesser degree) temperature changes was estimated with large uncertainty to reduce the direct AIC RF by almost 20% (ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>). The RF values compiled in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> have not been corrected for this feedback. One climate model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>
  </span> reports much lower AIC RF for 2006 aircraft operations than others, possibly because in the model contrails, while evolving consistently with the hydrological cycle, are undifferentiated from other clouds. The same model predicts an increase in AIC RF from 2006 to 2050 by a factor of seven due to a non-uniform regional increase in air traffic and different sensitivities for the forcing in different regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>
