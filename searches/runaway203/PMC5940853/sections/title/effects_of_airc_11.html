      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Full quantification of aircraft-induced cloudiness changes is hampered by a lack of
         knowledge on whether and how particle emissions affect natural liquid phase and ice
         phase clouds. Climate models indicate that increases in upper tropospheric sulphate
         and soot particle mass concentrations due to aviation emissions are at least tenfold
         smaller compared to other sources
         <span><a>82</a></span>. They also suggest that aircraft emissions increase the number concentrations of
         fine (sizes &lt; 100 nm) aerosol particles significantly in some areas
         <span><a>82</a>,
            <a>83</a></span>. Soot particles, regardless of their source, do not appear to contribute much to
         natural cirrus formation
         <span><a>84</a>,
            <a>85</a></span>. In contrast, sufficiently large sulphate particles tend to be efficient liquid cloud
         nucleating agents; several climate models predict significant modification of low
         level liquid phase clouds by emissions of small aircraft sulphate particles
         <span><a>82</a>,
            <a>83</a>,
            <a>86</a></span>. A global model study of the influence of soot particles emitted by aircraft and
         other sources on natural cirrus found RF estimates that would dominate the total aviation
         RF, but the sign of the simulated forcing could not be ascertained
         <span><a>87</a></span>. A contrail model run within a climate model predicted reductions in the total water
         column and high- and low-level cloud coverage
         <span><a>88</a></span>. Based on the assumption that aircraft soot particles—once preconditioned in contrails—act
         as highly efficient ice forming agents, one climate model predicted substantial effects
         on natural cirrus
         <span><a>89</a></span>. This relied, in part, on assumptions of how ice forms in background cirrus—a matter
         of current debate
         <span><a>61</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the lack of observational evidence for effects of aircraft particle emissions
         on natural clouds and the poor model treatment of underlying processes, reducing scientific
         uncertainty and building confidence in these effects remain challenging.
