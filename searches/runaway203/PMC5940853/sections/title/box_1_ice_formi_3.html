      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mixing and associated cooling of jet plumes with surrounding air progresses, ambient
         aerosol particles are gradually mixed into them and exposed to moister and warmer
         plume air. Ultrafine aqueous particles (UAPs) are generated from gaseous emissions
         before ice crystals form. UAPs partition into a larger mode that formed on ionised
         molecules (chemi-ions)
         <span><a>41</a>,
            <a>128</a></span> and an electrically neutral mode too small to contribute significantly to ice nucleation.
         Fuel combustion produces condensable vapours including water vapour, sulphuric acid,
         nitric acid, and low-volatile hydrocarbons. Sulphuric acid is produced by oxidation
         of emitted sulphur oxides and is highly water-soluble. Nitric acid is produced by
         oxidation of emitted nitrogen oxides and is only taken up by UAPs that are sufficiently
         diluted (water rich)
         <span><a>129</a></span>. The chemical nature of organic compounds from emissions of unburned hydrocarbons
         in aircraft exhaust is poorly characterised. The number of UAPs in the chemi-ion mode,
         exceeding 10
         <span>17</span> per kg of fuel burnt
         <span><a>41</a></span>, is insensitive to variations of, and UAP sizes (1–10 nm) increase with, the sulphur
         content in the fuel
         <span><a>130</a>,
            <a>131</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incomplete combustion of carbonaceous phases present in aviation fuel produces aromatic
         compounds that merge to form elementary spherules. These solid black carbon (soot)
         aerosol particles grow further into fractal clusters mostly in the size range 10–100 nm
         and with numbers 10
         <span>14</span>–10
         <span>15</span> per kg-fuel
         <span><a>93</a></span>. The fractal morphology of soot particles affects the relationship between total
         soot particle mass and number emissions. Their number and chemical state as well as
         the size gap between soot and UAP modes vary depending on engine type, engine power
         setting and type of fuel
         <span><a>93</a>,
            <a>132</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aerosol particles attract water molecules depending on their solubility and on relative
         humidity. Hygroscopic properties of liquid and mixed (liquid–solid) particles are
         determined by the chemical nature of the solutes. Insufficient knowledge of the size
         distribution and the surface-to-vapour interfacial energy (surface tension) renders
         model predictions of UAP activation into nearly pure water droplets uncertain. Hygroscopic
         properties of soot particles are mainly determined by chemical oxidants, condensation
         and particle scavenging processes in the jet exhaust plume producing thin aqueous
         coatings affecting their droplet formation (water activation) behaviour. In liquid
         water-supersaturated conditions, the largest and most soluble aerosol particles preferably
         activate into water droplets. Below contrail formation threshold temperatures, vigorous
         plume cooling rates (&gt;10 K s
         <span>−1</span>) generate high supersaturation capable of activating the rather insoluble soot particles
         <span><a>28</a></span>. Modern jet engines extract more heat for propulsion
         <span><a>133</a></span>, meaning that plumes stay cooler and therefore develop higher supersaturation for
         similar water vapour emissions. Activation of plume particles ceases when the newly
         formed droplets start to quench the supersaturation due to condensational growth.
         This happens along with homogeneous water droplet freezing at plume temperatures 229–232 K
         (ref. 
         <span><a>28</a></span>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first particles to freeze are the water droplets originating from the largest
         soot particles and the more water soluble but much less abundant (equivalent to 10
         <span>12</span>–10
         <span>13</span> (kg-fuel)
         <span>−1</span>) ambient particles. UAPs contribute to the pool of water droplets only if plume supersaturation
         is high enough to overcome the size (Kelvin) barrier for activation, i.e., if soot
         particles are removed from the exhaust to an extent that they no longer act as the
         primary condensational sink for water vapour and if temperatures fall significantly
         below formation threshold temperatures
         <span><a>37</a></span>. Desulphurising jet fuel decreases the size of UAPs and turns them into less potent
         droplet forming agents.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laboratory studies suggest that exhaust water vapour by itself will neither form water
         droplets nor ice crystals
         <span><a>22</a></span>. About one third of aviation soot particles achieved a surface coverage of significant
         amounts of soluble material and activated into water droplets; ice formation set in
         at a relative humidity only slightly below liquid water saturation, where liquid water
         starts to nucleate ice homogeneously in UAPs
         <span><a>23</a></span>. However, the frozen soot fraction was very small (&lt;5%), consistent with small amounts
         (1% by volume) of soluble coatings as found in other measurements
         <span><a>24</a></span>. Together, these findings support the notion of homogeneous droplet freezing as the
         predominant ice nucleation mode in fresh contrails.
