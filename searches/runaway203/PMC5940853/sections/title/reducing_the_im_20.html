      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reducing the impact of AIC on climate</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Commercial aircraft are in service for 20â€“30 years meaning that adoption of new technologies
         from research to integration takes many decades. Therefore, in addition to scientific
         challenges, the implementation of AIC mitigation options also faces engineering and
         economical hurdles and will only be realised when disruptive change in the air transportation
         system can be avoided. Accomodating the expected growth in air travel while reducing
         the impact of AIC RF may require a combination of options.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) agreed upon a carbon offsetting
         and reduction scheme for global aviation
         <span><a>125</a></span>, but does not explicitly address AIC in their environmental protection activities.
         Integrating AIC in these activities would constitute an important stepping stone in
         support of widespread implementation of AIC mitigation options. The use of biofuels
         has already been initiated by the aviation industry in the necessary transition away
         from fossil-based fuels. Besides implementing a standard for carbon neutral growth,
         ICAO has also developed certified testing procedures applying from 2020 for particulate
         emissions from aircraft engines based on particle mass and number
         <span><a>125</a></span>. This action facilitates the realisation of mitigation solutions addressing formation
         stage (emission-related) processes and holds promise to reduce AIC effects on climate
         on short time scales
         <span><a>96</a></span>. With regard to the spreading stage, while an interim strategy has been conceived
         <span><a>126</a></span>, ATM is considered to offer a potential long-term solution as meteorological forecast
         skills mature and if ATM proves to be flexible enough to allocate climate-compatible
         flight routes quickly and safely.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compelling evidence has been presented as to the urgency to prevent human activities
         from causing unacceptable environmental change
         <span><a>127</a></span>. Studying climate change in response to AIC involves basic scientific challenges
         and is important to address in the larger context of how anthropogenic activities
         affect natural cirrus clouds and climate
         <span><a>61</a></span>. Better understanding the radiative response of contrail cirrus as it emerges from
         coupled meteorological and microphysical controls requires an integrative approach
         aiming at understanding on the process level at small scales and at the same time
         be cognisant of interactions that operate on large scales.
