 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robust RF estimates of this potential contribution to AIC RF are missing due to lack of observational evidence and uncertainties in underlying mechanisms and their parameterisation. Mechanisms include modification of ultrafine aqueous plume aerosols during transport from cruise altitudes to lower cloud levels and pre-activation of emitted soot particles in contrails. Given the small size and the substantial fraction of organic matter in aqueous plume particles and the largely insoluble nature of exhaust soot (Box

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" href="#CR114">114</a>
  </span> are neither expected to be efficient liquid cloud-nucleating particles nor potent heterogeneous ice nuclei. This casts doubt on their capability to facilitate cloud water droplet or ice crystal formation in atmospheric conditions. Pre-activation refers to an increase in an aerosol particle’s freezing temperature after ice nucleation occurred. While pre-activation has been observed in laboratory settings, it is not known whether it occurs on aircraft-emitted, small (&lt;100 nm) soot particles in the atmosphere or in contrails.

 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Liquid aerosol particles produced from gaseous aircraft engine emissions are influenced by fuel composition (Box 
  <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">1</a>) but are not well represented in emission inventories used to initialise global models. They must be specified to estimate the formation and evolution of ultrafine aqueous plume particles. The sulphur dioxide (SO
  <sub>2</sub>) emission index in kerosene varies widely around a mean value ≈1 g (kg-fuel)
  <span class="sup">−1</span> depending on the origin of the crude oil

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>; most jet fuel has lower emissions. The fraction of SO
  <sub>2</sub> converted to condensable sulphuric acid at emission (few %) and the mass and chemical nature of emissions of condensable organic vapours are not well known. With regard to aircraft-emitted soot particles, emission inventories only provide mass-based soot emissions

  </span>—often as a single, fleet-averaged surface-level value—from which particle numbers at cruise are inferred using empirical correlations. This seriously underestimates variability in soot particle numbers in contrails at formation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To parameterise aqueous plume particle formation and contrail ice nucleation properly in climate models, it is necessary to inform global aircraft emission inventories with additional sulphate/organics mass and soot particle number emissions. Such improved inventories better represent aviation activity and allow for more realistic simulations of the formation stage, AIC RF and effects on natural clouds by way of parameterisation.</p>
