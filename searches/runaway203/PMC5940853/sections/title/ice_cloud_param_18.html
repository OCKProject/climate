      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the one hand, instrumental challenges pose significant limitations in measurements
         of microphysical and optical properties of contrail cirrus. This heightens the role
         of models (Table 
         <a>2</a>) in providing RF estimates. On the other hand, improved scientific understanding
         is required before embarking on parameterisation.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local scale process and fluid-dynamical models systematically explore how plume turbulence
         and wake dynamics affects nucleation and properties of contrail ice crystals (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>) and how predictions of nucleated ice numbers (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>) and sublimation losses (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>) relate to aircraft measurements. Cloud-resolving and regional models—driven with
         appropriate meteorological boundary conditions and combined with optical parameterisations
         capturing the SW response of µm-sized ice crystals—analyse large atmospheric regions
         based on collocated aircraft and satellite measurements to better judge AIC RF and
         the radiative significance of natural cirrus perturbed by contrails. These models
         capture variability in ice supersaturation and are employed to drive LES to gain more
         detailed understanding of the contrail-to-contrail cirrus transition. Global models
         use information regarding properties of thin ice supersaturated layers (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>) derived from high-resolution simulations or radiosonde data
         <span><a>122</a></span> to improve their representation of AIC supporting areas
         <span><a>50</a></span>. They also use parameterisations of formation stage processes to initialise AIC properties
         and rely on progress in simulating the formation of natural cirrus more realistically
         <span><a>61</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global models represent much of the system complexity, but account for processes and
         their variability affecting RF only to a degree, depending on the model’s representation
         of clouds. They track atmospheric motion and clouds with ≈10 min time steps and represent
         them with coarse spatial resolution. This means that formation and effects of clouds
         must be parameterised. Cloud microphysical and optical variables evolve on unresolved
         temporal and spatial scales. The connection of unresolved processes to resolved (large-scale)
         model variables is not always obvious. With higher resolution, fewer parameterisations
         are required. The prospect to perform in the near-term global studies that resolve
         explicitly the regional scales crucial for AIC development
         <span><a>123</a></span> is very promising. More aircraft travelling in the same regions may not necessarily
         lead to more AIC coverage due to overlap effects and merging with natural cirrus,
         thus limiting increases in RF for higher air traffic volume. Moreover, AIC and natural
         cirrus do not evolve independently
         <span><a>6</a>,
            <a>49</a></span>. A new generation of high-resolution global models explores such effects in the spreading
         stage with increased confidence.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Improving and validating AIC in global models requires an integrative analysis framework
         that unravels crucial cloud-controlling factors and conditions. Propitious weather
         conditions leading to large radiative impact of contrail outbreaks are tied to synoptic-scale,
         enhanced moisture transport and uplift (cooling), in which moderately high ice supersaturation
         at the same time minimises sedimentation losses and maximises OD by generating ice
         crystals within an optimal size range
         <span><a>31</a></span>, reminiscent of the ‘Goldilocks principle’. A suitable framework combines aircraft
         and active remote sensing observations and local and regional models to study characteristics
         of and linkages between individual processes (bottom-up) with passive remote sensing
         observations, and global models to explore large-scale constraints arising from the
         coupled dynamics-aerosol-cloud-radiation system (top–down).
