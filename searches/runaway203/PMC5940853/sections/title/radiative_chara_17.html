      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Radiative transfer parameterisations commonly used in climate models are designed
         to represent effects of natural cirrus that are composed of ice crystals, whose mean
         maximum dimensions hardly fall below 10 µm. In dense flight corridors, AIC might on
         average be composed of such small ice crystals
         <span><a>17</a>,
            <a>118</a></span>. As neither geometric optics nor Mie theory accurately describe such cases, other
         optical models might be employed to provide more realistic parameterisations of ice
         crystal scattering properties in contrails and contrail cirrus. Shapes of small ice
         crystals are largely unconstrained by direct observations (Box 
         <a>2</a>), constituting a significant drawback in applying advanced optical parameterisations.
         Before being implemented in global models, such parameterisations might be tested
         in regional models providing more detailed information on ice crystal size and habit
         distributions. This better constrains SW radiative transfer calculations and helps
         improve estimates of AIC RF and climate sensitivity.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Solar radiation fluxes declined from the 1950s to 1980s and partially recovered since
         mid-1980s
         <span><a>119</a></span>. A statistically significant increase in broadband (wavelength-integrated) SW radiation
         at the Earth’s surface in cloudless scenes has been observed at several locations
         across the continental U.S.A. in the period 1996–2007 (ref. 
         <span><a>120</a></span>). The observed trend was almost entirely due to an increase in the diffuse irradiance,
         while the direct component remained virtually unchanged, ruling out a concomitant
         decrease in atmospheric aerosol OD as the sole cause of the increase. Recent analyses
         using diffuse SW spectral measurements
         <span><a>121</a></span> confirmed this trend coined as ‘clear-sky whitening’. Ref. 
         <span><a>121</a></span> hypothesised that while a decreased aerosol load did increase the total SW irradiance,
         an increase in subvisible contrail-generated ice crystal ‘haze’ repartitioned this
         increase from the direct into the diffuse component. Formation and spreading stage
         processes including radiative effects of small ice crystals must be understood well
         to explore this plausible hypothesis.
