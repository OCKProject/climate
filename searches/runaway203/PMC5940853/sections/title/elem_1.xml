  </span>. Ice supersaturation denotes sufficiently cold and moist atmospheric conditions—relative to saturation with respect to the ice phase—that influence radiative properties, extent and lifetimes of all cirrus cloud types and is required for contrails to be long-lived and evolve into contrail cirrus (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Duration and extent of ice supersaturated regions and the magnitude of ice supersaturation within them strongly depend on the synoptic (meteorological) situation and set upper limits for the lifetime and extent of AIC. Outside ice supersaturated areas in drier or warmer (ice subsaturated) air, contrails may still form, but are only short-lived and thus stay narrow with small areal coverage, leaving little to no impact on RF. Cirrus ice crystals form around microscopic aerosol particles. What sets AIC primarily apart from natural cirrus is the aircraft-dominated formation stage, wherein jet engine emissions, modified in aircraft wakes, result in a larger number of smaller ice crystals

    <p>AIC subsume persistent contrails and contrail cirrus and potentially clouds either formed or modified by aircraft soot and sulphate particle emissions. In this review, the latter are not included in AIC due to lack of observational evidence of their existence. Contrails are line-shaped at formation and may attain irregular shapes due to non-uniform winds, turbulent (random) motions and humidity fluctuations at some point during their lifetime. Long-lived contrails spread out due to wind shear that is common at cruise altitudes. Those maintaining a linear shape are referred to as persistent contrails. Irregular-shaped contrail cirrus cannot be easily distinguished from natural cirrus hampering their observation. Dimensions of contrail cirrus clouds depend on poorly known morphologies and have not been studied systematically, but are likely highly variable. At northern middle latitudes, individual ice supersaturated regions may have lifetimes of several days

Contrail occurrence is predicted with confidence, if ambient pressure and relative humidity, water vapour and heat emissions, and propulsive characteristics of aircraft engines are known. The underlying definition of threshold temperatures rests on the assumption that exhaust plumes surpass water saturated conditions (water saturation constraint). The thermodynamic approach is not capable of predicting formation (nucleation) pathways and microphysical properties of ice crystals in contrails.

Plumes from multiple aircraft engines merge with two wing tip vortices, forming an inhomogeneous wake. The further evolution of ice crystals depends largely on fluid-dynamical processes (vortex regime). The downward motion of the vortex pair warms the air causing ice crystal sublimation in the lower part of the wake. A small contrail fraction is released from the jets remaining at flight level and enhanced by detrainment of air from the lower wake.

Plumes from multiple aircraft engines merge with the vortex pair, forming an inhomogeneous wake. The further evolution of ice crystals depends on the interaction between jet plumes and wake vortices. The vortex pair, in which most of the contrail is captured, descends some 100 m below the flight level. This downward motion leads to a partial loss of ice crystals due to sublimation in the lower part of the wake. Ice crystals present in the upper wake continue to grow by uptake of entrained ice supersaturated water vapour. After few minutes of contrail age, the wake-averaged ice crystal size distribution contains signatures of nucleation, growth and sublimation. Eventually, flow instability triggered by turbulence causes the organised flow pattern to collapse and mix with ambient air, terminating the formation stage. Evolution of ice crystals in engine plumes and aircraft wakes depend on ambient conditions and on the type of aircraft and jet engines, as borne out by fluid-dynamical simulations

Hygroscopic properties of liquid and mixed (liquid–solid) particles are determined by the chemical nature of the solutes. Insufficient knowledge of the size distribution and the surface-to-vapour interfacial energy (surface tension) renders model predictions of UAP activation into nearly pure water droplets uncertain. Hygroscopic properties of soot particles are mainly determined by chemical oxidants, condensation and particle scavenging processes in the jet exhaust plume producing thin aqueous coatings affecting their droplet formation (water activation) behaviour. In liquid water-supersaturated conditions, the largest and most soluble aerosol particles preferably activate into water droplets. Below contrail formation threshold temperatures, vigorous plume cooling rates (&gt;10 K s

Water droplet formation followed by homogeneous freezing defines a minimal microphysical framework.

While it is computationally too expensive to treat ice nucleation explicitly in large-eddy simulation (LES) codes, they have been employed to study effects of aircraft wake development on ice crystals. In this regard, LES have provided valuable insights into systematic dependencies of ice crystal losses on aircraft-dependent and atmospheric variables.</p>

   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Over time, persistent contrails lose their initial linear shape and transition into contrail cirrus. They overlap and merge in traffic-congested areas, forming extended ice cloud layers that vary in shape, depth and lifetime and differ from natural cirrus in terms of microphysical, optical and geometrical properties. Ice supersaturated layers supporting them differ in vertical structure and horizontal area and the exchange of water molecules between vapour and ice phases within them.

     <p>Factors affecting the development of aircraft-induced clouds. Areal cloud coverage increases due to vertical shear of horizontal wind components. Turbulent mixing (entrainment) forces ice crystal concentrations to decrease (dilute) over time. Ice crystal sizes increase by uptake (deposition) of water vapour from ice-supersaturated layers. Sustained deposition growth causes ice crystal shapes (habits) to deviate from initial isometry. The shapes of ice crystals, which are only poorly known and illustrated as droxtals, hexagonal prisms and columns, bullet rosettes and aggregates, affect their size-dependent growth and fall rates and optical properties. Ice crystals with maximum dimensions &gt;30 µm settle (sediment) due to gravity with fall speeds &gt;100 m h
      <span class="sup">−1</span> and sublimate in warmer or drier air, while smaller crystals remain around the flight levels due to negligible fall speeds as long as some supersaturation can be maintained depending on the meteorological situation. The efficiency of sedimentation depends on the depositional growth rate, i.e., on ice supersaturation, the rate of cooling of air, and on ice crystal size, habit and number concentration. Sedimentation increases the vertical extent of AIC, which, in turn, enhances the rate of spreading and therefore coverage in a sheared flow. Sustained warming and drying due to large-scale subsidence dissolves AIC entirely. Ice crystal images adapted from ref.

   <span class="bold">a</span>): it decreases the energy lost to outer space, enhancing the temperature in the atmosphere below the cloud and at the Earth’s surface (cloud greenhouse forcing). Cloud ice crystals affect RF by reducing thermal emission (radiant energy with 
   <span class="italic">λ</span> &gt; 4 µm) to space via absorption and re-emission of LW radiation at cold temperatures. Contrary to low clouds composed mainly of liquid water droplets (
   <span class="bold">b</span>), high ice clouds are often optically thin (

   <span class="bold"> d</span>), i.e., partially transparent to solar radiation (
   <span class="italic">λ</span> ≈ 0.2–4 µm), meaning their ability to scatter SW radiation back to space (albedo forcing) is small. The greenhouse forcing is stronger for higher and colder clouds, in which ice crystals are increasingly abundant. The net average diurnal RF due to thin cirrus and contrails is a small positive residual from the wavelength-integrated SW and LW forcings. RF contributions due to thickening of natural cirrus by embedded contrails and new ice crystal formation in contrail areas with low ice crystal concentrations, blurring the distinction between natural cirrus and contrail cirrus, have not yet been determined.
