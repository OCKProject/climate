      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variability in cloud properties—conveniently illustrated with the help of probability
         distribution functions (PDFs)—arises from variations in meteorological conditions
         and from cloud heterogeneity. Both sources of variability affect OD and hence RF and
         are not fully captured by global models. Large variability in microphysical and optical
         properties was observed in aircraft measurements of young (age &lt;10–30 min) contrails

            <a>64</a></span>. In addition to satellite observations, high-resolution lidar
         <span><a>47</a></span> and cloud models
         <span><a>65</a></span> show marked variability in properties and RF of ageing persistent contrails.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
         <a>6</a> displays schematically the characteristic shapes of variability of four key meteorological
         drivers of AIC development. Those PDFs drive a contrail microphysical model
         <span><a>65</a></span> simulating in ice supersaturated conditions the dilution and spreading of contrails
         along with depositional growth and sedimentation of ice crystals within them. Figure 
         <a>6</a> also depicts the resulting model PDF of contrail OD and its cumulant, along with
         an observed cumulative PDF
         <span><a>56</a></span>. The model PDF derives from an analysis of satellite observations
         <span><a>66</a></span> and contains many optically thin and even invisible portions within contrails. This
         indicates that contrails that are non-detectable by passive remote sensing and invisible
         by ground-based observers may exert a non-negligible RF despite their low OD, since
         they are likely associated with large coverage

               <p>Variability in contrail optical depth. Probability distributions (PDF) of contrail
                  optical depth, OD, and (top) the cumulative distribution (
                  <span>a</span>) simulated by an idealised contrail model. The model PDF (
                  <span>b</span>) was obtained (i) by solving an equation governing the evolution of the ice crystal
                  size distribution accounting for mixing-induced dilution, shear-induced spreading,
                  sedimentation and growth by vapour uptake and (ii) by imposing on this solution variability
                  in meteorological factors described by probability distributions (inset) of air temperature,
                  
                  <span>T</span>, ice supersaturation (accounting for unresolved vertical air motion variability),
                  
                  <span>s</span><sub>i</sub>, vertical shear of horizontal winds, 
                  <span>σ</span>, and thickness of ice supersaturated layers, Δ

                  results
                  <span><a>65</a></span> are compared with satellite observations
                  <span><a>56</a></span> of contrails over the eastern North Pacific in the year 2001. According to the model
                  analysis
                  <span><a>66</a></span>, the measurements detected only 39% of all contrails over the whole OD range, 49%
                  are subvisible (OD &lt; 0.02) and 11% are not optically thin (OD &gt; 0.3). By comparing
                  simulated and observed PDF, detection efficiencies, 
                  <span>ε</span>, were inferred: 11.5% for data in the range 0&lt; OD ≤ 0.05; 49% for 0.05 &lt; OD ≤ 0.1;
                  94.5% for 0.1 &lt; OD ≤ 0.2; and 100% for OD &gt; 0.2, partly overlapping with values derived
                  with other methods and in other conditions
                  <span><a>59</a></span>. After adjusting the model PDF for inefficient detection using these efficiencies
                  (horizontal arrow), it replicates the observed cumulant (stepped curve). Overall,
                  applying the detection efficiency curve is consistent with a single cut-off OD value
                  of 0.04, the upper limit OD value of the hatched area marking undetected (and partly
                  invisible) contrails. The mean OD of all simulated contrails is 0.15, translating
                  into 0.29 when corrected for non-detectable contrails. The corrected OD is roughly
                  in line with the observed mean value, 0.24, that overestimates the model mean value
                  of all contrails by ≈63%
