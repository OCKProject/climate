      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate sensitivity parameter serves as a measure of the RF-induced change in
         globally averaged, equilibrium surface temperature (Box 
         <a>2</a>). Climate sensitivities for persistent contrails have been derived from equilibrium
         climate change simulations with two different global models, yielding 0.43 K (W m
         <span>−2</span>)
         <span>−1</span> (ref. 
         <span><a>76</a></span>) and 0.3 K (W m
         <span>−2</span>)
         <span>−1</span> (ref. 
         <span><a>77</a></span>), meaning that contrails induce a smaller global temperature change per unit RF than
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions. In combination with the most recent IPCC uncertainty range in contrail
         RF of 5–30 mW m
         <span>−2</span> (Fig. 
         <a>7</a>), these contrail climate sensitivities imply a global warming contribution of 0.00115—0.03 K.
         Both studies agree that this temperature response is only weakly correlated geographically
         with air traffic and dismiss previously suggested influences of contrails on decadal
         temperature trends over the U.S.A.
         <span><a>15</a>,
            <a>78</a></span>. Without specifying the AIC contribution, ref. 
         <span><a>79</a></span> simulated for 2006 aviation operations a lower-limit global surface temperature increase
         of 0.01 K due to all aircraft climate forcings together.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contrail climate sensitivities mentioned above are at the low end of the overall
         climate sensitivity uncertainty across climate models
         <span><a>7</a></span>, 0.4–1.2 K (W m
         <span>−2</span>)
         <span>−1</span>. Combining the latter range with the most recent (year 2011) uncertainty range for
         AIC RF, 20–150 mW m
         <span>−2</span>, leads to a highly uncertain equilibrium global warming contribution of 0.008–0.18 K
         due to AIC. This may be compared to the range 0.014–0.042 K due to accumulated aviation
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions alone inferred from the associated RF of 35 mW m
         <span>−2</span> (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>), as well as to the estimate of 0.85 (0.65–1.06) K, the global temperature increase
         due to all anthropogenic activities accumulated over the period 1880 to 2012 (ref.
         
         <span><a>80</a></span>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More effort is required to understand the causes of spread in AIC RF estimates across
         different global climate models and methodologies. Total uncertainty estimates should
         account for correlations between uncertainties due to different processes. Besides
         a more complete representation (parameterisation) of AIC, an improvement of the representation
         of natural cirrus in global models
         <span><a>61</a></span> is also needed to simulate AIC RF and its dependence on future air traffic patterns
         and climate change with greater confidence. Understanding forcing-response relationships
         in the climate system to better quantify surface air temperature changes warrants
         further scientific scrutiny
         <span><a>81</a></span>. In particular, time series of AIC RF and climate sensitivity estimates for contrail
         cirrus are needed to better constrain the contribution of AIC to global warming.
