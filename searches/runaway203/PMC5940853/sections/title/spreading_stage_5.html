      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microphysical and optical properties of ice crystals in contrails change as they spread
         or transition into contrail cirrus, depending on the meteorological situation and
         microphysical processes (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). Over time, persistent contrails lose their initial linear shape and transition
         into contrail cirrus. They overlap and merge in traffic-congested areas, forming extended
         ice cloud layers that vary in shape, depth and lifetime and differ from natural cirrus
         in terms of microphysical, optical and geometrical properties. Ice supersaturated
         layers supporting them differ in vertical structure and horizontal area and the exchange
         of water molecules between vapour and ice phases within them. All these factors influence
         the RF potential of AIC (Box 
         <a>2</a>). Much of the knowledge about spreading contrails summarised below stems from space-borne
         observations
         <span><a>15</a>,
            <a>40</a></span>; little progress has been made since IPCC 1999 (ref. 
         <span><a>4</a></span>) in quantifying lifecycles of contrail cirrus and in identifying and understanding
         factors controlling them.

               <p>Factors affecting the development of aircraft-induced clouds. Areal cloud coverage
                  increases due to vertical shear of horizontal wind components. Turbulent mixing (entrainment)
                  forces ice crystal concentrations to decrease (dilute) over time. Ice crystal sizes
                  increase by uptake (deposition) of water vapour from ice-supersaturated layers. Sustained
                  deposition growth causes ice crystal shapes (habits) to deviate from initial isometry.
                  The shapes of ice crystals, which are only poorly known and illustrated as droxtals,
                  hexagonal prisms and columns, bullet rosettes and aggregates, affect their size-dependent
                  growth and fall rates and optical properties. Ice crystals with maximum dimensions
                  &gt;30 µm settle (sediment) due to gravity with fall speeds &gt;100 m h
                  <span>−1</span> and sublimate in warmer or drier air, while smaller crystals remain around the flight
                  levels due to negligible fall speeds as long as some supersaturation can be maintained
                  depending on the meteorological situation. The efficiency of sedimentation depends
                  on the depositional growth rate, i.e., on ice supersaturation, the rate of cooling
                  of air, and on ice crystal size, habit and number concentration. Sedimentation increases
                  the vertical extent of AIC, which, in turn, enhances the rate of spreading and therefore
                  coverage in a sheared flow. Sustained warming and drying due to large-scale subsidence
                  dissolves AIC entirely. Ice crystal images adapted from ref.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While formation conditions including those for short-lived contrails are frequently
         met at cruise altitudes
         <span><a>19</a></span>, the fraction of ice supersaturated areas in which aircraft actually fly is relatively
         small (10–15%) (ref. 
         <span><a>44</a></span>). Projected changes of extent and frequency of occurrence of ice supersaturated regions
         in the upper troposphere have implications for contrail formation
         <span><a>45</a></span>. Persistent contrails may merge with or form in natural cirrus
         <span><a>40</a>,
            <a>46</a>–
            <a>49</a></span>. AIC can be transported considerable distances (many 100 km) away from their source
         regions, therefore contrails and contrail cirrus may be found in areas where formation
         conditions are not met
         <span><a>50</a></span>. Over congested airspace, they manifest as ice cloud layers (‘contrail outbreaks’),
         which can extend over as much as 100,000 km
         <span>2</span> and are readily apparent in satellite imagery
         <span><a>16</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Optical properties of ice crystals influence AIC RF. Cloud optical depth (OD) measures
         the attenuation of radiation passing through cloud (Box 
         <a>2</a>) and is often reported at a wavelength in the visible part of the radiation spectrum.
         AIC RF is roughly proportional to OD and areal cloud coverage. Estimates of spatial
         coverage and radiative properties of optically thin (transparent) ice clouds depend
         on thresholds for determining their boundaries. Those thresholds could be a lower
         OD limit in remote sensing observations or a lower limit of ice water content in in
         situ measurements.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite remote sensing reveals slight seasonal differences in contrail mean OD (average
         value 0.22) and particle effective diameter (36 µm) without diurnal variations
         <span><a>51</a></span>. Changes in the diurnal cycle of coverage and outgoing radiation in the North Atlantic
         region were estimated in correlation with air traffic
         <span><a>52</a></span>. Another study determined cloud properties formed during several contrail outbreaks
         that occurred over North America
         <span><a>53</a></span>. Both studies reported persistent contrails embedded in cirrus or sharing an atmospheric
         column with extant cirrus and suggested enhancements in OD and effective ice crystal
         size over the values found for contrails alone. A study quantified over the eastern
         North Pacific statistically the effect of contrails on OD of already existing cirrus,
         resulting in enhanced cirrus OD inside selected flight tracks, mostly in vertically
         thinner ice clouds
         <span><a>49</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some space borne observations include lidar measurements with increased temporal and
         spatial resolution of, and sensitivity to, optically thin contrails, assisted by manual
         detection
         <span><a>54</a></span> or an automated tracking algorithm able to follow for some time a fraction of spreading
         contrails that are no longer line-shaped
         <span><a>55</a></span>. These studies have yielded values of mean geometrical thickness of 670 m, average
         contrail top altitude (temperature) of 10.9–11.7 km (≈219 K) and OD of 0.19–0.34,
         showing that contrails are mostly optically thin (OD &lt; 0.3) in line with other studies
         <span><a>56</a></span>. Differences in the results of these studies reflect variability in microphysical
         and optical properties and meteorological conditions, differences in observation regions
         and air traffic activity, and inherent differences in detection methods.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Detectability of AIC from space depends on a large number of factors related to OD
         <span><a>15</a>,
            <a>57</a></span>. The optically thinnest ice clouds escape detection when using satellite-based, passive
         remote sensing methods that rely on upwelling radiance measurements, because detection
         efficiencies decline rapidly at low (&lt;0.1) OD
         <span><a>58</a>,
            <a>59</a></span>. Meaningful comparisons of observed AIC properties, acquired via aircraft data sets
         <span><a>17</a>,
            <a>25</a></span>, with models are often precluded due to: missing information on contrail source aircraft
         and local formation conditions; sparse sampling of AIC that exhibit large spatial
         variability; poorly constrained dilution factors reducing ice crystal number concentrations;
         counting and chemically analysing small (sizes &lt;0.01 µm) aerosol particles; counting
         and sizing errors in ice crystal size distributions taken with optical spectrometers;
         inability to directly measure with imaging probes the shapes of ice crystals with
         maximum dimensions &lt;40 µm; and substantial uncertainties in measurements of supersaturation
         and ice water content—the amount of cloud ice per unit volume of air. Few attempts
         have been made
         <span><a>30</a></span> to relate ice crystal size distributions of AIC from in situ measurements
         <span><a>17</a>,
            <a>60</a></span> to microphysical simulations of the formation stage. While AIC might be detected
         in situ through a combination of measured aircraft co-emissions of NO
         <sub><span>x</span></sub> and model-based trajectory analyses
         <span><a>17</a></span>, all types of observations remain inconclusive regarding the ability to separate
         contrail cirrus from natural cirrus due to the large variability in geometrical and
         microphysical properties of the latter. Moreover, it is difficult in dense traffic
         areas to determine whether natural cirrus have already been perturbed by aircraft
         emissions.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Space borne and aircraft measurements provide a fairly detailed picture of contrail
         properties, albeit with a considerable spread of observation results. While first
         steps resolving the transition of contrails into contrail cirrus have been taken,
         cloud system resolving models linking the regional scale evolution of AIC to specific
         meteorological situations and simulating their microphysical interactions with natural
         cirrus are lacking. To inform our incomplete understanding of the spreading stage,
         such models are needed along with collocated observations of mesoscale (1–100 km)
         vertical air motion and associated ice supersaturation variability as well as properties
         of ice nucleating ambient atmospheric particles
