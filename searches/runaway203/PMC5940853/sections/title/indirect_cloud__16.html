      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robust RF estimates of this potential contribution to AIC RF are missing due to lack
         of observational evidence and uncertainties in underlying mechanisms and their parameterisation.
         Mechanisms include modification of ultrafine aqueous plume aerosols during transport
         from cruise altitudes to lower cloud levels and pre-activation of emitted soot particles
         in contrails. Given the small size and the substantial fraction of organic matter
         in aqueous plume particles and the largely insoluble nature of exhaust soot (Box 
         <a>1</a>), particles processed in ageing aircraft plumes
         <span><a>114</a></span> are neither expected to be efficient liquid cloud-nucleating particles nor potent
         heterogeneous ice nuclei. This casts doubt on their capability to facilitate cloud
         water droplet or ice crystal formation in atmospheric conditions. Pre-activation refers
         to an increase in an aerosol particle’s freezing temperature after ice nucleation
         occurred. While pre-activation has been observed in laboratory settings, it is not
         known whether it occurs on aircraft-emitted, small (&lt;100 nm) soot particles in the
         atmosphere or in contrails.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Liquid aerosol particles produced from gaseous aircraft engine emissions are influenced
         by fuel composition (Box 
         <a>1</a>) but are not well represented in emission inventories used to initialise global models.
         They must be specified to estimate the formation and evolution of ultrafine aqueous
         plume particles. The sulphur dioxide (SO
         <sub>2</sub>) emission index in kerosene varies widely around a mean value ≈1 g (kg-fuel)
         <span>−1</span> depending on the origin of the crude oil
         <span><a>4</a></span>; most jet fuel has lower emissions. The fraction of SO
         <sub>2</sub> converted to condensable sulphuric acid at emission (few %) and the mass and chemical
         nature of emissions of condensable organic vapours are not well known. With regard
         to aircraft-emitted soot particles, emission inventories only provide mass-based soot
         emissions
         <span><a>115</a>–
            <a>117</a></span>—often as a single, fleet-averaged surface-level value—from which particle numbers
         at cruise are inferred using empirical correlations. This seriously underestimates
         variability in soot particle numbers in contrails at formation.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To parameterise aqueous plume particle formation and contrail ice nucleation properly
         in climate models, it is necessary to inform global aircraft emission inventories
         with additional sulphate/organics mass and soot particle number emissions. Such improved
         inventories better represent aviation activity and allow for more realistic simulations
         of the formation stage, AIC RF and effects on natural clouds by way of parameterisation.
