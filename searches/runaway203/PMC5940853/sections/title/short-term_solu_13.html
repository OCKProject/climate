         presents engineering and scientific challenges
         <span><a>8</a>,
            <a>9</a></span>. Replacement fuels are limited to those that pass both technical and safety requirements.
         Alternatives to kerosene from crude oil include synthetic fuels (produced by Fischer–Tropsch
         chemical conversion processes from coal, natural gas or biomass) and biofuels (from
         feedstock, algae or biomass)
         <span><a>92</a></span>. To meet technical and safety standards, those can be implemented rapidly only when
         blended with kerosene. Alternative fuels need to be assessed in terms of their environmental
         footprint including lifecycle analyses to ensure an overall carbon offset.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As pure synthetic fuels and biofuels contain next to no sulphur and aromatic species,
         their use would lead to a substantial reduction in ice forming aqueous plume and soot
         particles (Box 
         <a>1</a>). The use of kerosene-biofuel blends reduces soot particle emissions only moderately
         (≈−50%)
         <span><a>93</a></span> and exerts a rather small impact on ice crystal numbers (−35%)
         <span><a>42</a></span>, since lower nucleated ice numbers due to reduced soot particle emissions (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>) are partly compensated by enhanced sublimation losses (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). This means that they are unlikely to bring about a large reduction in AIC effects.
         The same is expected for kerosene-synthetic fuel blends. While a higher hydrogen content
         in kerosene-biofuel blends relative to conventional jet fuel (+8%)
         <span><a>93</a></span> slightly increases contrail formation threshold temperatures
         <span><a>19</a></span> (0.5–1 K), and thereby causes contrails to form more frequently, this does not lead
         to a significant increase in ice crystal numbers at the end of the formation stage
         (&lt;5%)
         <span><a>42</a></span>. The effect of alternative fuels on contrail ice crystal formation is currently being
         investigated in airborne measurements
         <span><a>93</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pure biofuels cannot satisfy current supply demands and research into emissions arising
         from the use of pure synthetic fuels is still in the demonstration stage. It is therefore
         meaningful to explore the capability of modifications to propulsion technology to
         reduce in-flight soot emissions. Lean combustion technology (employing high air to
         fuel ratios during fuel combustion) produces low soot particle emissions by number
         in ground-based measurements (Table 
         <a>1</a> in ref. 
         <span><a>94</a></span>). Other technical options to reduce contrail ice formation have been proposed
         <span><a>95</a></span>; their viability has not yet been demonstrated and they may become operative only
         in the long term.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prospect of reducing in-flight soot particle numbers more than 10-fold using pure
         alternative fuels or lean combustion motivates climate mitigation studies of soot-poor
         contrail cirrus formed on low levels of ambient upper tropospheric aerosol particles
         (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). The sulphur level in kerosene can be reduced without direct impact on engine performance,
         albeit with minor enhancements (≈0.1 %) in CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions
         <span><a>4</a></span>. Substantial reduction of the total number and mean size of exhaust soot particles
         along with desulphurisation of jet fuel is an efficient root level solution to curb
         AIC effects including potential indirect effects on natural clouds
         <span><a>96</a></span>. In the context of mitigation, this places investigations of climatic effects of
         aircraft particulate emission reductions right into the crosshairs of scientific scrutiny.
         To assess the associated benefits in an optimal way, aircraft emission inventories
         used in climate models should capture realistically the various sources of variability
         in soot particle emissions by number.
