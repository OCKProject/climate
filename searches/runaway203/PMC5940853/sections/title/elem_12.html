      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The achievement of the 2015 Paris (COP21) agreement
         <span><a>90</a></span> limiting global warming to 2 °C (preferably 1.5 °C) above pre-industrial levels by
         the end of this century, requires a dramatic pace for decarbonisation. If greenhouse
         gas emissions continue for just 15 more years, global surface temperature could rise
         as much as 3 °C (ref. 
         <span><a>91</a></span>). International aviation can help achieve the COP21 goals by mitigating the contribution
         of AIC to aviation RF on short time scales and thereby buy time to more substantially
         reduce aircraft CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions. Figure 
         <a>8</a> summarises several short-term (relating to several years) and long-term (many decades)
         AIC mitigation options which are further discussed below. While some long-term solutions
         can be implemented gradually, others require changes in aircraft design, fuel production
         or supply infrastructure.

               <p>Options to mitigate the climate effect of aircraft-induced clouds. Options are categorised
                  into short-term and long-term solutions. Long-term options are further distinguished
                  as drop-in (easily replaceable) and non-drop-in approaches. Mitigation options may
                  also be categorised according to their influence in the two stages of AIC evolution.
                  Most options, including technological options addressing alterations of aircraft engine
                  architecture and airframe/engine integration, affect the formation stage (red) by
                  reducing or modifying particle emissions or affecting nucleation and sublimation of
                  contrail ice crystals in aircraft exhaust plumes and wakes. Only two options affect
                  the spreading stage (blue), requiring sound predictive capability of ice supersaturated
                  areas (air traffic management, ATM) or producing short-lived contrails in the dry
                  lower stratosphere (supersonic flight) with negligible radiative impact

            presents engineering and scientific challenges
            <span><a>8</a>,
               <a>9</a></span>. Replacement fuels are limited to those that pass both technical and safety requirements.
            Alternatives to kerosene from crude oil include synthetic fuels (produced by Fischer–Tropsch
            chemical conversion processes from coal, natural gas or biomass) and biofuels (from
            feedstock, algae or biomass)
            <span><a>92</a></span>. To meet technical and safety standards, those can be implemented rapidly only when
            blended with kerosene. Alternative fuels need to be assessed in terms of their environmental
            footprint including lifecycle analyses to ensure an overall carbon offset.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As pure synthetic fuels and biofuels contain next to no sulphur and aromatic species,
            their use would lead to a substantial reduction in ice forming aqueous plume and soot
            particles (Box 
            <a>1</a>). The use of kerosene-biofuel blends reduces soot particle emissions only moderately
            (≈−50%)
            <span><a>93</a></span> and exerts a rather small impact on ice crystal numbers (−35%)
            <span><a>42</a></span>, since lower nucleated ice numbers due to reduced soot particle emissions (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>) are partly compensated by enhanced sublimation losses (Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). This means that they are unlikely to bring about a large reduction in AIC effects.
            The same is expected for kerosene-synthetic fuel blends. While a higher hydrogen content
            in kerosene-biofuel blends relative to conventional jet fuel (+8%)
            <span><a>93</a></span> slightly increases contrail formation threshold temperatures
            <span><a>19</a></span> (0.5–1 K), and thereby causes contrails to form more frequently, this does not lead
            to a significant increase in ice crystal numbers at the end of the formation stage
            (&lt;5%)
            <span><a>42</a></span>. The effect of alternative fuels on contrail ice crystal formation is currently being
            investigated in airborne measurements
            <span><a>93</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pure biofuels cannot satisfy current supply demands and research into emissions arising
            from the use of pure synthetic fuels is still in the demonstration stage. It is therefore
            meaningful to explore the capability of modifications to propulsion technology to
            reduce in-flight soot emissions. Lean combustion technology (employing high air to
            fuel ratios during fuel combustion) produces low soot particle emissions by number
            in ground-based measurements (Table 
            <a>1</a> in ref. 
            <span><a>94</a></span>). Other technical options to reduce contrail ice formation have been proposed
            <span><a>95</a></span>; their viability has not yet been demonstrated and they may become operative only
            in the long term.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prospect of reducing in-flight soot particle numbers more than 10-fold using pure
            alternative fuels or lean combustion motivates climate mitigation studies of soot-poor
            contrail cirrus formed on low levels of ambient upper tropospheric aerosol particles
            (Fig. 
            <a>3</a>). The sulphur level in kerosene can be reduced without direct impact on engine performance,
            albeit with minor enhancements (≈0.1 %) in CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions
            <span><a>4</a></span>. Substantial reduction of the total number and mean size of exhaust soot particles
            along with desulphurisation of jet fuel is an efficient root level solution to curb
            AIC effects including potential indirect effects on natural clouds
            <span><a>96</a></span>. In the context of mitigation, this places investigations of climatic effects of
            aircraft particulate emission reductions right into the crosshairs of scientific scrutiny.
            To assess the associated benefits in an optimal way, aircraft emission inventories
            used in climate models should capture realistically the various sources of variability
            in soot particle emissions by number.

            have zero soot and sulphur emissions. In a climate model study, RF due to a hypothetical
            fleet of LH2-propelled aircraft (cryoplanes) with increased water vapour emissions
            was smaller than for kerosene aircraft
            <span><a>97</a></span>. Full electrification of future generations of aircraft would lead to zero emissions
            of CO
            <sub>2</sub>, NO
            <sub><span>x</span></sub> and particles. In realising the vision of a transition to electric flight over the
            next decades, including transcontinental routes, a main technological hurdle is the
            power stored in batteries with sufficiently high energy density. Blended wing body
            technology combined with multi-fuel hybrid engines has been considered for civil aviation
            as a means to improve overall efficiency and reduce fuel consumption, hence, CO
            <sub>2</sub> emissions
            <span><a>98</a></span>. A scenario assuming that one engine burns biofuel and the other LH2 (LNG) showed
            that AIC RF increases by 50% (40%) compared to conventional future technology due
            to changed contrail formation conditions
            <span><a>99</a></span>. While the effect of reduced soot emissions has not been investigated in detail,
            the study suggested that a reduction of AIC RF might be achieved when employing blended
            wing body technology together with soot-poor fuels.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The long-term transition to a fleet of supersonic aircraft operating in the lower
            stratosphere (altitudes 16–20 km) will increase levels of water vapour and nitric
            acid (deriving from aircraft NO
            <sub><span>x</span></sub> emissions) due to longer lifetimes of emissions. The lower stratosphere is commonly
            too dry to support AIC, but those gaseous emissions affect polar stratospheric cloud
            formation with negative repercussions for the ozone layer
            <span><a>100</a>,
               <a>101</a></span>. Evaluating the climate impact of a hypothetical civil supersonic fleet without accounting

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air traffic management (ATM) plays a key role in enabling safe and energy efficient
            operation. Studies have begun to explore the mitigation potential of changes in ATM
            with regard to wind-optimised improvement in fuel consumption
            <span><a>103</a></span>. The identification of those regions depends heavily on the accuracy of weather forecast
            and climate models. Re-routing strategies aim at reducing effects of non-CO
            <sub>2</sub> forcing agents by flying in less climate-sensitive regions, while at the same time
            evaluating associated increases in economic costs
            <span><a>104</a></span>. Results based on simplified climate response models indicate that even small differences
            between various mitigation scenarios resulting from flight altitude variations might
            be reliably assessed
            <span><a>105</a></span>. One study suggests that circumnavigating the Arctic circle by re-routing cross-polar
            flights reduces soot pollution there

            <span><a>107</a></span>. While entirely avoiding the formation of persistent contrails by re-routing is arguably
            difficult, it is desirable to identify and avoid meteorological conditions that cause
            the potentially largest climate impact: long lived, large scale, ice supersaturated
            areas
            <span><a>108</a></span>. Simply re-scheduling global air traffic to more daytime flights to promote the compensation
            of SW and LW AIC RF (Box 
            <a>2</a>), however, bears only a limited mitigation potential
            <span><a>109</a></span>, contrary to an earlier suggestion
            <span><a>110</a></span>. Other approaches study mitigation as a function of different weather situations

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most mitigation options affect the formation stage (Fig. 8). Adopting the two principal
            stages of AIC evolution discussed here as a conceptual framework in mitigation studies
            offers the possibility to systematically explore the implications for mitigation by
            analyses of subcomponents within each stage, i.e., the jet and vortex regimes within
            the formation stage
            <span><a>42</a></span>. Studies addressing the formation stage (Fig. 
            <a>2</a>) quantify changes in ice crystal number due to nucleation and sublimation. Studies
            addressing the spreading stage (Fig. 
            <a>5</a>) focus on changes in RF. Soot particle emissions and atmospheric ice supersaturation
            are key factors tying the two stages together.
