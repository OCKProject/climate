      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robust predictions of changes in climate that result from AIC rely to a large degree
         on the ability to transfer the process understanding outlined above into models that
         are not capable of treating the formation stage explicitly due to a lack of spatial
         or temporal resolution. This goal can be reached by allying findings from observations
         with local scale, process-oriented models. While first attempts have been made to
         devise simulations addressing formation stage processes prior to IPCC 1999 (ref. 
         <span><a>4</a></span>), refined models have become available only in recent years
         <span><a>29</a>–
            <a>32</a>,

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Together with observations, process models point to exhaust soot particles as the
         most important source of contrail ice crystals for current propulsion technology
         <span><a>5</a>,
            <a>37</a>–
            <a>40</a></span>. The ice nucleation process in contrails has been simulated assuming that the kinetics
         of water droplet and ice crystal formation are not affected by turbulent plume mixing
         and in which supersaturation is not resolved at scales (≈0.1–1 cm) below which molecular
         diffusion removes spatial gradients of water vapour and temperature. Water droplet
         formation followed by homogeneous freezing defines a minimal microphysical framework.
         By invoking a heterogeneous (solid surface assisted) ice nucleation mode involving
         bare exhaust soot particles, it is possible to tune these nucleation rates to trigger
         rapid formation of copious ice crystals preventing water supersaturation from occurring.
         However, this violates the water saturation constraint.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
         <a>3</a> shows the dependence of nucleated contrail ice crystal numbers as a function of soot
         particle emissions studied systematically by one process model based on the minimal
         framework
         <span><a>37</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). The trends shown are generic and basically consistent with other parcel models
         <span><a>38</a>,
            <a>39</a>,
            <a>41</a></span>. In soot-rich exhaust, ice crystal and soot particle numbers increase nearly in proportion.
         Near the contrail threshold, only few ice crystals form, since low plume supersaturation
         diminishes water activation of soot particles. Ice crystal numbers decrease about
         100-fold from soot-rich to soot-poor conditions, approaching constant low values set
         by the number of particles in the contrail environment. Ice crystal numbers increase
         at low ambient temperatures in soot-poor exhaust due to water activation and subsequent
         freezing of abundant aqueous plume particles (Box 
         <a>1</a>). While one observational case study is consistent with those predictions
         <span><a>42</a></span>, uncertainties in aircraft measurements of ice supersaturation and ice crystal number
         concentrations in fresh contrails have prevented direct verification of these results
         <span><a>28</a></span>. Simulations of soot-poor contrails remain unconstrained by observations, since current
         soot emission levels are high.

                  index of emitted soot particles simulated by a parcel model
                  <span><a>37</a></span>. Two results are shown for an ambient temperature, 
                  <span>T</span>, close to a contrail formation threshold temperature, 
                  <span>Θ</span> ≈ 225 K, frequently found in extratropical cruise conditions, and a rather low temperature
                  12 K below this value. At intermediate ambient temperatures, nucleated ice crystal
                  numbers increase due to enhanced water activation of either soot or ultrafine aqueous
                  plume particles (Box 
                  <a>1</a>). An approximate range of current in-flight soot emission indices is indicated (hatched
                  area). In soot-rich exhaust, the number of soot particles that can be water-activated
                  and freeze increases with decreasing ambient temperature that in turn increases plume
                  cooling rates and levels of plume supersaturation over liquid water. As 
                  <span>T</span> approaches 
                  <span>Θ</span> in soot-poor exhaust, ambient aerosol particles mixed into exhaust plumes are the
                  only source of contrail ice crystals, as increasingly fewer plume particles can be
                  activated owing to diminishing plume supersaturation; the number concentrations of
                  ambient particles are much lower in contrails than current soot emission levels. The
                  plume cooling rate determines the time of water activation of entrained ambient particles,
                  hence, the number of ice crystals derived from them. In soot-poor exhaust, ultrafine
                  aqueous plume particles are formed in large numbers in the fresh exhaust, if the fuel
                  contains sufficient amounts of condensable vapours besides water vapour. Those small
                  particles are predicted to contribute significantly to ice crystal formation at low
                  ambient temperatures well below average values at cruise levels (
                  <span>T</span> ≈ 218 K in the extratropics and 
                  <span>T</span> ≈ 228 K in the tropics). If the formation of ultrafine particles cannot be avoided,
                  ice crystal numbers are lowest in an intermediate range of soot emissions, 10

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Computational fluid dynamics simulations are capable of predicting contrail properties
         past ice crystal formation in greater detail within limited spatial domains. While
         it is computationally too expensive to treat ice nucleation explicitly in large-eddy
         simulation (LES) codes, they have been employed to study effects of aircraft wake
         development on ice crystals. In this regard, LES have provided valuable insights into
         systematic dependencies of ice crystal losses on aircraft-dependent and atmospheric
         variables.

         <a>4</a> illustrates ice crystal sublimation losses as a function of assumed nucleated ice
         crystal number and their dependence on ambient ice supersaturation derived from one
         set of LES

         in jet exhaust plumes have been prescribed. The more ice crystals nucleate, the larger
         the sublimation losses which decrease with increasing supersaturation. Observations

         have been taken

         until measurements become available providing tight links between soot emissions and

                  at cruise and low (0.1), medium (0.2) and high (0.3) ambient ice supersaturation (Table
                  A2 Block 4 in ref. 
                  <span><a>43</a></span>). The magnitude of sublimation losses depends on aircraft engine thrust settings
                  affecting soot particle numbers as well as on aircraft weight affecting the vertical
                  depth of the wake; ambient conditions including ice supersaturation, air temperature
                  and its vertical gradient and turbulence levels; and level of plume ice supersaturation
                  and number, mean size and spread of the contrail ice crystal size distribution in
                  the late jet regime. Substantial losses have been attributed to the Kelvin effect
                  <span><a>31</a></span>, marking an increase in supersaturation over the surfaces of small particles relative
                  to ambient values. Although this increase is very small (0.001–0.1) for µm-sized ice
                  crystals, it becomes important in aircraft wake vortices for high ice crystal number

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Advances in research in the last two decades do not abrogate the need to measure more
         accurately physical and chemical properties of aerosol particles and ice crystals
         in the size range 1–1000 nm and to re-examine model predictions of ice crystal size
         distributions in and vertical extensions of contrails with better informed models
         at the end of the formation stage. These variables serve as initial conditions of
         AIC in the spreading stage and have important repercussions regarding the transition
         of contrails into contrail cirrus. It is important to ascertain model predictions
         by which sublimation decreases differences in nucleated ice crystal numbers induced
         by changes in soot emissions.
