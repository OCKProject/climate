   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>). Through a combination of models, laboratory and in situ measurements, the last two decades have seen significant advances in identifying and understanding thermo-, fluid-dynamical and microphysical processes in the formation stage. Understanding these processes is essential to model and predict initial AIC properties.

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrails begin to form when jet engine exhaust plumes expand and their constituents mix with surrounding ambient air (Fig.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> has shown that temperatures typically below 233 K (≈−40 °C) provide a threshold below which either short-lived or long-lived contrails appear behind jet aircraft cruising above ≈8 km (formation constraint). Contrail occurrence is predicted with confidence, if ambient pressure and relative humidity, water vapour and heat emissions, and propulsive characteristics of aircraft engines are known. The underlying definition of threshold temperatures rests on the assumption that exhaust plumes surpass water saturated conditions (water saturation constraint). The thermodynamic approach is not capable of predicting formation (nucleation) pathways and microphysical properties of ice crystals in contrails.

    <p>Processes influencing the contrail formation stage. Exhaust plumes produced by combusting fuel–air mixtures at high temperature and pressure within turbofan jet engines contain gaseous and particulate matter. Particles types present in the freely expanding and cooling plumes (jet regime) comprise emitted soot particles and aqueous aerosol particles formed in the exhaust (Box 
     <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">1</a>) along with entrained ambient aerosol particles. When turbulent mixing (arrows) and the associated cooling produces plume supersaturation over liquid water (
     <span class="italic">s</span>
     <sub>w</sub> &gt; 0), copious plume particles turn into water droplets (grey) that freeze and grow rapidly by uptake of water vapour forming a visible contrail. This happens when the ambient temperature, 
     <span class="italic">T</span>, falls below the formation threshold, 
     <span class="italic">Θ</span>. In soot-rich exhaust, most droplets contain soot inclusions. Droxtals, frozen water droplets with faceted surfaces, and hexagonal prisms and columns likely developing from them may provide a realistic representation of small ice crystals in fresh contrails, but no direct observational evidence for their shapes is available. Plumes from multiple aircraft engines merge with two wing tip vortices, forming an inhomogeneous wake. The further evolution of ice crystals depends largely on fluid-dynamical processes (vortex regime). The downward motion of the vortex pair warms the air causing ice crystal sublimation in the lower part of the wake. A small contrail fraction is released from the jets remaining at flight level and enhanced by detrainment of air from the lower wake. Ice crystals present in the upper wake continue to grow by uptake of entrained ice-supersaturated (

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aerosol particles types present in aircraft exhaust plumes comprise emitted soot particles, nanometre-sized (ultrafine) aqueous aerosol particles formed within the plumes and particles mixed (entrained) into the plumes from the ambient air (Box 
  <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">1</a>). In the cooling plumes, these particles interact with condensable vapours—mainly emitted water vapour—and ionised gas molecules. The different particle types compete for supersaturated vapour in water droplet formation; for current emissions, soot particles figure most prominently in droplet formation. Although water droplets are initially present in contrails, they are unstable since the upper troposphere stays below liquid water saturation

  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> indicates that properties of persistent contrails are further developed through circulatory airflow patterns (vortices) appearing behind aircraft wings. Plumes from multiple aircraft engines merge with the vortex pair, forming an inhomogeneous wake. The further evolution of ice crystals depends on the interaction between jet plumes and wake vortices. The vortex pair, in which most of the contrail is captured, descends some 100 m below the flight level. This downward motion leads to a partial loss of ice crystals due to sublimation in the lower part of the wake. Ice crystals present in the upper wake continue to grow by uptake of entrained ice supersaturated water vapour. After few minutes of contrail age, the wake-averaged ice crystal size distribution contains signatures of nucleation, growth and sublimation. Eventually, flow instability triggered by turbulence causes the organised flow pattern to collapse and mix with ambient air, terminating the formation stage. Evolution of ice crystals in engine plumes and aircraft wakes depend on ambient conditions and on the type of aircraft and jet engines, as borne out by fluid-dynamical simulations
