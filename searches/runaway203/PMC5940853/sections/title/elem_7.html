            to persistent contrails was not available. This caused large uncertainty in aviation
            RF as a whole. After IPCC 1999, AIC RF estimates have been based on associating air
            traffic with regional trends in cirrus coverage without proof of causality and by

               <a>70</a>,
               <a>74</a></span>. An offsetting feedback of AIC on natural clouds due to humidity and (to a lesser
            degree) temperature changes was estimated with large uncertainty to reduce the direct
            AIC RF by almost 20% (ref.

            <a>7</a> have not been corrected for this feedback. One climate model
            <span><a>69</a></span> reports much lower AIC RF for 2006 aircraft operations than others, possibly because
            in the model contrails, while evolving consistently with the hydrological cycle, are
            undifferentiated from other clouds. The same model predicts an increase in AIC RF
            from 2006 to 2050 by a factor of seven due to a non-uniform regional increase in air
            traffic and different sensitivities for the forcing in different regions
            <span><a>75</a></span>. While model-based central estimates of AIC RF converged over time, results for current

            other sources on natural cirrus found RF estimates that would dominate the total aviation
            RF, but the sign of the simulated forcing could not be ascertained

            column and high- and low-level cloud coverage
            <span><a>88</a></span>. Based on the assumption that aircraft soot particles—once preconditioned in contrails—act
            as highly efficient ice forming agents, one climate model predicted substantial effects
            on natural cirrus
            <span><a>89</a></span>. This relied, in part, on assumptions of how ice forms in background cirrus—a matter
            of current debate

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the lack of observational evidence for effects of aircraft particle emissions
            on natural clouds and the poor model treatment of underlying processes, reducing scientific
            uncertainty and building confidence in these effects remain challenging.
