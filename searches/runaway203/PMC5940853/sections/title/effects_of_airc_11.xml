 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Full quantification of aircraft-induced cloudiness changes is hampered by a lack of knowledge on whether and how particle emissions affect natural liquid phase and ice phase clouds. Climate models indicate that increases in upper tropospheric sulphate and soot particle mass concentrations due to aviation emissions are at least tenfold smaller compared to other sources

  </span>. They also suggest that aircraft emissions increase the number concentrations of fine (sizes &lt; 100 nm) aerosol particles significantly in some areas

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>
  </span>. Soot particles, regardless of their source, do not appear to contribute much to natural cirrus formation

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>
  </span>. In contrast, sufficiently large sulphate particles tend to be efficient liquid cloud nucleating agents; several climate models predict significant modification of low level liquid phase clouds by emissions of small aircraft sulphate particles

  </span>. A global model study of the influence of soot particles emitted by aircraft and other sources on natural cirrus found RF estimates that would dominate the total aviation RF, but the sign of the simulated forcing could not be ascertained
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>
  </span>. A contrail model run within a climate model predicted reductions in the total water column and high- and low-level cloud coverage
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>
  </span>. Based on the assumption that aircraft soot particles—once preconditioned in contrails—act as highly efficient ice forming agents, one climate model predicted substantial effects on natural cirrus
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>
  </span>. This relied, in part, on assumptions of how ice forms in background cirrus—a matter of current debate

 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the lack of observational evidence for effects of aircraft particle emissions on natural clouds and the poor model treatment of underlying processes, reducing scientific uncertainty and building confidence in these effects remain challenging.</p>
