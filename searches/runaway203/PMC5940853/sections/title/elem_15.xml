  <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robust RF estimates of this potential contribution to AIC RF are missing due to lack of observational evidence and uncertainties in underlying mechanisms and their parameterisation. Mechanisms include modification of ultrafine aqueous plume aerosols during transport from cruise altitudes to lower cloud levels and pre-activation of emitted soot particles in contrails. Given the small size and the substantial fraction of organic matter in aqueous plume particles and the largely insoluble nature of exhaust soot (Box 
   <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">1</a>), particles processed in ageing aircraft plumes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" href="#CR114">114</a>
   </span> are neither expected to be efficient liquid cloud-nucleating particles nor potent heterogeneous ice nuclei. This casts doubt on their capability to facilitate cloud water droplet or ice crystal formation in atmospheric conditions. Pre-activation refers to an increase in an aerosol particle’s freezing temperature after ice nucleation occurred. While pre-activation has been observed in laboratory settings, it is not known whether it occurs on aircraft-emitted, small (&lt;100 nm) soot particles in the atmosphere or in contrails.
  </p>
  <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Liquid aerosol particles produced from gaseous aircraft engine emissions are influenced by fuel composition (Box 
   <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">1</a>) but are not well represented in emission inventories used to initialise global models. They must be specified to estimate the formation and evolution of ultrafine aqueous plume particles. The sulphur dioxide (SO
   <sub>2</sub>) emission index in kerosene varies widely around a mean value ≈1 g (kg-fuel)
   <span class="sup">−1</span> depending on the origin of the crude oil
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
   </span>; most jet fuel has lower emissions. The fraction of SO
   <sub>2</sub> converted to condensable sulphuric acid at emission (few %) and the mass and chemical nature of emissions of condensable organic vapours are not well known. With regard to aircraft-emitted soot particles, emission inventories only provide mass-based soot emissions

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" href="#CR117">117</a>
   </span>—often as a single, fleet-averaged surface-level value—from which particle numbers at cruise are inferred using empirical correlations. This seriously underestimates variability in soot particle numbers in contrails at formation.
  </p>
  <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To parameterise aqueous plume particle formation and contrail ice nucleation properly in climate models, it is necessary to inform global aircraft emission inventories with additional sulphate/organics mass and soot particle number emissions. Such improved inventories better represent aviation activity and allow for more realistic simulations of the formation stage, AIC RF and effects on natural clouds by way of parameterisation.</p>

  <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Radiative transfer parameterisations commonly used in climate models are designed to represent effects of natural cirrus that are composed of ice crystals, whose mean maximum dimensions hardly fall below 10 µm. In dense flight corridors, AIC might on average be composed of such small ice crystals
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" href="#CR118">118</a>
   </span>. As neither geometric optics nor Mie theory accurately describe such cases, other optical models might be employed to provide more realistic parameterisations of ice crystal scattering properties in contrails and contrail cirrus. Shapes of small ice crystals are largely unconstrained by direct observations (Box 
   <a rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec7">2</a>), constituting a significant drawback in applying advanced optical parameterisations. Before being implemented in global models, such parameterisations might be tested in regional models providing more detailed information on ice crystal size and habit distributions. This better constrains SW radiative transfer calculations and helps improve estimates of AIC RF and climate sensitivity.

   </span>. A statistically significant increase in broadband (wavelength-integrated) SW radiation at the Earth’s surface in cloudless scenes has been observed at several locations across the continental U.S.A. in the period 1996–2007 (ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" href="#CR120">120</a>
   </span>). The observed trend was almost entirely due to an increase in the diffuse irradiance, while the direct component remained virtually unchanged, ruling out a concomitant decrease in atmospheric aerosol OD as the sole cause of the increase. Recent analyses using diffuse SW spectral measurements
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" href="#CR121">121</a>
   </span> confirmed this trend coined as ‘clear-sky whitening’. Ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" href="#CR121">121</a>
   </span> hypothesised that while a decreased aerosol load did increase the total SW irradiance, an increase in subvisible contrail-generated ice crystal ‘haze’ repartitioned this increase from the direct into the diffuse component. Formation and spreading stage processes including radiative effects of small ice crystals must be understood well to explore this plausible hypothesis.

  <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local scale process and fluid-dynamical models systematically explore how plume turbulence and wake dynamics affects nucleation and properties of contrail ice crystals (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and how predictions of nucleated ice numbers (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) and sublimation losses (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) relate to aircraft measurements. Cloud-resolving and regional models—driven with appropriate meteorological boundary conditions and combined with optical parameterisations capturing the SW response of µm-sized ice crystals—analyse large atmospheric regions based on collocated aircraft and satellite measurements to better judge AIC RF and the radiative significance of natural cirrus perturbed by contrails. These models capture variability in ice supersaturation and are employed to drive LES to gain more detailed understanding of the contrail-to-contrail cirrus transition. Global models use information regarding properties of thin ice supersaturated layers (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>) derived from high-resolution simulations or radiosonde data

   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global models represent much of the system complexity, but account for processes and their variability affecting RF only to a degree, depending on the model’s representation of clouds. They track atmospheric motion and clouds with ≈10 min time steps and represent them with coarse spatial resolution. This means that formation and effects of clouds must be parameterised. Cloud microphysical and optical variables evolve on unresolved temporal and spatial scales. The connection of unresolved processes to resolved (large-scale) model variables is not always obvious. With higher resolution, fewer parameterisations are required. The prospect to perform in the near-term global studies that resolve explicitly the regional scales crucial for AIC development
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" href="#CR123">123</a>
   </span> is very promising. More aircraft travelling in the same regions may not necessarily lead to more AIC coverage due to overlap effects and merging with natural cirrus, thus limiting increases in RF for higher air traffic volume. Moreover, AIC and natural cirrus do not evolve independently
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
   </span>. A new generation of high-resolution global models explores such effects in the spreading stage with increased confidence.
  </p>
  <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Improving and validating AIC in global models requires an integrative analysis framework that unravels crucial cloud-controlling factors and conditions. Propitious weather conditions leading to large radiative impact of contrail outbreaks are tied to synoptic-scale, enhanced moisture transport and uplift (cooling), in which moderately high ice supersaturation at the same time minimises sedimentation losses and maximises OD by generating ice crystals within an optimal size range
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span>, reminiscent of the ‘Goldilocks principle’. A suitable framework combines aircraft and active remote sensing observations and local and regional models to study characteristics of and linkages between individual processes (bottom-up) with passive remote sensing observations, and global models to explore large-scale constraints arising from the coupled dynamics-aerosol-cloud-radiation system (top–down).

  <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methodologies combining estimates of contrail coverage from meteorological reanalysis data and mean contrail OD in off-line radiative transfer models and used to diagnose global contrail RF in climate models have been replaced by simulations of AIC within global models
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
   </span>. Adding or elaborating on processes may be required to improve on specific problems. However, this would expand the space of underlying model parameters, possibly compromising the robustness of the models’ predictive capability and the goal of reducing overall model uncertainty
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" href="#CR124">124</a>
   </span>. Parameterisation schemes used in such models should therefore be informed by theory, whereby it is important to capture the most influential processes governing a specific application, and document the physical soundness and plausibility of the scheme. Understanding how well global climate models work for a specific purpose (evaluation) is important, but in itself is not a straightforward task. At times the disagreement of a model with observations motivates model improvements.
  </p>
  <p id="Par67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another important task in support of model improvement is ascertaining its “truth” (validation), e.g., by comparison with suitable measurements. In models with many compensating uncertainties, several pathways of process representation conforming to the same set of underlying physical laws may lead to similar plausible agreement with observations. Just because models agree with some measurements does not imply reduced uncertainty in their RF predictions. In view of the case study nature of many measurements, observationalists and modellers should aspire to clarify if and exactly how measurements can be used to validate models and constrain uncertainty. Introducing microphysical mechanisms in cloud parameterisations without critical analysis, theoretical underpinning or support by empirical evidence increases the likelihood of model fallacies. Unexamined process representation carries the danger of proliferating unsubstantiated conclusions. The resulting enhanced uncertainty levels are difficult to judge and may be irreducible.</p>
  <p id="Par68" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lack of rigorous model evaluation and validation has serious repercussions for the interpretation of model results. A way out could be to devise models based on a minimal set of processes with only a few open physical parameters and expounding meaningful ways of how model behaviour could be confirmed or falsified. Complexity would be added only when needed, fulfilling a methodological principle known as ‘Ockham’s razor’. To minimise AIC model uncertainty, ice cloud parameterisations should conform to a number of tenets: full inclusion of AIC into the model’s hydrological cycle, as cloud-induced changes in the moisture and heat budget cause feedbacks on natural cloudiness; consideration of vertical overlap between AIC and natural clouds, as cloud overlap statistic has a profound impact on overall fractional cloud coverage within a model grid box and on net RF; realistic representation of AIC within the model’s radiation scheme, as optical properties differ from those of natural cirrus; and abandonment of instantaneous conversion of water vapour above ice saturation into cloud ice (and the reverse process below ice saturation), as ice crystal growth and sublimation can be kinetically hindered in thin or aged contrail cirrus; moreover, the kinetic treatment of water vapour uptake involving size-dispersed populations of disparate ice nuclei is a perquisite for the proper treatment of ice nucleation in models. Implementing these improvements will also lead to better simulations of natural cirrus.</p>

  <p id="Par69" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Commercial aircraft are in service for 20–30 years meaning that adoption of new technologies from research to integration takes many decades. Therefore, in addition to scientific challenges, the implementation of AIC mitigation options also faces engineering and economical hurdles and will only be realised when disruptive change in the air transportation system can be avoided. Accomodating the expected growth in air travel while reducing the impact of AIC RF may require a combination of options.</p>
