      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquefied natural gas (LNG, consisting of mostly methane)
         have zero soot and sulphur emissions. In a climate model study, RF due to a hypothetical
         fleet of LH2-propelled aircraft (cryoplanes) with increased water vapour emissions
         was smaller than for kerosene aircraft
         <span><a>97</a></span>. Full electrification of future generations of aircraft would lead to zero emissions
         of CO
         <sub>2</sub>, NO
         <sub><span>x</span></sub> and particles. In realising the vision of a transition to electric flight over the
         next decades, including transcontinental routes, a main technological hurdle is the
         power stored in batteries with sufficiently high energy density. Blended wing body
         technology combined with multi-fuel hybrid engines has been considered for civil aviation
         as a means to improve overall efficiency and reduce fuel consumption, hence, CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions
         <span><a>98</a></span>. A scenario assuming that one engine burns biofuel and the other LH2 (LNG) showed
         that AIC RF increases by 50% (40%) compared to conventional future technology due
         to changed contrail formation conditions
         <span><a>99</a></span>. While the effect of reduced soot emissions has not been investigated in detail,
         the study suggested that a reduction of AIC RF might be achieved when employing blended
         wing body technology together with soot-poor fuels.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The long-term transition to a fleet of supersonic aircraft operating in the lower
         stratosphere (altitudes 16–20 km) will increase levels of water vapour and nitric
         acid (deriving from aircraft NO
         <sub><span>x</span></sub> emissions) due to longer lifetimes of emissions. The lower stratosphere is commonly
         too dry to support AIC, but those gaseous emissions affect polar stratospheric cloud
         formation with negative repercussions for the ozone layer
         <span><a>100</a>,
            <a>101</a></span>. Evaluating the climate impact of a hypothetical civil supersonic fleet without accounting
         for effects on stratospheric cloudiness, one study predicts a total RF of 22 (9–29) mW m
         <span>−2</span> in 2050 (ref. 
         <span><a>102</a></span>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air traffic management (ATM) plays a key role in enabling safe and energy efficient
         operation. Studies have begun to explore the mitigation potential of changes in ATM
         with regard to wind-optimised improvement in fuel consumption
         <span><a>103</a></span>. The identification of those regions depends heavily on the accuracy of weather forecast
         and climate models. Re-routing strategies aim at reducing effects of non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> forcing agents by flying in less climate-sensitive regions, while at the same time
         evaluating associated increases in economic costs
         <span><a>104</a></span>. Results based on simplified climate response models indicate that even small differences
         between various mitigation scenarios resulting from flight altitude variations might
         be reliably assessed
         <span><a>105</a></span>. One study suggests that circumnavigating the Arctic circle by re-routing cross-polar
         flights reduces soot pollution there
         <span><a>106</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trade-offs must be considered when applying technological and operational changes
         <span><a>8</a></span>. The chemical impact of contrail avoidance measures is considered small
         <span><a>107</a></span>. While entirely avoiding the formation of persistent contrails by re-routing is arguably
         difficult, it is desirable to identify and avoid meteorological conditions that cause
         the potentially largest climate impact: long lived, large scale, ice supersaturated
         areas
         <span><a>108</a></span>. Simply re-scheduling global air traffic to more daytime flights to promote the compensation
         of SW and LW AIC RF (Box 
         <a>2</a>), however, bears only a limited mitigation potential
         <span><a>109</a></span>, contrary to an earlier suggestion
         <span><a>110</a></span>. Other approaches study mitigation as a function of different weather situations
         <span><a>104</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most mitigation options affect the formation stage (Fig. 8). Adopting the two principal
         stages of AIC evolution discussed here as a conceptual framework in mitigation studies
         offers the possibility to systematically explore the implications for mitigation by
         analyses of subcomponents within each stage, i.e., the jet and vortex regimes within
         the formation stage
         <span><a>42</a></span>. Studies addressing the formation stage (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>) quantify changes in ice crystal number due to nucleation and sublimation. Studies
         addressing the spreading stage (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>) focus on changes in RF. Soot particle emissions and atmospheric ice supersaturation
         are key factors tying the two stages together.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate impacts resulting from RF due to AIC and CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions need to be placed on a common scale by the use of suitable metrics beyond
         RF. To compare the associated climate responses on various time horizons, climate
         change metrics other than RF are more suitable for AIC
         <span><a>111</a>–
            <a>113</a></span>. Choosing a time horizon depends on the specific climate policy the metric should
         serve and helps evaluate the relative importance of short-lived and long-lived climate
         perturbations.
