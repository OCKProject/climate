 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the top of the atmosphere, annually and globally averaged, incoming shortwave (SW, solar) radiation and the outgoing longwave (LW, thermal) radiation cancel out unless a climate forcing, such as changes in properties of clouds, perturbs this balance

  </span>. An initial perturbation of the radiation balance defines RF, a first-order indicator of the importance of different climate change mechanisms. RF refers to initial imbalances over a specified region and period of time; those provided by the IPCC

  </span> are global averages taken relative to a pre-industrial time (1750). Global RF cannot be observed directly and is therefore obtained with the help of models or by extrapolation of regional values inferred from satellite observations.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">OD—measuring the opacity of a medium when electromagnetic radiation of a given wavelength, 
  <span class="italic">λ</span>, passes through it—is a crucial determinant of RF. OD and RF are determined by a number of radiative transfer processes. Ice in high level clouds, i.e., thin cirrus and long-lived contrails, acts similar to cloud-free air (
  <span class="bold">a</span>): it decreases the energy lost to outer space, enhancing the temperature in the atmosphere below the cloud and at the Earth’s surface (cloud greenhouse forcing). Cloud ice crystals affect RF by reducing thermal emission (radiant energy with 
  <span class="italic">λ</span> &gt; 4 µm) to space via absorption and re-emission of LW radiation at cold temperatures. Contrary to low clouds composed mainly of liquid water droplets (
  <span class="bold">b</span>), high ice clouds are often optically thin (
  <span class="bold">c</span>,
  <span class="bold"> d</span>), i.e., partially transparent to solar radiation (
  <span class="italic">λ</span> ≈ 0.2–4 µm), meaning their ability to scatter SW radiation back to space (albedo forcing) is small. The greenhouse forcing is stronger for higher and colder clouds, in which ice crystals are increasingly abundant. The net average diurnal RF due to thin cirrus and contrails is a small positive residual from the wavelength-integrated SW and LW forcings. RF contributions due to thickening of natural cirrus by embedded contrails and new ice crystal formation in contrail areas with low ice crystal concentrations, blurring the distinction between natural cirrus and contrail cirrus, have not yet been determined.

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beside the power received from the Sun (solar irradiance) and Earth’s atmosphere, Earth surface conditions and vertical distribution (overlap) of clouds, wavelength dependent scattering and absorption properties of single ice crystals are needed to estimate OD and RF. Those properties depend on shapes (habits), surface roughness and orientation against incident light of cloud ice crystals across their size distribution, all of which are difficult to quantify in airborne measurements. Emissivity (absorption and emission at near infrared wavelengths, LW forcing) and reflectance (scattering at visible wavelengths, SW forcing) of high ice clouds are determined by OD and physical properties of ice crystals. Reflectance is sensitive to the habits of small ice crystals. Optical contrail models assume mixtures of various habits with fixed fractional weights
