  <p>(
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Time series of the SST anomaly over the subtropical western-central Pacific (130°E–180°E, 0°–35°N) (black), the Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) anomaly over the Beaufort Sea (180°–120°W, 75°–90°N) (red), and the phase of the NAO (blue) over the period 1980–2016. The NAO and SIC anomalies are averages for June, July, and August (JJA), while the SST anomaly is an average for April, May, and June (AMJ), which is two months before JJA to present time-lagged impact of the SST that leads the variation of SIC and NAO phase. Two spatial patterns represent (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) simultaneous correlations between the NAO indices and SIC for JJA, and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) two month lag correlation between the northern hemispheric SST in AMJ and the NAO in JJA. Green dots are plotted, where correlations are statistically significant at 5 percent.
