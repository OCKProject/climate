  <p>Upper panel: Differences in the recent boreal summer (the 21st century) upper–tropospheric geopotential height [m] (250hPa, left) and mid–tropospheric temperature [0.1 K] (500hPa, right) between the subtropical western–central Pacific SST (STWCPSST) positive and negative spring anomalies. Composite of geopotential height and temperature in summer (JJA) preceded by cooler than average STWCPSST (detrended) in spring is subtracted from the composite of the geopotential height and temperature in summer preceded by warmer than average STWCPSST in spring. Green dots are plotted, where the difference values are significant at 10 percent. Lower panel: Same as the upper panel but for wave activity flux vector distribution in summer at 250 hPa. Shaded is the difference in surface temperature (AMJ average) between the STWCP warming and cooling in spring. Box with dashed line denotes the STWCP region.</p>
