  <p>Responses of geopotential height and temperature to the subtropical western–central Pacific SST (STWCPSST) increase simulated by the atmospheric general circulation model. Upper panel: Difference in 20 member averaged Jun–August geopotential height and temperature between Exp. SPW, where the observed warming (SST average over the years when the SST is warmer than climatological average) is imposed over the STWCP in spring, and Exp. CTL forced by climatological SST everywhere. Lower panel is the same as upper panel but for the response in winter to the STWCPSST increase in fall. Green dots are plotted, where the difference values are significant at 10 percent.</p>
