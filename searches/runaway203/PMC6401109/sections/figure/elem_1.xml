 <div class="caption">
  <p>Interannual variation of lag–correlations (with 20 year running window) between the NAO, sea ice concentration over Beaufort Sea (SICBS), and the subtropical western–central Pacific SST (STWCPSST) over the period 1980–2016. Years on the x–axis denote the centers of the individual 20–year windows. Each panel shows time variation of the lag–correlations for (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) STWCPSST × (−1) in AMJ, MJJ, and JJA vs. JJA NAO, (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) STWCPSST × (−1) in AMJ, MJJ, and JJA vs. JJA SICBS, and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) SICBS in MJJ, JJA, and JAS vs. JJA NAO. Trends are removed from the variables before calculating correlations. Short and long dashed lines in each panel represent a statistical significance limit at 5 percent (short-dash) and 10 percent (long-dash), respectively.
