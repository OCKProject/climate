  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The SICBS exhibits a strong coherence with the NAO phase especially in 21st century summers (Fig.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that the subtropical western-central Pacific SST (defined as 130°–180°E, 0°–35°N that encompass the subtropical region including the east/northeast of Philippine and part of the Western Pacific Warm Pool) (hereafter referred to as STWCPSST) two months earlier than JJA (black line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>) exhibits distinctively a negative relationship with the summer NAO in the 21st century (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), suggesting the possibility that the STWCPSST positive (negative) anomaly in spring could lead to a decrease (increase) in the NAO in summer. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a> shows a distribution of lag-correlations between JJA NAO and Northern Hemisphere SSTs in AMJ (two months before JJA). Clearly, the STWCPSST is negatively correlated (correlations: the largest negative values of 0.4–0.5, statistically significant at 5 percent) with the NAO. Negative correlations are also found over the sub-tropical Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and Eastern Pacific, with the largest negative values similar to those for the STWCP. However, time variation of those lag-correlations demonstrates that correlations are the highest over the STWCP in recent decades. For example, the time-lagged correlation of the summer NAO as led by Indian Ocean SSTs and tropical Eastern Pacific SSTs, respectively, tends to increase with time, but does not clearly exceed the statistical confidence threshold (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1a,b</a>, with blue denoted the AMJ period, and red denoting MJJ). For the Atlantic SST, we consider the cases when the summer NAO is led by the SST and lagged by the SST as their positive feedback was suggested in earlier studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. These correlations find that the time-lagged correlation is slightly higher when the summer NAO leads the subtropical Atlantic SST than when the Atlantic SST leads the summer NAO (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1c</a>). These features contrast with the correlations of the NAO with the STWCPSST as shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>, in that they exhibit a higher correlation and a gradual increase with time with a 1–2 month lead (SST leads) than for the other oceans in recent decades, exceeding the statistical significance limit. Correlations are also higher when the STWCPSST leads the NAO, than simultaneous correlations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), while the other oceans show lag-correlations (e.g., AMJ SST vs. JJA NAO) lower than simultaneous correlations (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We also find that upper-tropospheric geopotential height and temperature anomalies in summer that are led by the positive SST values show a better organized negative NAO-like structure when the warm STWCPSST is considered, which we will discuss in more detail in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>. These characteristic features motivate experiments for imposing positive SST anomaly over the STWCP, as described in Methods Section.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows time varying lag–correlations between the NAO and STWCPSST/SICBS (using a 20-year moving window), revealing that their relationships are particularly strong during the recent 21st Century summers. Note that the years on the x–axis denote the center of the individual 20–yr windows. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a> demonstrates that the linkage between the STWCPSST positive (negative) anomalies and the negative (positive) phase of the summer NAO is clearer in the recent period, with the maximum correlation greater than 0.4 when the STWCPSST × (−1) leads the NAO by a month or two months (blue and red lines). Compared to them, simultaneous correlation is relatively low (black line). Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a> also supports the argument that the STWCPSST affects the variation of the SICBS in summer. Correlations close to 0.5 with statistical significance at 5 percent are found when the STWCPSST × (−1) leads the summer SICBS by one or two months (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). It may indicate that the STWCPSST variation in spring could explain about 25 percent (
  <span class="italic">r</span> ≈ −0.5) of the total variance of the summer SICBS.

  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a> shows the moving correlations between the NAO and the SICBS. It is evident that the correlation gradually increases with time, reaching 0.8 in the 21st century. These high correlations are found at both positive and negative monthly lag, implying possibility of their strong linkage and positive feedback. For instance, the SICBS reduction and the resulting decrease in albedo (e.g., Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>) may allow for more absorption of solar insolation at the surface (e.g., Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>), driving warming and geopotential height increases in the Arctic atmosphere (mainly over the lower troposphere)

  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a> indicates that the atmospheric process that leads the SICBS variation may be getting stronger than the opposite sequence that the SICBS leads the atmosphere. Overall, lag-correlation results in Fig.

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> presents the large-scale atmospheric patterns in the Arctic for recent summers (e.g., the 21st Century) in response to the STWCPSST variation in spring. In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b</a>, we first separate the upper-tropospheric height and temperatures in JJAs into two groups based on the STWCPSST condition (i.e., positive or negative anomaly) in spring as a precursory signal. We then subtract the JJA height composite corresponding to the STWCPSST negative spring anomalies from the JJA height composite corresponding to the STWCPSST positive spring anomalies. The most pronounced feature in the difference map in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a> is a distribution of the height anomalies with alternate sign along the STWCP, northwestern Pacific and Aleutian Low region, and Arctic/Northeastern Canada, similar to the large-scale wave train.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The wave activity flux
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span> (WAF) pattern shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a> suggests the potential for a planetary-scale wave propagation from the STWCP where the local maximum of positive surface temperature anomalies are found (shaded in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>) to the Arctic, and continuing into the North Atlantic. One may contend that WAFs provide a contribution from the western North Pacific, and this suggests a need to examine what occurs in that region in terms of wave generation. But vectors over the northeastern part of the STWCPSST may be understood to be the contribution of the SST, positive geopotential height (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), and temperature (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>) anomalies over the STWCP. A large-scale distribution of SST, height, and temperature anomalies aligned with alternating sign from the STWCP up to the Arctic (through the mid-latitude western Pacific) together with the WAFs along that path indicates the feasibility that the wave activity starts near the STWCP. Linked to this wave propagation pattern, height increases over Greenland and lowering to its south are apparent (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), resembling the general pattern of the negative phase of the NAO. The corresponding temperature distribution in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a> is consistent with the height anomaly distribution, producing the negative temperature anomaly over the northwestern Pacific/Aleutian Low and North Atlantic region and strong positive anomaly in the Arctic, Greenland, and Northeastern Canada, as well as the STWCP region.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also calculate differences in the summer upper-tropospheric height and temperatures for the Indian and Eastern Pacific tropical/subtropical ocean SSTs in spring. The results (Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) find positive height and temperature anomalies over the part of Arctic and/or Greenland region, along with the negative (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>) or still the positive anomalies (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) over the south of Greenland. However, those anomalies less clearly indicate the pattern of the NAO negative phase. This contrasts with the pattern resulting from the STWCPSST forcing shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. We additionally calculated for the subtropical North Atlantic SSTs in spring. The result in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a> shows similarity to the negative phase of the NAO as the whole of Greenland is characterized by the positive height anomaly and warmer condition while the opposite is found over the southeast of Greenland. However, as it is addressed earlier, focus of this study is on the STWCP, where the role of SST leading the NAO phase is stronger than the opposite sequence, unlike the North Atlantic case.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further investigate the Arctic response to the STWCPSST by considering the surface energy balance (e.g., radiative and turbulent fluxes). Composite anomalies are calculated for the radiative and turbulent fluxes, in the same way as done in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. We first diagnose the JJA SIC distribution. It is evident from the difference map that the STWCPSST positive anomaly is followed by a reduction in SICBS in summer (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>), when the height and temperature both increase in the Arctic as shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. The SIC loss indicates a decrease in surface albedo (contour lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>) and suggests the possibility of more absorption of the incoming shortwave flux. This is confirmed in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>, which shows that the surface net shortwave flux over the Arctic increases specifically over the Beaufort Sea.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the surface net downward longwave flux near the coast of Beaufort Sea does not increase after the STWCPSST increase. The net longwave flux is lower in that region when the STWCPSST is warmer than average in spring, while the Arctic open ocean region shows an increase (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). Contour lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a> show that this net longwave flux pattern is consistent with the total cloud area fraction. Overall, the net longwave flux tends to be lower (higher) and thus have cooling (warming) effects over less (more) cloudy regions, where a higher (lower) net shortwave flux is observed. The surface net radiation defined as the sum of surface net shortwave and longwave fluxes reveal the increased net radiation over the Arctic in response to the STWCPSST increase (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). Consistent with previous studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span> that explain the increase in the net solar flux into the Arctic in summer due to sea ice retreat by virtue of the ice-albedo feedback, it is apparent in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b,c</a> that the shortwave flux plays an important role in this increased surface net radiation. The pattern of turbulent fluxes including the latent and sensible heat fluxes show that these two fluxes are smaller over the Arctic and northern part of Greenland and larger over the mid-latitude Atlantic under the condition of STWCPSST increase. We see some positive difference value of turbulent fluxes along the coastal region of Beaufort Sea, but the magnitude is smaller than that seen in the surface net radiation, indicating that energy surplus is expected in that region, based on the energy balance equation. Subtraction of turbulent fluxes from the net radiation (i.e., Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a> minus Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4e</a>) demonstrates that the Arctic and Greenland region has the surplus energy to heat surface (red shaded in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4f</a>), while the mid-latitude Atlantic region does not. Positive/negative signs of this difference pattern across the Arctic and the Atlantic are very similar to the temperature/geopotential height anomaly distribution observed during the negative phase of the NAO (e.g., Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We next conduct the AGCM experiments to clarify if tropospheric height and temperature increases in the Arctic may in fact be driven by the STWCPSST increase alone in the preceding season. Note that the result for winter is added here. As described in Methods section, the GEOS-5 AGCM is forced by the observed positive SST anomaly in spring and fall imposed over the STWCP region (Exp. SPW). The observed STWCPSST positive anomalies in spring and fall, respectively, are estimated by averaging SST over the years when the SST is greater than climatological average. Climatological SSTs and sea ice concentrations (climatology from average over 1980–2015) are prescribed elsewhere. This experiment is intended to clarify the impact of the STWCPSST positive spring (fall) anomalies on the Arctic-subpolar atmosphere in summer (winter). The left panel in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> represents the averaged upper-level geopotential height anomalies from a 20-member ensemble for summer (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>) and winter (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>). Note that the anomaly field indicates differences with the geopotential heights simulated in the Exp. CTL, where a full climatological SST and sea ice is prescribed everywhere. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a> shows that the geopotential height field in summer is characterized by a positive anomaly over the Arctic and Greenland with a negative anomaly over the central-eastern midlatitude North Atlantic, resembling the negative phase of the NAO. The distribution of temperature also indicates warming in the Arctic and Greenland and relative cooling over the south of Greenland (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). Over the mid-latitudes Pacific, the spatial structure is characterized by negative height anomalies, along with positive anomalies to the south. We presume that a negative NAO-like pattern with somewhat smaller magnitude in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>, compared to the observation, is partly due to 1) the absence in the warm STWCPSST forcing in summer (forcing is given only in spring) and 2) no impact from the Arctic sea ice anomaly (the prescribed sea ice is climatology) on atmosphere. We also see the pattern somewhat similar to the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) characterized by a meridional dipole in the geopotential height (and sea level pressure) across the North Pacific/Bering Sea/Aleutian islands. However, it is not yet sufficiently clear from the available evidence to argue that the pattern is physically meaningful as our calculation of the lagged and simultaneous correlations between the observed STWCPSST and the observed NPO index turns out to be generally low (the maximum of ~0.25 in the 21st century).
