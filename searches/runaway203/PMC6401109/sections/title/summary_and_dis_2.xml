 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational evidence and AGCM experiments shown in this study suggest a physical linkage between the STWCPSST springtime positive anomalies and the frequent occurrence of the negative phase of the NAO in recent summers. An increase in the tropospheric height and temperature fields with 0–2 month lag is more pronounced in 21st Century summers in the Arctic in response to the positive STWCPSST anomaly in spring. This atmospheric response extends to Greenland, providing favorable conditions for the negative phase of the summer NAO, which has been prominent in the 21st Century. A lagged large-scale atmospheric response to an STWCPSST positive (negative) anomaly is closely connected to Arctic SICBS reduction (recovery) and the radiative/turbulent energy fluxes that reinforce (weakens) Arctic warming. Based on time-varying correlations between the NAO and the SICBS for the 21st Century summer period, we suggest that the NAO-related atmospheric response to the STWCPSST leads the SICBS variation first, and then the SIC provides a positive feedback

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study focuses more on the STWCPSST than the SSTs in the other tropical/subtropical oceans. This does not indicate that the NAO phase is related to the STWCP region SST only. We acknowledge that, based on the results, the Arctic atmosphere and NAO may be also associated with the tropical/subtropical SST over the Indian, Eastern Pacific, and Atlantic, as well as the STWCP region. This analysis finds that the SST over the STWCP is more significantly related to the NAO during recent years as compared to the tropical SST of other locations. Also, time lagged-relationship between the spring SST and the summer NAO is higher than simultaneous relationship for the STWCPSST, while that feature is not clearly found for the other oceans.</p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An intriguing aspect of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> is the gradual increase with time of the moving correlations over the past four decades. This trend is coincident with greater interannual variability in the SICBS in recent years. During the 20th century, for example, the interannual variance of the SICBS was very small, possibly due to the thicker and more rigid ice distribution over the Arctic than in the 21st century (red line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). As high latitude warming advanced in the 21st century, the Arctic sea ice cover became thinner and the ice cover became more mobile, perhaps resulting in an ice pack

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span> more responsive to the remote forcing of the STWCPSST. It is speculated that this response of the SICBS may have contributed to the gradual increase in the lagged correlations between the STWCPSST, SICBS, and the NAO clearly presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>. However, further work would be required to reach a firm conclusion.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of this study may raise a question regarding whether the phase of the NAO is more likely to be negative in a continued climate change condition that exhibits an upward SST trend over the subtropical Pacific. While the results for the 21st Century summer period and the AGCM experiments appear to suggest a tendency toward a more negative phase of the NAO in response to the STWCPSST increase, it is shown that the observed recent winters in the 21st Century do not experience the frequent negative phase of the NAO despite the upward SST trend in the Pacific. For example, an additional analysis for the observed winters finds that, while the negative phase of the NAO pattern was dominant in the late 20th century winters (1980–1999) following the STWCP increase in fall (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5a,b</a>), the pattern in the Arctic in the 21st Century (2000–2016) is quite different with a significance at 5 percent, sometimes leading to near zero or even the positive phase of the NAO (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5c,d</a>). Another example that did not clearly present the negative phase of the NAO recently is summer 2017. As the first exceptional case in the 21st Century summer, the positive geopotential height anomalies were not so dominant in the Arctic and Greenland
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span> in the presence of the strong positive STWCPSST anomaly in spring-summer 2017. As a result, the NAO was not clearly in the negative phase (it was in near-zero phase) in June/July, though the neighboring months of May and August in summer are clearly in a negative phase
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. It has been generally accepted that the observation reflects both the response to the SST forcing and unforced natural variability (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5c,d</a>), while the multi-member mean AGCM result primarily presents a response to the SST forcing (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c,d</a>). Based on this difference, we speculate that the lack of a strong positive height anomaly in the Arctic and negative NAO in recent winter observations during the STWCPSST increase is partly due to the unforced natural variability (internal atmospheric noise), which is generally unpredictable by the model. However, further investigation should be needed to have more confirmative answer.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been understood that the phase of the NAO is determined by many factors, and is not driven by the STWCPSST anomaly alone. For example, some earlier studies suggested the partial relationship of the NAO phase with the Atlantic SST condition including the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. It would be also possible that the atmospheric response to the STWCPSST is masked by the other NAO development mechanism arisen from internal atmospheric processes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span>, resulting in not necessarily the negative phase of the NAO in the presence of the STWCPSST increase. A series of results (e.g., recent summer and model experiments) and discussions in this study suggest that geopotential height increase and warming in the Arctic, SICBS reduction, and negative phase of the NAO is indeed possible in response to the STWCPSST increase. However, the Arctic atmospheric response and the NAO phase in reality is not determined only by the STWCPSST condition. Thus, the negative phase of the NAO would not be guaranteed in a continued STWCPSST warming condition in the future as long as the impact of the STWCPSST warming does not overwhelm the counteracting influences.
