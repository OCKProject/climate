  <a rid="RSBL20180781TB1" ref-type="table" href="#RSBL20180781TB1">table 1</a>, see contributions in this volume). Critical for the development of actionable projects, these ecosystems fall within the IPCC definition of ‘wetlands’ and mangroves are often classified as ‘forests’ (and therefore included in national forest inventories), enabling their inclusion within greenhouse gas accounting guidance of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC provided emission factors (CO
  <sub>2</sub>, methane and nitrous oxide) for land-use change in coastal wetlands for activities that result in loss and conversion or those leading to restoration [

  <a rid="RSBL20180781C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSBL20180781C17">17</a>], establishing further compelling reasons for their inclusion as Blue Carbon ecosystems. As a result, after the Paris Agreement (2016), a range of nations have included coastal wetlands in their mitigation activities within their National Determined Contributions [

  <a rid="RSBL20180781TB1" ref-type="table" href="#RSBL20180781TB1">table 1</a>, these coastal ecosystems also have a range of characteristics that remain challenges to the development of Blue Carbon projects, including high spatial variation in greenhouse gas emissions, uncertainty around land tenure, tidal boundaries and legislative responsibilities for which research and development are still required [

Green shading indicates strong evidence for meeting the criteria, yellow indicates some evidence or inference, grey indicates that the criteria are not met. See electronic supplementary material, table S1 for illustrative references (indicated by the superscript numbers) and electronic supplementary material, table S2 for the criteria on which the ecosystems are assessed (either yes, no or inconclusive (?)).
