            <span>A</span>) Observations from HadCRUT4, (
            <span>B</span>) observations from GISTEMP, and (
            <span>C</span>) CMIP5 models. (A) and (B) show Kendall τ values, whereas (C) shows the number of
            models agreeing on the sign of the Kendall τ value. The window size for removing the
            annual cycle was 15 years, and the window to compute the Kendall τ value for the change
            in SD was 20 years.
