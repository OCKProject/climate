  <div class="title">Trends in temperature variability in the period 1958–2017 in observations and models.</div>
  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Observations from HadCRUT4, (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) observations from GISTEMP, and (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) CMIP5 models. (A) and (B) show Kendall τ values, whereas (C) shows the number of models agreeing on the sign of the Kendall τ value. The window size for removing the annual cycle was 15 years, and the window to compute the Kendall τ value for the change in SD was 20 years.
