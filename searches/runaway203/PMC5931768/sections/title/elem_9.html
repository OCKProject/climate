      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanisms that we identify above are in line with previous studies that have
         usually focused on temperature extremes (extreme compared to current climate) and
         on shorter time scales (
         <a><span>37</span></a>, 
         <a><span>38</span></a>). When comparing the occurrence of such extreme events between models and observation-based
         data sets, previous studies have usually found good agreement regarding their frequency
         and trend patterns (
         <a><span>39</span></a>, 
         <a><span>40</span></a>). Here, we briefly compare the modeled variability of monthly mean temperatures with
         four reanalysis data sets (see Materials and Methods for more detail): ERA-Interim
         (
         <a><span>41</span></a>), NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Reanalysis V2c (
         <a><span>42</span></a>), NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 (
         <a><span>43</span></a>), and MERRA2 (
         <a><span>44</span></a>). Although locally constrained by observations, these reanalysis data sets allow
         a global and temporally complete coverage. We calculate the temperature SD in the
         period 1980–2010 for all models and the four reanalyses by linear detrending for each
         month and computing the SD of the residuals. Overall, our comparison confirms that
         the current temperature SD of the CMIP5 models is within the observational range (fig.
         S6). Regional biases occur mostly in high latitudes over areas of substantial variability
         in sea-ice cover and over some tropical land regions (fig. S6A). However, these model
         mean biases are comparable in magnitude with the typical differences between models
         (fig. S6B) and, over some regions, are also comparable to the differences between
         reanalysis data sets (fig. S6C).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CMIP5 models are particularly uncertain and biased in the Amazon. Although most models
         show a pronounced hotspot of future temperature SD increase, this is also the region
         where the magnitude of this increase is most uncertain. Overall, the regions that
         the models identify as hotspots of future temperature SD increase tend to have a positive
         bias, that is, the model average shows larger present-day variability than reanalyses
         (fig. S6A). However, selecting groups of models based on their overall sign of biases
         hardly affects the general pattern of changing temperature variability. Although there
         is a tendency for models with positive bias to also show larger increases in temperature
         SD in many places, this bias is relatively small compared to the predicted changes
         in most hotspot areas, and the position of hotspots and the relative magnitude of
         temperature variability changes in these regions are not substantially affected.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Donat 
         <span>et al</span>. (
         <a><span>37</span></a>) recently raised the question whether the predictions of the models are reliable
         or whether they share common biases in their predictions of temperature extremes,
         despite the overall agreement regarding the magnitude of observed variability. In
         the case that the model predictions are correct, the question arises whether the anthropogenic
         fingerprint is already apparent in observations of temperature variability. We therefore
         recalculate the changes in temperature SD for the period from 1958 to 2017 and compare
         the result to two observational data sets based on in situ measurements from meteorological
         stations: HadCRUT4 (
         <a><span>45</span></a>) and the GISS (NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies) Surface Temperature Analysis
         (GISTEMP) (see Materials and Methods) (
         <a><span>46</span></a>). These data sets report temperatures whose mean and variance have been standardized
         with a reference period. This procedure is known to introduce biases in variance changes
         (
         <a><span>47</span></a>), although the effect is likely small here because the trends that we find in the
         observational data sets tend to also show up in the reanalyses that have no such bias
         (
         <a><span>17</span></a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At first sight, the observations do not agree well with the signal in the model predictions
         (
         <a>Fig. 4</a>). The most apparent features in observations are an increase in temperature SD in
         the Mediterranean region and a decrease in some parts of North America and Northern
         Europe (
         <a>Fig. 4</a>, A and B). In contrast, the tendencies of changes in temperature SD in the models
         already show the overall pattern that we analyzed above when all models are considered
         (
         <a>Fig. 4C</a>). However, the model agreement is still relatively low, and the characteristic contrast
         between high and low latitudes is not apparent in individual models with very few
         exceptions. If we assume that each model is one realization of climate variability
         in the real world, then this means that we cannot expect to see the anthropogenic
         signal in recent observations. It is only during the 21st century that the signal
         emerges in the large majority of the models, with more than 80% of the models agreeing
         on the sign until 2100 over subtropical land and the mid- and high latitudes (fig.
         S1). Although the sign of variability change in observations can be very clear at
         places (indicated by a large absolute Kendall τ value), these observations still provide
         only one realization.

               in SD was 20 years.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a recent companion study (
         <a><span>17</span></a>), we have shown that the sign of the observed temperature trends substantially depends
         on the choice of the time period, which confirms that the observed changes are largely
         related to internal climate variability and not a forced trend. The relatively robust
         decrease of observed variability over high northern latitudes in the North Atlantic
         region, however, might already be part of the anthropogenic signal (associated with
         sea-ice loss). Unfortunately, the regions with the largest model agreement in 
         <a>Fig. 4C</a> (tropical land areas and high latitudes)—where the anthropogenic signal can be expected
         to emerge the earliest—are also among the regions with the fewest observations. It
         is therefore hard to conclude whether current observations confirm or refute the predictions
         of models regarding trends in monthly temperature variability.
