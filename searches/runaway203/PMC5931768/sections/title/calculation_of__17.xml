 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the monthly mean surface air temperature and removed the annual cycle at each grid cell within a running window of 30 years length, centered at the time point under consideration (fig. S8A). Choosing a baseline in such a local time window and considering each month separately are crucial to our analysis because it circumvents two problems: (i) the typical annual cycle changes over time (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" href="#R54">
   <span class="italic">54</span>
  </a>), for example, because the minimum and maximum sea-ice area occurs later in the year in a warmer world (

   <span class="italic">54</span>
  </a>), and (ii) the choice of any specific reference period would lead to biases due to the limited sample size (
  <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
   <span class="italic">47</span>
  </a>). Within the window and for each month, we subtracted the mean value of all 30 temperature values to obtain a temperature anomaly. Because of the necessity of 15 years of data to both sides of a data point, the procedure shortens each time series by 30 years.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thereafter, we calculated the SD within a sliding window of 100 years that we moved along each anomaly time series at each grid cell in each model (fig. S8B). Hence, the window covers almost half the length of the whole time series like in previous studies (
  <a rid="R55" ref-type="bibr" href="#R55">
   <span class="italic">55</span>
  </a>). We calculated the trend in the obtained SD values based on the Kendal τ rank correlation coefficient (fig. S8C). A positive Kendal τ signals increasing SD, whereas a negative τ indicates decreasing SD. For example, a monotonous increase over time would yield τ = 1, whereas a monotonous decrease would yield τ = −1, and no trend would yield τ = 0. The Kendall τ values were used to assess the model agreement in fig. S1 and the hatching in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>. These sign agreements hence reflect the changes over the whole time series from 1850 to 2100.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For comparing trends in models and observations in the period 1958–2017, we used the same procedure but with a sliding window size of 15 years to remove the annual cycle, and 20 years to calculate the SD of the residuals. We took 1958 as the start year because we expected the anthropogenic fingerprint to be small before the mid–20th century and because only few observations are available from earlier years.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For comparing models and reanalysis data sets in the time period 1980–2010, we used a slightly different procedure: Instead of using a running window, we removed a linear trend from each month’s yearly time series. This linear trend removal is adequate because of the short time period and has the advantage that no data points are lost in the beginning and end of the time series. As we removed trends for each month separately, we still took into account that the typical annual cycle can change within the time period.</p>
