      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anticipating how anthropogenic climate change will affect natural and human systems
         requires an understanding not only of the changes in the mean climate but also whether
         and how climate variability will change. For instance, present temperature fluctuations
         in the tropics are strongly correlated with negative agricultural, economic, and political
         impacts (
         <a><span>1</span></a>–
         <a><span>3</span></a>). The increasing frequency and persistence of extreme weather events (
         <a><span>4</span></a>) like heat waves or droughts can have severe impacts on many biological systems showing
         nonlinear responses to environmental change (
         <a><span>5</span></a>). These effects involve changes in the physiological responses of individual species
         (
         <a><span>6</span></a>), the risk of species extinction (
         <a><span>7</span></a>), the functioning of global terrestrial ecosystems (
         <a><span>8</span></a>), and human food security (
         <a><span>9</span></a>). Furthermore, climate variability can also be an indicator of the sensitivity of
         climate to perturbations, and variability changes have been proposed to be a forewarning
         of upcoming tipping points (
         <a><span>10</span></a>, 
         <a><span>11</span></a>). It is therefore important to understand the patterns of variability change and
         the mechanisms behind them.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies analyzing variability changes predicted by climate models have focused
         on changes in variance (
         <a><span>12</span></a>), mostly in high and mid-latitudes (
         <a><span>13</span></a>) and the global mean temperature (
         <a><span>14</span></a>, 
         <a><span>15</span></a>). Here, we analyze changes in the standard deviation (SD) of monthly temperature
         anomalies on a local scale, with the aims of (i) identifying regional hotspots where
         models agree on the largest magnitude changes and (ii) investigating the physical
         mechanisms behind the identified changes. Because of the variability of climate on
         multiple time scales, observational time series are usually too short to detect a
         clear human influence on climate variability (
         <a><span>16</span></a>–
         <a><span>18</span></a>). Here, instead, we analyze all available state-of-the art climate models from the
         Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) (
         <a><span>19</span></a>), which were used to inform the last report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
         Change. Our time series consist of the historical simulation starting in 1850, followed
         by the future scenario with the largest greenhouse gas emissions, RCP8.5 (
         <a><span>20</span></a>). The 37 models in total are used to calculate changes until the year 2100, and simulations
         with nine of the models have been extended until the year 2300. In the following,
         we examine monthly temperature anomalies, where each anomaly value represents the
         deviation from the 30-year running mean of the same month at a particular grid cell
         in a model (see Materials and Methods). We then analyze the changes in SD over time
         that are associated with global warming.
