      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two observational temperature data sets, based on in situ measurements from
         meteorological stations: HadCRUT4 (
         <a><span>45</span></a>) and the GISTEMP (
         <a><span>46</span></a>). The latter data set has been interpolated over a scale of 1200 km to fill spatial
         gaps between stations, which is the reason for the very uniform changes in the Arctic
         in fig. S8 (
         <a><span>46</span></a>). Because these data sets report temperature as standardized anomalies, we did not
         calculate absolute changes in variability, but only the direction of change as Kendall
         τ values. The GISTEMP data set has been obtained as version 5 from the GISS, 
         <span>https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/</span>. The HadCRUT data set (version 4.6.0.0) has been obtained from 
         <span>https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/</span>. Both data sets have been downloaded on 31 January 2018. The four reanalysis data
         sets and their sources are the following:
