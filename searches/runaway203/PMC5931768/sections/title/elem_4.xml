 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are known to affect temperature over land (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>), SST variability appears not to be responsible for the increased variability on land, because of the low model agreement over the oceans in contrast to the large agreement in the identified land hotspots (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a> and fig. S1). Furthermore, in the Southern Hemisphere summer, advection only plays a minor role (fig. S4C). We therefore focus on the local energy balance over land.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a local perspective, fluctuations in the downwelling radiation (short-wave plus long-wave fluxes) at the surface, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub>, can be seen as a direct atmospheric driver of temperature changes, which determines how much energy is available at the surface. We do not consider changes in surface albedo here because its contribution to monthly variability is likely small. We recognize that local conditions can feed back to the atmosphere (for example, via changes in cloud cover) to affect 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub>, but note that 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> is also determined by processes on larger scales. A second important parameter is the evaporative fraction (EF) (the part of the available energy at the surface used to evaporate water), here calculated as 
  <span class="italic">EF</span> = 
  <span class="italic">LH</span>/(
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>u</sub> + 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub>), with upwelling radiation 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>u</sub> and latent heat flux (LH). Because an increase in sensible heat flux is associated with temperature increase, whereas increased LH is not, EF determines by how much a change in atmospheric forcing translates into temperature change. The smaller the EF becomes, the greater the effect of variations in available net radiation on temperature, because more radiation is converted into sensible instead of latent heat.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have shown that changes in soil moisture affect the partitioning of surface fluxes mostly in intermediate moisture regimes (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). Where evapotranspiration is limited by moisture but still has a substantial contribution to the energy balance, soil moisture has the largest effect on LH or temperature (and hence their variability). In this context, it is striking that regions with substantial increases in temperature variability coincide with regions identified as hotspots of strong soil moisture temperature coupling in previous studies (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>). We therefore analyze how increases in temperature variability are related to changes in soil moisture and EF, in comparison to variations in downwelling radiation 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub>. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2A</a> shows that the grid cells where temperature variability increases (red on the color scale) tend to have decreasing soil moisture (horizontal axis) as well as increasing variability in 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> (vertical axis). The same relation emerges when plotting EF instead of soil moisture (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>). Therefore, the changes in the Southern Hemisphere hotspots are consistent with the explanation that soil moisture loss leads to smaller EF and thus larger temperature variability. Even in the humid climate of Amazonia where evapotranspiration is limited by radiation in many places, the large future drying brings the region closer to a soil moisture–limited regime, which is associated with a large reduction in the positive correlation between evapotranspiration and incoming radiation (fig. S5).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such a transition from a wet to a moisture-limited regime is associated with an increase in the sensitivity of LH to soil moisture fluctuations (even in the absence of any changes in available radiation) (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>). The variability changes in 
  <span class="italic">LH</span> and 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> can therefore potentially reveal information on the mechanisms behind changes in variability. In agreement with the soil moisture hypothesis, increased temperature variability is associated with substantial increases in the variability of LH (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). The SD of 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> and LH both increase to a similar extent, and thus, both contribute to increased temperature variability. However, as the changes in EF and soil moisture show, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> cannot be the sole driver of the increased temperature variability because there is no clear reason why the increased SD of 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> would systematically deplete the mean soil moisture. Instead, we suggest that the SD increase in downwelling radiation in these areas is at least partly associated with land-atmosphere feedbacks. For example, surface drying can affect cloud distribution and, hence, the variability of 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub>. To separate these effects quantitatively, specific additional model simulations would be needed.
