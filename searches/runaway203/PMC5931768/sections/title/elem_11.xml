 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted increases in temperature variability in the identified hotspots suggest the potential for substantial impacts on top of the impacts caused by changes in the mean climate. Poor countries are located in the identified hotspot regions of increasing temperature variability. A growing body of climate-economy literature shows that poor countries are particularly vulnerable to weather and climate shocks, whereas rich countries tend to show no significant vulnerability (

  </a>). Tropical temperature fluctuations are not only strongly correlated with a temporal loss of agricultural output, as might be expected from anomalous weather affecting crop productivity and yields (

   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>). They also affect the economic growth rate of countries, leading to long-term economic disadvantages compared to the development of other nations (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). Moreover, it has been argued that high temperatures favor political instability and conflict in tropical countries (

  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
   <span class="italic">49</span>
  </a>), although this claim remains controversial (
  <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">
   <span class="italic">50</span>
  </a>). Like our own analysis, these studies are often based on monthly climate anomalies over many years and, thus, integrate many individual weather and climate events. The unequal projected regional changes in climate variability therefore constitute a matter of climate justice.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate this, we calculate the relative changes in temperature SD for individual countries, omitting small countries that are usually not resolved in the models (see Materials and Methods). It is particularly striking that the geographical pattern of the changes in SD coincides closely with the current distribution of wealth on the national level (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>). Although temperature fluctuations are projected to become smaller in countries having a large per capita gross domestic product (GDP), they tend to increase in countries with low GDP. Hence, countries facing the largest increases in temperature variability also have the least economic potential to cope with the impacts. The countries affected by this dual challenge of poverty and increasing variability already share half of the world’s population (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>), and population growth rates are particularly large in these countries (see Materials and Methods for data sources).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unequal changes in projected climate variability are also a challenge for climate justice regarding the contributions of different nations to global climate change. Considering the average per capita emissions in the period 1990–2015 (excluding land use change and forestry), countries with the smallest emissions tend to have the largest increases in variability (fig. S7A), whereas those with the largest emissions tend to have smaller increases or even decreases in variability (Australia being a notable exception). The picture changes somewhat when including recent emissions from land use change and forestry (fig. S7B), bearing in mind that land use–related emissions are much more uncertain than emission estimates from fossil fuel burning. In the selected time period, tropical countries contributed a large fraction to land use–related emissions, associated with tropical deforestation especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Amazonia, and Southeast Asia.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of the econometric studies mentioned above, it is hard to conclude what the exact impacts of changing climate variability will be. For example, it is important to assess to what extent the impacts caused by warm climate anomalies are compensated by cold anomalies. In general, an increase in temperature variability is arguably more difficult to cope with than a decrease in variability. Societies and ecosystems are typically adapted to a certain long-term climate at any particular location—the more an anomaly deviates from the local mean, the more damage it can thus cause. This is particularly important in the presence of critical thresholds, for example, in species performance (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>). Several studies find nonlinearity in the effect of temperature anomalies, for example, on agriculture, mortality, and energy demand (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>), indicating that the effects of warm and cold anomalies will not simply cancel out. Moreover, the distribution of daily temperature is projected to become more skewed to warm anomalies in many of the identified hotspot locations (
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>). It therefore seems plausible that, overall, the projected increases in temperature variability would have negative consequences for nature and society.
