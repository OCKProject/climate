      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GDP per person (based on purchasing power parity) for 
         <a>Fig. 5</a> has been obtained from 
         <span>http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?view=chart</span> for the year 2015. Countries smaller than 60,000 km
         <span>2</span> were omitted. For four countries, data from the year 2015 were not available, in
         which case we chose the most recent year for which data were available: Eritrea (2011),
         Libya (2011), Papua New Guinea (2014), and Venezuela (2013). To calculate changes
         in SD in individual countries (
         <a>Fig. 5</a>), we interpolated the multimodel average of the relative annual SD changes (
         <a>Fig. 1C</a>) to a global grid of 0.1 Ã— 0.1 degrees using a bilinear interpolation. We then picked
         all grid cells in a particular country and calculated the area average. The country
         boundaries for creating the selection mask have been obtained from 
         <span>http://gadm.org/</span>. Population estimates and projections have been obtained from 
         <span>https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/</span>. Estimates for the year 2015 have been used for 
         <a>Fig. 5</a>. Greenhouse gas emissions have been obtained from the World Resources Institute (
         <span>http://cait.wri.org</span>). For Sudan, emissions from 2011 were used, whereas South Sudan was omitted. Country
         acronyms in 
         <a>Fig. 5</a> and fig. S7 are International Organization for Standardization alpha-3 codes.
