      <div>Index related to the changes in the SD of LH versus downwelling net radiation.</div>
      <p>See main text and 
         <a>Fig. 2</a> (C and F). Negative values indicate that changes are driven by soil drying, whereas
         positive values indicate a larger contribution of atmospheric variability. Ice sheets
         and locations where changes in temperature SD are smaller than 0.1K have been masked
         out (white areas). Each hemisphere shows summer conditions (JJA in the North, DJF
         in the South). All changes are calculated from the multimodel average and the period
         1875–1904 versus 2055–2084.
