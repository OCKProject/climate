 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Northern Hemisphere shows a very different pattern (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, D to F). There, soil moisture is not a good explanatory variable in general (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>). This occurs because soil moisture does not limit EF in many places, so that decreases in soil moisture do not necessarily cause increased temperature variability. Moreover, changes in EF alone cannot explain the increased temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2E</a>), and increases in 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> variability are needed as an explanatory variable at many places. The few exceptions with decreased temperature SD in the range of +4 to 6 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> of downwelling radiation SD (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2E</a>) occur at grid boxes in very high northern latitudes (mainly Northeast Canada) where the fluctuations in available energy are often compensated by phase changes (melting snow and water, or freezing water) instead of temperature fluctuations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This pattern suggests that changes in the atmosphere on a regional scale are an important driver of the changes in variability at the surface. When we compare changes in the variability of 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> and LH in the Northern Hemisphere summer, we find two distinct regimes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2F</a>). The horizontal (bottom-right) branch with substantial increases in LH variability is consistent with the soil-drying mechanism explained above. Because 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> variability does not increase or even decreases, the soil moisture loss must be solely responsible for the enhanced temperature variability. In contrast, the vertical (upper) branch in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2F</a> consists of dry regions where other mechanisms dominate, whereas changes in LH variability are small.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate the geographical distribution of these differences, we quantify the relation between SD changes in LH and net downwelling surface radiation (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub>) as an index (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). This index (
  <span class="italic">I</span>) is proportional to the angle in the diagram spanned by the two properties (blue coordinate system in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, C and F)

  </div>where ΔSD(
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub>) and ΔSD(LH) stand for the changes in the SD of 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> and LH. The factor 2/π and the shift by 0.5 transform this angle in such a way to obtain a value of −1 if the increase in LH SD equals the decrease in 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> SD, 0 if both increase by the same amount (most points in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a> lie in this direction), and +1 if 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub> SD increases as much as LH SD decreases. In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>, all clearly negative values (blue areas) are associated with variability increases in the latent heat flux, which cannot be explained with radiation alone. All clearly positive values (red areas) are associated with an increased variability of the downwelling radiation 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>d</sub>, which cannot be explained with local hydrological changes. For example, heat waves in European summer (
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>) show up as dominated by soil moisture loss (the horizontal branch in the scatter cloud of 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2F</a>), whereas, in the subtropics of the Northern Hemisphere (mostly the Sahel, Arabia, and India), radiation often dominates over LH changes (vertical branch in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2F</a>). The latter indicates that local changes in hydrology are too small to explain the radiative changes and that processes other than soil moisture loss are causing increased temperature fluctuations.

Negative values indicate that changes are driven by soil drying, whereas positive values indicate a larger contribution of atmospheric variability. Ice sheets and locations where changes in temperature SD are smaller than 0.1K have been masked out (white areas). Each hemisphere shows summer conditions (JJA in the North, DJF in the South). All changes are calculated from the multimodel average and the period 1875–1904 versus 2055–2084.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because model agreement tends to be lower in India and the Sahel than in other hotspots (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a> and fig. S1), we also calculate model averages for only the models showing an increase in temperature SD in a given region. In India, the SD of rainfall, soil moisture, cloud cover, and LH all increase despite little changes in mean soil moisture. This indicates that the Indian summer monsoon in the models is becoming more variable under greenhouse forcing, a result that is confirmed by other studies (
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>). A similar effect occurs in Southeast Asia (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>), in combination with a mean soil moisture decrease, causing an additional SD increase in temperature. In the Sahel, summer rainfall protrudes further north in those models showing a clear increase in temperature SD. Where the preindustrial climate has been almost permanently dry, an increased occurrence of cloudier and wetter months promotes increased variability in both radiation and LH. Moreover, because the Sahara warms more than the vegetated regions to the South, the meridional temperature gradient in the Sahel region is enhanced (fig. S4B). This enhancement of variability due to the increased spatial temperature contrast is hence the reversed mechanism of the decreased variability in mid-latitudes. An increased temperature gradient is also the reason for the zone of large SD increase surrounding the Arctic Ocean (fig. S4A), which warms much less than the land.
