      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are known to affect temperature over
         land (
         <a><span>24</span></a>), SST variability appears not to be responsible for the increased variability on
         land, because of the low model agreement over the oceans in contrast to the large
         agreement in the identified land hotspots (
         <a>Fig. 1</a> and fig. S1). Furthermore, in the Southern Hemisphere summer, advection only plays
         a minor role (fig. S4C). We therefore focus on the local energy balance over land.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a local perspective, fluctuations in the downwelling radiation (short-wave plus
         long-wave fluxes) at the surface, 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>, can be seen as a direct atmospheric driver of temperature changes, which determines
         how much energy is available at the surface. We do not consider changes in surface
         albedo here because its contribution to monthly variability is likely small. We recognize
         that local conditions can feed back to the atmosphere (for example, via changes in
         cloud cover) to affect 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>, but note that 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> is also determined by processes on larger scales. A second important parameter is
         the evaporative fraction (EF) (the part of the available energy at the surface used
         to evaporate water), here calculated as 
         <span>EF</span> = 
         <span>LH</span>/(
         <span>R</span><sub>u</sub> + 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>), with upwelling radiation 
         <span>R</span><sub>u</sub> and latent heat flux (LH). Because an increase in sensible heat flux is associated
         with temperature increase, whereas increased LH is not, EF determines by how much
         a change in atmospheric forcing translates into temperature change. The smaller the
         EF becomes, the greater the effect of variations in available net radiation on temperature,
         because more radiation is converted into sensible instead of latent heat.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have shown that changes in soil moisture affect the partitioning
         of surface fluxes mostly in intermediate moisture regimes (
         <a><span>30</span></a>). Where evapotranspiration is limited by moisture but still has a substantial contribution
         to the energy balance, soil moisture has the largest effect on LH or temperature (and
         hence their variability). In this context, it is striking that regions with substantial
         increases in temperature variability coincide with regions identified as hotspots
         of strong soil moisture temperature coupling in previous studies (
         <a><span>30</span></a>, 
         <a><span>31</span></a>). We therefore analyze how increases in temperature variability are related to changes
         in soil moisture and EF, in comparison to variations in downwelling radiation 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>. 
         <a>Figure 2A</a> shows that the grid cells where temperature variability increases (red on the color
         scale) tend to have decreasing soil moisture (horizontal axis) as well as increasing
         variability in 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> (vertical axis). The same relation emerges when plotting EF instead of soil moisture
         (
         <a>Fig. 2B</a>). Therefore, the changes in the Southern Hemisphere hotspots are consistent with
         the explanation that soil moisture loss leads to smaller EF and thus larger temperature
         variability. Even in the humid climate of Amazonia where evapotranspiration is limited
         by radiation in many places, the large future drying brings the region closer to a
         soil moisture–limited regime, which is associated with a large reduction in the positive
         correlation between evapotranspiration and incoming radiation (fig. S5).

               in SD. Each dot represents the difference between the periods 1875–1904 and 2055–2084
               at a particular land grid cell in the Southern Hemisphere without Antarctica (A to
               
               <span>C</span>) and the Northern Hemisphere without Greenland (D to 
               <span>F</span>) for the multimodel average. All figures show summer conditions (DJF in the Southern
               Hemisphere, JJA in the Northern Hemisphere). The blue coordinate system in (C) and
               (F) defines the index shown in 
               <a>Fig. 3</a>, with negative values indicating larger increases in LH variability and positive
               values indicating larger radiative variability.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such a transition from a wet to a moisture-limited regime is associated with an increase
         in the sensitivity of LH to soil moisture fluctuations (even in the absence of any
         changes in available radiation) (
         <a><span>30</span></a>, 
         <a><span>32</span></a>). The variability changes in 
         <span>LH</span> and 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> can therefore potentially reveal information on the mechanisms behind changes in
         variability. In agreement with the soil moisture hypothesis, increased temperature
         variability is associated with substantial increases in the variability of LH (
         <a>Fig. 2C</a>). The SD of 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> and LH both increase to a similar extent, and thus, both contribute to increased
         temperature variability. However, as the changes in EF and soil moisture show, 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> cannot be the sole driver of the increased temperature variability because there
         is no clear reason why the increased SD of 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> would systematically deplete the mean soil moisture. Instead, we suggest that the
         SD increase in downwelling radiation in these areas is at least partly associated
         with land-atmosphere feedbacks. For example, surface drying can affect cloud distribution
         and, hence, the variability of 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>. To separate these effects quantitatively, specific additional model simulations
         would be needed.
