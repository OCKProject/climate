      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed all 37 models for which surface air temperature was available from the
         historical and RCP8.5 simulations: ACCESS1-0, ACCESS1-3, bcc-csm1-1, bcc-csm1-1-m,
         BNU-ESM, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CESM1-CAM5, CMCC-CESM, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CMS, CNRM-CM5,
         CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, FGOALS-g2, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, FIO-ESM, EC-EARTH, GISS-E2-H,
         GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, inmcm4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR,
         IPSL-CM5B-LR, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3,
         NorESM1-M, and NorESM1-ME. The historical simulation starts in the year 1850, with
         the exception of the three versions of HadGEM2, where it starts in 1860. The RCP8.5
         simulation ends in 2100 and has been extended to 2300 in the models bcc-csm1-1, CCSM4,
         CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, GISS-E2-G, GISS-E2-H, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and MPI-ESM-LR, and to
         2299 in HadGEM2-ES. For GFDL-ESM2M, years 2101 to 2200 were also available but were
         not used for our analysis.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the RCP8.5 scenario, atmospheric CO
         <sub>2</sub> shows an accelerated increase until the year 2100, when a radiative forcing of approximately
         8.5 Wm
         <span>âˆ’2</span> is reached. Thereafter, the CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration stabilizes at almost 2000 parts per million (
         <a><span>20</span></a>), yielding the largest warming of all CMIP5 simulations. For each model, we combined
         the historical simulation, the RCP8.5 simulation, and (if available) the extended
         RCP8.5 simulation, obtaining one long time series per grid cell and model.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although temperature output was available from all selected models, this is not true
         for all variables that we analyzed. Specifically, LH was not available for EC-EARTH,
         downwelling net radiation was not available for FIO-ESM and EC-EARTH, and surface
         soil moisture (shown in 
         <a>Fig. 2</a>, A and D) was not available for the CMCC models, FIO-ESM, EC-EARTH, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO,
         HadGEM2-ES, inmcm4, the IPSL models, MIROC-ESM, and the MPI-ESM models.
