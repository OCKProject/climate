 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We loosely define hotspots as regions of relatively large variability changes that also show a large model agreement on the sign of the change. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a> shows the projected relative changes in SD of monthly temperature anomalies until the end of the 21st century, averaged over all 37 models (see fig. S1 for model agreement). Several hotspots of increases in SD are revealed over (sub)tropical land, namely, Amazonia, Southern Africa, Australia, the Sahel, the Arabian Peninsula, India, and Southeast Asia. In boreal summer, large increases occur over Europe, North America, and near the Arctic coast (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>). In all other seasons, SD decreases over northern mid-latitudes (fig. S2). Several of the identified hotspots are consistent with previous modeling studies (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Absolute changes in variability are greatest in mid- and high latitudes in boreal autumn and winter (fig. S2), but these are also regions with the largest background levels of temperature variability. In relative terms, the largest changes in SD are increases of up to 40% in Amazonia and Southern Africa in austral spring and summer. Using temperature anomalies from all months of the year, Amazonia stands out as a region with a particularly large relative SD increase (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>) because increases occur in all seasons. Although the models agree on the sign of change, the magnitude differs substantially between the models, with some models showing a doubling of SD in the tropical hotspots, especially in central and northern Amazonia. The changes continue in the nine models extended beyond 2100 and scale approximately with global warming. In the model average, each degree of global warming leads to an ~15% increase in SD in Amazonia, Southern Africa, and the Arctic coast during the local summer season, and a 10% increase in the subtropical hotspots of the Northern Hemisphere (fig. S3).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have isolated the role of selected mechanisms in individual models by suppressing certain sources of variability (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). This is not feasible across all of the CMIP5 models; hence, we take a different approach and analyze the changes in the terms contributing to the surface energy balance in the model mean, and identify important regional differences. In high latitudes, decreases in temperature SD are particularly pronounced over regions with sea-ice loss because the exposed ocean introduces a much larger heat capacity. This leads to more persistent but damped anomalies (

   <span class="italic">12</span>

  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>), in other words, SD decreases. Reductions in SD in mid-latitudes are not directly related to Arctic sea-ice loss. The largest SD decrease in the Arctic occurs in autumn [September, October, and November (SON)], the season with the largest sea-ice loss until 2100, whereas the SD decrease in mid-latitudes is most pronounced during Northern Hemisphere winter (DJF), the season where Arctic amplification is largest (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a> and fig. S2). This amplification of mean warming in high northern latitudes leads to a reduced meridional temperature gradient (fig. S4). If one assumes that typical wind patterns do not change, then incoming air from the North or South is less different in temperature than it was when the temperature gradient weakens, leading to smaller local temperature anomalies. Calculating the monthly anomalies of advection (the local temperature tendencies due to horizontal wind) indeed reveals a decrease of the advection-induced temperature variability (fig. S4). We thereby confirm previous studies showing that the decreased temperature variability in mid-latitudes is associated with a decreased meridional temperature gradient due to the polar amplification of global warming (

  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). The CMIP5 models do not support the alternative hypothesis that Arctic amplification causes increased meandering of the mid-latitude westerlies and, hence, greater variance and persistence of mid-latitude weather conditions (

  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increases of temperature variability that we find are largest in the season of maximum insolation (fig. S2). In the following, we therefore focus on the summer season. In the Southern Hemisphere, the results are qualitatively similar in all seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer season is the only season with an increased SD of temperature anomalies, whereas SD decreases in all other seasons (for the reasons described above). The large increases in SD over tropical land are particularly striking and have not been explained in previous analyses.</p>
