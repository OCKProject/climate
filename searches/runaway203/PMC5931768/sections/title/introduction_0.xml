 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anticipating how anthropogenic climate change will affect natural and human systems requires an understanding not only of the changes in the mean climate but also whether and how climate variability will change. For instance, present temperature fluctuations in the tropics are strongly correlated with negative agricultural, economic, and political impacts (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). The increasing frequency and persistence of extreme weather events (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>) like heat waves or droughts can have severe impacts on many biological systems showing nonlinear responses to environmental change (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). These effects involve changes in the physiological responses of individual species (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>), the risk of species extinction (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>), the functioning of global terrestrial ecosystems (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>), and human food security (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>). Furthermore, climate variability can also be an indicator of the sensitivity of climate to perturbations, and variability changes have been proposed to be a forewarning of upcoming tipping points (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>). It is therefore important to understand the patterns of variability change and the mechanisms behind them.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies analyzing variability changes predicted by climate models have focused on changes in variance (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>), mostly in high and mid-latitudes (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>) and the global mean temperature (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). Here, we analyze changes in the standard deviation (SD) of monthly temperature anomalies on a local scale, with the aims of (i) identifying regional hotspots where models agree on the largest magnitude changes and (ii) investigating the physical mechanisms behind the identified changes. Because of the variability of climate on multiple time scales, observational time series are usually too short to detect a clear human influence on climate variability (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). Here, instead, we analyze all available state-of-the art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) (
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>), which were used to inform the last report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our time series consist of the historical simulation starting in 1850, followed by the future scenario with the largest greenhouse gas emissions, RCP8.5 (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>). The 37 models in total are used to calculate changes until the year 2100, and simulations with nine of the models have been extended until the year 2300. In the following, we examine monthly temperature anomalies, where each anomaly value represents the deviation from the 30-year running mean of the same month at a particular grid cell in a model (see Materials and Methods). We then analyze the changes in SD over time that are associated with global warming.
