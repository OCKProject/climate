         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed all 37 models for which surface air temperature was available from the
            historical and RCP8.5 simulations: ACCESS1-0, ACCESS1-3, bcc-csm1-1, bcc-csm1-1-m,
            BNU-ESM, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CESM1-CAM5, CMCC-CESM, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CMS, CNRM-CM5,

            IPSL-CM5B-LR, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3,
            NorESM1-M, and NorESM1-ME. The historical simulation starts in the year 1850, with
            the exception of the three versions of HadGEM2, where it starts in 1860. The RCP8.5
            simulation ends in 2100 and has been extended to 2300 in the models bcc-csm1-1, CCSM4,
            CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, GISS-E2-G, GISS-E2-H, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and MPI-ESM-LR, and to
            2299 in HadGEM2-ES. For GFDL-ESM2M, years 2101 to 2200 were also available but were
            not used for our analysis.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the RCP8.5 scenario, atmospheric CO
            <sub>2</sub> shows an accelerated increase until the year 2100, when a radiative forcing of approximately
            8.5 Wm
            <span>−2</span> is reached. Thereafter, the CO
            <sub>2</sub> concentration stabilizes at almost 2000 parts per million (
            <a><span>20</span></a>), yielding the largest warming of all CMIP5 simulations. For each model, we combined
            the historical simulation, the RCP8.5 simulation, and (if available) the extended
            RCP8.5 simulation, obtaining one long time series per grid cell and model.

            for all variables that we analyzed. Specifically, LH was not available for EC-EARTH,
            downwelling net radiation was not available for FIO-ESM and EC-EARTH, and surface
            soil moisture (shown in

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used two observational temperature data sets, based on in situ measurements from
            meteorological stations: HadCRUT4 (
            <a><span>45</span></a>) and the GISTEMP (
            <a><span>46</span></a>). The latter data set has been interpolated over a scale of 1200 km to fill spatial
            gaps between stations, which is the reason for the very uniform changes in the Arctic
            in fig. S8 (
            <a><span>46</span></a>). Because these data sets report temperature as standardized anomalies, we did not
            calculate absolute changes in variability, but only the direction of change as Kendall
            τ values. The GISTEMP data set has been obtained as version 5 from the GISS, 
            <span>https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/</span>. The HadCRUT data set (version 4.6.0.0) has been obtained from

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Calculation of anomalies and trends in SD</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the monthly mean surface air temperature and removed the annual cycle at each
            grid cell within a running window of 30 years length, centered at the time point under
            consideration (fig. S8A). Choosing a baseline in such a local time window and considering
            each month separately are crucial to our analysis because it circumvents two problems:
            (i) the typical annual cycle changes over time (
            <a><span>53</span></a>, 
            <a><span>54</span></a>), for example, because the minimum and maximum sea-ice area occurs later in the year
            in a warmer world (
            <a><span>54</span></a>), and (ii) the choice of any specific reference period would lead to biases due to
            the limited sample size (
            <a><span>47</span></a>). Within the window and for each month, we subtracted the mean value of all 30 temperature
            values to obtain a temperature anomaly. Because of the necessity of 15 years of data
            to both sides of a data point, the procedure shortens each time series by 30 years.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thereafter, we calculated the SD within a sliding window of 100 years that we moved
            along each anomaly time series at each grid cell in each model (fig. S8B). Hence,
            the window covers almost half the length of the whole time series like in previous
            studies (
            <a><span>55</span></a>). We calculated the trend in the obtained SD values based on the Kendal τ rank correlation
            coefficient (fig. S8C). A positive Kendal τ signals increasing SD, whereas a negative
            τ indicates decreasing SD. For example, a monotonous increase over time would yield
            τ = 1, whereas a monotonous decrease would yield τ = −1, and no trend would yield
            τ = 0. The Kendall τ values were used to assess the model agreement in fig. S1 and
            the hatching in 
            <a>Fig. 1</a>. These sign agreements hence reflect the changes over the whole time series from
            1850 to 2100.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For comparing trends in models and observations in the period 1958–2017, we used the
            same procedure but with a sliding window size of 15 years to remove the annual cycle,
            and 20 years to calculate the SD of the residuals. We took 1958 as the start year
            because we expected the anthropogenic fingerprint to be small before the mid–20th
            century and because only few observations are available from earlier years.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For comparing models and reanalysis data sets in the time period 1980–2010, we used
            a slightly different procedure: Instead of using a running window, we removed a linear
            trend from each month’s yearly time series. This linear trend removal is adequate
            because of the short time period and has the advantage that no data points are lost
            in the beginning and end of the time series. As we removed trends for each month separately,
            we still took into account that the typical annual cycle can change within the time
            period.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Time periods and multimodel averages</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate geographic maps (
            <a>Fig. 1</a> and figs. S2 and S3) and scatter plots (
            <a>Fig. 2</a>) with changes in variability, we selected two time periods (1875–1904 and 2055–2084
            to assess changes until 2100) from the anomaly time series mentioned above in each
            model.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When calculating seasonal changes, we only selected the anomalies from the specific
            months belonging to a season (hence removing all other months from the time series).
            For each model, season, and time period, we then calculated the SD of the anomaly
            time series for the variable under consideration and took the absolute and relative
            difference between the two periods for each season and model. Because the historical
            simulation from 1850–2005 includes the radiative forcing from volcanic eruptions (in
            particular the strong eruption of Mt. Krakatoa in 1883), whereas the future scenario
            does not, we verified the robustness of our results. For example, when using a base
            period from 1888 to 1917 (that is, excluding the Krakatoa eruption) or the preindustrial
            control simulations (which do not contain volcanic eruptions), our results remain
            essentially the same.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thereafter, we averaged the resulting maps over all models. To do so, we brought the
            data on the same grid by interpolating each map to the grid of the model with the
            highest resolution (CCSM4), using a bilinear interpolation (CMCC-CM has even higher
            resolution but not all variables that we analyzed were available in that model, see
            above). The same method and grid were also used for interpolating the four reanalysis
            data sets. All multimodel averages are based on the same time period in each model.
