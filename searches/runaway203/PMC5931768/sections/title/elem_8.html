         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanisms that we identify above are in line with previous studies that have
            usually focused on temperature extremes (extreme compared to current climate) and
            on shorter time scales (
            <a><span>37</span></a>, 
            <a><span>38</span></a>). When comparing the occurrence of such extreme events between models and observation-based
            data sets, previous studies have usually found good agreement regarding their frequency
            and trend patterns (
            <a><span>39</span></a>, 
            <a><span>40</span></a>). Here, we briefly compare the modeled variability of monthly mean temperatures with
            four reanalysis data sets (see Materials and Methods for more detail): ERA-Interim
            (
            <a><span>41</span></a>), NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Reanalysis V2c (
            <a><span>42</span></a>), NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 (
            <a><span>43</span></a>), and MERRA2 (
            <a><span>44</span></a>). Although locally constrained by observations, these reanalysis data sets allow
            a global and temporally complete coverage. We calculate the temperature SD in the
            period 1980–2010 for all models and the four reanalyses by linear detrending for each
            month and computing the SD of the residuals. Overall, our comparison confirms that
            the current temperature SD of the CMIP5 models is within the observational range (fig.
            S6). Regional biases occur mostly in high latitudes over areas of substantial variability
            in sea-ice cover and over some tropical land regions (fig. S6A). However, these model
            mean biases are comparable in magnitude with the typical differences between models
            (fig. S6B) and, over some regions, are also comparable to the differences between
            reanalysis data sets (fig. S6C).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CMIP5 models are particularly uncertain and biased in the Amazon. Although most models
            show a pronounced hotspot of future temperature SD increase, this is also the region
            where the magnitude of this increase is most uncertain. Overall, the regions that
            the models identify as hotspots of future temperature SD increase tend to have a positive
            bias, that is, the model average shows larger present-day variability than reanalyses
            (fig. S6A). However, selecting groups of models based on their overall sign of biases
            hardly affects the general pattern of changing temperature variability. Although there
            is a tendency for models with positive bias to also show larger increases in temperature
            SD in many places, this bias is relatively small compared to the predicted changes
            in most hotspot areas, and the position of hotspots and the relative magnitude of
            temperature variability changes in these regions are not substantially affected.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Donat 
            <span>et al</span>. (
            <a><span>37</span></a>) recently raised the question whether the predictions of the models are reliable
            or whether they share common biases in their predictions of temperature extremes,
            despite the overall agreement regarding the magnitude of observed variability. In
            the case that the model predictions are correct, the question arises whether the anthropogenic
            fingerprint is already apparent in observations of temperature variability. We therefore
            recalculate the changes in temperature SD for the period from 1958 to 2017 and compare
            the result to two observational data sets based on in situ measurements from meteorological
            stations: HadCRUT4 (
            <a><span>45</span></a>) and the GISS (NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies) Surface Temperature Analysis
            (GISTEMP) (see Materials and Methods) (
            <a><span>46</span></a>). These data sets report temperatures whose mean and variance have been standardized
            with a reference period. This procedure is known to introduce biases in variance changes
            (
            <a><span>47</span></a>), although the effect is likely small here because the trends that we find in the
            observational data sets tend to also show up in the reanalyses that have no such bias
            (
            <a><span>17</span></a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At first sight, the observations do not agree well with the signal in the model predictions
            (
            <a>Fig. 4</a>). The most apparent features in observations are an increase in temperature SD in
            the Mediterranean region and a decrease in some parts of North America and Northern
            Europe (
            <a>Fig. 4</a>, A and B). In contrast, the tendencies of changes in temperature SD in the models
            already show the overall pattern that we analyzed above when all models are considered
            (
            <a>Fig. 4C</a>). However, the model agreement is still relatively low, and the characteristic contrast
            between high and low latitudes is not apparent in individual models with very few
            exceptions. If we assume that each model is one realization of climate variability
            in the real world, then this means that we cannot expect to see the anthropogenic
            signal in recent observations. It is only during the 21st century that the signal
            emerges in the large majority of the models, with more than 80% of the models agreeing
            on the sign until 2100 over subtropical land and the mid- and high latitudes (fig.
            S1). Although the sign of variability change in observations can be very clear at
            places (indicated by a large absolute Kendall τ value), these observations still provide
            only one realization.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a recent companion study (
            <a><span>17</span></a>), we have shown that the sign of the observed temperature trends substantially depends
            on the choice of the time period, which confirms that the observed changes are largely
            related to internal climate variability and not a forced trend. The relatively robust
            decrease of observed variability over high northern latitudes in the North Atlantic
            region, however, might already be part of the anthropogenic signal (associated with
            sea-ice loss). Unfortunately, the regions with the largest model agreement in 
            <a>Fig. 4C</a> (tropical land areas and high latitudes)—where the anthropogenic signal can be expected
            to emerge the earliest—are also among the regions with the fewest observations. It
            is therefore hard to conclude whether current observations confirm or refute the predictions
            of models regarding trends in monthly temperature variability.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A matter of climate justice</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted increases in temperature variability in the identified hotspots suggest
            the potential for substantial impacts on top of the impacts caused by changes in the
            mean climate. Poor countries are located in the identified hotspot regions of increasing
            temperature variability. A growing body of climate-economy literature shows that poor
            countries are particularly vulnerable to weather and climate shocks, whereas rich
            countries tend to show no significant vulnerability (
            <a><span>2</span></a>, 
            <a><span>3</span></a>, 
            <a><span>48</span></a>). Tropical temperature fluctuations are not only strongly correlated with a temporal
            loss of agricultural output, as might be expected from anomalous weather affecting
            crop productivity and yields (
            <a><span>3</span></a>, 
            <a><span>9</span></a>). They also affect the economic growth rate of countries, leading to long-term economic
            disadvantages compared to the development of other nations (
            <a><span>3</span></a>). Moreover, it has been argued that high temperatures favor political instability
            and conflict in tropical countries (
            <a><span>3</span></a>, 
            <a><span>49</span></a>), although this claim remains controversial (
            <a><span>50</span></a>). Like our own analysis, these studies are often based on monthly climate anomalies
            over many years and, thus, integrate many individual weather and climate events. The
            unequal projected regional changes in climate variability therefore constitute a matter
            of climate justice.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate this, we calculate the relative changes in temperature SD for individual
            countries, omitting small countries that are usually not resolved in the models (see
            Materials and Methods). It is particularly striking that the geographical pattern
            of the changes in SD coincides closely with the current distribution of wealth on
            the national level (
            <a>Fig. 5</a>). Although temperature fluctuations are projected to become smaller in countries
            having a large per capita gross domestic product (GDP), they tend to increase in countries
            with low GDP. Hence, countries facing the largest increases in temperature variability
            also have the least economic potential to cope with the impacts. The countries affected
            by this dual challenge of poverty and increasing variability already share half of
            the world’s population (
            <a>Fig. 5</a>), and population growth rates are particularly large in these countries (see Materials
            and Methods for data sources).

         </div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unequal changes in projected climate variability are also a challenge for climate
            justice regarding the contributions of different nations to global climate change.
            Considering the average per capita emissions in the period 1990–2015 (excluding land
            use change and forestry), countries with the smallest emissions tend to have the largest
            increases in variability (fig. S7A), whereas those with the largest emissions tend
            to have smaller increases or even decreases in variability (Australia being a notable
            exception). The picture changes somewhat when including recent emissions from land
            use change and forestry (fig. S7B), bearing in mind that land use–related emissions
            are much more uncertain than emission estimates from fossil fuel burning. In the selected
            time period, tropical countries contributed a large fraction to land use–related emissions,
            associated with tropical deforestation especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Amazonia,
            and Southeast Asia.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of the econometric studies mentioned above, it is hard to conclude what
            the exact impacts of changing climate variability will be. For example, it is important
            to assess to what extent the impacts caused by warm climate anomalies are compensated
            by cold anomalies. In general, an increase in temperature variability is arguably
            more difficult to cope with than a decrease in variability. Societies and ecosystems
            are typically adapted to a certain long-term climate at any particular location—the
            more an anomaly deviates from the local mean, the more damage it can thus cause. This
            is particularly important in the presence of critical thresholds, for example, in
            species performance (
            <a><span>6</span></a>). Several studies find nonlinearity in the effect of temperature anomalies, for example,
            on agriculture, mortality, and energy demand (
            <a><span>2</span></a>), indicating that the effects of warm and cold anomalies will not simply cancel out.
            Moreover, the distribution of daily temperature is projected to become more skewed
            to warm anomalies in many of the identified hotspot locations (
            <a><span>37</span></a>). It therefore seems plausible that, overall, the projected increases in temperature
            variability would have negative consequences for nature and society.
