      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis shows marked predicted increases in temperature variability in tropical
         land regions including many of the world’s poorer countries, with the Amazon being
         a particular hotspot of concern. These hotspots result mainly from soil drying in
         the Southern Hemisphere and from increased atmospheric variability in the subtropics
         of the Northern Hemisphere. Temperature variability is projected to decrease in mid-latitudes
         because of a decreasing meridional temperature gradient and in high latitudes because
         of sea-ice loss. Overall, the pattern of predicted changes agrees with previous studies
         (
         <a><span>21</span></a>–
         <a><span>23</span></a>, 
         <a><span>51</span></a>, 
         <a><span>52</span></a>) but differs from observed changes in temperature variability. Models and observations
         indicate that the anthropogenic signal may not yet have emerged from the “noise” of
         natural variability but can be expected to do so during the 21st century. The identified
         hotspots are robust across models and mechanistically plausible. The predicted increase
         in the amplitude of temperature variability in much of the developing world, and the
         corresponding decrease in temperature variability in much of the developed world,
         could have substantial social, economic, and ecological consequences that add to the
         inequality in the impacts of a changing climate.
