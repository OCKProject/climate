 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis shows marked predicted increases in temperature variability in tropical land regions including many of the world’s poorer countries, with the Amazon being a particular hotspot of concern. These hotspots result mainly from soil drying in the Southern Hemisphere and from increased atmospheric variability in the subtropics of the Northern Hemisphere. Temperature variability is projected to decrease in mid-latitudes because of a decreasing meridional temperature gradient and in high latitudes because of sea-ice loss. Overall, the pattern of predicted changes agrees with previous studies (

  </a>) but differs from observed changes in temperature variability. Models and observations indicate that the anthropogenic signal may not yet have emerged from the “noise” of natural variability but can be expected to do so during the 21st century. The identified hotspots are robust across models and mechanistically plausible. The predicted increase in the amplitude of temperature variability in much of the developing world, and the corresponding decrease in temperature variability in much of the developed world, could have substantial social, economic, and ecological consequences that add to the inequality in the impacts of a changing climate.
