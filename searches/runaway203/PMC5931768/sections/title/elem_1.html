         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We loosely define hotspots as regions of relatively large variability changes that
            also show a large model agreement on the sign of the change. 
            <a>Figure 1</a> shows the projected relative changes in SD of monthly temperature anomalies until
            the end of the 21st century, averaged over all 37 models (see fig. S1 for model agreement).
            Several hotspots of increases in SD are revealed over (sub)tropical land, namely,
            Amazonia, Southern Africa, Australia, the Sahel, the Arabian Peninsula, India, and
            Southeast Asia. In boreal summer, large increases occur over Europe, North America,
            and near the Arctic coast (
            <a>Fig. 1A</a>). In all other seasons, SD decreases over northern mid-latitudes (fig. S2). Several
            of the identified hotspots are consistent with previous modeling studies (
            <a><span>21</span></a>–
            <a><span>23</span></a>).

                  the 37 models agree on the sign of change from 1850 to 2100 expressed in the Kendall
                  τ value [for example, see fig. S1A for the model agreement in (C)].

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Absolute changes in variability are greatest in mid- and high latitudes in boreal
            autumn and winter (fig. S2), but these are also regions with the largest background
            levels of temperature variability. In relative terms, the largest changes in SD are
            increases of up to 40% in Amazonia and Southern Africa in austral spring and summer.
            Using temperature anomalies from all months of the year, Amazonia stands out as a
            region with a particularly large relative SD increase (
            <a>Fig. 1C</a>) because increases occur in all seasons. Although the models agree on the sign of
            change, the magnitude differs substantially between the models, with some models showing
            a doubling of SD in the tropical hotspots, especially in central and northern Amazonia.
            The changes continue in the nine models extended beyond 2100 and scale approximately
            with global warming. In the model average, each degree of global warming leads to
            an ~15% increase in SD in Amazonia, Southern Africa, and the Arctic coast during the
            local summer season, and a 10% increase in the subtropical hotspots of the Northern
            Hemisphere (fig. S3).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have isolated the role of selected mechanisms in individual models
            by suppressing certain sources of variability (
            <a><span>24</span></a>–
            <a><span>26</span></a>). This is not feasible across all of the CMIP5 models; hence, we take a different
            approach and analyze the changes in the terms contributing to the surface energy balance
            in the model mean, and identify important regional differences. In high latitudes,
            decreases in temperature SD are particularly pronounced over regions with sea-ice
            loss because the exposed ocean introduces a much larger heat capacity. This leads
            to more persistent but damped anomalies (
            <a><span>12</span></a>, 
            <a><span>15</span></a>, 
            <a><span>27</span></a>), in other words, SD decreases. Reductions in SD in mid-latitudes are not directly
            related to Arctic sea-ice loss. The largest SD decrease in the Arctic occurs in autumn
            [September, October, and November (SON)], the season with the largest sea-ice loss
            until 2100, whereas the SD decrease in mid-latitudes is most pronounced during Northern
            Hemisphere winter (DJF), the season where Arctic amplification is largest (
            <a>Fig. 1</a> and fig. S2). This amplification of mean warming in high northern latitudes leads
            to a reduced meridional temperature gradient (fig. S4). If one assumes that typical
            wind patterns do not change, then incoming air from the North or South is less different
            in temperature than it was when the temperature gradient weakens, leading to smaller
            local temperature anomalies. Calculating the monthly anomalies of advection (the local
            temperature tendencies due to horizontal wind) indeed reveals a decrease of the advection-induced
            temperature variability (fig. S4). We thereby confirm previous studies showing that
            the decreased temperature variability in mid-latitudes is associated with a decreased
            meridional temperature gradient due to the polar amplification of global warming (
            <a><span>13</span></a>, 
            <a><span>22</span></a>, 
            <a><span>27</span></a>, 
            <a><span>28</span></a>). The CMIP5 models do not support the alternative hypothesis that Arctic amplification
            causes increased meandering of the mid-latitude westerlies and, hence, greater variance
            and persistence of mid-latitude weather conditions (
            <a><span>29</span></a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increases of temperature variability that we find are largest in the season of
            maximum insolation (fig. S2). In the following, we therefore focus on the summer season.
            In the Southern Hemisphere, the results are qualitatively similar in all seasons.
            In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer season is the only season with an increased
            SD of temperature anomalies, whereas SD decreases in all other seasons (for the reasons
            described above). The large increases in SD over tropical land are particularly striking
            and have not been explained in previous analyses.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are known to affect temperature over
            land (
            <a><span>24</span></a>), SST variability appears not to be responsible for the increased variability on
            land, because of the low model agreement over the oceans in contrast to the large
            agreement in the identified land hotspots (
            <a>Fig. 1</a> and fig. S1). Furthermore, in the Southern Hemisphere summer, advection only plays
            a minor role (fig. S4C). We therefore focus on the local energy balance over land.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a local perspective, fluctuations in the downwelling radiation (short-wave plus
            long-wave fluxes) at the surface, 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>, can be seen as a direct atmospheric driver of temperature changes, which determines
            how much energy is available at the surface. We do not consider changes in surface
            albedo here because its contribution to monthly variability is likely small. We recognize
            that local conditions can feed back to the atmosphere (for example, via changes in
            cloud cover) to affect 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>, but note that 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> is also determined by processes on larger scales. A second important parameter is
            the evaporative fraction (EF) (the part of the available energy at the surface used
            to evaporate water), here calculated as 
            <span>EF</span> = 
            <span>LH</span>/(
            <span>R</span><sub>u</sub> + 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>), with upwelling radiation 
            <span>R</span><sub>u</sub> and latent heat flux (LH). Because an increase in sensible heat flux is associated
            with temperature increase, whereas increased LH is not, EF determines by how much
            a change in atmospheric forcing translates into temperature change. The smaller the
            EF becomes, the greater the effect of variations in available net radiation on temperature,
            because more radiation is converted into sensible instead of latent heat.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have shown that changes in soil moisture affect the partitioning
            of surface fluxes mostly in intermediate moisture regimes (
            <a><span>30</span></a>). Where evapotranspiration is limited by moisture but still has a substantial contribution
            to the energy balance, soil moisture has the largest effect on LH or temperature (and
            hence their variability). In this context, it is striking that regions with substantial
            increases in temperature variability coincide with regions identified as hotspots
            of strong soil moisture temperature coupling in previous studies (
            <a><span>30</span></a>, 
            <a><span>31</span></a>). We therefore analyze how increases in temperature variability are related to changes
            in soil moisture and EF, in comparison to variations in downwelling radiation 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>. 
            <a>Figure 2A</a> shows that the grid cells where temperature variability increases (red on the color
            scale) tend to have decreasing soil moisture (horizontal axis) as well as increasing
            variability in 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> (vertical axis). The same relation emerges when plotting EF instead of soil moisture
            (
            <a>Fig. 2B</a>). Therefore, the changes in the Southern Hemisphere hotspots are consistent with
            the explanation that soil moisture loss leads to smaller EF and thus larger temperature
            variability. Even in the humid climate of Amazonia where evapotranspiration is limited
            by radiation in many places, the large future drying brings the region closer to a
            soil moisture–limited regime, which is associated with a large reduction in the positive
            correlation between evapotranspiration and incoming radiation (fig. S5).

                  values indicating larger radiative variability.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such a transition from a wet to a moisture-limited regime is associated with an increase
            in the sensitivity of LH to soil moisture fluctuations (even in the absence of any
            changes in available radiation) (
            <a><span>30</span></a>, 
            <a><span>32</span></a>). The variability changes in 
            <span>LH</span> and 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> can therefore potentially reveal information on the mechanisms behind changes in
            variability. In agreement with the soil moisture hypothesis, increased temperature
            variability is associated with substantial increases in the variability of LH (
            <a>Fig. 2C</a>). The SD of 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> and LH both increase to a similar extent, and thus, both contribute to increased
            temperature variability. However, as the changes in EF and soil moisture show, 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> cannot be the sole driver of the increased temperature variability because there
            is no clear reason why the increased SD of 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> would systematically deplete the mean soil moisture. Instead, we suggest that the
            SD increase in downwelling radiation in these areas is at least partly associated
            with land-atmosphere feedbacks. For example, surface drying can affect cloud distribution
            and, hence, the variability of 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>. To separate these effects quantitatively, specific additional model simulations
            would be needed.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in Northern Hemisphere summer</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Northern Hemisphere shows a very different pattern (
            <a>Fig. 2</a>, D to F). There, soil moisture is not a good explanatory variable in general (
            <a>Fig. 2D</a>). This occurs because soil moisture does not limit EF in many places, so that decreases
            in soil moisture do not necessarily cause increased temperature variability. Moreover,
            changes in EF alone cannot explain the increased temperature variability in the Northern
            Hemisphere (
            <a>Fig. 2E</a>), and increases in 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> variability are needed as an explanatory variable at many places. The few exceptions
            with decreased temperature SD in the range of +4 to 6 W/m
            <span>2</span> of downwelling radiation SD (
            <a>Fig. 2E</a>) occur at grid boxes in very high northern latitudes (mainly Northeast Canada) where
            the fluctuations in available energy are often compensated by phase changes (melting
            snow and water, or freezing water) instead of temperature fluctuations.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This pattern suggests that changes in the atmosphere on a regional scale are an important
            driver of the changes in variability at the surface. When we compare changes in the
            variability of 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> and LH in the Northern Hemisphere summer, we find two distinct regimes (
            <a>Fig. 2F</a>). The horizontal (bottom-right) branch with substantial increases in LH variability
            is consistent with the soil-drying mechanism explained above. Because 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> variability does not increase or even decreases, the soil moisture loss must be solely
            responsible for the enhanced temperature variability. In contrast, the vertical (upper)
            branch in 
            <a>Fig. 2F</a> consists of dry regions where other mechanisms dominate, whereas changes in LH variability
            are small.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate the geographical distribution of these differences, we quantify the
            relation between SD changes in LH and net downwelling surface radiation (
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>) as an index (
            <a>Fig. 3</a>). This index (
            <span>I</span>) is proportional to the angle in the diagram spanned by the two properties (blue

            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>) and ΔSD(LH) stand for the changes in the SD of 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> and LH. The factor 2/π and the shift by 0.5 transform this angle in such a way to
            obtain a value of −1 if the increase in LH SD equals the decrease in 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> SD, 0 if both increase by the same amount (most points in 
            <a>Fig. 2C</a> lie in this direction), and +1 if 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> SD increases as much as LH SD decreases. In 
            <a>Fig. 3</a>, all clearly negative values (blue areas) are associated with variability increases
            in the latent heat flux, which cannot be explained with radiation alone. All clearly
            positive values (red areas) are associated with an increased variability of the downwelling
            radiation 
            <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>, which cannot be explained with local hydrological changes. For example, heat waves
            in European summer (
            <a><span>33</span></a>) show up as dominated by soil moisture loss (the horizontal branch in the scatter
            cloud of 
            <a>Fig. 2F</a>), whereas, in the subtropics of the Northern Hemisphere (mostly the Sahel, Arabia,
            and India), radiation often dominates over LH changes (vertical branch in 
            <a>Fig. 2F</a>). The latter indicates that local changes in hydrology are too small to explain the
            radiative changes and that processes other than soil moisture loss are causing increased
            temperature fluctuations.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because model agreement tends to be lower in India and the Sahel than in other hotspots
            (
            <a>Fig. 1</a> and fig. S1), we also calculate model averages for only the models showing an increase
            in temperature SD in a given region. In India, the SD of rainfall, soil moisture,
            cloud cover, and LH all increase despite little changes in mean soil moisture. This
            indicates that the Indian summer monsoon in the models is becoming more variable under
            greenhouse forcing, a result that is confirmed by other studies (
            <a><span>34</span></a>,

            in temperature. In the Sahel, summer rainfall protrudes further north in those models
            showing a clear increase in temperature SD. Where the preindustrial climate has been
            almost permanently dry, an increased occurrence of cloudier and wetter months promotes
            increased variability in both radiation and LH. Moreover, because the Sahara warms
            more than the vegetated regions to the South, the meridional temperature gradient
            in the Sahel region is enhanced (fig. S4B). This enhancement of variability due to
            the increased spatial temperature contrast is hence the reversed mechanism of the
            decreased variability in mid-latitudes. An increased temperature gradient is also
            the reason for the zone of large SD increase surrounding the Arctic Ocean (fig. S4A),
            which warms much less than the land.
