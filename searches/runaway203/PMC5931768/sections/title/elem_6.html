      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in Northern Hemisphere summer</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Northern Hemisphere shows a very different pattern (
         <a>Fig. 2</a>, D to F). There, soil moisture is not a good explanatory variable in general (
         <a>Fig. 2D</a>). This occurs because soil moisture does not limit EF in many places, so that decreases
         in soil moisture do not necessarily cause increased temperature variability. Moreover,
         changes in EF alone cannot explain the increased temperature variability in the Northern
         Hemisphere (
         <a>Fig. 2E</a>), and increases in 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> variability are needed as an explanatory variable at many places. The few exceptions
         with decreased temperature SD in the range of +4 to 6 W/m
         <span>2</span> of downwelling radiation SD (
         <a>Fig. 2E</a>) occur at grid boxes in very high northern latitudes (mainly Northeast Canada) where
         the fluctuations in available energy are often compensated by phase changes (melting
         snow and water, or freezing water) instead of temperature fluctuations.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This pattern suggests that changes in the atmosphere on a regional scale are an important
         driver of the changes in variability at the surface. When we compare changes in the
         variability of 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> and LH in the Northern Hemisphere summer, we find two distinct regimes (
         <a>Fig. 2F</a>). The horizontal (bottom-right) branch with substantial increases in LH variability
         is consistent with the soil-drying mechanism explained above. Because 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> variability does not increase or even decreases, the soil moisture loss must be solely
         responsible for the enhanced temperature variability. In contrast, the vertical (upper)
         branch in 
         <a>Fig. 2F</a> consists of dry regions where other mechanisms dominate, whereas changes in LH variability
         are small.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate the geographical distribution of these differences, we quantify the
         relation between SD changes in LH and net downwelling surface radiation (
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>) as an index (
         <a>Fig. 3</a>). This index (
         <span>I</span>) is proportional to the angle in the diagram spanned by the two properties (blue
         coordinate system in 
         <a>Fig. 2</a>, C and F)

         </div>where ΔSD(
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>) and ΔSD(LH) stand for the changes in the SD of 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> and LH. The factor 2/π and the shift by 0.5 transform this angle in such a way to
         obtain a value of −1 if the increase in LH SD equals the decrease in 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> SD, 0 if both increase by the same amount (most points in 
         <a>Fig. 2C</a> lie in this direction), and +1 if 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub> SD increases as much as LH SD decreases. In 
         <a>Fig. 3</a>, all clearly negative values (blue areas) are associated with variability increases
         in the latent heat flux, which cannot be explained with radiation alone. All clearly
         positive values (red areas) are associated with an increased variability of the downwelling
         radiation 
         <span>R</span><sub>d</sub>, which cannot be explained with local hydrological changes. For example, heat waves
         in European summer (
         <a><span>33</span></a>) show up as dominated by soil moisture loss (the horizontal branch in the scatter
         cloud of 
         <a>Fig. 2F</a>), whereas, in the subtropics of the Northern Hemisphere (mostly the Sahel, Arabia,
         and India), radiation often dominates over LH changes (vertical branch in 
         <a>Fig. 2F</a>). The latter indicates that local changes in hydrology are too small to explain the
         radiative changes and that processes other than soil moisture loss are causing increased
         temperature fluctuations.

            <p>See main text and 
               <a>Fig. 2</a> (C and F). Negative values indicate that changes are driven by soil drying, whereas
               positive values indicate a larger contribution of atmospheric variability. Ice sheets
               and locations where changes in temperature SD are smaller than 0.1K have been masked
               out (white areas). Each hemisphere shows summer conditions (JJA in the North, DJF
               in the South). All changes are calculated from the multimodel average and the period
               1875–1904 versus 2055–2084.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because model agreement tends to be lower in India and the Sahel than in other hotspots
         (
         <a>Fig. 1</a> and fig. S1), we also calculate model averages for only the models showing an increase
         in temperature SD in a given region. In India, the SD of rainfall, soil moisture,
         cloud cover, and LH all increase despite little changes in mean soil moisture. This
         indicates that the Indian summer monsoon in the models is becoming more variable under
         greenhouse forcing, a result that is confirmed by other studies (
         <a><span>34</span></a>, 
         <a><span>35</span></a>). A similar effect occurs in Southeast Asia (
         <a><span>36</span></a>), in combination with a mean soil moisture decrease, causing an additional SD increase
         in temperature. In the Sahel, summer rainfall protrudes further north in those models
         showing a clear increase in temperature SD. Where the preindustrial climate has been
         almost permanently dry, an increased occurrence of cloudier and wetter months promotes
         increased variability in both radiation and LH. Moreover, because the Sahara warms
         more than the vegetated regions to the South, the meridional temperature gradient
         in the Sahel region is enhanced (fig. S4B). This enhancement of variability due to
         the increased spatial temperature contrast is hence the reversed mechanism of the
         decreased variability in mid-latitudes. An increased temperature gradient is also
         the reason for the zone of large SD increase surrounding the Arctic Ocean (fig. S4A),
         which warms much less than the land.
