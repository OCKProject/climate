      <p>Extreme events such as heat waves are among the most challenging aspects of climate
         change for societies. We show that climate models consistently project increases in
         temperature variability in tropical countries over the coming decades, with the Amazon
         as a particular hotspot of concern. During the season with maximum insolation, temperature
         variability increases by ~15% per degree of global warming in Amazonia and Southern
         Africa and by up to 10%°C
         <span>−1</span> in the Sahel, India, and Southeast Asia. Mechanisms include drying soils and shifts
         in atmospheric structure. Outside the tropics, temperature variability is projected
         to decrease on average because of a reduced meridional temperature gradient and sea-ice
         loss. The countries that have contributed least to climate change, and are most vulnerable
         to extreme events, are projected to experience the strongest increase in variability.
         These changes would therefore amplify the inequality associated with the impacts of
         a changing climate.
