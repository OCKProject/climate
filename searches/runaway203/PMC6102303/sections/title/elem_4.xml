   </span>. The theoretical basis underlying AA and resultant weakening of the mid-latitude storm track is straightforward: The thermal-wind balance relates vertical shear in the westerly flow to the magnitude of the poleward temperature gradient. In the lower troposphere, a reduction in the temperature gradient equates to a similar reduction in the shear, weakening the thermally driven jet and reducing the low-level baroclinicity
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
   </span>. A reduced low-level baroclinicity implies less or weaker synoptic-scale cyclogenesis and thus leads to overall weakening of the storm tracks. Note, that the thermal-wind balance does not give a direction of causality per se: The causality could be the other way around, whereby a change in mid-latitude circulation alters the poleward heat transport giving rise to more rapid warming in the Arctic

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Empirical evidence based on multiple datasets shows that over the satellite-covered period (i.e., since 1979), the mid-latitude summer circulation has indeed weakened in conjunction with a reduction in the poleward temperature gradient in the lower troposphere. This weakening has been detected in the westerly jet (following the thermal-wind balance), the total kinetic energy of synoptic storm systems (by about 15%) and the number of strong cyclones

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>
   </span>. While, the satellite era is most reliable when analyzing wind field characteristics, its limited timespan compromises long-term trend analyses. Natural variability on multi-decadal time scales, either due to changes in SSTs or from internal atmospheric variability, are thus likely to have a role in the observed trends.
  </p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is modeling evidence indicating that these observed trends are at least partly attributable to AA. CMIP5 coupled model simulations of the twentieth century show that the observed changes in the zonal-mean temperature gradient in summer (characterized by AA and enhanced high-latitude land warming) are likely attributable to anthropogenic forcing ("likely" according to IPCC lexicon)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>
   </span>. Idealized modeling experiments support storm track weakening when sea-ice is reduced but also indicate that sea-ice changes by itself can explain only part of the observed weakening
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>
   </span>. Modeling studies indicate that the effects of historic sea-ice reductions can explain up to one-third of the magnitude of the observed anomalies, with an additional role for changes in SSTs

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shift in jet-position</div>
  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding jet shifts in the Northern Hemisphere is a challenging task due to several competing processes. Theoretically, the change in jet stream position can be divided into a relatively small direct radiative-induced shift and a larger indirect SST-mediated effect. The indirect effect comes from mid-latitude dynamical feedbacks, involving enhanced irreversible mixing due to wave breaking of high-frequency transient eddies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>
   </span>, and can explain most of the expected jet shifts
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>
   </span>. When considered in isolation, AA should theoretically cause a southward shift in the mid-latitude jet stream.
  </p>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Idealized dry atmospheric model simulations indeed indicate a southward shifted jet coming from AA by itself
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>
   </span>. This is also confirmed by more complex models with reductions in sea-ice imposed

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>
   </span>. Despite the process linking AA to a more equatorward jet, the zonal-mean jet streams are projected to migrate poleward by about one degree by the end of the twenty-first century under a high-emission scenario
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>
   </span>. Thus in the long run, i.e., at the end-of-century, the tropics likely dominate the tug-of-war, at least in models. While in winter both the Atlantic and the Pacific jets are projected to migrate poleward, in summer this shift is seen only for the North Atlantic jet
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>. AA may therefore exert a stronger opposing influence to the expected poleward shift of the Pacific jet in summer. Different state-of-the-art climate models employ different simplifying parameterizations (e.g., for clouds) and those can, in a complex, non-linear system, lead to very different outcomes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>
   </span>. The inter-model spread of the poleward shift therefore tends to be larger than the signal itself

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amplification of wave trains</div>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limited evidence from theory, observations and some model simulations suggests that AA may amplify synoptic-scale, quasi-stationary waves embedded in the summer jet (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Theory of the dynamics of a dry atmosphere suggests that a lower troposphere diabatic heating source in the mid-latitudes will have a larger stationary wave response (in terms of a meridional stream function displacement) when the background baroclinicity and zonal winds are reduced, as a direct response of AA
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
   </span>. In a more complex atmosphere of an aquaplanet model (i.e., an Earth covered by water only), quasi-stationary synoptic-scale wave trains are enhanced when the meridional temperature gradient is reduced and the westerly winds weaken
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
   </span>. Thus, as the background flow becomes weaker, the same heating source in the lower troposphere can trigger a stronger stationary wave response especially for synoptic-scale waves. The increased moisture content in a warmer atmosphere, and the tendency for increased latent heat release in the tropics and over warm ocean currents in higher latitudes, can provide further heating to perturb more or stronger CGWTs.

Generally, the negative phase shows a reverse pattern. Like the winter NAO, the impact of the SNAO on climate extremes such as heavy rainfall and flooding is profound, especially for Europe. Post-2007 summers have seen increasingly robust negative SNAO associated with a persistent anticyclonic anomaly over Greenland and a cyclonic anomaly over Northwest Europe. This pattern caused rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet and brought unusually wet summers to Northwest Europe, including the massive flooding of U.K. in summer 2012.

In summer, when an efficiently trapping waveguide becomes (almost) circumglobal, then resonant interactions between free and forced waves (typically of synoptic scale, wavenumbers 6–8) might lead to wave-amplification and persistent, high-amplitude waves. Waveguide formation is favored during double-jet regimes and thus linked to strongly positive NAM phases. Panel c shows a schematic representation of a wave-resonance event with an amplified wave 7. The orange and green areas represent regions of positive and negative upper-level meridional winds. Such events are associated with alternating hot-dry and cold-wet conditions, following the ridges and troughs.

These measures provide a theoretical basis for quantitatively relating changes in zonal wind speed to accompanying changes in wave amplitude and eddy fluxes, which is straightforwardly verifiable under idealized conditions. Such approaches are being applied in climatological studies of circulation trends and extreme weather events related to amplified flow patterns but their derivation is more technical and their application is more involved than geometric methods.
