 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several arguments support the AA influence on summer circulation as compared to winter. First, in the mid-latitudes, the equator-to-pole near-surface temperature gradient has seen a pronounced reduction in summer, but not in winter
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Second, late-spring to early-summer snow cover extent, which influences summer flow regimes, has dramatically declined
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">109</a>
  </span>; and finally, summer circulation is less affected by tropical ENSO forcing, and thus potentially more sensitive to Arctic warming

 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reviewing the literature, we conclude that there is robust evidence that AA causes a weakening of storm tracks in summer. The mechanism is straightforward: Cyclone genesis is directly related to the lower troposphere temperature gradient which weakens with AA. Further support comes from observed trends and historic and future climate modeling experiments. Still, multi-model attribution analyses are needed to quantify the exact role of past and future AA on the weakening of storm tracks.</p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is still substantial uncertainty in what implications this weakening will have for summer weather conditions. Does it become more persistent and therefore more extreme? Theoretically, a weakened westerly flow leads to a small increase in the stationary wavenumber (i.e., a 5% decrease in the flow would lead to a 2.5% increase in stationary wavenumber
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>) but not necessarily to a more-stationary flow. Both observations and climate models suggest that a weaker westerly flow is associated with a more wavy flow pattern, especially in summer, but this does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span> (see Box 
  <a rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec10">3</a>). A reduction in synoptic activity favors the buildup of hot-dry conditions and this can interact with regional land-atmosphere processes that can feedback on the continental-scale circulation (as outlined above). However, the relative role of these processes, and the strength of their interactions is largely unquantified. To assess future high-end risks, these non-linear interactions need to be disentangled and quantified.
 </p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is robust evidence that summer time quasi-stationary waves lead to persistent and therefore extreme weather conditions. However, substantial uncertainty remains in how such waves will change under global warming including the role of AA therein. While physical mechanisms exist that could amplify quasi-stationary short waves as an indirect response to AA, their representation in climate models is biased
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span> and their relative importance compared to other drivers is poorly understood
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. Some upward trends in quasi-stationary wave activity have been reported but confidence in these trends is generally low due to the use of different diagnostics leading to conflicting results (Box 
  <a rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec10">3</a>). Moreover, the relative importance of enhanced high-latitude warming, strengthened monsoons, and a weakening AMOC with associated mid-latitude SST anomalies, in shaping the mid-latitude summer circulation needs to be understood. All these drivers have a tendency to strengthen CGWTs but their interactions and regional effects are poorly known.
