 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The described dynamical mechanisms do not operate in isolation but instead interact with each other, with other teleconnections, and regionally with land-atmosphere feedbacks. The exact nature of these interactions is still speculative at this stage but positive feedbacks are certainly possible which would lead to tail risks.</p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weakened storm tracks favor the buildup of hot and dry conditions over the continents. This can strengthen the land-ocean thermal contrast which, combined with the enhanced wave response to thermal forcing when the background flow is weak, could lead to amplified quasi-stationary waves. The projected weakening of storm tracks and westerlies can interact with soil moisture and snow cover changes, potentially regionally exacerbating zonal-mean circulation changes. Enhanced terrestrial heating in mid- to high-latitudes associated with reductions in snow cover can promote anomalous ridging in the upper troposphere, as suggested by both observational and modeling studies

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">98</a>
  </span>. The emergence of such positive geopotential height anomalies in mid-to-high latitudes induces hot and dry air through subsidence and easterly wind anomalies of continental origin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span>. Likewise, drying soils in subtropical regions like the Mediterranean (a robust projection in future climate) can favor the formation of a heat low, i.e., low pressures at the surface due to upflow associated with intense surface heating
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>
  </span>. A Mediterranean near-surface heat low brings easterly winds to central and western Europe, obstructing the normal westerlies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">100</a>
  </span>. Weakened or diverted westerlies can reduce rainfall leading to further soil drying. Due to such feedback mechanisms between soil moisture, snow cover changes, and continental-scale circulation, summer weather in western Europe and interior North America is likely to become more continental as seen in models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">100</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">101</a>
  </span> and possibly also in observations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">102</a>
  </span>. The effectiveness of this mechanism depends on the delicate balance between land-atmosphere feedbacks and the strength (and thus its long-term weakening) of the storm tracks.

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies indicate that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC, i.e., the large-scale north-south transport in the Atlantic ocean) has seen an unprecedented slowdown in recent decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">103</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">104</a>
  </span>, something which is projected for future warmer climates as well. This slowdown results in anomalously cold SSTs over the northern Atlantic which can trigger a quasi-stationary Rossby wave response favoring blocking high-pressure systems over western Europe
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">105</a>
  </span>. So, just like AA, a slowdown of the AMOC leads to weakening westerlies in summer over the Atlantic sector, favoring persistent hot-dry extremes over Europe
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">106</a>
  </span>. Recent observational studies indeed indicate that weather persistence in Europe and some other mid-latitude regions has increased in boreal summer

 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Northern Hemisphere summer circulation is connected to the tropics primarily via two-way interactions with monsoon systems. Anomalously low snow cover over Eurasia during late winter to early-spring can increases the land-ocean temperature gradient due to snow-albedo and soil moisture effects which strengthens the Indian summer monsoon rainfall
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">107</a>
  </span>. On sub-seasonal time scales, extreme monsoonal rainfall over eastern or western Himalayan foothills is often linked to southward intruding mid-latitude troughs, possibly part of the CGWT
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" href="#CR108">108</a>
  </span>. The monsoon is also a source of diabatic heating that can generate the CGWT
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Thus, wave trains originating from higher latitudes can modulate the intensity of the monsoon, and the monsoon’s strength in turn reinforces the downstream propagation of the wave train
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. The projected increase in Indian summer monsoon rainfall is thus expected to strengthen the CGWT.
