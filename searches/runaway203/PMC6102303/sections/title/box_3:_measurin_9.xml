 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the concept of wavy versus zonal circulation patterns is straightforward, quantifying these opposite states has proven challenging. Approaches can be roughly separated into geometric and dynamic methods. The former focuses on the geometry of the circulation to characterize the departure of the flow from zonality in terms of wave amplitude, sinuosity, or circularity

  </span>. These metrics have the advantage of being intuitive and readily visualized from geopotential height contours, but they have been criticized for lacking a firm physical basis. The existence of wave trains usually lasts 2–4 weeks and they do not necessarily have a preferred phase position

  </span>. Averaging over time may thus cancel out any signal. Further, often the diagnostic approach to detect extratropical jet’s waviness involves Fourier decomposition of zonal wavenumbers

  </span> which could lead to spurious wave signals. In the extreme case: Fourier decomposition of a delta function will create amplitudes in a range of zonal wavenumbers even if the circulation feature is extremely local, i.e., it does not involve a wave “train”

  </span>. Likewise, a zonal wavenumber 5 along 40° N (subtropical jet) or 65° N (polar jet) depicts two very different wavelengths. Dynamically based waviness metrics such as effective diffusivity of potential vorticity

  </span> are derived from first-order mass and circulation conservation principles and satisfy exact budget closure equations. These measures provide a theoretical basis for quantitatively relating changes in zonal wind speed to accompanying changes in wave amplitude and eddy fluxes, which is straightforwardly verifiable under idealized conditions. Such approaches are being applied in climatological studies of circulation trends and extreme weather events related to amplified flow patterns but their derivation is more technical and their application is more involved than geometric methods.
