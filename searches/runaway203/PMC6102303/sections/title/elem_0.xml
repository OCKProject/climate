 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme heat and heavy rainfall events since the late 1980s, especially in mid-latitude regions, have been linked to anthropogenic global warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Scientists are generally confident in the thermodynamic drivers of these changes but are less so in dynamic aspects
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Another pronounced signal of anthropogenic global warming is the rapidly increasing near-surface temperatures in the Arctic at a pace two to four times faster than the rest of the globe, known as Arctic amplification (AA)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. The extent to which AA affects the mid-latitude circulation and possibly contribute to the observed increases in weather extremes has been a subject of active debate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most studies analyzing the role of AA on mid-latitude weather have focused on the winter season and the linkage with cold spells. The stronger jet stream, the presence of the stratospheric polar vortex, and the post-1990s increase in abnormally cold winters over central Eurasia have drawn a lot of attention to the winter season
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. The increased heat stored in the Arctic Ocean owing to sea-ice loss is released into the atmosphere in early winter. The associated expansion of the near-surface air increases Arctic geopotential heights and can affect the circumglobal circulation directly as well as via feedbacks between the troposphere and stratosphere involving the stratospheric polar vortex
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. Even though the exact pathways through which the Arctic influences the mid-latitude winter circulation are debated, a scientific consensus is emerging that AA has at least some influence on winter weather
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Links between AA and summer circulation have received far less scientific attention, despite the potential for synergistic effects that might favor high-impact extremes. In summer, thermodynamic and dynamic drivers of extreme weather could act in the same direction, leading to tail risks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. For instance, any increased frequency in circulation regimes conducive to persistent heat extremes would act on top of the thermodynamically driven increase in heat, creating possibilities for very-extreme heatwaves. Many recent high-impact summer heatwaves indeed occurred in that far-tail of the distribution and cannot be explained by the direct thermodynamic effect of greenhouse gas forcing alone (Box 
  <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">1</a>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>
  <span class="sup">–</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. Such extreme heatwaves have been found to increase and intensify across most regions but more so in the mid-latitudes than over the rest of the globe
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Consistent with the increase in heatwaves, the hot tail of summer temperature distribution has been warming faster than the median and the cold tail. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows the warming trends in the 95th percentile (hot tail), 50th percentile (median), and 5th percentile (cold tail) of daily summer temperatures. Clearly, over most mid-latitude regions, in particular over Eurasia but less so in the US, the hot tail has been warming faster than the cold tail and thus temperature variability in summer has increased
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. This increased variability indicates that more complex processes beyond simple radiative greenhouse gas forcing are important in driving heat extremes (Box 
  <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">1</a>). This is supported by recent studies that indicate that summer weather has become more persistent in several regions in the mid-latitudes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. In summer, the hot tail of the distribution is associated with persistent, blocking weather systems, and an increase in their persistence leads to more extreme temperatures.

 <p id="Par999" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we review recent studies analyzing possible links between AA, mid-latitude summer weather and extreme events, in particular persistent hot-dry extremes. We start by giving a brief synopsis of the different Arctic mechanisms proposed for winter. Next, we address the seasonal differences in the mid-latitude circulations, in the influence of regional and far-away drivers, and in detected changes in the Arctic. We focus on three possible dynamical pathways that are most relevant to summer and summarize the theoretical, empirical, and modeling evidence for each of them. We discuss the confidence and uncertainties associated with these dynamical pathways, identify knowledge gaps and key societal risks, and provide a roadmap for future research.</p>

  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many recent high-impact summer heatwaves occurred in the far-tail of the distribution and are difficult to explain by the direct radiative warming effect of greenhouse gas forcing alone

   </span>. In 2010, Russia saw 33 consecutive hot-and-dry days (with temperatures above 30 °C), resulting in an estimated 55,000 heat-related deaths, more than 500 wildfires near Moscow and grain-harvest losses of 30%
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
   </span>. A quantitative global analyses showed that the 2010 event was the most-severe heatwave ever recorded worldwide, based on a heatwave index that can be used across different regions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span>. Intriguingly, all record-setting heatwaves based on this index occurred in the mid-latitudes, indicating that here heatwaves are becoming more intense at a pace that exceeds the global mean
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span>. Extreme summer heat in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes now far exceeds historical frequencies in the twentieth century
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" href="#CR117">117</a>
   </span>. Over the last decade, Europe has seen an exceptionally rapid increase in the chance of extremely hot summers similar to the 2003 extreme
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>. Other notable high-impact and record-breaking droughts and heatwaves occurred in the USA in 2011 and 2012

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>

   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One reason why these extremes cause so much damage is that temperature and precipitation during summer are anti-correlated virtually everywhere across extratropical land
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" href="#CR122">122</a>
   </span>. Consequently, extremes of heat and dryness often coincide to produce compound extremes that exert disproportionately large societal impacts
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" href="#CR123">123</a>
   </span>. Certain mid-latitude regions identified as hotspots of tight atmosphere–land coupling, such as central North America 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" href="#CR124">124</a>
   </span>, are especially prone to concurrent heatwaves and droughts.
  </p>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such events are promoted by positive thermodynamic feedbacks that favor depleted soil moisture and enhanced sensible surface heating as the land warms, but they are also strongly regulated by atmospheric dynamics that initiate and sustain anomalous heating and drying
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" href="#CR125">125</a>
   </span>. These kinds of summertime compound events are therefore highly relevant for the dynamical changes described in this study, and recent studies have developed innovative techniques to separate the contributions from dynamics and thermodynamics
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" href="#CR126">126</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128" href="#CR128">128</a>
   </span>. In particular, the projected trend toward a weaker and poleward-shifted jet stream is consistent with projections of a significantly increased risk of compound hot-dry extremes across much of the Northern Hemisphere this century
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" href="#CR122">122</a>
   </span>. This type of climate change would likely exacerbate the separate impacts of extreme heat and dryness, based on the documented stresses that compound heatwaves and droughts exert in causing disease
