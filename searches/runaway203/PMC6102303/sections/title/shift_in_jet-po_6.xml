 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding jet shifts in the Northern Hemisphere is a challenging task due to several competing processes. Theoretically, the change in jet stream position can be divided into a relatively small direct radiative-induced shift and a larger indirect SST-mediated effect. The indirect effect comes from mid-latitude dynamical feedbacks, involving enhanced irreversible mixing due to wave breaking of high-frequency transient eddies

  </span>, and can explain most of the expected jet shifts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>
  </span>. When considered in isolation, AA should theoretically cause a southward shift in the mid-latitude jet stream.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Idealized dry atmospheric model simulations indeed indicate a southward shifted jet coming from AA by itself
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>
  </span>. This is also confirmed by more complex models with reductions in sea-ice imposed

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>
  </span>. Despite the process linking AA to a more equatorward jet, the zonal-mean jet streams are projected to migrate poleward by about one degree by the end of the twenty-first century under a high-emission scenario
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">86</a>
  </span>. Thus in the long run, i.e., at the end-of-century, the tropics likely dominate the tug-of-war, at least in models. While in winter both the Atlantic and the Pacific jets are projected to migrate poleward, in summer this shift is seen only for the North Atlantic jet
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. AA may therefore exert a stronger opposing influence to the expected poleward shift of the Pacific jet in summer. Different state-of-the-art climate models employ different simplifying parameterizations (e.g., for clouds) and those can, in a complex, non-linear system, lead to very different outcomes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>
  </span>. The inter-model spread of the poleward shift therefore tends to be larger than the signal itself

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed jet shifts in the Northern Hemisphere are generally small compared to those in the Southern Hemisphere, but still generally indicate a poleward migration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>
  </span>. For the Northern Hemisphere, some evidence of a poleward shift of jet streams has been identified in reanalysis products

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>
  </span> and is most significant in winter. This is thus largely in agreement with model projections pointing at the important role of the tropics in shifts in the jet position.
