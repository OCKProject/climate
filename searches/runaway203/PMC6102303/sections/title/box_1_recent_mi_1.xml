 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many recent high-impact summer heatwaves occurred in the far-tail of the distribution and are difficult to explain by the direct radiative warming effect of greenhouse gas forcing alone

  </span>. In 2010, Russia saw 33 consecutive hot-and-dry days (with temperatures above 30 °C), resulting in an estimated 55,000 heat-related deaths, more than 500 wildfires near Moscow and grain-harvest losses of 30%

  </span>. A quantitative global analyses showed that the 2010 event was the most-severe heatwave ever recorded worldwide, based on a heatwave index that can be used across different regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Intriguingly, all record-setting heatwaves based on this index occurred in the mid-latitudes, indicating that here heatwaves are becoming more intense at a pace that exceeds the global mean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Extreme summer heat in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes now far exceeds historical frequencies in the twentieth century

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" href="#CR117">117</a>
  </span>. Over the last decade, Europe has seen an exceptionally rapid increase in the chance of extremely hot summers similar to the 2003 extreme

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One reason why these extremes cause so much damage is that temperature and precipitation during summer are anti-correlated virtually everywhere across extratropical land
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" href="#CR122">122</a>
  </span>. Consequently, extremes of heat and dryness often coincide to produce compound extremes that exert disproportionately large societal impacts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" href="#CR123">123</a>
  </span>. Certain mid-latitude regions identified as hotspots of tight atmosphere–land coupling, such as central North America 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" href="#CR124">124</a>
  </span>, are especially prone to concurrent heatwaves and droughts.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such events are promoted by positive thermodynamic feedbacks that favor depleted soil moisture and enhanced sensible surface heating as the land warms, but they are also strongly regulated by atmospheric dynamics that initiate and sustain anomalous heating and drying
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" href="#CR125">125</a>
  </span>. These kinds of summertime compound events are therefore highly relevant for the dynamical changes described in this study, and recent studies have developed innovative techniques to separate the contributions from dynamics and thermodynamics

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128" href="#CR128">128</a>
  </span>. In particular, the projected trend toward a weaker and poleward-shifted jet stream is consistent with projections of a significantly increased risk of compound hot-dry extremes across much of the Northern Hemisphere this century

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" href="#CR122">122</a>
  </span>. This type of climate change would likely exacerbate the separate impacts of extreme heat and dryness, based on the documented stresses that compound heatwaves and droughts exert in causing disease
