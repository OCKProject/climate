With a glaciated area of ~146,000 km<sup>2</sup>, the CAA has the potential to contribute 199 &#x000b1; 30 mm to global mean sea level rise (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Rates of ice mass loss from the CAA have increased sharply during the 21st century (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>), from the Queen Elizabeth Islands (QEI) in the north [31 &#x000b1; 8 gigatons (Gt) year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 2004&#x02013;2006, increasing to 92 &#x000b1; 12 Gt year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 2007&#x02013;2009] (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>) to Baffin and Bylot Islands (BBI) further south (from 11.1 &#x000b1; 3.4 Gt year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 1963&#x02013;2006 to 23.8 &#x000b1; 6.12 Gt year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 2003&#x02013;2011) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Although total ice mass loss is known, changes in individual glaciers have not been analyzed regionally.</p><p>There is increasing evidence in both polar regions that rates of frontal ablation of ice flowing into the ocean are strongly controlled by subsurface ocean temperatures (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Unprecedented warming of the Arctic Ocean and surrounding water bodies (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>) therefore makes pan-Arctic marine-terminating glaciers vulnerable to rapid retreat (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). Oceanic forcing has already been recognized as a key control on the fluctuations of outlet glaciers in western Greenland (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>), where rates of submarine melting are up to two orders of magnitude greater than surface melt rates (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). Warming of subpolar North Atlantic water entering Baffin Bay is considered to be triggering an increase in the rate of submarine melting of Greenland&#x02019;s outlet glaciers (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). However, on the Canadian side of Baffin Bay, the role of oceanic forcing on marine-terminating glaciers has not been directly investigated and is largely unknown, although it has been hypothesized that ocean temperatures might be influencing glacier retreat (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>).</p><p>With over 300 marine-terminating glaciers in the CAA, dynamic feedbacks associated with glacier frontal changes have clear potential to influence decadal-scale ice losses from the region. Recent studies have shown that increasing ice discharge to the ocean has contributed to recent mass loss from the CAA in some locations (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>). For example, ~62% of current ice discharge (i.e., via calving) from the QEI is channeled through Trinity and Wykeham glaciers, southeast Ellesmere Island, where flow speed has markedly accelerated over the past 10 to 15 years (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>). In this area, at least half of the observed thinning rate at the glacier termini has been attributed to changes in ice dynamics rather than to surface mass balance (SMB) changes (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>). Changes taking place at the terminus of marine-terminating glaciers form a crucial component of mass balance (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>) and have a major influence on coastal ecosystems, and yet, long-term regional patterns and trends in the frontal changes of glaciers in the CAA have never been examined. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of decadal changes in the frontal positions of 300 marine-terminating glaciers in the region. We analyze ocean temperature measurements, together with downscaled 1-km-resolution regional climate model output, to evaluate the relative importance of oceanographic and atmospheric influences on the observed changes in glacier frontal positions since the late 1950s.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Marine-terminating glacier frontal changes</title><p>We determined ~7 frontal positions for each glacier by digitizing images from a range of sources collected at approximately decadal intervals (see Materials and Methods, fig. S1, and table S1). Our comparison of historical aerial photography from 1958/1959 with Landsat satellite imagery in 2015 indicates that &#x0003e;94% of the 300 marine-terminating glaciers investigated have, overall, retreated during this period (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The mean frontal change rate was &#x02212;9.3 m year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (&#x000b1;1.4 m year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> SE) for the 211 glaciers in the QEI and &#x02212;6.9 m year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (&#x000b1;0.7 m year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> SE) for the 89 glaciers in BBI. Total area loss by frontal retreat since 1958 was 387 km<sup>2</sup> in the QEI and 22.5 km<sup>2</sup> in BBI. In both regions, the absolute area change associated with glacier retreat is related to both the width and length of the glacier (in absolute terms, larger glaciers retreat greater distances than smaller ones), so we normalized area changes according to the length of glacier basins in ~2000. Mean relative length changes since the late 1950s were &#x02212;4.2% (&#x000b1;0.3% SE) in the QEI and &#x02212;4.1% (&#x000b1;0.3% SE) in BBI (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Of the 211 marine-terminating glaciers in the QEI, 23 have previously been identified as surge type (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>), so we excluded these from further analysis because their terminus behavior can be independent of climate forcing. In addition, our study does not include glaciers situated along the northern coast of Ellesmere Island, which are strongly influenced by the buttressing effect of multiyear sea ice and interactions with floating ice shelves and have been described elsewhere (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Spatial patterns of marine-terminating glacier front change from 1958/1959 to 2015 (as the percentage of glacier length in 2000).</title><p>In the QEI, 197 glaciers have retreated, and 12 have advanced since 1959. Five of those that have advanced are surge type. In the BBI region, 87 glaciers have retreated, and 2 have advanced since 1958. Named features are those referred to in text.

The mean frontal change rates in the QEI and BBI during the 1960s were &#x02212;7.0 and &#x02212;0.6 m year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, increasing to &#x02212;29.1 and &#x02212;22.9 m year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> since 2009/2010 (table S2). This trend is evident in both absolute and relative length changes and across all glacier types (e.g., different sizes, lengths, and frontal widths). The greatest absolute retreat rates occurred in the QEI, where mean glacier lengths and terminus widths are greater than those of glaciers further south. One notable anomaly in the BBI region is a period of increased retreat in the early 1980s (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Another period of note is the earliest interval in the QEI region (1959&#x02013;1975), when retreat rates were greater than in the two subsequent periods (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Temporal trends in glacier length, surface ablation and runoff.</title><p>Marine-terminating glacier length changes (percentage per year) by time interval for (<bold>A</bold>) QEI and (<bold>B</bold>) BBI.

S2). At all latitudes in the QEI, the lowest retreat rates occurred in the earlier periods, and rates were highest in the two periods since 2002. Although mean relative retreat rates are lower in the two most northerly latitudinal bands, they exhibit the same temporal trend. In the BBI region, the pattern is broadly similar, but during the period 1980&#x02013;1985, there was a notable increase in retreat in each band north of 70&#x000b0;N. The highest regional mean retreat rate (&#x02212;0.33% year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) occurred in the most recent period, 2009&#x02013;2015, in southeast Ellesmere Island (77&#x000b0;N to 78&#x000b0;N). The greatest absolute retreat rates in the CAA were observed on the coalescent Trinity and Wykeham glaciers (78.0&#x000b0;N, 78.6&#x000b0;W), where they reached &#x02212;338 m year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> between 1976 and 1984 and &#x02212; 255 m year<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> between 2009 and 2015, with a total retreat of 4.8 km since 1959.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ocean temperatures and regional frontal change</title><p>The coherency in glacier retreat rates across the region suggests a common external driver. Subsurface ocean temperatures on the eastern side of Baffin Bay have been identified as a significant control on frontal change rates of glaciers in western Greenland (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>), and so, we first consider the possible influence of ocean temperatures on glacier fluctuations on the Canadian side of Baffin Bay. Although ocean temperature measurements from locations close to glacier fronts in the CAA are generally sparse, there are sufficient data sources for regional-scale analyses. TOPAZ4 reanalysis data (gridded at 12.5 km from 1991 to 2015) (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>) are available from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and show spatial patterns in mean temperatures at standard depths (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Strong differences in temperature between the east and west sides of Baffin Bay are evident: Off southwest Greenland, warm waters (&#x0003e;1&#x000b0;C) are present at all depths, whereas waters at depths of 200 m and shallower surrounding the CAA are typically cold (&#x0003c;&#x02212;1&#x000b0;C). This pattern is explained by the cyclonic circulation in northern Baffin Bay from the West Greenland Current System (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>), which advects warm, saline Atlantic waters northward along western Greenland and carries fresh and cold Arctic waters southward along eastern Baffin Island. Additional cold water masses occur off northern Baffin Island as a result of wintertime freezing within the polynyas of northern Baffin Bay (in Smith, Jones, and Lancaster Sounds; locations marked on <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>). Cold waters in Smith Sound originate from water from the Pacific that enters via the Arctic Ocean and Nares Strait (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>). In recent decades, however, changes have occurred in Baffin Bay, including warming in areas affected by the Atlantic inflow (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>).</p><fig id="F3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Mean annual ocean temperatures at standard depths of 50, 100, 200, and 400 m.</title><p>Data are from CMEMS TOPAZ4 Arctic Ocean Physics reanalysis at 12.5-km grid spacing, modeled from all available satellite and in situ observations between 1991 and 2015. The black line is the 100-km buffer offshore from the CAA coastline.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aau8507-F3"/></fig><p>To assess ocean temperatures close to marine-terminating glaciers in the CAA, we use in situ temperature measurements (1972&#x02013;2015) obtained from the World Ocean Database 2013 (WOD13) (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>) for standard depths between 50 and 500 m. These depths represent the range of bathymetry close to the coast, as calculated from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (see Materials and Methods). Although only 19 glaciers have ocean temperature measurements within 5 km of their fronts, these show comparable mean temperatures to those with measurements up to 20 km away (figs. S3 and S4). In total, 117 glaciers have &#x02265;10 conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) measurements within 20 km of their fronts, which provides a sample that is more than sufficient for statistical analysis. First, following methods outlined in (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>), we compare mean overall glacier frontal changes (1958/1959 to 2015) with their adjacent mean ocean temperatures (1972 to 2015). From this, we find no statistically significant correlation at any depth (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and table S4). The mean ocean temperatures within 20 km of glacier fronts are below 0&#x000b0;C at all depths (fig. S4), and although these are above the freezing temperature of sea water (calculated from pressure and mean salinity), the melt induced by water at such low mean temperatures would be insufficient to drive retreat at the scale observed (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>). For example, a study of glaciers in Svalbard (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>) found that the relationship between frontal ablation rate and ambient subsurface ocean temperatures was strong and linear above 0&#x000b0;C, but little or no retreat occurred when ocean temperatures were below 0&#x000b0;C.</p><fig id="F4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Mean overall (1958&#x02013;2015) glacier front changes (as the percentage of glacier length in 2000) by mean in situ ocean temperatures (1971&#x02013;2015) at specific depths.</title><p>Results are for all glaciers with 10 or more ocean temperature measurements within 20 km of their fronts (glacier counts are in table S3, and correlation coefficients are in table S4).

Although heat content is low at these northern latitudes, a statistically significant increase in temperature occurred between the 1970s and 2000s at all depths (where data are available). Another study has shown that, on a local scale, there are variations to the regional trend, such as to the east of Devon Island and southeast Ellesmere Island, where temperatures at 200-m depth were lower in 2000&#x02013;2010 relative to 1995&#x02013;1999 (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>). At latitudes south of 75&#x000b0;N, mean temperatures have been warmer than 0&#x000b0;C at 400- and 500-m depths since records began, and warming has occurred at all depths, except for a temperature decrease between 72&#x000b0;N and 74&#x000b0;N at 500-m depth (table S5). Although ocean warming has occurred throughout much of the region, the temperatures have been substantially below those seen to be driving melt in western Greenland and elsewhere [e.g., (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>)]. For example, the rapidly retreating Jakobshavn Isbrae is adjacent to the warm (mean, ~1.8&#x000b0;C) subsurface water of Disko Bay (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>).</p><fig id="F5" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Temporal trends from World Ocean Database (WOD13) data (up to 100 km offshore).</title><p>Mean ocean temperatures are separated by standard depths and degrees latitude for (<bold>A</bold>) QEI and (<bold>B</bold>) BBI.

Results from a recent study (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>) show that the mean ice thickness at the grounding line of 35 tidewater glaciers in the QEI is estimated to be ~230 m and that only eight glaciers have a grounding line thickness that exceeds 300 m. In the BBI region, the mean ice thickness at the grounding lines is estimated to be even smaller (~100 m) (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). Therefore, the warmer water present at ocean depths deeper than 400 m will have little impact on the glaciers. By comparison, many outlet glaciers in Greenland extend into fjords to depths of 600 m or more, where they are exposed to deep warm Atlantic water (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). Thus, while some large glaciers in the CAA may be vulnerable to melt in specific locations where they sit in deeper and warmer water, we find no evidence that ocean temperatures have driven the long-term regional patterns in the retreat of marine-terminating glaciers in the CAA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Atmospheric temperatures and regional frontal change</title><p>Atmospheric temperatures in the CAA have increased rapidly in the 21st century (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>), but the relationship between rising temperatures and the retreat rates of marine-terminating glaciers has not previously been investigated. To quantify this, we evaluate modeled climate data from the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model 2.3 (RACMO2.3), statistically downscaled from 11- to 1-km resolution (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). The downscaled data provide a detailed reconstruction of glacier SMB components for the period 1958&#x02013;2015, corrected for biases in elevation and ice albedo (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). The 1-km product corresponds well with altimetry records and shows a close correlation between surface meltwater production and measured mean annual near-surface temperatures (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). From the downscaled version of RACMO2.3, we calculate mean ablation rates [millimeter water equivalent (w.e.) per year], mean ablation area ratio (as the percentage of basin size), and mean runoff (millimeter w.e. per year) for the full drainage basins of all 300 marine-terminating glaciers (see Materials and Methods and fig. S5).</p><p>Correlations between overall relative changes in glacier length (1958&#x02013;2015) and the mean surface ablation components over the same period are all statistically significant [Spearman&#x02019;s rank (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub>), two-tailed, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; table S6]. Glaciers that have retreated more are found to drain basins that have (i) higher mean ablation rates, (ii) larger ablation areas, and (iii) greater runoff, compared to those that have retreated less (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The strongest correlation (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = &#x02212;0.506, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) is between overall frontal change and mean runoff. Overall, retreat rates are lowest north of 78&#x000b0;N in Nares Strait (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and fig. S2A), where runoff is the least (fig.

There has been an increase in runoff from marine-terminating glaciers throughout the CAA, with the highest runoff occurring most recently (figs. S6 and S7 and table S7). The mean runoff at all latitudes during this latter period is over 40% greater than the mean before 2001. Few weather stations are situated in the region, but available records all show a trend toward more positive anomalies in mean summer near-surface air temperature (fig.

During concurrent periods, retreat rates are lower during times of lower runoff and smaller ablation areas and greater when runoff and ablation areas are larger. The only period for which this is not the case is 2002&#x02013;2009 in the QEI, when the runoff and ablation areas decreased slightly when frontal retreat rates were increasing (although the direction of change is still consistent; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and C</xref>). In BBI, the correlation persists across all six time periods, including the anomalous period of greater glacier retreat in 1980&#x02013;1985, when there was a distinct increase in runoff/ablation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and D</xref>). A recent study of surface mass loss from 1-km downscaled RACMO2.3 output shows that ice masses in the CAA experienced significant near-surface atmospheric warming (+1.1&#x000b0;C above the 1958&#x02013;1995 mean) in the mid-1990s (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>), which caused increases in meltwater runoff across the region. The region-wide acceleration in retreat rates since ~2000 corresponds well with the modeled and measured increase in mean annual near-surface atmospheric temperatures. No lag effects are observed between the surface ablation rates and the frontal changes at the scale of the multiyear periods used in this study. This indicates a rapid and near-synchronous response of marine-terminating glacier fronts to atmospheric temperature changes throughout this region.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion|conclusions" disp-level="1"><title>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our analysis indicates a rapid increase in the rate of glacier retreat in the CAA since the start of the 21st century. The evidence does not support ocean temperatures as the driver of the regional trends in glacier retreat along the western side of either Baffin Bay or Nares Strait, despite ocean forcing being recognized as a key driver of glacier frontal retreat on the eastern side of Baffin Bay in west Greenland. Both ocean temperature measurements and reanalysis data show predominantly cold waters, both on a broad regional scale (up to 100 km from the coast) and closer to glacier fronts (where data are available within 20 and 5 km). In contrast to west Greenland, CAA glaciers are relatively thin at their grounding lines (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>) and tend to occupy shallower water. They are, therefore, less vulnerable to deep ocean temperature changes, and the mean ocean temperatures at shallower depths have been too low to have driven the observed region-wide patterns of retreat (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>).</p><p>Results from the 1-km downscaled RACMO2.3, however, demonstrate a significant correlation between marine-terminating glacier front retreat rates and SMB components (mean ablation rate, ablation area ratio, and mean runoff) over the period 1958&#x02013;2015. The relationship is quantitatively robust and occurs across the region. Moreover, temporal variations in retreat rates and surface runoff rates are largely synchronous, suggesting that there is a rapid response of CAA marine-terminating glacier fronts to near-surface atmospheric warming. External forcings on the fluctuations of marine terminating glaciers have been noted in varying degrees in other locations on Earth, but the regional dominance of atmospheric temperatures in driving marine-terminating glacier retreat has not been observed elsewhere.</p><p>Glacier frontal retreat rates have followed a similar trend to the rates of surface mass loss in the CAA, which have accelerated since ~2000 (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). We suggest that the mechanisms by which increased surface air temperatures drive rapid retreat of marine-terminating glaciers in this region are likely to be much the same as those that drive retreat of the land-terminating glaciers. That is, increased melt and subsequent meltwater runoff reduces mass delivery to glacier termini through reductions in glacier flow, with the consequence that glaciers thin and retreat in their ablation areas (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>). Other mechanisms observed on marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland, such as increased surface melt amplifying the delivery of ocean heat to the terminus via the creation of an upwelling plume at the grounding line (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>), are less likely to be a primary mechanism behind regional glacier retreat in the CAA. This is because most of CAA glaciers terminate in shallow water, making them less vulnerable to intrusion of warmer deep water. However, this mechanism could be important on the local scale for the few CAA glaciers that terminate in deep water, although further research is required to examine this.</p><p>It is now widely acknowledged that ocean temperature increase has been the dominant driver of glacier retreat in other polar regions in recent years, particularly along the western Antarctic Peninsula, around the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and in western Greenland. In contrast, we show that, in the CAA, the substantial rise in atmospheric temperature in the 21st century has outweighed any regional impact of changing ocean temperature on marine-terminating glacier frontal behavior. It follows that ocean temperature cannot be assumed to be the primary driver of marine-terminating glacier retreat in all polar regions and that studies of local processes are needed to understand the impacts of climate change on glacier behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Glacier frontal positions data sources</title><p>The baseline image on which our study is based is the Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) image mosaic of the CAA, compiled from Landsat 7 scenes between 1999 and 2002, and orthorectified using ground control and conjugate points (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>). The seamless mosaic is considered accurate to ~20 m, or less than one image pixel (30 m) (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>). We downloaded the image tiles for our region of interest from the Canadian Open Government portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset">https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset</ext-link>). The glacier basin outlines were downloaded from the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>), with manual checking and correction of gross errors (e.g., coregistration of the basin outlines to the NRCan Landsat 7 mosaic). The glacier frontal positions for the period 1999&#x02013;2002 were digitized from the mosaic and joined to the glacier basin outlines to produce closed polygons, with relevant attributes (such as glacier length, type, and ID) from the GLIMS database. Marine-terminating glaciers were identified as those that terminated in the ocean at the time of the Landsat 7 mosaic (1999&#x02013;2002). In many cases, it was not possible to identify from the images the extent to which the glacier descended below sea level, and so, we used the general term &#x0201c;marine-terminating&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;tidewater&#x0201d; glacier. In total, we mapped all 300 marine-terminating glaciers in the CAA with basin size greater than 2 km<sup>2</sup> (in 1999&#x02013;2002), excluding those on the northern coast of Ellesmere Island (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Glacier frontal positions were manually digitized, using Esri ArcGIS10.5 software from a range of sources (table S1). Aerial photographs, from survey missions between 1956 and 1961, were the first observations that covered the whole region. These were accessed from the NRCan National Air Photo Library. The glacier frontal positions were mapped from the aerial photographs by on-screen digitizing from scans of the photographs georeferenced to the Landsat 7 mosaic base image. Where original photographs were not available, the glacier fronts were digitized from scans of National Topographic System map sheets, which were compiled in the 1960s from the aerial photographs. An average of seven frontal positions, at approximately decadal intervals, were mapped per glacier. Post-1960, most glacier frontal positions were digitized from Landsat satellite images. These were accessed and downloaded using the U.S. Geological Survey Earth Explorer portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov">https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov</ext-link>/). Image resolutions ranged from 5 m (aerial photographs) to 60 m (Landsat Multispectral Scanner), with all post-2000 images (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat 8) at 15-m resolution. High relative positional accuracy was maintained by ensuring that the frontal positions were georegistered to the geospatially accurate Landsat 7 mosaic. The digitization methodology follows standard procedures when mapping glacier changes in previous work (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>). Uncertainties in the glacier change results stem from the reliability of the source material, measurement error, and methods used to calculate change, as documented in Cook <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>). Similarly, in this study, it is estimated that the digitization uncertainties are less than the largest image pixel size (60 m).

Glacier area measurements take into account uneven changes along the ice front and offer a more precise assessment of change than can be obtained using along-flow sample lines that intersect the glacier fronts. Differencing of polygon areas from one epoch to another provides values of absolute area change. We used the established &#x0201c;box method&#x0201d; (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>), with some minor modifications. Using ArcMap, a box polygon was digitized for each glacier, intersecting the glacier front at its maximum width and extending upflow to an undefined distance, ensuring that all decadal positions were contained within the box (fig. S1). Each frontal position was then clipped to the box and projected into equal-area projection (WGS84 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area). The area of each clipped polygon (in square kilometers) enabled area change calculations between time periods, and the mean changes in length were calculated by dividing the area changes by the width of the glacier box. The rates of change (in meters per year) were then calculated by dividing the changes in length by the number of years that elapsed between the frontal positions. The magnitude of absolute glacier retreat is related to glacier size (larger glaciers tend to change more in absolute terms), so to enable comparisons between basins, we normalized changes according to glacier length. The relative length changes (as percentage per year) were calculated relative to the glacier length in 1999&#x02013;2002 (using the length attribute reported in GLIMS).</p><p>Statistical analyses of regional and temporal glacier changes include mean absolute (meters per year) and relative (percentage per year) rates of frontal change for glaciers in the QEI and BBI over each time interval (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and table S2) and relative rates of frontal changes over each time interval at 1&#x000b0; latitudes (fig.

For all statistical analyses, mean values are considered a suitable measure, with SE bars to show the uncertainty around the estimate of the mean, considered the most valuable measure based on the large sample size. The CAA were split into the two broad regions of QEI and BBI for the following reasons: (i) clarity in data analysis, (ii) the notably different glacier basin sizes and frontal widths between the two regions, and (iii) the differences in image availability, which results in differing start/end years for the time periods.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Grounding line ice thickness</title><p>Ice thickness at the grounding lines of tidewater glaciers in the QEI was calculated by Van Wychen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>) using data from a range of sources.

There are six weather stations located throughout the CAA (locations shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), and although some are situated at a considerable distance from the marine-terminating glaciers in this study, the records provide a useful indication of long-term temperature trends in the wider region. Temperature measurements are available at the following weather stations in the QEI: Eureka (1947&#x02013;2014), Resolute (1947&#x02013;2014), and Grise Fiord (1984&#x02013;2007); and in BBI: Pond Inlet (1975&#x02013;2007), Cape Hooper (1957&#x02013;2007), and Cape Dyer (1959&#x02013;1993). Mean summer air temperatures, for the months of June to August (JJA), were calculated from monthly mean temperatures derived from daily averages. Annual anomalies in mean summer temperatures were calculated relative to the mean temperature across the complete time period available for each weather station (fig. S8).</p></sec></sec></sec>
