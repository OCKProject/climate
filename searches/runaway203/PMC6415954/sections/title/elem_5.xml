 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The coherency in glacier retreat rates across the region suggests a common external driver. Subsurface ocean temperatures on the eastern side of Baffin Bay have been identified as a significant control on frontal change rates of glaciers in western Greenland (

   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>), and so, we first consider the possible influence of ocean temperatures on glacier fluctuations on the Canadian side of Baffin Bay. Although ocean temperature measurements from locations close to glacier fronts in the CAA are generally sparse, there are sufficient data sources for regional-scale analyses. TOPAZ4 reanalysis data (gridded at 12.5 km from 1991 to 2015) (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>) are available from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and show spatial patterns in mean temperatures at standard depths (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). Strong differences in temperature between the east and west sides of Baffin Bay are evident: Off southwest Greenland, warm waters (&gt;1°C) are present at all depths, whereas waters at depths of 200 m and shallower surrounding the CAA are typically cold (&lt;−1°C). This pattern is explained by the cyclonic circulation in northern Baffin Bay from the West Greenland Current System (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>), which advects warm, saline Atlantic waters northward along western Greenland and carries fresh and cold Arctic waters southward along eastern Baffin Island. Additional cold water masses occur off northern Baffin Island as a result of wintertime freezing within the polynyas of northern Baffin Bay (in Smith, Jones, and Lancaster Sounds; locations marked on

  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). Cold waters in Smith Sound originate from water from the Pacific that enters via the Arctic Ocean and Nares Strait (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). In recent decades, however, changes have occurred in Baffin Bay, including warming in areas affected by the Atlantic inflow (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess ocean temperatures close to marine-terminating glaciers in the CAA, we use in situ temperature measurements (1972–2015) obtained from the World Ocean Database 2013 (WOD13) (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>) for standard depths between 50 and 500 m. These depths represent the range of bathymetry close to the coast, as calculated from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (see Materials and Methods). Although only 19 glaciers have ocean temperature measurements within 5 km of their fronts, these show comparable mean temperatures to those with measurements up to 20 km away (figs. S3 and S4). In total, 117 glaciers have ≥10 conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) measurements within 20 km of their fronts, which provides a sample that is more than sufficient for statistical analysis. First, following methods outlined in (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>), we compare mean overall glacier frontal changes (1958/1959 to 2015) with their adjacent mean ocean temperatures (1972 to 2015). From this, we find no statistically significant correlation at any depth (
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a> and table S4). The mean ocean temperatures within 20 km of glacier fronts are below 0°C at all depths (fig. S4), and although these are above the freezing temperature of sea water (calculated from pressure and mean salinity), the melt induced by water at such low mean temperatures would be insufficient to drive retreat at the scale observed (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>). For example, a study of glaciers in Svalbard (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>) found that the relationship between frontal ablation rate and ambient subsurface ocean temperatures was strong and linear above 0°C, but little or no retreat occurred when ocean temperatures were below 0°C.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial and temporal analysis of in situ temperature measurements shows that, north of 75°N, mean ocean temperatures up to 100 km from the coast have been below 0°C almost universally since the earliest records (
  <a rid="F5" ref-type="fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a> and table S5). Although heat content is low at these northern latitudes, a statistically significant increase in temperature occurred between the 1970s and 2000s at all depths (where data are available). Another study has shown that, on a local scale, there are variations to the regional trend, such as to the east of Devon Island and southeast Ellesmere Island, where temperatures at 200-m depth were lower in 2000–2010 relative to 1995–1999 (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). At latitudes south of 75°N, mean temperatures have been warmer than 0°C at 400- and 500-m depths since records began, and warming has occurred at all depths, except for a temperature decrease between 72°N and 74°N at 500-m depth (table S5). Although ocean warming has occurred throughout much of the region, the temperatures have been substantially below those seen to be driving melt in western Greenland and elsewhere [e.g., (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>)]. For example, the rapidly retreating Jakobshavn Isbrae is adjacent to the warm (mean, ~1.8°C) subsurface water of Disko Bay (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ice thickness and water depth at the grounding line also influence the degree of oceanic control on glacier retreat. Results from a recent study (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>) show that the mean ice thickness at the grounding line of 35 tidewater glaciers in the QEI is estimated to be ~230 m and that only eight glaciers have a grounding line thickness that exceeds 300 m. In the BBI region, the mean ice thickness at the grounding lines is estimated to be even smaller (~100 m) (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>). Therefore, the warmer water present at ocean depths deeper than 400 m will have little impact on the glaciers. By comparison, many outlet glaciers in Greenland extend into fjords to depths of 600 m or more, where they are exposed to deep warm Atlantic water (
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>). Thus, while some large glaciers in the CAA may be vulnerable to melt in specific locations where they sit in deeper and warmer water, we find no evidence that ocean temperatures have driven the long-term regional patterns in the retreat of marine-terminating glaciers in the CAA.
