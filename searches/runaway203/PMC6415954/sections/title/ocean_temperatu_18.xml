The TOPAZ4 Arctic Ocean Physics reanalysis data provide physical ocean variables for the time period 1991–2015. These data are available from the CMEMS (product identifier: ARCTIC_REANALYSIS_PHYS_002_003). The TOPAZ reanalysis system assimilates all available satellite and in situ temperature-salinity profile observations, resulting in modeled data as a 12.5-km resolution grid (

  </a>). We downloaded the mean monthly temperature and salinity NetCDF files at the subsurface standard depths available: 50, 100, 200, 400, and 700 m. Mean annual temperatures were calculated from the grid values at each depth. The quality information document (

The forecast biases are −0.35°C at 5- to 100-m depth, −0.2°C at 100- to 300-m depth, and 0.5°C at 300- to 800-m depth. Forecast RMS differences are 0.6°C at 5- to 100-m depth, 0.8°C at 100- to 300-m depth, and 1.0°C at 300- to 800-m depth. These accuracy estimates are for the full domain, but there is variability in the system accuracy, e.g., in some regions with few temperature profile data, the reanalysis Root Mean Square error (RMSE) can be up to 1.0°C. Our statistical analysis does not include TOPAZ4 reanalysis data, and therefore, these errors do not affect our results. Rather, the data are used to illustrate the regional overview of mean annual ocean temperature at each depth (

  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>) is a comprehensive set of historical ocean profile data collected between 1972 and 2015. Data are provided by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. We selected in situ data from CTD profiles for the region surrounding the CAA. We downloaded temperatures at the following standard depths available: 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, and 500 m. WOD13 water properties at standard depths were measured and reported either directly or by interpolation, as set out by commonly used criteria (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). The data variables include the measurement station ID, latitude/longitude, date, and year, in addition to temperature and salinity values. To download the data for our region of interest, we used the Ocean Data View software provided by NOAA. Error estimates described in the WOD13 report (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>) state that the accuracy of CTD measurements varies with instrument design, typically from 0.005° to 0.001°C for temperature. The overall quality of CTD measurements are also affected by calibration drift (i.e., prolonged use of the CTD instrument in the sea), data streaming problems, varying speeds of the CTD, and rapid changes in the ocean environment. The measurements are assigned a flag in quality control checks and measurements that are considered to fail quality control are excluded from WOD13. Other flags range from good quality (1), to potentially bad quality but based on visual inspection found no reason not to be used in scientific research (4) (

  </a>). For our study, we included all measurements available in WOD13, and our representation of error in the statistical analysis methods is SE, considered the most valuable owing to the large sample size.
