  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The baseline image on which our study is based is the Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) image mosaic of the CAA, compiled from Landsat 7 scenes between 1999 and 2002, and orthorectified using ground control and conjugate points (
   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
    <span class="italic">40</span>

   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
    <span class="italic">40</span>

The glacier basin outlines were downloaded from the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database (
   <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
    <span class="italic">41</span>
   </a>), with manual checking and correction of gross errors (e.g., coregistration of the basin outlines to the NRCan Landsat 7 mosaic). The glacier frontal positions for the period 1999–2002 were digitized from the mosaic and joined to the glacier basin outlines to produce closed polygons, with relevant attributes (such as glacier length, type, and ID) from the GLIMS database. Marine-terminating glaciers were identified as those that terminated in the ocean at the time of the Landsat 7 mosaic (1999–2002). In many cases, it was not possible to identify from the images the extent to which the glacier descended below sea level, and so, we used the general term “marine-terminating” rather than “tidewater” glacier. In total, we mapped all 300 marine-terminating glaciers in the CAA with basin size greater than 2 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> (in 1999–2002), excluding those on the northern coast of Ellesmere Island (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Glacier frontal positions were manually digitized, using Esri ArcGIS10.5 software from a range of sources (table S1). Aerial photographs, from survey missions between 1956 and 1961, were the first observations that covered the whole region. These were accessed from the NRCan National Air Photo Library. The glacier frontal positions were mapped from the aerial photographs by on-screen digitizing from scans of the photographs georeferenced to the Landsat 7 mosaic base image. Where original photographs were not available, the glacier fronts were digitized from scans of National Topographic System map sheets, which were compiled in the 1960s from the aerial photographs. An average of seven frontal positions, at approximately decadal intervals, were mapped per glacier. Post-1960, most glacier frontal positions were digitized from Landsat satellite images. These were accessed and downloaded using the U.S. Geological Survey Earth Explorer portal (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov</span>/). Image resolutions ranged from 5 m (aerial photographs) to 60 m (Landsat Multispectral Scanner), with all post-2000 images (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat 8) at 15-m resolution. High relative positional accuracy was maintained by ensuring that the frontal positions were georegistered to the geospatially accurate Landsat 7 mosaic. The digitization methodology follows standard procedures when mapping glacier changes in previous work (
   <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
    <span class="italic">42</span>
   </a>). Uncertainties in the glacier change results stem from the reliability of the source material, measurement error, and methods used to calculate change, as documented in Cook 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (
   <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
    <span class="italic">42</span>
   </a>). Similarly, in this study, it is estimated that the digitization uncertainties are less than the largest image pixel size (60 m). Uncertainty in the data analysis methods is described in the following section.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All frontal positions digitized for each basin were joined to the glacier basin outline, resulting in individual area polygons for each time period. Glacier area measurements take into account uneven changes along the ice front and offer a more precise assessment of change than can be obtained using along-flow sample lines that intersect the glacier fronts. Differencing of polygon areas from one epoch to another provides values of absolute area change. We used the established “box method” (
    <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
     <span class="italic">43</span>
    </a>), with some minor modifications. Using ArcMap, a box polygon was digitized for each glacier, intersecting the glacier front at its maximum width and extending upflow to an undefined distance, ensuring that all decadal positions were contained within the box (fig. S1). Each frontal position was then clipped to the box and projected into equal-area projection (WGS84 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area). The area of each clipped polygon (in square kilometers) enabled area change calculations between time periods, and the mean changes in length were calculated by dividing the area changes by the width of the glacier box. The rates of change (in meters per year) were then calculated by dividing the changes in length by the number of years that elapsed between the frontal positions. The magnitude of absolute glacier retreat is related to glacier size (larger glaciers tend to change more in absolute terms), so to enable comparisons between basins, we normalized changes according to glacier length. The relative length changes (as percentage per year) were calculated relative to the glacier length in 1999–2002 (using the length attribute reported in GLIMS).
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical analyses of regional and temporal glacier changes include mean absolute (meters per year) and relative (percentage per year) rates of frontal change for glaciers in the QEI and BBI over each time interval (
    <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> and table S2) and relative rates of frontal changes over each time interval at 1° latitudes (fig. S2). For all statistical analyses, mean values are considered a suitable measure, with SE bars to show the uncertainty around the estimate of the mean, considered the most valuable measure based on the large sample size. The CAA were split into the two broad regions of QEI and BBI for the following reasons: (i) clarity in data analysis, (ii) the notably different glacier basin sizes and frontal widths between the two regions, and (iii) the differences in image availability, which results in differing start/end years for the time periods.

The TOPAZ4 Arctic Ocean Physics reanalysis data provide physical ocean variables for the time period 1991–2015. These data are available from the CMEMS (product identifier: ARCTIC_REANALYSIS_PHYS_002_003). The TOPAZ reanalysis system assimilates all available satellite and in situ temperature-salinity profile observations, resulting in modeled data as a 12.5-km resolution grid (

The forecast biases are −0.35°C at 5- to 100-m depth, −0.2°C at 100- to 300-m depth, and 0.5°C at 300- to 800-m depth. Forecast RMS differences are 0.6°C at 5- to 100-m depth, 0.8°C at 100- to 300-m depth, and 1.0°C at 300- to 800-m depth. These accuracy estimates are for the full domain, but there is variability in the system accuracy, e.g., in some regions with few temperature profile data, the reanalysis Root Mean Square error (RMSE) can be up to 1.0°C. Our statistical analysis does not include TOPAZ4 reanalysis data, and therefore, these errors do not affect our results. Rather, the data are used to illustrate the regional overview of mean annual ocean temperature at each depth (

We selected in situ data from CTD profiles for the region surrounding the CAA. We downloaded temperatures at the following standard depths available: 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, and 500 m. WOD13 water properties at standard depths were measured and reported either directly or by interpolation, as set out by commonly used criteria (

    </a>) state that the accuracy of CTD measurements varies with instrument design, typically from 0.005° to 0.001°C for temperature. The overall quality of CTD measurements are also affected by calibration drift (i.e., prolonged use of the CTD instrument in the sea), data streaming problems, varying speeds of the CTD, and rapid changes in the ocean environment. The measurements are assigned a flag in quality control checks and measurements that are considered to fail quality control are excluded from WOD13. Other flags range from good quality (1), to potentially bad quality but based on visual inspection found no reason not to be used in scientific research (4) (

The model is a downscaled version of the 11-km RACMO2.3, corrected for biases in elevation and bare ice albedo, and provides regional SMB data at a scale suitable for measuring mean values within individual glacier basins in the CAA. The SMB output is in millimeter w.e. year

Correcting for elevation and bare ice albedo bias during the downscaling process significantly improved the accuracy. Assessment with observational data showed that, relative to the 11-km model, the 1-km downscaled version of RACMO2.3 has a much improved mean SMB bias (40 mm w.e.), RMSE (380 mm w.e.), and

To obtain these estimates, the 4356 in situ SMB measurements from 1961 to 2016, e.g., from Sverdrup Glacier on Devon Island (yellow dots in fig.

The 1-km resolution data enabled statistical analysis of ablation components within each glacier basin (fig. S5).</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean ablation rates per glacier basin were calculated from negative (i.e., &lt;0) SMB values, in mm w.e. year
    <span class="sup">−1</span>. Net ablation occurs in the region of the glacier basin where ice loss through surface melt, sublimation, and runoff is greater than ice gain through precipitation and riming. The ablation area ratio (in percentage) was therefore calculated as the area where SMB &lt; 0 mm w.e. year
    <span class="sup">−1</span>, divided by the glacier basin area. This is calculated from the gridded data, i.e., the number of negative SMB points divided by the total number of grid points that constitute each glacier basin. The ablation area ratio enables analysis of patterns of change across all glaciers by normalization of basin areas. Mean annual runoff (in mm w.e. year
    <span class="sup">−1</span>) represents basin-wide nonrefrozen rain and meltwater induced by the surface energy balance, and we calculated this from the sum of the runoff component values divided by the number of grid points per basin. It should be noted that summer runoff consist partly of rainfall, which does not contribute to mass loss, but the flux is small [Figure 8 in (
