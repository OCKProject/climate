  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A detailed reconstruction of SMB between 1958 and 2015 is available from the RACMO2.3 statistically downscaled to 1 km. The model is a downscaled version of the 11-km RACMO2.3, corrected for biases in elevation and bare ice albedo, and provides regional SMB data at a scale suitable for measuring mean values within individual glacier basins in the CAA. The SMB output is in millimeter w.e. year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The methods used in producing the model, along with accuracy assessments based on in situ mass balance measurements, are reported in Noël 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (
   <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
    <span class="italic">5</span>
   </a>). These are summarized as follows. The SMB values from both the 11- and 1-km versions of RACMO2.3 were assessed against 4356 stake measurements within the CAA. Correcting for elevation and bare ice albedo bias during the downscaling process significantly improved the accuracy. Assessment with observational data showed that, relative to the 11-km model, the 1-km downscaled version of RACMO2.3 has a much improved mean SMB bias (40 mm w.e.), RMSE (380 mm w.e.), and 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> (0.74). The product uncertainty for SMB was estimated at 11.0 and 4.5 Gt year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for Northern CAA (NCAA = QEI) and Southern CAA (SCAA = BBI), respectively. To obtain these estimates, the 4356 in situ SMB measurements from 1961 to 2016, e.g., from Sverdrup Glacier on Devon Island (yellow dots in fig. S5), were binned in 250 mm w.e. intervals for which the mean bias was estimated (i.e., modeled minus measured SMB), which was then applied to total ablation and accumulation areas across the region (

    <span class="italic">5</span>
   </a>). The RACMO2.3 product was further evaluated using independently derived mass changes from ICESat and CryoSat-2 altimetry measurements. The downscaled dataset shows good agreement with the altimetry records, and both winter accumulation and summer ablation are accurately resolved. In addition, the SMB product falls well within ICESat/CryoSat-2 measurement uncertainty. Ice mass loss estimates from the downscaled SMB product are similar to estimates from other mass loss studies (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SMB calculations per glacier basin</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For our study, the SMB calculations per glacier basin were made from the downscaled RACMO2.3 by converting the gridded values to points for analysis in ArcGIS. The 1-km resolution data enabled statistical analysis of ablation components within each glacier basin (fig. S5).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean ablation rates per glacier basin were calculated from negative (i.e., &lt;0) SMB values, in mm w.e. year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>. Net ablation occurs in the region of the glacier basin where ice loss through surface melt, sublimation, and runoff is greater than ice gain through precipitation and riming. The ablation area ratio (in percentage) was therefore calculated as the area where SMB &lt; 0 mm w.e. year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, divided by the glacier basin area. This is calculated from the gridded data, i.e., the number of negative SMB points divided by the total number of grid points that constitute each glacier basin. The ablation area ratio enables analysis of patterns of change across all glaciers by normalization of basin areas. Mean annual runoff (in mm w.e. year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) represents basin-wide nonrefrozen rain and meltwater induced by the surface energy balance, and we calculated this from the sum of the runoff component values divided by the number of grid points per basin. It should be noted that summer runoff consist partly of rainfall, which does not contribute to mass loss, but the flux is small [Figure 8 in (
   <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
    <span class="italic">5</span>
   </a>)].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated mean values of these components across the whole study period (1958–2015) and, for each time period, used in the glacier front change study. Mean runoff patterns show similar temporal trends for marine-terminating glaciers at all degrees latitude, with a statistically significant increase in recent time periods (fig. S6). This is reflected in the spatiotemporal patterns of runoff from ice masses throughout the CAA (fig. S7).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Near-surface (2 m) air temperature data are available from weather stations operated by Environment Canada from 1948 to the present (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://climate.weather.gc.ca" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://climate.weather.gc.ca</span>/). There are six weather stations located throughout the CAA (locations shown in 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>), and although some are situated at a considerable distance from the marine-terminating glaciers in this study, the records provide a useful indication of long-term temperature trends in the wider region. Temperature measurements are available at the following weather stations in the QEI: Eureka (1947–2014), Resolute (1947–2014), and Grise Fiord (1984–2007); and in BBI: Pond Inlet (1975–2007), Cape Hooper (1957–2007), and Cape Dyer (1959–1993). Mean summer air temperatures, for the months of June to August (JJA), were calculated from monthly mean temperatures derived from daily averages. Annual anomalies in mean summer temperatures were calculated relative to the mean temperature across the complete time period available for each weather station (fig. S8).
