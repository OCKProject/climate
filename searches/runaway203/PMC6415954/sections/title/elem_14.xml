  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All frontal positions digitized for each basin were joined to the glacier basin outline, resulting in individual area polygons for each time period. Glacier area measurements take into account uneven changes along the ice front and offer a more precise assessment of change than can be obtained using along-flow sample lines that intersect the glacier fronts. Differencing of polygon areas from one epoch to another provides values of absolute area change. We used the established “box method” (

   </a>), with some minor modifications. Using ArcMap, a box polygon was digitized for each glacier, intersecting the glacier front at its maximum width and extending upflow to an undefined distance, ensuring that all decadal positions were contained within the box (fig. S1). Each frontal position was then clipped to the box and projected into equal-area projection (WGS84 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area). The area of each clipped polygon (in square kilometers) enabled area change calculations between time periods, and the mean changes in length were calculated by dividing the area changes by the width of the glacier box. The rates of change (in meters per year) were then calculated by dividing the changes in length by the number of years that elapsed between the frontal positions. The magnitude of absolute glacier retreat is related to glacier size (larger glaciers tend to change more in absolute terms), so to enable comparisons between basins, we normalized changes according to glacier length. The relative length changes (as percentage per year) were calculated relative to the glacier length in 1999–2002 (using the length attribute reported in GLIMS).

   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> and table S2) and relative rates of frontal changes over each time interval at 1° latitudes (fig. S2). For all statistical analyses, mean values are considered a suitable measure, with SE bars to show the uncertainty around the estimate of the mean, considered the most valuable measure based on the large sample size. The CAA were split into the two broad regions of QEI and BBI for the following reasons: (i) clarity in data analysis, (ii) the notably different glacier basin sizes and frontal widths between the two regions, and (iii) the differences in image availability, which results in differing start/end years for the time periods.
