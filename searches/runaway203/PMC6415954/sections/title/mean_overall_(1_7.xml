 <div class="title">Mean overall (1958–2015) glacier front changes (as the percentage of glacier length in 2000) by mean in situ ocean temperatures (1971–2015) at specific depths.</div>
 <p>Results are for all glaciers with 10 or more ocean temperature measurements within 20 km of their fronts (glacier counts are in table S3, and correlation coefficients are in table S4). No significant correlation is observed between magnitude of frontal retreat and temperatures at any depth.</p>
