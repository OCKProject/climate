  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We determined ~7 frontal positions for each glacier by digitizing images from a range of sources collected at approximately decadal intervals (see Materials and Methods, fig. S1, and table S1). Our comparison of historical aerial photography from 1958/1959 with Landsat satellite imagery in 2015 indicates that &gt;94% of the 300 marine-terminating glaciers investigated have, overall, retreated during this period (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). The mean frontal change rate was −9.3 m year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (±1.4 m year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> SE) for the 211 glaciers in the QEI and −6.9 m year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (±0.7 m year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> SE) for the 89 glaciers in BBI. Total area loss by frontal retreat since 1958 was 387 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> in the QEI and 22.5 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> in BBI. In both regions, the absolute area change associated with glacier retreat is related to both the width and length of the glacier (in absolute terms, larger glaciers retreat greater distances than smaller ones), so we normalized area changes according to the length of glacier basins in ~2000. Mean relative length changes since the late 1950s were −4.2% (±0.3% SE) in the QEI and −4.1% (±0.3% SE) in BBI (
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). Of the 211 marine-terminating glaciers in the QEI, 23 have previously been identified as surge type (
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
    <span class="italic">22</span>
   </a>), so we excluded these from further analysis because their terminus behavior can be independent of climate forcing. In addition, our study does not include glaciers situated along the northern coast of Ellesmere Island, which are strongly influenced by the buttressing effect of multiyear sea ice and interactions with floating ice shelves and have been described elsewhere (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar decadal patterns in frontal variability occurred throughout the study region: Glaciers showed slow retreat in the earlier years (1958 to late 1990s), and retreat rates increased considerably after ~2000 (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, A and B</a>). The mean frontal change rates in the QEI and BBI during the 1960s were −7.0 and −0.6 m year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively, increasing to −29.1 and −22.9 m year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> since 2009/2010 (table S2). This trend is evident in both absolute and relative length changes and across all glacier types (e.g., different sizes, lengths, and frontal widths). The greatest absolute retreat rates occurred in the QEI, where mean glacier lengths and terminus widths are greater than those of glaciers further south. One notable anomaly in the BBI region is a period of increased retreat in the early 1980s (
   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>). Another period of note is the earliest interval in the QEI region (1959–1975), when retreat rates were greater than in the two subsequent periods (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar trends are observed across different latitudes, showing that there are no clear spatial variations in the temporal pattern of accelerating retreat (fig. S2). At all latitudes in the QEI, the lowest retreat rates occurred in the earlier periods, and rates were highest in the two periods since 2002. Although mean relative retreat rates are lower in the two most northerly latitudinal bands, they exhibit the same temporal trend. In the BBI region, the pattern is broadly similar, but during the period 1980–1985, there was a notable increase in retreat in each band north of 70°N. The highest regional mean retreat rate (−0.33% year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) occurred in the most recent period, 2009–2015, in southeast Ellesmere Island (77°N to 78°N). The greatest absolute retreat rates in the CAA were observed on the coalescent Trinity and Wykeham glaciers (78.0°N, 78.6°W), where they reached −338 m year
   <span class="sup">−1</span> between 1976 and 1984 and − 255 m year

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The coherency in glacier retreat rates across the region suggests a common external driver. Subsurface ocean temperatures on the eastern side of Baffin Bay have been identified as a significant control on frontal change rates of glaciers in western Greenland (

   </a>), and so, we first consider the possible influence of ocean temperatures on glacier fluctuations on the Canadian side of Baffin Bay. Although ocean temperature measurements from locations close to glacier fronts in the CAA are generally sparse, there are sufficient data sources for regional-scale analyses. TOPAZ4 reanalysis data (gridded at 12.5 km from 1991 to 2015) (
   <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
    <span class="italic">25</span>
   </a>) are available from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and show spatial patterns in mean temperatures at standard depths (
   <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). Strong differences in temperature between the east and west sides of Baffin Bay are evident: Off southwest Greenland, warm waters (&gt;1°C) are present at all depths, whereas waters at depths of 200 m and shallower surrounding the CAA are typically cold (&lt;−1°C). This pattern is explained by the cyclonic circulation in northern Baffin Bay from the West Greenland Current System (
   <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
    <span class="italic">26</span>
   </a>), which advects warm, saline Atlantic waters northward along western Greenland and carries fresh and cold Arctic waters southward along eastern Baffin Island. Additional cold water masses occur off northern Baffin Island as a result of wintertime freezing within the polynyas of northern Baffin Bay (in Smith, Jones, and Lancaster Sounds; locations marked on

   <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
    <span class="italic">28</span>
   </a>) for standard depths between 50 and 500 m. These depths represent the range of bathymetry close to the coast, as calculated from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (see Materials and Methods). Although only 19 glaciers have ocean temperature measurements within 5 km of their fronts, these show comparable mean temperatures to those with measurements up to 20 km away (figs. S3 and S4). In total, 117 glaciers have ≥10 conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) measurements within 20 km of their fronts, which provides a sample that is more than sufficient for statistical analysis. First, following methods outlined in (
   <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
    <span class="italic">29</span>
   </a>), we compare mean overall glacier frontal changes (1958/1959 to 2015) with their adjacent mean ocean temperatures (1972 to 2015). From this, we find no statistically significant correlation at any depth (
   <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a> and table S4). The mean ocean temperatures within 20 km of glacier fronts are below 0°C at all depths (fig. S4), and although these are above the freezing temperature of sea water (calculated from pressure and mean salinity), the melt induced by water at such low mean temperatures would be insufficient to drive retreat at the scale observed (
   <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
    <span class="italic">29</span>
   </a>). For example, a study of glaciers in Svalbard (
   <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
    <span class="italic">10</span>
   </a>) found that the relationship between frontal ablation rate and ambient subsurface ocean temperatures was strong and linear above 0°C, but little or no retreat occurred when ocean temperatures were below 0°C.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial and temporal analysis of in situ temperature measurements shows that, north of 75°N, mean ocean temperatures up to 100 km from the coast have been below 0°C almost universally since the earliest records (
   <a rid="F5" ref-type="fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a> and table S5). Although heat content is low at these northern latitudes, a statistically significant increase in temperature occurred between the 1970s and 2000s at all depths (where data are available). Another study has shown that, on a local scale, there are variations to the regional trend, such as to the east of Devon Island and southeast Ellesmere Island, where temperatures at 200-m depth were lower in 2000–2010 relative to 1995–1999 (

At latitudes south of 75°N, mean temperatures have been warmer than 0°C at 400- and 500-m depths since records began, and warming has occurred at all depths, except for a temperature decrease between 72°N and 74°N at 500-m depth (table S5). Although ocean warming has occurred throughout much of the region, the temperatures have been substantially below those seen to be driving melt in western Greenland and elsewhere [e.g., (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ice thickness and water depth at the grounding line also influence the degree of oceanic control on glacier retreat. Results from a recent study (
   <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
    <span class="italic">31</span>
   </a>) show that the mean ice thickness at the grounding line of 35 tidewater glaciers in the QEI is estimated to be ~230 m and that only eight glaciers have a grounding line thickness that exceeds 300 m. In the BBI region, the mean ice thickness at the grounding lines is estimated to be even smaller (~100 m) (
   <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
    <span class="italic">32</span>
   </a>). Therefore, the warmer water present at ocean depths deeper than 400 m will have little impact on the glaciers. By comparison, many outlet glaciers in Greenland extend into fjords to depths of 600 m or more, where they are exposed to deep warm Atlantic water (

During concurrent periods, retreat rates are lower during times of lower runoff and smaller ablation areas and greater when runoff and ablation areas are larger.

   <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, B and D</a>). A recent study of surface mass loss from 1-km downscaled RACMO2.3 output shows that ice masses in the CAA experienced significant near-surface atmospheric warming (+1.1°C above the 1958–1995 mean) in the mid-1990s (

The region-wide acceleration in retreat rates since ~2000 corresponds well with the modeled and measured increase in mean annual near-surface atmospheric temperatures. No lag effects are observed between the surface ablation rates and the frontal changes at the scale of the multiyear periods used in this study. This indicates a rapid and near-synchronous response of marine-terminating glacier fronts to atmospheric temperature changes throughout this region.
