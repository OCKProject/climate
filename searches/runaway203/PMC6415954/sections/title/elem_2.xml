 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marine-terminating glacier frontal changes</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We determined ~7 frontal positions for each glacier by digitizing images from a range of sources collected at approximately decadal intervals (see Materials and Methods, fig. S1, and table S1). Our comparison of historical aerial photography from 1958/1959 with Landsat satellite imagery in 2015 indicates that &gt;94% of the 300 marine-terminating glaciers investigated have, overall, retreated during this period (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). The mean frontal change rate was −9.3 m year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (±1.4 m year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> SE) for the 211 glaciers in the QEI and −6.9 m year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (±0.7 m year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> SE) for the 89 glaciers in BBI. Total area loss by frontal retreat since 1958 was 387 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in the QEI and 22.5 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in BBI. In both regions, the absolute area change associated with glacier retreat is related to both the width and length of the glacier (in absolute terms, larger glaciers retreat greater distances than smaller ones), so we normalized area changes according to the length of glacier basins in ~2000. Mean relative length changes since the late 1950s were −4.2% (±0.3% SE) in the QEI and −4.1% (±0.3% SE) in BBI (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). Of the 211 marine-terminating glaciers in the QEI, 23 have previously been identified as surge type (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>), so we excluded these from further analysis because their terminus behavior can be independent of climate forcing. In addition, our study does not include glaciers situated along the northern coast of Ellesmere Island, which are strongly influenced by the buttressing effect of multiyear sea ice and interactions with floating ice shelves and have been described elsewhere (

   <p>In the QEI, 197 glaciers have retreated, and 12 have advanced since 1959. Five of those that have advanced are surge type. In the BBI region, 87 glaciers have retreated, and 2 have advanced since 1958. Named features are those referred to in text.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar decadal patterns in frontal variability occurred throughout the study region: Glaciers showed slow retreat in the earlier years (1958 to late 1990s), and retreat rates increased considerably after ~2000 (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, A and B</a>). The mean frontal change rates in the QEI and BBI during the 1960s were −7.0 and −0.6 m year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively, increasing to −29.1 and −22.9 m year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> since 2009/2010 (table S2). This trend is evident in both absolute and relative length changes and across all glacier types (e.g., different sizes, lengths, and frontal widths). The greatest absolute retreat rates occurred in the QEI, where mean glacier lengths and terminus widths are greater than those of glaciers further south. One notable anomaly in the BBI region is a period of increased retreat in the early 1980s (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>). Another period of note is the earliest interval in the QEI region (1959–1975), when retreat rates were greater than in the two subsequent periods (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar trends are observed across different latitudes, showing that there are no clear spatial variations in the temporal pattern of accelerating retreat (fig. S2). At all latitudes in the QEI, the lowest retreat rates occurred in the earlier periods, and rates were highest in the two periods since 2002. Although mean relative retreat rates are lower in the two most northerly latitudinal bands, they exhibit the same temporal trend. In the BBI region, the pattern is broadly similar, but during the period 1980–1985, there was a notable increase in retreat in each band north of 70°N. The highest regional mean retreat rate (−0.33% year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) occurred in the most recent period, 2009–2015, in southeast Ellesmere Island (77°N to 78°N). The greatest absolute retreat rates in the CAA were observed on the coalescent Trinity and Wykeham glaciers (78.0°N, 78.6°W), where they reached −338 m year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> between 1976 and 1984 and − 255 m year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> between 2009 and 2015, with a total retreat of 4.8 km since 1959.
