 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For our study, the SMB calculations per glacier basin were made from the downscaled RACMO2.3 by converting the gridded values to points for analysis in ArcGIS. The 1-km resolution data enabled statistical analysis of ablation components within each glacier basin (fig. S5).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean ablation rates per glacier basin were calculated from negative (i.e., &lt;0) SMB values, in mm w.e. year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Net ablation occurs in the region of the glacier basin where ice loss through surface melt, sublimation, and runoff is greater than ice gain through precipitation and riming. The ablation area ratio (in percentage) was therefore calculated as the area where SMB &lt; 0 mm w.e. year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, divided by the glacier basin area. This is calculated from the gridded data, i.e., the number of negative SMB points divided by the total number of grid points that constitute each glacier basin. The ablation area ratio enables analysis of patterns of change across all glaciers by normalization of basin areas. Mean annual runoff (in mm w.e. year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) represents basin-wide nonrefrozen rain and meltwater induced by the surface energy balance, and we calculated this from the sum of the runoff component values divided by the number of grid points per basin. It should be noted that summer runoff consist partly of rainfall, which does not contribute to mass loss, but the flux is small [Figure 8 in (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated mean values of these components across the whole study period (1958–2015) and, for each time period, used in the glacier front change study. Mean runoff patterns show similar temporal trends for marine-terminating glaciers at all degrees latitude, with a statistically significant increase in recent time periods (fig. S6). This is reflected in the spatiotemporal patterns of runoff from ice masses throughout the CAA (fig. S7).</p>
