 <div class="title">Temporal trends in glacier length, surface ablation and runoff.</div>
 <p>Marine-terminating glacier length changes (percentage per year) by time interval for (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) QEI and (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) BBI. Trends in mean runoff (millimeter w.e. year
  <span class="sup">–1</span>) and mean ablation area (as the percentage of glacier basin area) calculated from RACMO2.3 statistically downscaled to 1 km for (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) QEI and (
  <span class="bold">D</span>) BBI. Surge-type glaciers are excluded. Thick horizontal lines are mean values, and outer horizontal lines are ±1 SE.
