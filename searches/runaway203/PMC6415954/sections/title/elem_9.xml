  </a>), but the relationship between rising temperatures and the retreat rates of marine-terminating glaciers has not previously been investigated. To quantify this, we evaluate modeled climate data from the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model 2.3 (RACMO2.3), statistically downscaled from 11- to 1-km resolution (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). The downscaled data provide a detailed reconstruction of glacier SMB components for the period 1958–2015, corrected for biases in elevation and ice albedo (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). The 1-km product corresponds well with altimetry records and shows a close correlation between surface meltwater production and measured mean annual near-surface temperatures (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). From the downscaled version of RACMO2.3, we calculate mean ablation rates [millimeter water equivalent (w.e.) per year], mean ablation area ratio (as the percentage of basin size), and mean runoff (millimeter w.e. per year) for the full drainage basins of all 300 marine-terminating glaciers (see Materials and Methods and fig. S5).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Correlations between overall relative changes in glacier length (1958–2015) and the mean surface ablation components over the same period are all statistically significant [Spearman’s rank (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>s</sub>), two-tailed, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01; table S6]. Glaciers that have retreated more are found to drain basins that have (i) higher mean ablation rates, (ii) larger ablation areas, and (iii) greater runoff, compared to those that have retreated less (
  <a rid="F6" ref-type="fig" href="#F6">Fig. 6</a>). The strongest correlation (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>s</sub> = −0.506, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01) is between overall frontal change and mean runoff. Overall, retreat rates are lowest north of 78°N in Nares Strait (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a> and fig. S2A), where runoff is the least (fig. S6), near-surface air temperatures are the lowest (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>), and sea ice concentration remains high (
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>). There has been an increase in runoff from marine-terminating glaciers throughout the CAA, with the highest runoff occurring most recently (figs. S6 and S7 and table S7). The mean runoff at all latitudes during this latter period is over 40% greater than the mean before 2001. Few weather stations are situated in the region, but available records all show a trend toward more positive anomalies in mean summer near-surface air temperature (fig. S8).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temporal trends in runoff and ablation area extent between 1958 and 2015 correspond closely with the trends in frontal retreat rates in both the QEI and BBI regions (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> and table S7). During concurrent periods, retreat rates are lower during times of lower runoff and smaller ablation areas and greater when runoff and ablation areas are larger. The only period for which this is not the case is 2002–2009 in the QEI, when the runoff and ablation areas decreased slightly when frontal retreat rates were increasing (although the direction of change is still consistent; 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, A and C</a>). In BBI, the correlation persists across all six time periods, including the anomalous period of greater glacier retreat in 1980–1985, when there was a distinct increase in runoff/ablation (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, B and D</a>). A recent study of surface mass loss from 1-km downscaled RACMO2.3 output shows that ice masses in the CAA experienced significant near-surface atmospheric warming (+1.1°C above the 1958–1995 mean) in the mid-1990s (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>), which caused increases in meltwater runoff across the region. The region-wide acceleration in retreat rates since ~2000 corresponds well with the modeled and measured increase in mean annual near-surface atmospheric temperatures. No lag effects are observed between the surface ablation rates and the frontal changes at the scale of the multiyear periods used in this study. This indicates a rapid and near-synchronous response of marine-terminating glacier fronts to atmospheric temperature changes throughout this region.
