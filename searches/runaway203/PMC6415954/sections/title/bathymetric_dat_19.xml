 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The standard depths at which the ocean temperature measurements were chosen were based on the range of depths close to the glacier fronts. These were established from the NOAA International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean v3, 500-m grid (fig. S3). The grid is compiled from all available multibeam, dense single beam, and land data and built using a gridding algorithm at 500-m resolution (

  </a>). It is currently recognized as the best Arctic Ocean Digital Bathymetric Model available. We downloaded and clipped the dataset to our region of interest and removed land data before undertaking statistical analysis of depths close to glacier fronts.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Buffers extending from the marine-terminating glacier fronts (at their positions ca. 2000) were created at 5- and 20-km radii (fig. S3). The mean bathymetry within the 20-km buffer for all 300 glaciers is 166 m of which 40 glaciers have mean bathymetry deeper than 400 m. Within 5 km of all glacier fronts, the mean bathymetry is 90 m, and 11 glaciers have a mean bathymetry deeper than 400 m within 5 km of their fronts. Of the 117 glaciers with ≥10 ocean temperature measurements within 20 km, 36 have a mean depth deeper than 400 m (mean, 477 m). When all glaciers are separated by 1° latitudes, the mean depths within 20 km are shallower than 400 m in all latitudinal degree bands, and within 5 km, mean depths are shallower than 200 m.</p>
