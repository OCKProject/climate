 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Near-surface (2 m) air temperature data are available from weather stations operated by Environment Canada from 1948 to the present (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://climate.weather.gc.ca" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://climate.weather.gc.ca</span>/). There are six weather stations located throughout the CAA (locations shown in 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>), and although some are situated at a considerable distance from the marine-terminating glaciers in this study, the records provide a useful indication of long-term temperature trends in the wider region. Temperature measurements are available at the following weather stations in the QEI: Eureka (1947–2014), Resolute (1947–2014), and Grise Fiord (1984–2007); and in BBI: Pond Inlet (1975–2007), Cape Hooper (1957–2007), and Cape Dyer (1959–1993). Mean summer air temperatures, for the months of June to August (JJA), were calculated from monthly mean temperatures derived from daily averages. Annual anomalies in mean summer temperatures were calculated relative to the mean temperature across the complete time period available for each weather station (fig. S8).
