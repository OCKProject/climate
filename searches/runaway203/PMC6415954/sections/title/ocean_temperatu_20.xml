 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regional modeled mean ocean temperatures were mapped in ArcMap using TOPAZ4 gridded data for the region surrounding the CAA and west Greenland (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig 3</a>). Ocean temperature analysis close to glacier fronts was carried out using in situ data from the WOD13 within the buffers at 20- and 5-km radii from each glacier front (fig. S3). In total, 117 glaciers have ≥10 CTD measurements within 20 km of their fronts, and 19 glaciers have ≥5 CTD measurements within 5 km of their fronts. Measurements within both radii have similar mean temperatures at each depth (fig. S4). Glaciers with ocean measurements within 20 km provided a wide-ranging sample for statistical analysis. Our investigations of glacier front change and ocean temperature correlations include glacier relative change value bins and mean ocean temperatures at each depth (glacier counts are shown in table S3). Spatiotemporal trends are based on WOD13 ocean temperature data within the 100-km buffer zone (
