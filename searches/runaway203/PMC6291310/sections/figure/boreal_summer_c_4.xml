  <div class="title">Boreal summer climate response to ice sheet albedo as a function of ocean-atmosphere coupling.</div>
  <p>Rainfall (
   <span class="bold">A</span> to 
   <span class="bold">C</span>) and surface temperature (
   <span class="bold">D</span> to 
   <span class="bold">F</span>) change during July-August-September (JAS) simulated by CESM1 in response to ice sheet albedo. Surface wind stress changes (vectors) (D to F) are June-July-August (JJA) to highlight their role initiating the cooling of the Arabian Sea. Climate responses under varying degrees of ocean-atmosphere coupling are shown. Left to right: CESM1 with fixed SSTs, with a mixed-layer ocean model, and with a fully interactive ocean model.
