 <div class="title">Walker circulation response to LGM boundary conditions.</div>
 <p>Changes in vertical velocity (ω) over the equatorial Indo-Pacific simulated by CESM1 in response to the following changes in boundary conditions at the LGM: (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) sea level effects over the Maritime Continent, (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) lowered GHGs, and (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) full LGM effects combined. Contours are annual mean ω simulated in the preindustrial control experiment. Vertical velocity values are averaged over the 10°S to 10°N latitude band. Contour intervals are 5 hPa day
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Note that the color scale is not linear.
