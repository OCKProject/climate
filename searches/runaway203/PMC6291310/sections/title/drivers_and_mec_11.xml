 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulations and quantitative proxy-model agreement show that the full LGM response is dominated by the combined effect of sea level and ice sheet albedo. These two drivers explain most of the large-scale features seen in the proxies, including the wetter/drier dipole along the equatorial IO and the drier conditions in the central IPWP, northern Australia, India, and southeastern Asia. The combined response (IS
  <sub>albedo</sub> + SL
  <sub>MC</sub>) also shows the highest pattern correlation (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.50, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) with the SST proxies (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>), which is higher than the correlation with the response to sea level alone, attesting to the enhanced improvement by inclusion of the ice sheet albedo response. Over the deep tropics, the hydroclimate changes are dominated by changes in the Walker circulation, which shows a massive weakening of its ascending branch over the Maritime Continent accompanied by increased ascending motion over the western IO (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3C</a>). The spatial patterns of the IS
  <sub>albedo</sub> + SL
  <sub>MC</sub> response are nearly identical to that of the full LGM response; however, the full LGM conditions result in lower κ and pattern correlation values (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>) because the exclusion of the GHG forcing artificially enhances the agreement of the model with the proxies. While statistically significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05), our 
  <span class="italic">r</span> and κ metrics of proxy-model agreement show rather low values, particularly for the full LGM response. This indicates that only a small fraction of the proxy pattern variance is explained by our simulations. However, we note multiple cases where nearby proxy sites show lack of agreement, for example, in the eastern IO, where the magnitude of the cooling estimated by Mg/Ca and

  <span class="italic">r</span> values could also be indicative of proxy uncertainties, in addition to model uncertainties. Two robust patterns in the hydrological proxies, the muted changes in Sumatra and New Guinea, are not captured by our model, suggesting obvious model deficiencies there. Nevertheless, our conclusion that shelf exposure and ice sheet albedo are the main drivers of the LGM climate is not sensitive to these issues, stressing the importance of multiproxy approaches to studying past climate changes.
