 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings have important implications for understanding mechanisms driving tropical climate change. First, the LGM test case demonstrates that IO dynamics amplify external perturbations through the Bjerknes feedback, resulting in marked large-scale hydroclimate changes extending over one-third of the global tropics, from eastern Africa, across the entire Maritime Continent, to the western Pacific. This positive feedback loop was first proposed by Bjerknes (

  </a>) to explain the growth of El Niño events. A similar mechanism has been hypothesized to control the response of the Pacific Ocean to external forcings (

   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>). However, proxies, observations, and models are inconclusive regarding Bjerknes amplification of past or future climate changes in the Pacific (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>). In contrast, here we present robust evidence that coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions can amplify externally forced climate changes in the IO—an ocean that is generally considered to play a passive role in tropical climate change. While there is no future analog for shelf exposure, the mechanisms uncovered here are directly relevant for projecting changes in the IPWP in response to greenhouse warming. Our simulations and proxy reconstructions show that small wind perturbations driven by shelf exposure are amplified by changes in the ocean through changes in the east-west SST gradient. The dynamics of this externally forced response are potentially unique to the IO and indicate that this ocean is capable of amplifying small asymmetries introduced by any external forcing, for instance, as hypothesized in response to greenhouse warming (

  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>). This result also revises the long-standing belief that IPWP climate is mainly forced by the tropical Pacific (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>) and supports the emerging view that the IO can behave autonomously on multidecadal and longer time scales (

   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>), with important implications for regional hydroclimate prediction.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, our results reveal important new details on monsoon dynamics. Previous studies have argued that monsoon weakening during glacial periods is simply the terrestrial manifestation of global shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in response to NH cooling (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). Climate models consistently show that the ITCZ shifts south when the NH cools, as a compensation for the alteration in energy balance (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>). Our simulations show that albedo cooling of the NH does shift the ITCZ in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific (fig. S9D), but this response requires thermal (or full) air-sea coupling. The monsoonal retreat, in contrast, occurs in the absence of air-sea coupling and without an ITCZ shift (fig. S9C), demonstrating that these responses obey distinct mechanisms. We posit that albedo cooling is also communicated to the tropics by land-atmosphere processes operating over Africa and Asia. Cold, dry air generated over the LIS is advected around the NH and mixed equatorward, inhibiting convection during the seasonal advance of the NH monsoons. This part of the response is consistent with the ventilation mechanism, proposed as a limit for the poleward extent of the monsoons (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ventilation mechanism has been proposed to explain weakening of the African and North American monsoons in response to hemispheric cooling (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>), two monsoon systems that are not topographically insulated from mid-latitude air. The Indian monsoon, in contrast, is insulated by the Himalayas (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>), explaining the more muted drying over India in the absence of air-sea coupling (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5A</a> and fig. S9C). Enhanced glacial cooling of the Arabian Sea is thus the critical link between albedo cooling of the NH and the rainfall reductions over India. This cooling is tied to glacial ventilation, which causes warming of the Arabian Peninsula, establishing an anomalous thermal gradient relative to the Arabian Sea. This gradient drives stronger southwesterly winds increasing the evaporative cooling over the Arabian Sea. The colder SSTs reduce moisture transport into the core monsoon region—a thermodynamic effect that dominates over the dynamic effect of increased southwesterly flow. This mechanism allows glacial ventilation to “bypass” the insulating effect of the Himalayas and cause widespread drying over India. This mechanism could also explain drying over India during other intervals characterized by NH cooling. Previous studies have found a robust link between Arabian Sea cooling and India drying (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>), but the ultimate link to high-latitude cooling remains unclear. Monsoon ventilation and its effect on Arabian Sea surface temperatures could provide that link. Proxy evidence for monsoon ventilation could help establish this link; however, we anticipate that the evidence for land surface warming would be challenging to detect due to its seasonality and the cooling effect of other glacial forcings.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study firmly establishes that ocean-atmosphere interactions play a central role in shaping externally forced responses in IPWP hydroclimate. We also show the importance of shelf exposure and ice sheet albedo relative to other glacial boundary conditions. Ice sheets should therefore be considered alongside orbital (precessional) forcing as a major driver of Late Quaternary climate change in the tropics. However, as we focused on a time period with a similar orbital configuration to today (the LGM), we cannot assess the relative importance of orbital versus glacial (ice sheet–related) forcings during the Pleistocene. Our results demonstrate that patterns of cooling (and arguably patterns of warming) play a first-order role in the response of tropical rainfall to external forcings. Furthermore, our finding of an active climatological Bjerknes feedback in the IO deserves further attention in the context of climate prediction, since this feedback could be activated by anthropogenic forcings. Likewise, the emerging importance of ventilation as a control knob on monsoon intensity is directly relevant to how we understand and predict future rainfall in seasonally arid lands. The LGM still therefore offers us important lessons about Earth’s climate system, despite the fact that we are heading toward a warmer, and not cooler, world.</p>
