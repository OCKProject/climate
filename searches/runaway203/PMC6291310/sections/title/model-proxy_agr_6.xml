 <p>Maximum Cohen’s κ (left) and pattern correlation coefficient (right) for each climate response simulated by CESM1. Cohen’s κ quantifies agreement between simulated patterns of rainfall change and a multiproxy synthesis of hydroclimate change at the LGM. The maximum κ value obtained from the threshold sensitivity analysis is reported. The correlation coefficient (
  <span class="italic">r</span>) quantifies agreement between simulated patterns of SST change and our reconstruction of LGM temperature changes derived from Mg/Ca and

  <span class="italic">r</span> value of one indicates perfect model-proxy agreement. A value of zero indicates lack of agreement. Solid circles indicate statistically significant (

  <span class="italic">r</span> values. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals for the κ values. Uncertainty due to calibration of SST proxies is reported as the minimum-maximum range of the

  <span class="italic">r</span> values computed using the ensemble mean reconstruction is also shown (gray error bars). Further details on the computation of these proxy-model agreement estimators, as well as the definition of the climate responses, are provided in the Supplementary Materials.
