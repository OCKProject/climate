 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulation using all LGM boundary conditions combined shows drying of the central IPWP, northern Australia, India, and southeastern Asia, and wetter conditions over the western IO (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>). These patterns closely resemble the rainfall-sensitive paleorecords, which also show a dipole of a drier IPWP center and a wetter coastal equatorial Africa, in addition to drying over Asia and inland equatorial Africa (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>, symbols). Our model also simulates an altered zonal SST gradient along the IO, with enhanced cooling in the east and subdued cooling in the west (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>), a pattern evident in the SST proxy data (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1B</a>, circles). Likewise, both the model simulation and the proxy data show enhanced cooling over the Arabian Sea, where several records show cooling in excess of 4 K. The simulated patterns show statistically significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) agreement with the proxy data, with a maximum Cohen’s κ = 0.28 for hydroclimate and a pattern correlation 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.34 for SST, suggesting that CESM1 provides a realistic representation of the glacial climate state of the Indo-Pacific. Hereafter, we unravel the mechanisms driving the distinct spatial patterns seen in the proxy data, assessing proxy-model agreement with select single-forcing simulations.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To isolate the impact of lowered sea level on IPWP glacial climate, we focus on the SL
   <sub>MC</sub> response, which captures the effect of lower LGM sea level over the Maritime Continent (exposure of the Sunda and Sahul shelves, altered Indonesian throughflow passages, and tidal mixing) but holds GHGs and ice sheet extent at preindustrial conditions (see the Supplementary Materials for details). These sea level effects explain many patterns of hydroclimate change at the LGM inferred from our proxy network, including the large-scale drying over the Maritime Continent and northern Australia, as well as the wetter conditions over equatorial East Africa (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>). These rainfall changes are accompanied by colder SSTs over the eastern IO and warmer SSTs over the western IO (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>, shading), also evident in the proxy data after removing the mean IO cooling (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>, circles). The simulated dipole of drier/wetter conditions across the equatorial IO reflects a greatly weakened Walker circulation in the IO, with increased ascending motion and convection in the western IO and reduced ascending motion and convection over the eastern IO and the Maritime Continent (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These changes represent a marked departure from the modern Walker circulation, albeit not a complete reversal of the large-scale overturning over the IO. The changes in SST are a critical part of this response, as the warmer western IO becomes more favorable for ascending motion—and deep convection—while the colder eastern IO favors subsiding motion and drying. This SST dipole drives anomalous easterly winds along the equator (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>, vectors), which drive the ocean into a state that also represents a major departure from modern conditions. The equatorial thermocline, which is uniformly deep across the modern equatorial IO, responds to the easterly winds, establishing a large-scale east-west tilt with shoaling of more than 15 m over the eastern side of the basin (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>, contours). In addition, the easterly winds drive equatorial upwelling (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>, shading), also in contrast to the present-day climate, in which upwelling is restricted off the coast of Sumatra. These two processes act to cool the eastern IO, reinforcing the SST gradient and the easterly winds, consistent with a positive feedback loop akin to the Bjerknes feedback (
   <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
    <span class="italic">11</span>
   </a>). This feedback is excited by an atmospheric response to exposure of the Sahul shelf, with drying and anomalous subsidence over the shelf and anomalous easterly winds over the eastern IO. These wind changes shoal the thermocline in the east, initiating the cooling (
   <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
    <span class="italic">12</span>
   </a>). In addition, anomalous westward currents advect the climatological temperature gradient (warmer in the east, less warm in the west), effectively warming the western IO and establishing the characteristic SST dipole seen in the simulations and proxy data.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is significant proxy-model agreement between SL
   <sub>MC</sub> and both hydroclimate and SSTs (κ
   <sub>max</sub> = 0.26 and 
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.38), indicating that lowered sea level during the LGM relative to modern conditions is responsible for key features of the proxy patterns (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). Among the sea level boundary conditions, exposure of both the Sahul and Sunda shelves is the main driver of these responses, as shown by the superior agreement with both the hydroclimate (κ
   <sub>max</sub> = 0.26; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>) and the SST (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>) proxies. Exposure of the Sunda shelf explains drying over Borneo, Sumatra, and Thailand, while the Sahul shelf explains the drying over New Guinea and northern Australia and wetter equatorial East Africa (fig. S2). Statistically significant κ values occur for a limited range of thresholds used to categorize the model changes into drier, unchanged, or wetter LGM (fig. S3), suggesting that each shelf in isolation cannot explain data. Proxy-inferred SST changes are best explained by exposure of both shelves combined (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>), with Sahul dominating the agreement, a result that demonstrates that this shelf is most effective at exciting the Bjerknes feedback (
   <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
    <span class="italic">12</span>
   </a>). Further inclusion of GHG and orbital forcing does not change the agreement for hydroclimate (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>) and degrades the agreement with SSTs (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>). Together, these results demonstrate that shelf exposure and Bjerknes amplification best explain the proxy-inferred hydrological changes over the IO and Maritime Continent.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Response to GHGs</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We followed the same approach to determine whether lower GHGs could explain any part of the patterns seen in the proxy data. Here, we use our single-forcing simulation that reduces GHG concentrations to LGM levels but holds ice extent and sea level effects at preindustrial values. The associated response shows wetter conditions over the Maritime Continent and drying over the western IO and equatorial East Africa (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>, shading). GHG forcing also drives drying in inland East Africa, explaining the proxy-inferred patterns over that region. The simulated wetter conditions over the Maritime Continent are not supported by the proxies (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>, circles), resulting in low model-proxy agreement (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). Reduced GHGs drive a tropical mean cooling of −1.9 K and produce an SST pattern that is largely the opposite of the sea level response, with a warmer eastern IO (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2E</a>, shading) and anomalous westerlies along the IO (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2E</a>, vectors). Accordingly, the pattern correlation with the SST proxy data is negative but not significant at the 1σ level (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.13, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &gt; 0.33; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>). Together, these changes are consistent with stronger ascending motion over the IPWP center (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3B</a>), anomalous westerly winds along the equatorial IO (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2E</a>, vectors), suppression of equatorial upwelling (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2F</a>, contours). These responses also indicate Bjerknes amplification, as in the sea level case, but with circulation and SST gradient changes in the opposite direction, hence the lack of proxy-model agreement (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Response to ice sheets</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We isolate the response to ice sheets (topography and albedo) using single-forcing simulations that change only these aspects. Additional simulations allowed us to isolate the responses to ice sheet albedo (IS
   <sub>albedo</sub>) and topography (IS
   <sub>topo</sub>). The IS
   <sub>albedo</sub> response shows that the higher albedo of the LGM ice sheets causes dry conditions over the northern IPWP, India, and southeastern Asia, a key feature of the proxy-inferred patterns that cannot be explained by shelf exposure (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2G</a>). Ice sheet albedo drives SST changes with enhanced cooling in the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and South China Sea (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2H</a>). These changes lead to a significant pattern correlation with the SST proxies (

   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>), which show pronounced glacial cooling in these areas (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2H</a>, circles). The changes in response to ice sheet topography are generally opposite and weaker over the IPWP domain, confirming the preeminence of ice sheet albedo as a driver of glacial changes in IPWP climate (see section S7.1 for full details on the responses to albedo and topography and their nonlinear interactions).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Glacial response of the Indian monsoon</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further explore the mechanisms by which the Northern Hemisphere (NH) ice sheets influence IPWP climate, we performed a hierarchy of simulations with varying degrees of ocean-atmosphere coupling. The hierarchy consists of uncoupled (atmosphere only), thermally coupled (atmosphere coupled through heat fluxes to a mixed layer ocean), and fully coupled simulations. All uncoupled simulations were run with SSTs from the preindustrial control (see section S7.1 for further details). All three types of simulations show a large-scale weakening of the Afro-Asian summer monsoon system with drying stretching from the Sahel to northwest India (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, top, and also fig. S9). The fact that widespread continental drying occurs in the uncoupled case (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5A</a> and also fig. S9C) indicates that SST changes do not play a role in linking ice sheet cooling with the large-scale monsoon weakening. We characterize this large-scale response as a monsoonal retreat, with the exception of south India, which shows increased rainfall in the uncoupled case (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5A</a>). Inclusion of air-sea coupling causes drying over south India (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, B and C), suggesting that SST changes play a role on this regional aspect of the response. The large-scale pattern of drying from Africa to central Asia can be attributed to enhanced “ventilation” of mid-latitude air as follows. Cold and dry air generated over the Laurentide ice sheet (LIS) is advected by the westerly winds around the NH, particularly over northern Africa and central Asia. This air is mixed equatorward, making the environment less conducive to deep convection. This limits the summertime advance of the monsoon rain belts seen as reductions in summertime rainfall (see section S7.1 for further details).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The retreat of the monsoon rainbelts leads to reductions in cloud cover and relative humidity, causing massive changes in the energy balance of the land surface (fig. S10). Increased radiation and decreased evaporative cooling cause pronounced warming over a swath of land stretching from the Sahel to northwest India (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, bottom, and fig. S9, top). This warming results in a large land-sea temperature contrast between the Arabian Peninsula and the Arabian Sea that drives anomalous southwesterly winds along the shore (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, bottom, vectors). These wind changes are present in the uncoupled case (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5D</a>), showing that they are directly driven by the large-scale monsoonal retreat. Thermal air-sea coupling plays a key role in enhancing the land-sea temperature contrast, as the increased wind speed cools the ocean surface over the Arabian Sea (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5E</a>). Interactive ocean dynamics do not change the pattern and amplitude of this response (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5F</a>), demonstrating that evaporative cooling is the essential mechanism cooling the Arabian Sea. Furthermore, this response explains the drying over the core Indian monsoon region (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>, B and C), especially in southern India, confirming that cooling of the Arabian Sea is the key feedback contributing to the glacial drying over India. Note that this thermodynamic effect overwhelms the effect of stronger winds, which would otherwise increase rainfall, as seen in the uncoupled response (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulations and quantitative proxy-model agreement show that the full LGM response is dominated by the combined effect of sea level and ice sheet albedo. These two drivers explain most of the large-scale features seen in the proxies, including the wetter/drier dipole along the equatorial IO and the drier conditions in the central IPWP, northern Australia, India, and southeastern Asia. The combined response (IS
   <sub>albedo</sub> + SL
   <sub>MC</sub>) also shows the highest pattern correlation (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.50, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05) with the SST proxies (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a>), which is higher than the correlation with the response to sea level alone, attesting to the enhanced improvement by inclusion of the ice sheet albedo response. Over the deep tropics, the hydroclimate changes are dominated by changes in the Walker circulation, which shows a massive weakening of its ascending branch over the Maritime Continent accompanied by increased ascending motion over the western IO (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3C</a>). The spatial patterns of the IS
   <sub>albedo</sub> + SL
   <sub>MC</sub> response are nearly identical to that of the full LGM response; however, the full LGM conditions result in lower κ and pattern correlation values (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>) because the exclusion of the GHG forcing artificially enhances the agreement of the model with the proxies. While statistically significant (
   <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.05), our 
   <span class="italic">r</span> and κ metrics of proxy-model agreement show rather low values, particularly for the full LGM response.
