  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of each glacial forcing and associated mechanisms was assessed by quantifying the agreement between the simulated changes with two multiproxy reconstructions. We assessed agreement between simulated rainfall responses (
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>) against the updated version of our synthesis of LGM hydroclimate described in section S1. As this reconstruction is categorical, we estimated the model-proxy agreement using the weighted Cohen’s κ statistic, following previous work (
   <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
    <span class="italic">10</span>
   </a>). Cohen’s κ ranged from κ = 1, if a simulated pattern is in complete agreement with the proxies, to κ = 0, if the agreement could be expected entirely by chance. The weighted Cohen’s κ uses a weight matrix that penalizes models for a total miss (e.g., drier when it should be wetter) more than a near miss or partial agreement (e.g., drier when it should be no change). A weight of 0.5 is given to these cases. We explored the sensitivity of the κ values by varying the thresholds of rainfall, over which we placed the model output into the same categories of change assigned to the proxies. We consider that the model-proxy agreement is robust when 2σ statistically significant κ values are obtained for large range of dry-wet thresholds used to categorize the model simulated changes. The maximum Cohen’s κ values for each climate response are reported in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also assessed the agreement between simulated SST changes and a new compilation of LGM temperature anomalies across the IPWP derived from sedimentary alkenone, Mg/Ca, and δ
   <span class="sup">18</span>O data. As this reconstruction is quantitative, we simply calculated the pattern correlation between proxy and simulated values at the core sites. We applied different temperature calibrations to the alkenone and Mg/Ca data to explore the sensitivity of the model-proxy agreement to calibration choice. Most calibrations show the highest significant correlations with the simulated SST changes in response to either full sea level boundary conditions or sea level plus ice sheet albedo (fig. S5). The minimum-maximum range of 
   <span class="italic">r</span> values computed from this distribution of SST reconstruction is reported as uncertainty of the pattern correlation. Further details are available in sections S2 and S6.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used CESM1 (
   <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
    <span class="italic">38</span>
   </a>), a model that simulates realistic IPWP climate and is sensitive to changes in the configuration of land masses over the Maritime Continent (
   <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
    <span class="italic">12</span>
   </a>)—a response that is important for simulating glacial climates (
   <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
    <span class="italic">10</span>
   </a>). CESM1 consists of coupled general circulation models of the atmosphere and ocean, as well as sea ice and land models. Other components of the Earth system, such as the carbon cycle and marine ecosystems, can also be simulated using CESM1; however, we kept them inactive because our focus here is on the climate response to glacial boundary conditions. The climate at the LGM was simulated by prescribing the following boundary conditions: (i) reduced GHG concentrations, (ii) insolation changes due to the orbital configuration at 21 ka, (iii) orography changes due to ice sheets and corresponding roughness length, (iv) surface albedo changes due to ice sheets, and (v) changes in the land-sea distribution and altitude due to lower sea level. A simulation of preindustrial climate was used as control. A series of simulations forced with individual glacial boundary conditions, also known as “single forcing” runs, were used to isolate the climate responses to different glacial drivers. The climate responses and single forcing simulations used to compute them are listed in 
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>. Full details on the implementation of the LGM boundary conditions and the single forcing simulations are available in the Supplementary Materials.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ensemble was augmented by simulations in which the CESM1 atmosphere and land models (CAM5 and CLM4) were coupled to ocean models of varying complexity. These simulations allowed us to explore the importance of ocean-atmosphere coupling in response to ice sheets. First, we replaced the fully dynamical ocean (POP2) with a model of the ocean mixed layer. In this model, the effect of vertical mixing, entrainment, and horizontal currents is prescribed as a seasonally varying heat source or Q-flux. Changes in SSTs computed by this “slab” ocean model can only be influenced by energy exchanges with the atmosphere, such as changes in evaporation or clouds. In the second case, the ocean model consists of climatological SSTs and sea ice extent from the preindustrial control. In this configuration, the air-sea heat fluxes are computed but cannot change the prescribed climatological SST and sea ice extent. Therefore, climate changes simulated in this configuration are due to “uncoupled” atmosphere or land changes. “Thermally coupled” and uncoupled responses were computed from each configuration as in the full-coupled cases by differencing the simulations as specified in
