 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Let us consider the evolutionary scale 
  <span class="italic">in natura</span> that formed our own genetic and metabolic profile.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span> Natural selection could theoretically lead to the realization of evolutionary stable state (ESS) as a genetic composition supporting long-term fitness under a moderately fluctuating environment.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span> Such a condition for modern 
  <span class="italic">homo sapiens</span> can be traced anatomically to roughly 300,000 years ago,
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span> preceded by the adaptation of basic metabolic systems to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle over several million years, until the recent shift to agrarian life. Lifestyle and dietary modification supported by agriculture and consequent environmental change in Anthropocene have generated the complexity of food production on which various scientific disciplines are currently divided (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to integrate the relevant disciplines to resolve the diet-health-environment trilemma, sciences that support sustainable food production should incorporate the original cause as an interface: that is, the abrupt change of the food culture condition from 
  <span class="italic">in natura</span> to 
  <span class="italic">in cultura</span> with agriculture. We should then consider how such a macroscopic condition has led to the diversification of microscopic symptoms as observed in public health and environmental problems, where each discipline struggles without necessarily having reference to others.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> (b1–b3) shows how the 
  <span class="italic">in natura-in cultura</span> distinction could serve as an interface to explain the diet-health-environment trilemma, specifically, as a balance model of food variables with respect to evolutionary stable state (ESS) incorporating the hidden reef model in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> (a1–a3). In (b1–b3), the 
  <span class="italic">x</span>-axis represents the quantity of food variables per unit of food item divided by the physiological or environmental requirement (nutritive contents, environmental effects of the production, etc.). In the case of nutrients, the value of concentration on the 
  <span class="italic">x</span>-axis corresponds to the nutritive content per unit of food weight, which coincides with the multiplication of nutrient density by energy density commonly used in dietary guidelines.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span> The 
  <span class="italic">y</span>-axis shows the quantity of actual food intake, such as food weight. In (b1), all food variables and intake quantity are normalized to the green circle representing the 
  <span class="italic">in natura</span> ESS as the standard point on the nutrition need curve 
  <span class="italic">x</span> × 
  <span class="italic">y</span> = Constant, where the constant is the nutrition profile in natural state. Conversion to an 
  <span class="italic">in cultura</span> environment represented in (b2, b3) will diversify the parameters of each food variable (red circles), which affects the net physiological requirement of an individual organism (upper shift of blue line above the green circle). The required intake level (
  <span class="italic">y</span>-value) of the red circles is set to meet the demand in terms of the green circle, while that of the blue line represents the consequent response of an individual organism.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a typical example of malnutrition, micronutrient deficiency (left shifts of red circles in b2) in high-calorie food (right shift of red circle in b3) that leads to overeating (upper shift of blue line) is depicted. Red-shaded areas in (b2) and (b3) represent the amounts of micronutrient deficiency and excess calorie intake, respectively. This upper shift of the blue line is adaptive in two senses: one, animals tend to eat more food than necessary when it is abundant, and two, low micronutrient content necessitates increased intake to meet nutritional needs. The evolution of human feeding behavior in the ecological context also supports the diet choice for energy-dense and palatable food.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span> As an example of a food composition study associated with health risk, the values of the 
  <span class="italic">x</span>- and 
  <span class="italic">y</span>-axis of the red circles correspond to the “reef” while the degree of deviation of the blue line from 
  <span class="italic">in natura</span> ESS (green circle) is another expression of the “sea surface”. The key idea here is that the same 
  <span class="italic">x</span>- and 
  <span class="italic">y</span>-values of a nutrient can change their meaning for individual health between the appropriate dose of intake and deficiency/excess, according to the position of the blue line.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of representing the environmental load of farming with red circles in (b2, b3), 
  <span class="italic">in cultura</span> sufficiency, deficiency, and excess should read necessary, reduced, and excess load, respectively. The left shift (b2) can produce more food with less environmental impact than hunting-gathering, while the right shift (b3) imposes a higher rate of ecosystem degradation per unit of food. The blue line in this case corresponds to increased agricultural yield. Examples of the food variables and 
  <span class="italic">in cultura</span> responses are given in Supplementary Material 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Setting the intake balance of ESS as the ecological optimum 
  <span class="italic">in natura</span>, the 
  <span class="italic">in cultura</span> deviation can be expressed as both deficiency and excess of food variables, leading to a total increase of health risk and overload to the environment. The necessary and sufficient conditions for both human and environmental health may reside in the reintroduction of the 
  <span class="italic">in natura</span> state to primary food production, thus sustaining the ESS of our metabolism in the augmented diversity of ecosystems.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span> Such an approach to primary food production is compatible with the net positive impact approach to biodiversity,
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> which could conceivably be introduced to the world’s smallholders for a bottom-up resolution of the health-diet-environment trilemma.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between human and ecosystem health is schematized in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2(c)</a>, providing reference to the modes of agricultural production and consequent health benefits and risks. Historically, the development of farming systems toward a physiological optimum of monoculture methods achieved higher longevity and amelioration of basic nutrition status (upper right cyan arrow) while simultaneously producing an imbalance in micronutrient profiles and calories in foods as the risk factors of non-communicable diseases and the serious loss of regulation services in farming and surrounding ecosystems (lower right red arrow). The ecological optimum solution, which increases the functioning of the ecosystem through human introduction of biodiversity in the natural development of plant communities for food production, indicates the potential to synergistically contribute to human and ecosystem health (upper left green arrow). It generates diverse functional complementarity and synergy in multiple-scale adaptation processes ranging over the physiology of each organism and the ecology of self-organized communities.
