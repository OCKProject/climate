      <p>Observed and projected climate warming is strongest in the Arctic regions, peaking
         in autumn/winter. Attempts to explain this feature have focused primarily on identifying
         the associated climate feedbacks, particularly the ice-albedo and lapse-rate feedbacks.
         Here we use a state-of-the-art global climate model in idealized seasonal forcing
         simulations to show that Arctic warming (especially in winter) and sea ice decline
         are particularly sensitive to radiative forcing in spring, during which the energy
         is effectively ‘absorbed’ by the ocean (through sea ice melt and ocean warming, amplified
         by the ice-albedo feedback) and consequently released to the lower atmosphere in autumn
         and winter, mainly along the sea ice periphery. In contrast, winter radiative forcing
         causes a more uniform response centered over the Arctic Ocean. This finding suggests
         that intermodel differences in simulated Arctic (winter) warming can to a considerable
         degree be attributed to model uncertainties in Arctic radiative fluxes, which peak
         in summer.
