      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the global climate model EC-Earth V2.3
         <a>9</a> (one of the CMIP5 models) to assess the mechanisms relating seasonally-varying radiative
         forcing to Arctic warming and sea ice retreat. EC-Earth V2.3 includes the following
         components: atmosphere, ECMWF’s Integrated Forecast System (IFS cycle 31r1), resolution
         T159L62, including HTESSEL as land surface module; ocean, NEMO V2, resolution 1 deg.;
         sea ice, LIM2, resolution 1 deg; all coupled through the OASIS3 coupler
         <a>9</a>. The performance of EC-Earth in terms of its simulation of the present-day climate
         is satisfactory, even though parts of the (sub) Arctic have too high winter temperatures,
         especially the continental regions of Siberia and Canada, while the central Arctic
         is somewhat too cold. We carried out 44-year simulations for perpetual year 2006 climate
         forcing (the model is in equilibrium for year 2006 radiative forcing), in which we
         added an artificial (or ‘ghost’) additional downward longwave radiative forcing of
         30 W m
         <span>−2</span> to the surface of the entire Arctic region north of 70 °N (we chose a relatively
         strong radiative forcing to obtain a climate response larger than the interannual
         variability yet small enough to avoid possible nonlinear effects becoming dominant;
         we additionally carried out simulations with smaller/larger forcing, and concluded
         that the first-order average Arctic response roughly linearly depends on the magnitude
         of the forcing); the forcing was applied in each season separately over the entire
         length of the simulation (hence each year). Thus, in total we performed 5 simulations:
         4 simulations with additional forcing in winter (December-January-February, DJF),
         spring (March-April-May, MAM), summer (June-July-August, JJA) and autumn (September-October-November,
         SON), respectively, and a control simulation without additional forcing. Note that
         the seasonal forcing of 30 W m
         <span>−2</span> translates to an annual forcing of 7.5 W m
         <span>−2</span>, comparable to the RCP8.5 radiative forcing (but applied here only to the Arctic).
         The seasonal longwave forcing of 30 W m
         <span>−2</span> corresponds to 15, 10, 13 and 17% of the modelled climatological (of the control
         run) downward longwave radiation in DJF, MAM, JJA and SON, respectively. The results
         in 
         <a>Figs 2</a>, 
         <a>3</a> and 
         <a>4</a> represent the differences between the additional forcing simulations and the control
         simulation over the final 30 years of the simulations (over which the residual trend
         is small). In this way the contributions of the feedbacks (for seasonally constant
         forcing) and of the (seasonally varying) radiative forcing on the seasonal climate
         response can effectively be separated. Obviously, the applied ghost forcing is a simplified
         representation of real radiative forcings, but previous studies
         <a>22</a><a>28</a> have shown that this method nonetheless provides important insights into the primary
         response of the climate system. Note that the 30-year average climate state representing
         the year 2006 forcing (the control simulation) is used as a climatology to compare
         our sensitivity simulations to.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A possible caveat in our simulations is the absence of a transition zone in which
         the 30 Wm
         <span>−2</span> forcing gradually reduces to zero, both spatial (at 70°N) and temporal (at the beginning
         and ending of seasons), rather than instantaneous. Even though such a ‘soft’ transition
         (instead of the ‘hard’ one used here) probably affects the details of the response
         (e.g. atmospheric dynamics), it is unlikely to have a considerable effect on the overall
         (i.e. Arctic mean) temperature response. Hence, we do not expect the first-order results
         to be sensitive to minor changes at the edges. Our ‘hard transition’ forcing has the
         advantage that results are easy to interpret, moreover this simple forcing is also
         easy to apply (in other studies), and therefore facilitates intercomparison of results.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most uncertain issues in terms of a longwave radiation response concerns
         the role of clouds. Among CMIP5 models, Arctic cloud cover varies significantly. Also,
         most CMIP5 models exhibit biases in especially Arctic cloud phase, with excessive
         cloud ice and insufficient cloud water content
         <a>11</a><a>29</a>. This leads to an overestimate of surface cooling in winter and spring, too strong
         surface inversions and biases in TOA radiative fluxes. EC-Earth V2.3 has a single
         prognostic variable for cloud condensate mass with a temperature-driven partitioning
         between cloud liquid and solid mass, and also generally underestimates cloud liquid
         mass in the Arctic. This deficiency may affect the climate response resulting from
         enhanced radiative forcing.
