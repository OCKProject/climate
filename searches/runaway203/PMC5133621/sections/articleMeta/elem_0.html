         <p>Observed and projected climate warming is strongest in the Arctic regions, peaking
            in autumn/winter. Attempts to explain this feature have focused primarily on identifying
            the associated climate feedbacks, particularly the ice-albedo and lapse-rate feedbacks.
            Here we use a state-of-the-art global climate model in idealized seasonal forcing
            simulations to show that Arctic warming (especially in winter) and sea ice decline
            are particularly sensitive to radiative forcing in spring, during which the energy
            is effectively ‘absorbed’ by the ocean (through sea ice melt and ocean warming, amplified
            by the ice-albedo feedback) and consequently released to the lower atmosphere in autumn
            and winter, mainly along the sea ice periphery. In contrast, winter radiative forcing
            causes a more uniform response centered over the Arctic Ocean. This finding suggests
            that intermodel differences in simulated Arctic (winter) warming can to a considerable
            degree be attributed to model uncertainties in Arctic radiative fluxes, which peak
            in summer.
