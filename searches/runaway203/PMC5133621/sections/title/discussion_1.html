      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because Arctic radiative forcing peaks in spring/summer, it contributes strongly to
         Arctic winter and annual warming, especially in the peripheral sea ice regions where,
         according to our climate model simulations, spring forcing even dominates winter warming
         through seasonal storage and release of energy in the Arctic Ocean. To understand
         Arctic warming and its huge seasonal cycle, as well as related processes (such as
         sea ice decline and precipitation increases
         <a>14</a>) it is therefore imperative to study not only the governing feedbacks but also assess
         the impact of seasonally-varying radiative forcing. This also implies that an accurate
         representation of changes in the seasonality of radiative forcing (which are dominated
         by clouds
         <a>11</a>, see Methods) is crucial to correctly project both the magnitude and the pattern
         of future Arctic warming. Uncertainties in Arctic radiative fluxes (which peak in
         summer
         <a>11</a>) mainly affect Arctic winter and annual warming
         <a>10</a>, meaning that not only uncertain Arctic feedbacks but also the (spring and summer)
         radiative forcing contribute to the intermodel spread in Arctic climate change
         <a>13</a>. Current changes in the Arctic climate peak in Autumn (in particular November). With
         ongoing Arctic warming and further reductions in sea ice, the changes will probably
         become more winter centered, with peak warming shifting towards the winter (see 
         <a>Fig. 1b</a>), similar to the response simulated here (which represent an ‘artificial’ future
         warming relative to the present-day state).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ongoing sea-ice decline is expected to spark human activities in the Arctic (e.g.,
         shipping, fishery, mining, tourism), which will lead to increased emissions of radiatively-active
         constituents
         <a>15</a><a>26</a>, such as soot
         <a>27</a>, especially in summer (also soot originating from summertime sub-Arctic fires will
         enter the Arctic
         <a>27</a>). By lowering the sea-ice albedo
         <a>15</a>, the additional soot may induce a net radiative surface forcing during summer. The
         seasonal timing of anthopogenic radiative forcing (in whatever form) is most powerful
         when it occurs in seasons when the surface is climatologically gaining energy (spring
         and summer), so future anthropogenic emissions peaking in summer may reinforce Arctic
         (winter) warming and sea ice retreat.
