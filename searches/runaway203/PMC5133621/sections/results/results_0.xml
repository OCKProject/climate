 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we use a state-of-the-art global climate model (EC-Earth
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>, see Methods) in idealized climate (‘ghost’) forcing simulations to quantify the effect of seasonality in radiative forcing on the magnitude and pattern of seasonal Arctic warming. To infer the climate response throughout the year resulting from forcings in different seasons, an artificial longwave radiative forcing was applied to the surface for each season separately (see Methods). While the future climate response in near-surface temperature is maximum in winter (DJF, see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>), the seasonal forcing simulations suggest that the forcing season causing the strongest annual temperature response is spring (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>), and to a somewhat lesser degree summer. Interestingly, the spring and summer forcing combined contribute about 40% to the total wintertime temperature response. Even more surprising, summer forcing causes a much larger response in autumn and winter than in summer itself. In contrast, winter forcing is important for the wintertime response, but hardly for other seasons. The winter response is thus to a large degree governed by non-winter forcing, mainly through storage/release of ocean energy and associated feedbacks and possibly through changing atmospheric circulation. This clearly demonstrates that the near-surface Arctic temperature response to any climate forcing depends greatly on the season in which the forcing occurs, with the spring season being most effective. The only viable mechanism to invoke a surface air temperature response in seasons other than the forcing season relates to ocean storage and release of energy, which in turn is strongly modulated by sea ice (thickness) changes
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" href="#b5">5</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concurrent response in Arctic sea ice cover clearly peaks for spring and summer forcing (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Spring forcing causes maximum sea ice decline in all other seasons, including the winter (even more than for winter forcing itself). This is due to the ice-albedo feedback amplifying the sea-ice retreat over the summer months
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>: the extra energy in spring thins the sea ice and/or creates melt ponds, lowering the surface albedo and allowing spring and summer insolation to more effectively warm the surface (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>) and melt away sea ice
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. In fact, reflected solar radiation in the Arctic peaks in spring, when both sea ice cover and insolation are relatively high, meaning that any change in spring sea ice has a profound effect on absorbed solar radiation. The ice-albedo feedback thus strongly amplifies the response only if the forcing occurs in the season in which the seasonal ice-albedo feedback is mainly active (spring/summer) and the additional energy is used to melt ice. This leads to enhanced absorption of shortwave radiation of the surface (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>), increased sea surface temperatures, earlier onset of melt and an associated decline in sea ice cover. This amplified response for spring forcing is effectively carried over to subsequent seasons by storage of heat in the open Arctic Ocean, likely amplified by water vapour and cloud feedbacks
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>, leading to delayed freeze-up and thinner sea ice. The autumn sea ice response is indeed most pronounced for spring radiative forcing, which corresponds very well with observations-based correlations between enhanced incoming longwave radiation in spring and reduced autumn sea ice extent
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since sea ice effectively regulates the ocean-atmosphere energy exchange by acting as a lid, the total air-sea flux changes also exhibit a pronounced seasonal cycle (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b</a>). In summer, nearly all additional longwave forcing is used to either melt sea ice or warm the upper Arctic ocean; this energy thus hardly contributes to warming of the lower atmosphere in this season, but it is instead stored and subsequently released in autumn/winter (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b</a>). A considerable part of the upward energy flux used to warm the lower atmosphere during autumn/winter originates from spring/summer forcing (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). In contrast, a large portion of the additional energy is immediately returned to warm the lower atmosphere (and is partly lost to space) in case of autumn and winter surface forcing. Additionally, the limited impact of winter forcing on the response in other seasons can be attributed to the negative feedback between ice growth and ice thickness, meaning that ice thickness anomalies following a winter forcing will effectively decay in subsequent seasons. An extra downward forcing is thus most effective when the climatological net surface forcing is already downward (in late spring and summer, see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b</a>), so that the additional energy is predominantly used to warm the ocean and melt sea ice. In the winter months, the energy from the relatively mild and ice-depleted ocean surface is more easily radiated upward and thereby warms the overlying atmosphere (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b</a>). The stable stratification of the wintertime Arctic boundary layer reinforces warming of the near-surface atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seasonally varying response as shown in (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>) is purely the result of internal climate mechanisms since the magnitude of the applied radiative forcing was similar in all seasons. However, anthropogenic greenhouse forcing in the Arctic exhibits a pronounced seasonal cycle, peaking in late spring and summer
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>, which can be attributed mainly to the vertical distributions of temperature, water vapour and clouds, as well as to the temperature dependence of the emission/absorption characteristics of greenhouse gases. Intrusions of relatively warm and humid air from lower latitudes also lead to positive anomalies in moisture content and cloud amount, which especially in spring cause a considerable longwave forcing at the surface that contributes to enhanced sea ice melt later in the year
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. Moreover, internal climate feedbacks, for instance those related to sea ice retreat and the associated enhanced surface evaporation and cloud formation, may lead to climate forcings that exhibit strong seasonal variations. In any case, the climate radiative forcing tends to peak in the seasons during which the Arctic system is most sensitive to additional forcing. With spring sensitivity being about 50% higher than in winter (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>), the impact of enhanced spring/summer forcing on the annual temperature response reinforces the response from internal climate mechanisms alone, increasing the seasonality of the temperature response (maximum in winter) as well as the magnitude of the annual response. The seasonality of Arctic surface radiative forcing thus exerts a comparatively strong impact on annual mean Arctic warming (compared to the hypothetical situation in which the forcing were seasonally invariant).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the Arctic Ocean, the ‘transfer’ of energy from one season to the other through storage and release of energy (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b</a>) is obviously most effective in the sea-ice retreat regions, since these are the locations where a strong increase in upward energy flux can occur, heating the lower atmosphere in autumn/winter. Therefore, the effect of spring forcing on the surface temperature response in winter peaks in the sea ice retreat regions (the periphery of the Arctic region), especially in the Barents Sea (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). Remarkably, in these regions the winter temperature response due to spring forcing is even larger than that due to winter forcing itself. In contrast, winter forcing causes a somewhat more uniform response (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4b</a>) centered over the Arctic. Being effectively decoupled from the Arctic Ocean by sea ice, the direct winter forcing is mainly used to warm the (low thermal inertia) stably stratified lower atmosphere. Also, winter forcing yields a much larger surface air temperature response over the subarctic continents compared to spring forcing. Spring/summer forcing evidently exhibits a different geographical imprint compared to winter forcing in terms of the wintertime temperature response (and thereby the annual response, since this is governed by winter warming).
