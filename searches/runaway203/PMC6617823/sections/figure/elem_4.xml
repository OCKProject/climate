Red and blue contours are positive and negative 700 hPa geopotential height anomalies (m) drawn every 2 m. Black contours show the 0 m anomalies. Rainfall anomalies (mm/day) are shaded. Only anomalies above |1| mm/day that are significant at the 95% level according to a two‐tailed Student's

(c) Hovmüller (longitude–time) diagram of 850 hPa unfiltered meridional wind (v) and cold cloud streaks axes (black lines) averaged between 5°N and 15°N for the period July 1–August 15, 2001. Colored shading shows v at 2 m/s intervals; northerly winds are gold to red and southerly winds are green to blue. White lines are objectively computed positive meridional wind streaks used to identify AEWs. Cold cloud streaks have
