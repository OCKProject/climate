 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RECENT CHANGES IN RAINFALL CHARACTERISTICS</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observations show 1984 to be the driest year on record in the Sahel. Seasonal rainfall totals trended upwards since then (Dai et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0033">2004</a>), mesoscale disturbances have been more extensive and intense (Bell &amp; Lamb, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0005">2006</a>), and vegetation cover has increased over the same period (Dardel et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0034">2014</a>). Thus, the literature refers to the latest decades as a period of recovery for the Sahel (Nicholson, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0098">2005</a>). Farmers on the ground, on the other hand, have questioned whether this is a return to past conditions; instead, they have emphasized changes in the characteristics of the rainy season (its intermittency, variability, and prevalence of intense events) and enduring challenges for agriculture (Tambo &amp; Abdoulaye, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0134" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0134">2012</a>; West, Roncoli, &amp; Ouattara, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0149">2008</a>). A growing literature based on daily gauge data and high‐resolution satellite estimates is beginning to corroborate anecdotal accounts and on‐the‐ground experiences of increasing extreme and erratic rainfall.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The assessment of trends in the characteristics of rainfall is complicated by the quality of the observations and by the intrinsic noisiness of the record (especially for extreme events). Using satellite‐based rainfall data sets over the western Sahel for the period 1998–2013, Odoulami and Akinsanola (
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0102">2017</a>) show no regionally coherent significant trends in the intensity of extreme rainfall and a weak (and spatially incoherent) trend toward less‐frequent intense rainfall, even as total rainfall and rainfall frequency trend toward wetter conditions. Yet, Salack, Saley, Lawson, Zabré, and Daku (
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0118">2018</a>) show that, taken together, 72 gauge records for the western Sahel do show an increase in the 99th percentile daily rainfall threshold and that in the most recent decade extreme rainfall is more extreme than it was in the early 1960s. Gridded indices of 95th percentile rainfall suggest the same conclusions (Sanogo et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0119">2015</a>). Giannini et al. (
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0048">2013</a>) and Lodoun et al. (
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0088">2013</a>) analyzed the trends in rainfall from gauges in Burkina Faso and Senegal and found that in the decades of rainfall “recovery” the mean intensity of daily rainfall exhibited the steadiest trend and a dominant role in the recovery, above changes in rain frequency. Sarr, Zoromé, Seidou, Bryant, and Gachon (
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0120" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0120">2013</a>) objectively identified from station data in Senegal the switch from drying to wetting in the mid 1980s and showed that in the second part of the record the trend in rain frequency is not as strongly positive as the trend in rainfall intensity; at the same time they did not detect any signal in indices of extreme rainfall.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A balanced assessment of the recent changes in the character of the rainy season in West Africa is given by the careful study of Panthou, Vischel, and Lebel (
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0105">2014</a>), who looked at 43 stations in Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger. When epochal means in intense rainfall (above the 40‐mm threshold) occurrences were compared directly, the station network showed no coherent change, with half the stations indicating an increase in frequency of occurrence and half indicating a decrease. But when the noisiness of the data was reduced by using appropriate statistics for extreme distributions and by considering trends in total rainfall accumulation, they were able to show that the proportion of annual rainfall associated with extreme rainfall has increased from 17% in 1970–1990 to 19% in 1991–2000, to 21% in 2001–2010. In their words: “This tends to support the idea that a more extreme climate has been observed over 2001‐2010: this climate is drier in the sense of a persisting deficit of rainfall occurrence compared to 1950‐1969, while at the same time there is an increased probability of extreme daily rainfall.” The same sentiment is expressed by Salack, Giannini, Diakhaté, Gaye, and Muller (
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0117" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0117">2013</a>), who compared the timing and frequency of dry spells within the rainy season of West Africa and concluded that recent years have experienced seasonal rainfall amount close to normal, but were more susceptible to extreme dry spells that would cause false starts and early cessation of the cropping season.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A different approach was taken by Taylor et al. (
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0135" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0135">2017</a>). Their study does not look at rainfall directly, but uses Infra‐Red satellite images to identify storms. This has the advantage of providing a complete and homogeneous dataset that covers all of Africa for the period 1982–2016 and allows them to identify robust trends. They find that, over the Sahel, the most extreme storms tripled over that time and that their contribution to the seasonal rainfall has grown from 15% to above 20%, consistent with the gauge‐based estimates reported above.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between storms and environmental variables suggests that the observed intensification of storms follows from the intensification of the shallow circulation and the AEJ. Increase flow of mid‐level warm air and dry air act to suppress moderate convection, but once MCSs get triggered the same flow acts to intensify them via enhanced CAPE and evaporative downdraughts. A stronger jet also leads to more intense MCSs, as it provides the shear to organize convection and, possibly, to increase triggering and intensification of convection by AEWs. These mechanisms are all directly linked to a warming Sahara, and as such have been portrayed as a possible sign of anthropogenic influence on the characteristics of storms, but formal attribution has not been achieved yet.</p>
