 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explain tropical influences on Sahel rainfall variability, it is useful to emphasize that the Sahel is a zonally‐confined rainy region, that is, to emphasize the distinction from the ITCZ without necessarily emphasizing the specific geography of the region. The essential process is that strong convection is happening elsewhere in the tropics and the Sahel feels its effect (see schematic in Figure 
  <a rid="wcc591-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#wcc591-fig-0003">3</a>). The key elements of the teleconnection mechanism are (a) moist convection links surface temperature (more accurately, surface moist energy) to the free troposphere temperature and (b) the tropics can sustain only weak temperature gradients. Where convection happens frequently, the environment comes to be in statistical equilibrium with it: convection dissipates any new Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), updrafts from the boundary layer homogenize the atmospheric column, and the final result is that the temperature of the troposphere is close to moist neutrality. With a weak Coriolis effect, the tropics cannot support pressure gradients away from the surface, and thus their free‐troposphere temperature must be homogeneous at time scales longer than those of atmospheric waves. Putting these two constraints together requires that the temperature profile of the tropics be that of the moist adiabat corresponding to the precipitation‐weighted average of the tropical surface temperature (Flannaghan et al.,

The Sahel is represented as a lesser area of convection. The two regions are connected via the free troposphere, where temperature anomalies are quickly homogenized by transport</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We recognize the effect of this mechanism in the response of the Sahel to ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) variability (Giannini, Biasutti, Held, &amp; Sobel, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0047">2008</a>; Rowell, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0115">2001</a>): During an El Niño, the Warm Pool rainfall extends further into the warmer water, the entire tropical troposphere warms up, and the warm upper‐level anomalies increase the atmospheric stability over the Sahel region, thus dampening rain‐producing moist convection and causing drought. The same mechanism applies more widely than in the ENSO case—and in particular it ought to apply to the global warming case (Giannini, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0046">2010</a>; Giannini et al., 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0047">2008</a>): If the tropical oceans warm, the tropical atmosphere will switch to a warmer moist adiabat. And because warmer moist adiabats are also more stable, the Sahel will experience an upped ante for convection (Chou &amp; Neelin, 
  <a rid="wcc591-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#wcc591-bib-0026">2004</a>).
