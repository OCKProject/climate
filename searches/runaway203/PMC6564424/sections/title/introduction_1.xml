 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Avian breeding success is determined by many variables such as parental effort, food availability, parasites, predation and nest characteristics [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref008">8</a>]. Of those, the importance of nest characteristics has been understudied, especially for species that breed in harsh climates such as in the Antarctic zone. Nevertheless, previous research indicates that nest parameters like nest orientation, exposure and insulation play an important role in providing a thermally favourable microclimate and protection against precipitation (e.g. rain or snow), enhancing overall breeding success [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref006">6</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref009">9</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref016">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A suboptimal nest microclimate can be caused by various factors, such as extreme nest temperatures and exposure to wind or precipitation [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref021">21</a>]. Suboptimal nest temperatures during incubation have been shown to have a negative impact on embryonic development [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref023">23</a>]. In addition, increased energetic demands of incubating parents due to a low nest temperature may lead to reduced parental attentiveness and therewith increased periodic cooling of the clutch or the constant maintenance of clutch temperature below the developmental optimum, which is detrimental for the embryonic development [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref024">24</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref029">29</a>]. Nest temperature may also affect chick growth and survival. For instance, low nest temperature has been shown to hamper the immune response of common yellowthroat (
  <span class="italic">Geothlypis trichas</span>) chicks [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref030">30</a>]. Also, suboptimal thermal nest conditions caused by a high nest temperature have been shown to retard chick growth in blue tits (
  <span class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</span>) and eastern kingbirds (
  <span class="italic">Tyrannus tyrannus</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref031">31</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref032">32</a>]. This highlights the importance of the thermal microclimate of the nest on breeding success.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thermal microclimate of the nest is particularly important for endothermic vertebrates in regions with harsh climatic conditions such as low temperatures, strong winds and snow cover in alpine, Arctic and Antarctic regions. For example, chicks of little auks (
  <span class="italic">Alle alle</span>) breeding in the High-Arctic, grew faster in nest chambers with a higher mean air temperature [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref033">33</a>]. In harsh polar habitats breeding is usually challenging and animals breeding in such circumstances exhibit various coping mechanims (reviewed by Martin and Wiebe [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref034">34</a>]). Adults and chicks of avian species breeding in polar regions have been shown to exhibit high metabolic rates or energy requirements compared to species breeding in temperate environments [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref035">35</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref038">38</a>]. Similarly, metabolic rates of Adélie penguin (
  <span class="italic">Pygoscelis adeliae</span>) chicks and blue-eyed shag (
  <span class="italic">Phalacrocorax atriceps</span>) chicks have been found to correlate negatively with ambient temperature [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref039">39</a>]. In addition to low temperatures, snowfall during the breeding season has been reported as a major cause of egg and chick mortality and reduced body condition of the incubating parents or the chick for several species breeding in alpine, Arctic or Antarctic environments [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref034">34</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref040">40</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref044">44</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under harsh conditions of extreme environments, the selection of a sheltered nest site and construction of insulating nest lining can greatly improve the microclimate in the nest, increasing nest temperature, reducing heat loss and the effects of snowfall [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref045">45</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref050">50</a>]. Indeed, several Arctic breeding shorebird species have been found to select thermally favourable nest sites, and especially smaller shorebird species invested in the construction of nest lining [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref049">49</a>]. For example, in the pectoral sandpiper (
  <span class="italic">Calidris melanotos</span>) breeding in the Arctic, thicker nest lining was associated with reduced heat loss of the clutch [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref046">46</a>]. In common eiders (
  <span class="italic">Somateria mollissima</span>) breeding on the Arctic tundra, sheltered nests in combination with higher ambient temperature reduced the incubation effort (in terms of body mass loss of the incubating parent) [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref020">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A burrow nesting seabird, the Wilson’s storm-petrel (
  <span class="italic">Oceanites oceanicus</span>), is an excellent model species to investigate the importance of nest characteristics in extreme environments. First of all, it is the smallest endotherm breeding in the Antarctic, and due to the unfavourable volume-surface ratio of such a small body, both parents and chicks are thought to experience extreme energetic demands to maintain a constant body temperature [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref035">35</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref051">51</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref052">52</a>]. In addition, breeding pairs have a maximum of one breeding attempt with a single egg per year, which increases their vulnerability to unfavourable conditions during the breeding season [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref053">53</a>]. Moreover, food sources are unpredictable and usually require the parents to perform long foraging trips, during which the egg may be neglected or the chick is not fed for up to four days [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref051">51</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref054">54</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref056">56</a>]. Hence, internal nest dimensions, nest micro-topography and nest insulation creating a thermally favourable nest burrow, are likely to greatly enhance the breeding success by reducing the costs of thermoregulation of Wilson’s storm-petrel parents and chicks, and to reduce the amount of egg cooling when the parents are absent. Furthermore, the nest burrows of the Wilson’s storm-petrel are prone to snow blocking (i.e. the nest entrance is completely blocked by snow), which can lead to breeding failure due starvation of the chick [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref043">43</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref053">53</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref057">57</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref059">59</a>]. Therefore, nest site micro-topography that reduces the chance of snow blocking is likely to increase breeding success.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we investigated the effect of nest parameters including internal nest dimensions, nest site micro-topography, (i.e. shelter provided by surrounding structures), and thermal properties of the nest burrow as well as with weather conditions on hatching success, chick survival, and chick growth rate in the Wilson’s storm-petrel. We first examined whether the thermal microclimate of the nest depends on the shelter provided by the nest burrow features (expressed by nest dimensions, entrance orientation and thermal insulation) and by the nest site micro-topography (expressed by exposure to the wind, terrain ruggedness and orientation of the nest site) in combination with weather conditions. Subsequently, we examined whether susceptibility of the nest to snow blocking depends on its micro-topography, i.e. nest orientation and nest exposure (expressed by size of the nest entrance, wind exposure and terrain ruggedness of the nest site) in combination with wind speed and wind direction, and the amount of snowfall. We expected that hatching success and chick growth would be affected by the nest parameters mainly through their influence on nest temperature. Since higher air temperature may slow down the cooling of the egg during the absence of the parent, and reduce thermoregulation costs of the incubating parent and developing chick, we hypothesized that higher nest air temperature would increase both hatching success and chick growth rate. We also expected that chick survival would be affected by nest parameters through a varying susceptibility to snow blocking, rather than through the nest air temperature. Based on that prediction, we further hypothesized that a higher risk of snow blocking of the nest would result in higher chick mortality.</p>
