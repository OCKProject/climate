 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We recorded coordinates of all the nests found in the two study seasons using a handheld GPS receiver (GPSMAP 64S, Garmin, USA, accuracy ± 3 m). For all the nests we recorded the snow blocking status (i.e. 1 = nest entrance was closed off by snow completely, 0 = nest entrance was open) during each nest check. To examine the shelter effect of the nest related to the nest size and its orientation, we measured three internal dimensions of nest chamber (in cm): depth (distance on the floor, from nest entrance to the centre of the nest floor), width (measured from the left centre point of the nest wall to the most distant opposite point of the chamber, crossing the nest cup), and height (measured from the centre of the nest floor to the opposite point of the nest ceiling, or the point where the temperature logger was attached) (

  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref067">67</a>]: we took photos of the nest entrance with a ruler placed in the same plane of the entrance, and ensured the camera was positioned perpendicular to this plane. Finally, we measured the entrance orientation with a conventional pocket transit compass (0–360, Brunton, USA, accuracy: ± 1°, added 10° to measurement, to account for magnetic declination), then converted degrees to cosines of the radians [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref068">68</a>] and classified as northern entrance orientation (from north = 1 to south = -1) or the sines of the radians and classified as the eastern entrance orientation (from east = 1 to west = -1) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To quantify the shelter provided by the surroundings, we calculated the terrain ruggedness index (TRI, the amount of elevation change m

  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref069">69</a>], the slope (meter elevation m

  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref070">70</a>]. To calculate these parameters, we used a digital elevation model based on an along-track, tri-stereo set of Pléiades 1A panchromatic images collected on 25 December 2012 (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales, Paris, France) and a set of six ground control points. The sampling resolution was 0.5 m (see [
  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref071">71</a>] for more details on the model). We set a search radius for the slope, aspect and TRI for 5 cells (2.5 m) corresponding to ~20 m
  <span class="sup">2</span> circular footprint area. We calculated the WEI with a wind fetch length of 1 km. Some nest locations were snow covered during the satellite image acquisitions (~10% of all nest locations), the TRI for these points may be unreliable and hence we excluded these locations from the analysis.
