 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the effect of weather conditions on the thermal microclimate in the nests, we measured air temperature, in °C, with a temperature probe (Vaisala, Finland, HMP155, accuracy: ± 0.2°C, range: -40 to 20°C, 2.0 m above ground level), wind speed, in m ∙ s
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, with an anemometer (Vector Instruments, UK, A100R, accuracy: ± 0.1 m ∙ s
  <span class="sup">-1</span> at 0–10 m ∙ s
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, 1% between 10–55 m ∙ s
  <span class="sup">-1</span> and 2% above 55 m ∙ s
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, 2.0 m above ground level) and wind direction, with an ultrasonic wind sensor (Gill Instruments, UK, WindSonic, accuracy: ± c2° at 12 m ∙ s
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, 2.5 m above ground level) and converted to the cosines of the radians: from north = 1 to south = -1 (hereafter northern wind direction,) or the sines of the radians: from east = 1 to west = -1 (hereafter eastern wind direction). We recorded weather conditions every 10 minutes, using an automated meteorological station (station and CR3000 data logger manufactured by Campbell Scientific, USA), situated in a flat, waterlogged area 100 m from the sea coast, and 1200 m from the furthest nest (

We recorded the presence of precipitation (1 = higher or equal to 0.1 mm, 0 = lower than 0.1 mm, using a Hellman manual standard rain gauge) and snow cover (1 = any snow cover, continuous or discontinuous, 0 = no snow cover) measured several meters from the automatic weather station, once a day at 9:00 AM local time.
