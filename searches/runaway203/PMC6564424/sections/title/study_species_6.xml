 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Wilsonâ€™s storm-petrel is a long-lived, small pelagic seabird that breeds in crevices in rock falls and among boulder scree along the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic coastline. Both parents share the incubation (~ 40 days) and chick rearing, (~ 60 days) [

  <a rid="pone.0217708.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref057">57</a>]. Chicks are usually fed 1.2 times per 24 h [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the breeding success and chick growth, we determined the breeding status (i.e. the presence or absence of an egg or a chick) and the current state of the chick (i.e. dead or alive). In addition, we measured wing length (measured with a calliper, accurate to 0.1 mm), and chick body mass (measured with an electronic scale, OHAUS, USA, accurate to 0.1 g) during nest controls performed every 3 days (weather permitting) (details on further calculations on chick growth are provided in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217708.s017" href="#pone.0217708.s017">S2 File</a>). In case of snow blocking the nest entrance (completely or partly), we did not extract the chick nor remove any snow. This was to avoid affecting the breeding success, for example due to accidently getting the chick wet, or damage the insulating properties of the snow cover. Instead, we postponed the chick measurements until the nest opening was naturally free of snow. We performed the study under the permission of the Polish National SCAR (to enter Special Antarctic Protected area no 128, and interfere of Antarctic fauna, no 6/2017 and 8/2017). Following European Union regulations EU regarding animal welfare and guidelines published by Animal Behaviour, the study did not require the agreement of the Animal Ethics Committee due to a minimal level of disturbance [
