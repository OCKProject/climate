 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine thermal characteristics of the nests during the breeding season in 2018, we attached temperature loggers (iButton DS1921Z-F5 and DS1922L, Maxim Integrated Products, Sunnyvale, CA, USA, with resolution 0.125°C and 0.5°C, respectively) to the ceiling of the nest chamber, just above the nest cup (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217708.g002" href="#pone.0217708.g002">Fig 2A</a>), with the use of poster sticky tabs. We attached the loggers only in the breeding season 2018 due to logistic reasons. The loggers recorded nest chamber air temperature (°C) every hour. If loggers fell off the ceiling or were accidentally detached during a nest check, we reattached them immediately and excluded invalid records due to logger detachment from further analysis. We measured inner nest air chamber temperature in 51 nests that were occupied at the start of the season. We removed loggers if the egg or chick died, or at the end of the season. A summary of logged air temperature in nests is provided in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess thermal insulation properties of the nest, we conducted a cooling experiment in 47 nests (with four repetitions per nest). The selected nests were distributed across the whole study area, and most variations of nest lining were equally represented (i.e. from bare rocks or gravel to moss-, grass- or seaweed-insulated). We placed a small (10 ml) glass bottle filled with hot water for 10–15 minutes on the nest chamber floor (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217708.g002" href="#pone.0217708.g002">Fig 2B</a>). After removing the bottle, we placed a temperature logger (iButton DS1921Z-F5, Maxim Integrated Products, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) on the nest floor to record the temperature of the floor (°C) every minute for a minimum duration of 20 min (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217708.g002" href="#pone.0217708.g002">Fig 2C</a>). However, we occasionally left the logger in the nest for up to 60 min due to logistic circumstances in the field (please see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217708.s016" href="#pone.0217708.s016">S1 File</a> for further calculations and a sensitivity analysis of different measurement durations).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the occupied nests, we performed experiments when the chick was at least 14 days old, to ensure we could safely take the chick out of the nest for the duration of the experiment. To protect the chick from the wind we put it in a cotton bird bag placed in a plastic container with wooden lid, ensuring sufficient air flow. Experiments were conducted during daylight hours.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We could not quantify nest lining properties, such as composition and weight, as this would have required the collection of all nest lining material in the nests. Since Wilson’s storm-petrel breeding pairs might return to the same nets burrow every breeding season, removal of the nest lining could have been detrimental for their breeding success in the next seasons.</p>
