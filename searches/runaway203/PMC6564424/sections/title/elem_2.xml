  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine thermal characteristics of the nests during the breeding season in 2018, we attached temperature loggers (iButton DS1921Z-F5 and DS1922L, Maxim Integrated Products, Sunnyvale, CA, USA, with resolution 0.125°C and 0.5°C, respectively) to the ceiling of the nest chamber, just above the nest cup (

We attached the loggers only in the breeding season 2018 due to logistic reasons. The loggers recorded nest chamber air temperature (°C) every hour. If loggers fell off the ceiling or were accidentally detached during a nest check, we reattached them immediately and excluded invalid records due to logger detachment from further analysis. We measured inner nest air chamber temperature in 51 nests that were occupied at the start of the season. We removed loggers if the egg or chick died, or at the end of the season. A summary of logged air temperature in nests is provided in

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess thermal insulation properties of the nest, we conducted a cooling experiment in 47 nests (with four repetitions per nest). The selected nests were distributed across the whole study area, and most variations of nest lining were equally represented (i.e. from bare rocks or gravel to moss-, grass- or seaweed-insulated). We placed a small (10 ml) glass bottle filled with hot water for 10–15 minutes on the nest chamber floor (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217708.g002" href="#pone.0217708.g002">Fig 2B</a>). After removing the bottle, we placed a temperature logger (iButton DS1921Z-F5, Maxim Integrated Products, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) on the nest floor to record the temperature of the floor (°C) every minute for a minimum duration of 20 min (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217708.g002" href="#pone.0217708.g002">Fig 2C</a>). However, we occasionally left the logger in the nest for up to 60 min due to logistic circumstances in the field (please see

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the occupied nests, we performed experiments when the chick was at least 14 days old, to ensure we could safely take the chick out of the nest for the duration of the experiment. To protect the chick from the wind we put it in a cotton bird bag placed in a plastic container with wooden lid, ensuring sufficient air flow. Experiments were conducted during daylight hours.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We could not quantify nest lining properties, such as composition and weight, as this would have required the collection of all nest lining material in the nests. Since Wilson’s storm-petrel breeding pairs might return to the same nets burrow every breeding season, removal of the nest lining could have been detrimental for their breeding success in the next seasons.</p>

Expecting the signal to be weak in our data set, but also aiming to minimize the risk of false positives, we selected VIF &lt; 5 as a threshold, which was enough to ensure a safe and flexible approach in regard to our data set [
   <a rid="pone.0217708.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref081">81</a>]. Subsequently, when VIF &gt; 5, we removed the variable from the model.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As some nests were sampled &gt;1 in one year or sampled in both years (i.e. we possibly repeatedly recorded the same breeding pairs), we corrected for pseudoreplication by treating the nest label (hereafter nest ID) as a random effect. We tested the significance of the random effect by a likelihood ratio test (using the 
   <span class="italic">anova</span> function [
   <a rid="pone.0217708.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref072">72</a>]), which compared the linear mixed effect model with a similar linear model without the nest ID as a random effect. Comparing the output of the model with and without random effects is a way to test for significance of random factors [
   <a rid="pone.0217708.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref082">82</a>]. To enable this comparison, we fit both models using maximum likelihood.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For small sample sizes, we obtained the significance of the parameters by bootstrapping the model fitting of the specific model, including all averaged parameters (1000 iterations). We analysed the snow blocking and breeding output of both breeding seasons combined, to increase the sample size and enhance the power of the model. Parameters were considered significant if p ≤ 0.050, and considered a trend when p ≤ 0.100.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analysed the effects of weather conditions and nest characteristics on nest air temperature, snow blocking, hatching success and chick survival following a stepwise approach. In step 1 we aimed to investigate how weather conditions affected the nest air temperature during the breeding season of 2018 and the probability of the nest being blocked by snow in the breeding season of 2017 and 2018. Therefore, we first modelled the nest air temperature with the corresponding weather conditions by fitting a linear mixed effect model, using the 
   <span class="italic">lmer</span> function from the 
   <span class="italic">lme4</span> package [
   <a rid="pone.0217708.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref083">83</a>] (model selection in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217708.s002" href="#pone.0217708.s002">S2 Table</a>). Since the interval between the nest temperature measurements was 60 min and the interval between each of the other measurements was 10 min, we matched the nest air temperature at a specific moment with the corresponding weather conditions with an accuracy of ± 5 min. The averaged models predicting nest air temperature included the following predictors: air temperature, northern and eastern wind direction and wind speed (model selection in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217708.s002" href="#pone.0217708.s002">S2 Table</a>). Similarly, we modelled the snow blocking status (1 = closed, 0 = open) with the mean environmental predictor variables calculated for the three days preceding the nest check and snow cover at the day of the nest check itself (model selection in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217708.s003" href="#pone.0217708.s003">S3 Table</a>), using the

   <a rid="pone.0217708.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref083">83</a>]. Even though data from two years were included in this model, we decided that year should not be added as a predictor to this model. Since we expected that inter-annual differences in snow blocking the nest entrance are most likely the result of differences in weather conditions, the model already accounts for inter-annual differences by just testing the effects of weather conditions. The averaged models predicting the probability of snow blocking included the following predictors: air temperature, wind speed, northern and eastern wind direction, snow cover and precipitation. In none of the models, interactions between terms were tested, because we would lose too many degrees of freedom. We added nest ID as a random factor to both models. We obtained the significance of the parameters from the model averaging output (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In step 2 we quantified the nest effect on nest air temperature in the 2018 (hereafter the thermal microclimate) and snow blocking in 2017 and 2018 (hereafter the susceptibility to snow blocking), corrected for weather conditions. To quantify the thermal microclimate, we fit a linear mixed effect model to predict nest air temperature with all meterological parameters obtained from the model averaging described in step 1 (model selection in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217708.s002" href="#pone.0217708.s002">S2 Table</a>) with nest ID as a random effect. From this model, we obtained the thermal microclimate as the conditional modes (i.e. best linear unbiased predictors [
   <a rid="pone.0217708.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref084">84</a>]) of the random nest ID effects, using the

   <a rid="pone.0217708.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref083">83</a>]. Simultaneously, we quantified the susceptibility to snow blocking as the conditional modes of the random nest ID effect from a binomial mixed effect model that predicted snow blocking of the nest. This model included all meteorological parameters obtained from the model averaging described in step 1 (model selection in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217708.s003" href="#pone.0217708.s003">S3 Table</a>) with nest ID as a random effect. In both models, the random nest ID effect was significant (p &lt; 0.001).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In step 3 we examined how nest orientation, exposure and insulation (see

We modelled the thermal microclimate with nest characteristics using a linear model, starting with a model that included all possible nest characteristics (model selection in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217708.s004" href="#pone.0217708.s004">S4 Table</a>). The parameters of the averaged models were: entrance size and northern nest entrance orientation, nest height, depth and width and insulation (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In step 4 we modelled each breeding parameter (hatching success and chick survival) in relation to the thermal microclimate and the susceptibility to snow blocking, as quantified in step 2, using the

   <a rid="pone.0217708.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217708.ref083">83</a>]. We included the breeding season in the model, to account for inter-annual differences. We considered hatching as successful (response variable = 1) if one egg hatched, and chick survival as successful (response variable = 1) if the hatched chick survived until fledging (i.e. when it reached the age of 50 days). We also investigated the relationship between the breeding parameters and the nest characteristics. To do so, we initially modelled each breeding output parameter (i.e. hatching success and chick survival) with the nest parameters that were associated with the thermal microclimate and snow blocking as obtained in step 3, and breeding season to account for inter-annual differences (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the relation between chick growth and the nest microclimate in both breeding seasons apart from the stepwise analyses described before. We modelled chick growth (i.e. the daily percentage body mass increase,

We calculated the means of the explanatory variables based on records collected during the seven days preceding the nest check, so in general these intervals overlapped. We standardized all numerical parameters. We could not include the mean air temperature and the interaction between breeding season and snow cover in the model, due to multicolinearity (
