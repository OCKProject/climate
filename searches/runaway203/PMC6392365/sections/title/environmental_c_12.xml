 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental conditions were different in RTS than in undisturbed tundra. RTS sampled on the same hillslopes were more collapsed and lower in elevation than undisturbed controls (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>a). Midsummer soil temperatures at I‐minus 1 were 2°C warmer in its young RTS than in other age categories; at both sites, the middle‐aged RTS were among the coolest (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>b). Soil available NH
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">+</span> at I‐minus 1 was six times higher in RTS than undisturbed (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>c), and available NO
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span> was three to five times higher in young versus undisturbed at both sites (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>d). Similar to other studies (Bonfils et al., 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0012">2012</a>; Lantz et al., 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0049">2009</a>), active layer depths were deeper in older RTS than in undisturbed (I‐minus 1, Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>e), but we excluded active layer depth from our analyses due to surface rubble in young RTS impeding probes from reaching the frozen layer. Percent soil moisture varied from 1.9% ± 0.3% at NE‐14 to 71% ± 3% at I‐minus 1 and was not associated with RTS age (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>f).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Percent cover showed RTS age effects common to both sites. Young RTS had more bare soil, middle‐aged RTS were dominated by tall deciduous shrubs, and older and control plots featured more evergreen shrubs and lichens (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>g). Sites showed local differences in cover and seed rain composition: NE‐14 had more evergreens, and I‐minus 1 had more sedges and forbs (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>g,h). Total seed rain was not different between sites, with dwarf birch and willow seed comprising about 10% (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>h). The largest shrubs, mainly willows and dwarf birch, were found in middle‐aged RTS at both sites and were on average nearly 0.5 m taller and wider than shrubs in other RTS age groups (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>i).
