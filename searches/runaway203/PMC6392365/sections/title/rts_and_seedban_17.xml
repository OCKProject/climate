 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We predicted seedling recruitment was higher in RTS than in surrounding undisturbed tundra and best in young RTS due to a newer seedbank and better conditions for germination and growth. We found in situ seedlings only in RTS; no seedlings were found in undisturbed tundra, lending support for our hypothesis. We found no evidence of a trade‚Äêoff between seedbank quantity and quality to support our second hypothesis. Age effects on in situ seedling counts and greenhouse germination trials demonstrate that the source of recruitment in some RTS is likely from the seedbank. Our results suggest that recent RTS can be potential hotspots of seedling recruitment and recruitment rates appear to be comparable to other types of tundra disturbance (Nystuen et al.,
