 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive potential of seedbanks to climate change</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seedbanks represent a naturally occurring genetic time capsule of a past world. The cold dry conditions of permafrost soils may be similar to artificial seedbanks in preserving seed longevity (Yashina et al., 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0089">2012</a>); however, it is largely unknown how old viable buried seed may be or to what extent it contributes to Arctic vegetation communities. Historically, the Arctic has transitioned from graminoid tundra to shrub tundra in response to changing climate patterns during the Late Glacial Maximum (Mann, Groves, Kunz, Reanier, &amp; Gaglioti, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0051">2013</a>; Naito &amp; Cairns, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0058">2011</a>), but it is not well understood whether new populations arising from long‐buried seed can adapt to rapid anthropogenic change. Successful germination of plants from putative ancient seedbanks (Yashina et al., 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0089">2012</a>) and genetic diversity comparisons of above‐ground populations to their seedbanks (Honnay, Bossuyt, Jacquemyn, Shimono, &amp; Uchiyama, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0044">2008</a>) suggest that species with long‐lived seed may have sufficient genetic resources to adapt to rapid change. Species producing short‐lived seed, on the other hand, may be at greater risk of extinction through genetic drift if external changes lead to habitat loss (Honnay et al., 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0044">2008</a>). Shrub expansion in disturbed permafrost soils may be especially critical for species that produce ephemeral seed, as they may rely more heavily on recruitment and establishment to maintain gene flow than species with persistent seed.

  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0024">2000</a>) and Siberia (Katamura, Fukuda, Bosikov, &amp; Desyatkin, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0048">2009</a>). It has been proposed that due to low rates of plant turnover in the Arctic, the plants we see today and their seedbanks are not very different genetically from historical populations, and that adaptation to future conditions may be dependent upon recruitment of new populations (McGraw, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0052">1993</a>). Our study found that thermal erosional disturbance may stimulate recruitment in an area of the world where the contribution of seedlings is considered infrequent.
