 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We looked at environmental variables that had to be omitted from relative importance analysis due to their high correlation with bare soil. Soil temperature was highly correlated with bare soil at I‐minus 1 (

  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.75) and was useful to understand recruitment dynamics at this site. When percent germination in the greenhouse was used to predict in situ seedling counts in linear regression, the model was significant, explaining 37% of the variance in seedling abundance at I‐minus 1 (
