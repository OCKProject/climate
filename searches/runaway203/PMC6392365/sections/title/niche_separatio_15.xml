 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Canonical correspondence plots suggest there may be less niche separation of species at the recruitment stage than during formation of seedbanks (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0006">6</a>a,b). In situ seedlings of most species were more abundant with bare soil and available nutrients common to young RTS (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0006">6</a>a). The full model explained half of the variation and was significant in MANOVA (Wilk's Lambda (

The model produced four correlation functions between five species and five environmental gradients, with most correlations explained in the first two axes (constrained eigenvalues: 0.621, 0.391, 0.287, and 0.148 for CCA1 through CCA4, respectively). Linear Combination (LC) scores of CCA 1 described a gradient of undisturbed and older RTS sites: greater shrub cover, less bare soil, lower soil temperatures, and less available nitrogen, where most birch seedlings were found. CCA2 described a gradient of open ground containing forb, graminoid, and dicot seedlings, less shrub cover, warmer soils, and more available nitrogen characteristic of young (“Y”) RTS plots and some heath characteristic of late‐succession and undisturbed control plots (“O” and “C,” respectively; Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0006">6</a>a). In posthoc univariate analysis, graminoid and forb seedlings were, respectively, associated with bare soil and available nitrogen, accounting for 21% and 14%, respectively, of model variance in ANOVA (
