 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test our hypothesis of the effects of RTS age on each of our dependent variables (in situ seedling counts, seedbank percent germination, and seeds m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>), we performed two‐way ANOVA using RTS age categories (four levels): young (Y), middle‐aged (M), old (O), and control (C); site (two levels): NE‐14 and I‐minus 1; and an RTS × site interaction. When the RTS by site interaction was significant, we used one‐way ANOVA to test RTS age effects for each site separately. We performed separate analyses on seedbanks for all species, and for birch + willow. Tukey's Honest Significant Difference test was performed posthoc where effects were significant in ANOVA (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importance of environmental variables on in situ seedling counts, seedbank percent germination, and seeds m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> was calculated using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) relative importance values for covariates in multiple linear regression models (Akaike, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0001">1992</a>). Because we had many explanatory variables, we considered this a more appropriate method than hierarchical models, because the contribution of any given variable is expressed as a cumulative value across all possible models. For percent germination and seeds m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, the number of observations was too small to evaluate all explanatory variables, and models were ranked using AIC adjusted for the small number of seedbank sample plots (AICc). Importance values were calculated as the cumulative AIC or AICc weight (0 ≤ ∑
  <span class="italic">ω
   <sub>i</sub>
  </span> ≤ 1; Burnham and Anderson, 2002) using a threshold of ≥0.55 for well‐supported variables (Spellman, Schneller, Mulder, &amp; Carlson, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0072">2015</a>). Environmental variables highly correlated with explanatory variables of interest (Pearson correlation coefficient 
  <span class="italic">r</span> ≥ 0.60) were omitted from relative importance models and investigated separately in linear regression. Covariates consisted of eleven continuous variables: percent cover of shrubs, forbs, graminoids, nonvascular plants, pteridophytes, litter, and bare soil; percent soil moisture, available NH
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">+</span> and NO
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span>; and seed rain m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. Count data were square root transformed using the Box–Cox power transformation (Box &amp; Cox, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0014">1964</a>) to meet assumptions of normal distribution. Distance (m) of each seedling/seedbank plot from its transect origin was tested as a random variable, but was insignificant (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.1) and omitted from analysis. Individual data points falling beyond upper and lower quartiles that influenced model coefficients were omitted as outliers (Quinn &amp; Keough, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0064">2002</a>). Due to site interactions on environmental variables, we ran separate relative importance analyses for each chronosequence site (I‐minus 1, NE‐14).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to visualize niche separation between species or plant functional types comprising in situ seedlings or soil seedbanks and their respective environmental gradients (Ter Braak, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0078">1986</a>). Count data were standardized to proportions per species or functional type by dividing each sample by its species total, to equalize the contributions of abundant and rare species (Noy‐Meir, Walker, &amp; Williams, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0060">1975</a>). For this analysis, birch and willow seedbanks were analyzed separately. Because we were interested in disturbance as well as environmental effects, sample plots were coded by RTS age class. Evergreen shrub cover was highly correlated with lichen cover (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.57) and combined with lichen as heath tundra (“Heath”) for this analysis. Wilk's Lambda (
  <span class="italic">λ</span>) was used to test model significance at 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05 after 1,000 permutations, and because this statistic is used to report variance not explained by the model, we reported the model effect size as 1 − 
  <span class="italic">λ</span>, and we reported the variation explained by constrained axes. Where canonical correspondence models were significant, we used ANOVA to determine significance between individual species and environmental variables, and the proportional variance each relationship contributed to the full model. All statistical tests were performed using R 3.4.3 (R Core Team, 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0065">2017</a>) with the following packages: agricolae (posthoc tests), MASS (ANOVA), MuMIn (variable importance in multiple regression models), and vegan (canonical correspondence analysis).
