 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our work suggests that shrub recruitment from seed in young RTS could be important in the development of the tall shrub communities we observed in older RTS. As with previous studies, our study has uncovered the importance of local variation in environmental characteristics as potential predictors of seedling success in the Arctic. Additional research of recruitment and thermal erosion at additional sites is needed, but our results suggest that due to opportunities for seed germination in nutrient‚Äêrich open ground and to potential sheltering effects, RTS may act as seedling nurseries that could benefit many Arctic species, especially those which do not produce persistent seed.</p>
