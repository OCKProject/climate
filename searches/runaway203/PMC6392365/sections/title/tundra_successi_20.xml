 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is unknown whether increasing frequency of thermal erosion will lead to different vegetation communities (Becker et al., 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0005">2016</a>; Wang et al., 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0086">2017</a>) or if the tall shrub thickets we see in RTS in the Toolik Lake area represent a mid‐successional stage of MAT recovery. Viereck (
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0085">1966</a>) states that the transition from tall deciduous shrub thickets to dwarf shrubs, and finally to MAT, is more likely to occur once moss layers are developed, as this allows lateral expansion of adventitious roots for species other than willow, and creates suitable moisture regimes for establishment of 
  <span class="italic">E. vaginatum </span>tussocks. Ages of the two oldest RTS we sampled estimated in a previous study were found to be widely different (30 years and 380 years, respectively; Table 
  <a rid="ece34882-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34882-tbl-0001">1</a>), but these differences are useful in understanding what might happen decades versus centuries after RTS formation. Average canopy height of the tallest shrubs we measured at the 30‐year‐old RTS was over 0.4 m taller than at the 380‐year‐old RTS (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>i). Interestingly, 3–4 centuries after disturbance, vegetation at the oldest RTS (at I‐minus 1) was more similar in height and composition to the undisturbed MAT control located on the opposite side of the lake at this chronosequence (Figures 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0002">2</a>d and 
  <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>g,i). This and previous studies of the area suggest that although disturbance type and severity may influence successional outcomes, tundra communities appear to be resilient (Bret‐Harte et al., 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0015">2013</a>; Vavrek et al., 
  <a rid="ece34882-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0083">1999</a>). Our observations at I‐minus 1 and NE‐14 suggest that tall shrub thickets may not represent a vegetation shift, but rather a mid‐successional phase, and that MAT may require several centuries to recover from RTS disturbance.
