  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We predicted seedling recruitment was higher in RTS than in surrounding undisturbed tundra and best in young RTS due to a newer seedbank and better conditions for germination and growth. We found in situ seedlings only in RTS; no seedlings were found in undisturbed tundra, lending support for our hypothesis. We found no evidence of a trade‐off between seedbank quantity and quality to support our second hypothesis. Age effects on in situ seedling counts and greenhouse germination trials demonstrate that the source of recruitment in some RTS is likely from the seedbank. Our results suggest that recent RTS can be potential hotspots of seedling recruitment and recruitment rates appear to be comparable to other types of tundra disturbance (Nystuen et al.,

   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0040">2011</a>). Our in situ seedling counts and seedbank viability were either negatively correlated with plant cover or had no association. We found bare soil to be a variable of high importance, likely because it integrates other variables of biological significance, including space for germination and warmer soils. We did not measure RTS sheltering effects but found warmer soil temperatures in young RTS plots, which tended to be more collapsed than undisturbed ground. Sheltered microsites may reduce exposure of seeds and seedlings to winds in the lee of the RTS headwall or buffer temperature extremes by trapping snow (Sturm et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0073">2001</a>), allowing rapid germination following snowmelt. Conversely, winter seedling mortality may be higher in sheltered depressions where seedling emergence is high (Graae et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0040">2011</a>; Venn &amp; Morgan, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0084">2009</a>); however, sites of high average recruitment may experience higher seedling turnover (Van Mantgem, Stephenson, &amp; Keeley, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0081">2006</a>). Although seedling niches may vary among species (Eriksson, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0030">2002</a>), our canonical correspondence analysis shows seedling abundance across species and plant functional types was greater in recently disturbed ground where soils are more likely to be bare, warmer, and more nutrient‐rich than late‐succession or undisturbed tundra.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increased thawing is predicted to change the nutrient balance of permafrost soils, resulting in vegetation shifts as tundra communities respond to increased nutrient availability (Becker et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0005">2016</a>; Gooseff et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0037">2009</a>; Wang et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0086">2017</a>). Fertilization studies in the Toolik Lake area demonstrated that nutrients stimulate deciduous shrub growth (Chapin, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0021">2005</a>), and when nutrient demands are met, shrub productivity becomes more sensitive to other limiting factors such as temperature and light availability (Shaver et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0071">2001</a>). In open, warm microsites with adequate nutrient supply, dwarf birch and willow recruits can be expected to overtop other species within a few years. Compared to our undisturbed controls, available NH

   <span class="sup">+</span> did not change in RTS soils of different disturbance age, possibly due to the effects of higher quality litter production in older shrub‐dominated RTS (Buckeridge, Zufelt, Chu, &amp; Grogan, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0017">2009</a>). Available NO

   <sub>3</sub>
   <span class="sup">−</span> levels within the first 1–2 decades at the middle‐aged RTS implies plants are taking up the available nutrient supply. The fact that we found cooler soils under the tallest and widest shrubs suggests the combined effects of leaf canopy shading and litterfall. These results agree in part with previous research that shrubs may affect ground temperatures differently in summer than in winter (Blok et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0011">2010</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seedbank characteristics</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of a trade‐off between seedbank size and viability over time in our results suggests these properties are independent. Seedbanks in open tundra environments are expected to form through entrapment of wind‐ and water‐dispersed seed (Alsos et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0003">2003</a>; Chambers, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0020">1995</a>) and from seed rain (Fox, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0033">1983</a>). Although we found RTS to be more collapsed than adjacent undisturbed areas, we found no evidence that RTS sites trapped more seed than the flatter ground of undisturbed tundra. RTS are destructive events, resulting in soil wasting and mixing of soil layers (Pizano et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0063">2014</a>), and may be composed of combinations of new seed rain and uncovered old seed (Ebersole, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0028">1989</a>; Gartner et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0035">1983</a>; McGraw et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0053">1991</a>). In partial support of Fox's (
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0033">1983</a>) prediction that seedbank size increases with plant productivity and seed rain, we found most seedbanks associated with plant cover, although seed rain showed no relationship to seedbank size. Our seedbanks ranged from 71 to 10,000 seeds m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> (untransformed count data) and were not different from seedbank sizes reported in studies from temperate and northern latitudes (Alsos et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0003">2003</a>; Cooper et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0023">2004</a>; Ebersole, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0028">1989</a>; Fox,

   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0080">1978</a>). The fate of Arctic seeds is therefore likely determined by the same interactive processes that form seedbanks at other latitudes (Chambers, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0020">1995</a>; Thompson, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0080">1978</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to sedge‐dominated seedbanks found in some Alaskan Arctic soils (Ebersole, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0028">1989</a>), the largest seedbanks we found were from NE‐14’s old RTS and undisturbed tundra and were primarily composed of dwarf birch (
   <span class="italic">Betula nana</span>) and evergreen species (mainly 
   <span class="italic">Vaccinium</span> spp. and 
   <span class="italic">Empetrum nigrum</span>). This may be in part due to our goal to sample relatively recent seed input at an average depth of 3 cm, compared to Ebersole's (
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0028">1989</a>) sampling at 10 cm depths, as the latter method likely resulted in greater numbers of buried seed. Dwarf birch seed is common throughout the Arctic, but is considered short‐lived compared to sedge species, many of which are known to survive burial (Ebersole, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0028">1989</a>). Because short‐lived seed may not be adequately represented in studies of soil seedbanks at deeper depths, we felt our sampling method was appropriate in order to understand the relationship of seedbanks to the tall shrub thickets we found in RTS.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Birch and willow seed accounted for over half of some seedbanks, but low percent germination along with higher decay of willow seed in our greenhouse trials suggests recruitment in the field may be lower. Seedbank studies of High Arctic populations (Cooper et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0023">2004</a>) suggest greenhouse trials may not reflect in situ recruitment; however, Low Arctic populations may not be as seed‐limited as High Arctic populations due to a longer growing season, likely resulting in greater production of viable seed. Ebersole (
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0028">1989</a>) found dwarf birch and willow are common colonizers of disturbed tundra in the Alaskan Low Arctic, and given that birch and willow produce large quantities of seed, in situ germination rates of 1%–6% could be sufficient for recruitment in suitable microsites. It has been estimated that as few as 6–38 seedlings, followed by clonal growth, is sufficient to establish existing populations of these species at the northern limits of their ranges (Alsos et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0002">2007</a>). Perhaps the best evidence that germination rates may be sufficient for shrub establishment in the Toolik Lake area is that the RTS we observed were filled with shrubs within a few decades.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We did not follow the fate of in situ seedlings over time, nor did we account for resprouting vegetative propagules in this analysis (Alsos et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0003">2003</a>). Evidence from temperate and boreal forest fires suggests that seedling counts of woody species are highest within the first 5 years of disturbance and that revegetation occurs within the first decade (Johnstone et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0047">2004</a>; Romme, Turner, Tuskan, &amp; Reed, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0066">2005</a>; Rydgren, Økland, &amp; Hestmark, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0068">2004</a>). Similarly, thermokarst revegetation can occur if exposed soils stabilize within a year after disturbance (Gooseff et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0037">2009</a>). Our results agree qualitatively with these, because we saw the most seedlings in the sites aged to within 1 decade old.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is unknown whether increasing frequency of thermal erosion will lead to different vegetation communities (Becker et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0005">2016</a>; Wang et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0086">2017</a>) or if the tall shrub thickets we see in RTS in the Toolik Lake area represent a mid‐successional stage of MAT recovery. Viereck (
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0085">1966</a>) states that the transition from tall deciduous shrub thickets to dwarf shrubs, and finally to MAT, is more likely to occur once moss layers are developed, as this allows lateral expansion of adventitious roots for species other than willow, and creates suitable moisture regimes for establishment of 
   <span class="italic">E. vaginatum </span>tussocks. Ages of the two oldest RTS we sampled estimated in a previous study were found to be widely different (30 years and 380 years, respectively; Table 
   <a rid="ece34882-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34882-tbl-0001">1</a>), but these differences are useful in understanding what might happen decades versus centuries after RTS formation. Average canopy height of the tallest shrubs we measured at the 30‐year‐old RTS was over 0.4 m taller than at the 380‐year‐old RTS (Figure 
   <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>i). Interestingly, 3–4 centuries after disturbance, vegetation at the oldest RTS (at I‐minus 1) was more similar in height and composition to the undisturbed MAT control located on the opposite side of the lake at this chronosequence (Figures 
   <a rid="ece34882-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0002">2</a>d and 
   <a rid="ece34882-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0004">4</a>g,i). This and previous studies of the area suggest that although disturbance type and severity may influence successional outcomes, tundra communities appear to be resilient (Bret‐Harte et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0015">2013</a>; Vavrek et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0083">1999</a>). Our observations at I‐minus 1 and NE‐14 suggest that tall shrub thickets may not represent a vegetation shift, but rather a mid‐successional phase, and that MAT may require several centuries to recover from RTS disturbance.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive potential of seedbanks to climate change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seedbanks represent a naturally occurring genetic time capsule of a past world. The cold dry conditions of permafrost soils may be similar to artificial seedbanks in preserving seed longevity (Yashina et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0089">2012</a>); however, it is largely unknown how old viable buried seed may be or to what extent it contributes to Arctic vegetation communities. Historically, the Arctic has transitioned from graminoid tundra to shrub tundra in response to changing climate patterns during the Late Glacial Maximum (Mann, Groves, Kunz, Reanier, &amp; Gaglioti, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0051">2013</a>; Naito &amp; Cairns, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0058">2011</a>), but it is not well understood whether new populations arising from long‐buried seed can adapt to rapid anthropogenic change. Successful germination of plants from putative ancient seedbanks (Yashina et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0089">2012</a>) and genetic diversity comparisons of above‐ground populations to their seedbanks (Honnay, Bossuyt, Jacquemyn, Shimono, &amp; Uchiyama, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0044">2008</a>) suggest that species with long‐lived seed may have sufficient genetic resources to adapt to rapid change. Species producing short‐lived seed, on the other hand, may be at greater risk of extinction through genetic drift if external changes lead to habitat loss (Honnay et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0044">2008</a>). Shrub expansion in disturbed permafrost soils may be especially critical for species that produce ephemeral seed, as they may rely more heavily on recruitment and establishment to maintain gene flow than species with persistent seed.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although it is likely that thermokarst failures are occurring with greater frequency now than in the past, lake sediments and charcoal deposits provide evidence of Late Holocene thermokarst activity 3,000–10,000 years ago in the Canadian Arctic (Dallimore, Schröder‐Adams, &amp; Dallimore, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0024">2000</a>) and Siberia (Katamura, Fukuda, Bosikov, &amp; Desyatkin, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0048">2009</a>). It has been proposed that due to low rates of plant turnover in the Arctic, the plants we see today and their seedbanks are not very different genetically from historical populations, and that adaptation to future conditions may be dependent upon recruitment of new populations (McGraw, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0052">1993</a>). Our study found that thermal erosional disturbance may stimulate recruitment in an area of the world where the contribution of seedlings is considered infrequent.
