  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area includes mainly moist acidic tussock tundra (MAT), with some areas of heath tundra and shrub tundra. MAT is the most widespread tundra type in the foothills of the Brooks Range, consisting of 
   <span class="italic">Eriophorum vaginatum</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Carex bigelowii</span> sedges intermixed with dwarf deciduous shrubs (predominantly 
   <span class="italic">Betula nana</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Salix pulchra</span>) and evergreen shrubs (predominantly 
   <span class="italic">Rhododendron tomentosum</span> Harmaja (
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0043">1991</a>) and 
   <span class="italic">Vaccinium vitis‐idaea</span>), herbaceous forbs, mosses (mainly in the genera 
   <span class="italic">Sphagnum, Hylocomium</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Aulocomnium</span>), and lichens (Bliss &amp; Matveyeva, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0010">1992</a>). Heath tundra is found on dry, rocky uplands, and consists of dwarf deciduous (mainly 
   <span class="italic">B. nana</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Vaccinium uliginosum</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Arctostaphylos alpina</span>) and evergreen shrubs (including 
   <span class="italic">Dryas integrifolia </span>and/or 
   <span class="italic">D. octopetala,</span>
   <span class="italic">V. vitis‐idaea, R. tomentosum</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Empetrum nigrum</span>), with lichens and some mosses. Shrub tundra consists of tall (&gt;0.5 m) thickets of deciduous woody species, including dwarf birch (
   <span class="italic">B. nana </span>and/or 
   <span class="italic">B. glandulosa</span>), shrub willows (
   <span class="italic">Salix </span>spp.), some herbaceous forbs and mosses, some pteridophytes (the only pteridophytes we found were horsetails, mainly 
   <span class="italic">Equisetum arvense</span>) and usually no lichens, normally occurring along water tracks, river gravel bars, and in thermokarst gullies and slumps. All are underlain by continuous permafrost (200 m average depth), with a shallow unfrozen layer that develops in summer (approximately 20–40 cm).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compared plant recruitment dynamics in undisturbed MAT to that in RTS of different ages around two small lakes (&lt;1 km across), designated as NE‐14 and I‐minus 1 (Figure 
   <a rid="ece34882-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0002">2</a>b–d; Pizano et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0063">2014</a>). The lakes are approximately 16 km apart on similar slope, aspect, elevation, and parent material. Soils surrounding the lakes are composed of thin peat layers over Itkillik phase II glacial till deposits (approximately 11.5 ka BP; Hamilton, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0042">2003</a>). We chose three RTS age categories at each site: Y = young (1–10 years old); M = middle‐aged (11–29 years old); and O = old (≥30 years old). These were compared with nearby undisturbed MAT at each site (coded as “C” for the undisturbed control condition outside the RTS) for a total of eight study areas, four per site. Age of control areas was undetermined, but they were likely not disturbed by thaw slump thermal erosion for more than 300 years (Pizano et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0063">2014</a>). Approximate RTS ages were determined by a previous study through woody shrub growth ring counts and/or radiocarbon dating of moss macrofossils at the organic–mineral soil interface (Pizano et al., 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0063">2014</a>). Where feasible, we made shrub ring counts from the same areas and found them to be similar (Table

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Site characterization and observational design</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In July 2012 and 2013, we quantified abiotic and biotic characteristics at each site. We chose the month of July in order to quantify site conditions at midsummer, when most seedlings have germinated, plant canopies are fully expanded, and ground is snow‐free. Abiotic characteristics included elevation and soil variables; biotic characteristics included vegetative cover and seedbank variables. Because we expected the greatest seedling recruitment to occur in the lower portion of the RTS where soil had stabilized, in each RTS age category we ran a single 50 m transect on the lower half of the RTS running upslope, with the transect origin (0–1 m) at the downslope end (Figure 
   <a rid="ece34882-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34882-fig-0002">2</a>e). Transects in undisturbed controls were located within 500 m of the nearest RTS transect. At each transect, we calculated mean elevation (m) and relative change in elevation (highest point ‐ lowest point) from GPS points to account for RTS depressions versus the flatter ground in undisturbed control locations.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measurements were made inside 1 × 1 m plots along each transect. We measured soil temperature, soil moisture, and active layer depth at 2.5 m intervals (20 plots per transect), plant cover and seedling counts at 5 m intervals (10 plots per transect), soil nutrients from resin bags (five bags per transect), seed rain traps (five traps per transect), and soil seedbanks (3–4 plots per transect). The locations of resin bag, seed rain, and seedbank plots from transect origin were chosen using a random number generator. Seedbank plots were in the same plots or ≤4 m from abiotic and cover measurements described above and thus represent a subsample of plant cover and in situ seedling plots. Active layer depth, soil temperatures, and soil moisture levels were averaged from three sample points measured inside each plot. Active layer depth was measured using a 1.5 m steel thaw probe driven into the ground until rock or ice was struck. To estimate midsummer soil conditions experienced by seedlings, soil temperature (°C) and percent soil moisture at 5 cm depth were measured using handheld probes. We made visual estimates of aerial percent cover of vascular plants, mosses, and lichens identified to genus or species in each sample plot by counting the number of squares filled by each species using a 1 × 1 m grid divided into 10 × 10 cm squares (optical cramming). In each cover plot, we counted the number of live seedlings (assigning a maximum of 100 seedlings to plots with ≥100 seedlings m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>). We recorded the height and width to the nearest 0.1 cm of the tallest shrub and identified shrubs to species or plant functional type. Nomenclature follows Hultén (
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0045">1968</a>), except where noted. We quantified seed rain by species or functional type by counting the average number of seeds caught over the month of July 2013 in 20 × 20 cm vinyl turf seed traps and dividing by seed trap area (m

Each resin bag was made of nylon mesh acid‐washed in 10% HCl and rinsed with DI water prior to filling with 9 g fresh weight (fw) of resin, then preloaded with 2 M KCl overnight before being placed into the field. One resin bag per plot was placed in the soil at approximately 5 cm depth, in five randomly selected plots per transect, and left in place from July 6 to 31, 2013. Collected resin bags were transported to the laboratory on ice, washed free of soil using millipore‐filtered water, and stored at −20°C until extraction.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soil seedbanks (approximately 1 L volume per plot) were taken with a 5 cm diameter × 3 cm depth steel coring tool, 16 cores per plot. Live seedlings found growing in soil cores were added to in situ seedling counts, transplanted to 500 ml pots containing equal parts vermiculite and Promix (Premier Tech, Québec, Canada), and grown for identification to species or functional type in the University of Alaska Research Greenhouse (Fairbanks, Alaska). Soil cores were homogenized for each plot and divided into half. Half of each bulk sample was processed immediately for germination; the other half was frozen at −20°C for 16 weeks before germination (vernalization treatment) in order to induce broad‐spectrum germination of species with different requirements for breaking dormancy (Baskin, Thompson, &amp; Baskin, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0004">2006</a>). In both treatments, we concentrated seedbanks by washing them through 4–0.5 mm mesh soil sieves stacked coarse to fine. This method was developed to optimize germination in native soils by eliminating large particles and fine clays that can create uneven light exposure and moisture conditions (Ter Heerdt, Verweij, Bekker, &amp; Bakker, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0079">1996</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to assess germination, a 0.5 cm layer of concentrated seedbank was poured into 16 oz. plastic cups over moistened Whatman #2 filter paper. Cups were incubated in 20 hr daylight/4 hr night at 23.2°C day/21.4°C night to simulate Arctic summer photoperiod. Cups were randomized on benches weekly and inspected weekly for 12 weeks. Germinants were counted and grown until they were large enough to be identified. Ungerminated seeds were air‐dried, counted, and identified to species or functional type in the laboratory under a dissecting microscope. Counts of seeds or germinants m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> were calculated as the mean number of seeds or germinants/core divided by core area (m
   <span class="sup">2</span>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found willow seeds only in capsules and inferred that single, ungerminated willow seed decomposes rapidly in contact with the soil. We confirmed this in a seed decay experiment by incubating dwarf birch and tall shrub willow seeds collected from branches of live shrubs in a black spruce bog near Fairbanks, Alaska in October 2013. For each species, 100 seeds were placed onto moistened Whatman #2 filter paper in 8 Petri dishes (25 seeds per dish). Petri dishes were covered and incubated in the University of Alaska Research Greenhouse under the above conditions. No additional moisture was added. Initial germination for both species was not different, but after 7 weeks 58% of the willow seed, both germinated and ungerminated, was decayed by mold, versus 3% of the birch seed. We also found wide variation in willow seed counts in our native soil seedbanks, so we pooled birch and willow data for statistical analysis (“birch + willow”). We considered this method appropriate for comparison with other plant functional types because dwarf birch and willow species represented the majority of the deciduous shrub functional type at our sites.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test our hypothesis of the effects of RTS age on each of our dependent variables (in situ seedling counts, seedbank percent germination, and seeds m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>), we performed two‐way ANOVA using RTS age categories (four levels): young (Y), middle‐aged (M), old (O), and control (C); site (two levels): NE‐14 and I‐minus 1; and an RTS × site interaction. When the RTS by site interaction was significant, we used one‐way ANOVA to test RTS age effects for each site separately. We performed separate analyses on seedbanks for all species, and for birch + willow. Tukey's Honest Significant Difference test was performed posthoc where effects were significant in ANOVA (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importance of environmental variables on in situ seedling counts, seedbank percent germination, and seeds m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> was calculated using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) relative importance values for covariates in multiple linear regression models (Akaike, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0001">1992</a>). Because we had many explanatory variables, we considered this a more appropriate method than hierarchical models, because the contribution of any given variable is expressed as a cumulative value across all possible models. For percent germination and seeds m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, the number of observations was too small to evaluate all explanatory variables, and models were ranked using AIC adjusted for the small number of seedbank sample plots (AICc). Importance values were calculated as the cumulative AIC or AICc weight (0 ≤ ∑
   <span class="italic">ω
    <sub>i</sub>
   </span> ≤ 1; Burnham and Anderson, 2002) using a threshold of ≥0.55 for well‐supported variables (Spellman, Schneller, Mulder, &amp; Carlson, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0072">2015</a>). Environmental variables highly correlated with explanatory variables of interest (Pearson correlation coefficient 
   <span class="italic">r</span> ≥ 0.60) were omitted from relative importance models and investigated separately in linear regression. Covariates consisted of eleven continuous variables: percent cover of shrubs, forbs, graminoids, nonvascular plants, pteridophytes, litter, and bare soil; percent soil moisture, available NH

   <span class="sup">+</span> and NO

   <span class="sup">−</span>; and seed rain m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>. Count data were square root transformed using the Box–Cox power transformation (Box &amp; Cox, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0014">1964</a>) to meet assumptions of normal distribution. Distance (m) of each seedling/seedbank plot from its transect origin was tested as a random variable, but was insignificant (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.1) and omitted from analysis. Individual data points falling beyond upper and lower quartiles that influenced model coefficients were omitted as outliers (Quinn &amp; Keough, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0064">2002</a>). Due to site interactions on environmental variables, we ran separate relative importance analyses for each chronosequence site (I‐minus 1, NE‐14).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to visualize niche separation between species or plant functional types comprising in situ seedlings or soil seedbanks and their respective environmental gradients (Ter Braak, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0078">1986</a>). Count data were standardized to proportions per species or functional type by dividing each sample by its species total, to equalize the contributions of abundant and rare species (Noy‐Meir, Walker, &amp; Williams, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0060">1975</a>). For this analysis, birch and willow seedbanks were analyzed separately. Because we were interested in disturbance as well as environmental effects, sample plots were coded by RTS age class. Evergreen shrub cover was highly correlated with lichen cover (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.57) and combined with lichen as heath tundra (“Heath”) for this analysis. Wilk's Lambda (
   <span class="italic">λ</span>) was used to test model significance at 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05 after 1,000 permutations, and because this statistic is used to report variance not explained by the model, we reported the model effect size as 1 − 
   <span class="italic">λ</span>, and we reported the variation explained by constrained axes. Where canonical correspondence models were significant, we used ANOVA to determine significance between individual species and environmental variables, and the proportional variance each relationship contributed to the full model. All statistical tests were performed using R 3.4.3 (R Core Team, 
   <a rid="ece34882-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34882-bib-0065">2017</a>) with the following packages: agricolae (posthoc tests), MASS (ANOVA), MuMIn (variable importance in multiple regression models), and vegan (canonical correspondence analysis).
