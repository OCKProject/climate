 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our observational analysis demonstrates that carbon export from the Weddell Gyre, a representative region of the subpolar Southern Ocean, is established by the accumulation within CDW of remineralized organic carbon sourced from open-ocean primary production. The central implication is that the present-day rate of carbon uptake in the subpolar Southern Ocean is set by the open-ocean biological pump and the horizontal gyre circulation. This represents a deviation from the conventional, two-dimensional perspective of the carbon cycle in the subpolar Southern Ocean (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>), which attributes a disproportionate, rate-controlling role to the overturning circulation and biological processes on the Antarctic continental shelves. Our results support a reframing of the conceptual framework of the subpolar Southern Ocean carbon cycle to bring to the fore the critical mechanisms associated with the horizontal circulation and biological processes in the central gyre, as illustrated schematically in 
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent advances in understanding have promoted an appreciation for the fully three-dimensional nature of Southern Ocean dynamics (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). It is increasingly clear that both physical and biogeochemical processes in the region have a rich zonal structure (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>), an understanding of which will be crucial for progressing knowledge of how the Southern Ocean affects global climate on all time scales. The results presented here highlight the crucial role played by cyclonic gyres around the Antarctic continent, the dynamics of which have been broadly absent from historical perspectives on the carbon cycle in the subpolar Southern Ocean.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The conceptual reframing advocated here carries broad implications both for the interpretation of historical research and for the focus of research efforts moving forward. In the first instance, paleoreconstructions of ocean circulation and biogeochemistry are considered almost exclusively through the lens of a two-dimensional framework, consistent with 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>, such that changes in a proxy signal are commonly interpreted to reflect changes in the overturning circulation (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>). Our results indicate that processes far removed from the overturning circulation critically affect the biogeochemical signature of deep waters, fundamentally undermining this interpretation. Consideration within the three-dimensional framework of 
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, appreciating the crucial role of the cyclonic gyres, can promote a deeper understanding of the role played by the subpolar Southern Ocean in past changes of the global carbon cycle.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results further advocate for a broadening of future research efforts from the biologically productive Antarctic shelf seas, which have been the regions of focus for many process-oriented observational campaigns (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>) and modeling studies (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>), to the central gyre areas. The physical and biogeochemical controls on the biological carbon pump in these regions are markedly distinct (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). As a result, the evolution of each system under future environmental stressors, such as acidification (
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>) and sea-ice cover changes (
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>), may be substantially different.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary limitation of this study is that the observational dataset used, while regionally relatively extensive, is specific to a particular window in time. However, broad consistency of the carbon budget with independent measures of carbon uptake suggests that the results are not prohibitively biased by the timing of measurements, on either a seasonal or interannual basis (
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>). With regard to spatial representativeness, it is reasonable to assume that the mechanism of carbon enrichment within the recirculating gyre interior also operates in the other cyclonic gyre systems around the subpolar Southern Ocean (an assumption supported by observations of elevated remineralized carbon in the central Ross Gyre; fig. S4), although the quantitative details will vary between regions. Nonetheless, and as previously highlighted, operation of the mechanism in the Weddell Gyre alone already represents a globally significant drawdown of carbon to the deep ocean. Quantifying contributions from other regions, as well as assessing temporal variations, may be possible in future through analysis of a recent data-assimilating ocean state estimate that includes a carbon cycle (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>). Further, the impact on the regional carbon cycle of longer time scale variability in both circulation and biogeochemistry, for example, on glacial-interglacial time scales, would be a valuable consideration of future studies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conclude, understanding the carbon cycle dynamics of the subpolar Southern Ocean is of critical importance to a number of fundamental, intensely debated questions surrounding the past and future evolution of Earth’s climate—from the causes of glacial to interglacial climate transitions (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>) to future projections of atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). Central to these questions is the permeability of the subpolar Southern Ocean “lid,” which mediates exchange with the vast carbon reservoir contained in the lower cell of the global overturning circulation. Our results show that in the present day, it is the coupling of the open-ocean biological pump with the horizontal circulation that is key to maintaining net uptake in the region, thereby keeping the lid closed. We contend, therefore, that efforts to resolve such fundamental questions about Earth’s climate are unlikely to succeed as long as the working conceptual framework remains two-dimensional and focused on the overturning circulation. While the sensitivity of the carbon cycle to the overturning circulation is well established (

   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>), our results show that such a focus crucially misrepresents contemporary observations. The mechanism highlighted in this study indicates a way forward and should be carefully considered within a new three-dimensional framework (
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>).
