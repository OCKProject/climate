 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monthly estimates of net primary production were retrieved at 1/6° × 1/6° latitude-longitude resolution across the area enclosed by the ANDREX-I6S Weddell Gyre sections between 2003 and 2014 from the Ocean Productivity website (

Net primary production was calculated from chlorophyll-a, sea surface temperature (both derived from the Aqua-MODIS satellite data), and photosynthetically active radiation (derived from the SeaWiFS satellite data). Calculations were done using three independent models: the standard and Eppley applications of the Vertical General Productivity Model (
