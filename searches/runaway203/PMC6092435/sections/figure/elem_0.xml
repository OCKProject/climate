  <p>Spatial correlations of perturbations due to greenhouse gases vs aerosols. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> The spatial correlation of the ocean-masked surface energy flux perturbation due to greenhouse gases vs aerosols (blue dot) is substantially greater than that of the atmospheric concentrations of the two forcers or the top-of-atmosphere effective radiative forcing, and achieves approximately two-thirds of the spatial correlation in the eventual sea surface temperature response

   </span>. Decomposition of the ocean surface energy flux pattern correlation seasonally by latitude band (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) and by surface energy flux component (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) shows that the spatial correlation manifests most strongly in the surface heat fluxes over the summertime Northern Hemisphere oceans
