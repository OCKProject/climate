         <p>Spatial similarities in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface forcing.

            <span>b</span> June–July–August (JJA)-mean TOA effective radiative forcing due to 
            <span>a</span> greenhouse gases (GHGs) and 
            <span>b</span> aerosols. 
            <span>c</span>, 
            <span>d</span> JJA-mean surface heat flux perturbation due to 
            <span>c</span> GHGs and 
            <span>d</span> aerosols. Note that the color palette for aerosol signals (
            <span>b</span>, 
            <span>d</span>) is reversed relative to that for GHG signals (
            <span>a</span>, 
            <span>c</span>). Gridded regions are not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level via
            
            <span>t</span>-test. See Supplementary Fig.
