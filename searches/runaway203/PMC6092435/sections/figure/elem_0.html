         <p>Spatial correlations of perturbations due to greenhouse gases vs aerosols. 
            <span>a</span> The spatial correlation of the ocean-masked surface energy flux perturbation due
            to greenhouse gases vs aerosols (blue dot) is substantially greater than that of the
            atmospheric concentrations of the two forcers or the top-of-atmosphere effective radiative
            forcing, and achieves approximately two-thirds of the spatial correlation in the eventual
            sea surface temperature response
            <span><a>3</a></span>. Decomposition of the ocean surface energy flux pattern correlation seasonally by
            latitude band (
            <span>b</span>) and by surface energy flux component (
            <span>c</span>) shows that the spatial correlation manifests most strongly in the surface heat fluxes
            over the summertime Northern Hemisphere oceans
