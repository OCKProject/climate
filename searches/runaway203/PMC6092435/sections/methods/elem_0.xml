   </span>. The model contains 48 vertical layers in the atmosphere and has a cubed-sphere horizontal grid, with grid size varying from 163 to 231 km. AM3 contains fully interactive aerosols, which are transported and removed according to the internal meteorology and chemistry of the model. It simulates the first and second aerosol indirect effect in shallow convective and stratocumulus cloud, as well as internal mixing of black carbon and sulfate aerosol.

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three experimental set-ups are used, all run with natural forcings held fixed at 1860 values and with historically varying prescribed SST and sea ice: a 1860 forcing simulation with all anthropogenic and natural forcings held fixed at 1860 values (1860); an aerosol-only forcing simulation with historically varying anthropogenic aerosol emissions prescribed from Lamarque et al.

   </span> (AERO); and a GHG-only forcing simulation with historically varying concentrations of well-mixed GHGs. All experimental set-ups are run with five ensemble members, and years 1970–2014 of each simulation are used in analysis. The GHG signals referenced in this work are derived as the difference between the GHG ensemble and a subset of the 1860 ensemble; the aerosol signals are derived as the difference between the AERO ensemble and an independent subset of the 1860 ensemble. Different 1860 ensemble members are used in the aerosol and the GHG calculations. The signals are thus entirely independent.
