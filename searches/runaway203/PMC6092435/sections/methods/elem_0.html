            AM3 Atmospheric General Circulation Model
            <span><a>27</a></span> run with SSTs and sea ice prescribed from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
            6 data set prepared for the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
            <span><a>28</a></span>. The model contains 48 vertical layers in the atmosphere and has a cubed-sphere horizontal
            grid, with grid size varying from 163 to 231 km. AM3 contains fully interactive aerosols,
            which are transported and removed according to the internal meteorology and chemistry
            of the model. It simulates the first and second aerosol indirect effect in shallow
            convective and stratocumulus cloud, as well as internal mixing of black carbon and
            sulfate aerosol.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three experimental set-ups are used, all run with natural forcings held fixed at 1860
            values and with historically varying prescribed SST and sea ice: a 1860 forcing simulation
            with all anthropogenic and natural forcings held fixed at 1860 values (1860); an aerosol-only
            forcing simulation with historically varying anthropogenic aerosol emissions prescribed
            from Lamarque et al.
            <span><a>29</a></span> (AERO); and a GHG-only forcing simulation with historically varying concentrations
            of well-mixed GHGs. All experimental set-ups are run with five ensemble members, and
            years 1970–2014 of each simulation are used in analysis. The GHG signals referenced
            in this work are derived as the difference between the GHG ensemble and a subset of
            the 1860 ensemble; the aerosol signals are derived as the difference between the AERO
            ensemble and an independent subset of the 1860 ensemble. Different 1860 ensemble members
            are used in the aerosol and the GHG calculations. The signals are thus entirely independent.
