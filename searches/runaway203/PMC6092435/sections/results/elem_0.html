         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TOA ERF patterns, however, are already subject to some homogenization through
            atmosphere and land adjustment to each forcer. The patterns of TOA ERF are, for example,
            substantially more spatially anti-correlated than are the aggregate concentrations
            of the forcers themselves (
            <span>R</span> = 0.03*). Although the concentrations of the forcers is not an appropriate proxy
            for the initial radiative effects of the two types of forcers
            <span><a>7</a></span>, it is valuable to note that the physical presence of the two forcers (as captured
            by their atmospheric concentrations) is entirely uncorrelated—highlighting that some
            homogenization occurs simply in how the climatological radiative environment interacts
            with the presence of a forcing agent.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further, the TOA ERF does not represent only the initial radiative effects of the
            forcers, but also includes the radiative effects of microphysical, thermodynamic,
            and dynamical cloud responses to the presence of the aerosols or GHGs, as well as
            the outgoing longwave signature of the land surface temperature changes and associated
            lapse rate and albedo effects
            <span><a>6</a></span>. The spatial anti-correlation of the change in total cloud cover between the two
            runs (
            <span>R</span> = −0.43) is comparable to that for the all-sky TOA ERF, indicating that the latter
            can be explained partially by antisymmetric (i.e., symmetric, but of opposite sign)
            cloud changes in response to the two forcers. The spatially similar climatological
            cloud masking of aerosols’ and GHGs’ radiative effects may also play a role, as suggested
            by the slightly lower spatial correlation of the clear-sky (i.e., cloud non-permitting)
            TOA ERF (
            <span>R</span> = −0.40). Other radiative forcing definitions, such as instantaneous forcing, that
            are calculated prior to full atmospheric adjustment would not include such responses.
            However, such forcing definitions are impracticable for calculating aerosol radiative
            effects in models like AM3 that contain aerosol indirect effects on clouds and interactive
            translation of aerosol surface emissions into atmospheric concentrations—both of which
            require tropospheric adjustment in order to manifest.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial differences between the TOA ERF due to GHGs and that due to aerosols,
            however, are further homogenized in the surface energy flux perturbation due to each,
            achieving approximately two-thirds of the spatial similarity seen by Xie et al.
            <span><a>3</a></span> in the eventual sea surface temperature (SST) response. The pattern of surface energy
            flux perturbation (Δ
            <span>S</span>, defined as the change in total surface energy flux, composed of radiative shortwave
            and longwave, latent, and sensible energy) in response to the two forcers is more
            strongly anti-correlated (
            <span>R</span> = −0.52) than the TOA ERF, indicating an additional process of homogenization between
            the TOA perturbation and the surface perturbation. Because the surface energy balance
            over land rapidly re-equilibrates due to the low effective heat capacity of the land
            surface, Δ
            <span>S</span> is near zero for all land surfaces by necessity. The spatial correlation of Δ
            <span>S</span> is therefore calculated only over the ocean, although the values are similar with
            and without land-masking. The oceanic surface energy balance is not constrained to
            re-equilibrate on atmosphere-only timescales, and as such will reflect the atmospheric
            conditions setting surface fluxes.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Δ
            <span>S</span> can be construed as an intermediary between the TOA atmospheric perturbation of a
            forcing agent and the ocean response thereto, and is thus a telling manifestation
            of the fast, atmosphere-and-land-only pathway for fully atmosphere-and-ocean coupled
            response pattern formation. The annual-mean, global-mean Δ
            <span>S</span> correlation between GHGs and aerosols emerges most strongly in the surface sensible
            heat flux component of the surface energy balance (Fig. 
            <a>1</a>). In contrast, the surface radiative (shortwave and longwave) flux change is little
            correlated (
            <span>R</span> = −0.13*), indicating that neither the radiative effects of climatological cloud
            masking nor of cloud change are responsible for the spatial similarities in Δ
            <span>S</span>. The strongest anti-correlation occurs largely during Northern Hemisphere summertime
            over the tropical and northern extratropical oceans, as indicated by the seasonal
            and latitudinal decomposition of Δ
            <span>S</span> (Fig. 
            <a>1</a>), and is driven by antisymmetric wave-like patterns in the surface latent and sensible
            heat flux change in response to each forcer (Fig.

            of a wave perturbation to the atmospheric circulation that is produced by both GHGs
            and aerosols. Over the extratropical oceans, a barotropic stationary Rossby wave perturbation
            to the atmospheric flow, consistent with the wave pattern in surface heat fluxes,
            is evident in alternating positive and negative anomalies collocated in sea level
            pressure (SLP) and in geopotential height at the 500-hpa pressure level (

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rossby wave perturbations to the extratropical atmospheric flow can occur via wave
            sources located either in the extratropics or in the tropics. Wave excitation within
            the extratropics can result from changes in extratropical land–sea thermal and diabatic

            <span><a>8</a>,
               <a>9</a></span>. Excitation of extratropical waves from within the tropics, meanwhile, can occur
            due to changes in tropical deep convection and precipitation (and thus atmospheric
            latent heating), the signal from which then propagates into the extratropics

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GHGs and aerosols trigger these wave sources antisymmetrically. In the extratropics,
            the location of the landmasses serves as a potent fixed wave source in the presence
            of both forcers. The Northern Hemisphere summertime land–sea contrast (
            <span>T</span><sub>L/S</sub>, quantified as the climatologically positive hemispheric-mean difference between
            land and ocean surface temperatures) decreases in the presence of aerosols (Δ

            <span>T</span><sub>L/S</sub> = 0.35 K). This perturbation to the climatological land–sea contrast constitutes
            a diabatic heating anomaly that acts as an extratropical source of Rossby waves
            <span><a>8</a></span>. The surface temperature response to GHGs and aerosols (Fig. 
            <a>3c, d</a>) is constrained to the land in these prescribed SST runs. However, the land surface
            temperature response to the two forcers is spatially anti-correlated (
            <span>R</span> = −0.56, in the Northern Hemisphere summertime mean), likely constrained by local
            surface energy availability
            <span><a>14</a></span> and regional sensitivities and feedbacks that are largely forcing independent
            <span><a>15</a></span>. The substantially weaker spatial correlation of surface energy flux patterns during
            the Northern Hemisphere winter-time (DJF) may be attributable to the higher variability
            and greater influence of transient eddies on stationary Rossby wave patterns during
            the Northern Hemisphere wintertime
            <span><a>16</a></span>, which decreases the influence of the land–sea contrast mechanism proposed here.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the tropics, changes in deep tropical (20°S–20°N) precipitation due to GHGs and
            aerosols can also act as a source for extratropical Rossby waves. The fact that the
            simulated deep tropical precipitation changes are indeed antisymmetric (
            <span>R</span> = −0.54) (Fig. 
            <a>3e, f</a>) may contribute to the similar extratropical wave patterns. Interestingly, it is
            not straightforward why the two forcers would give rise to antisymmetric, rather than
            symmetric, precipitation changes. In fact, a thermodynamic scaling argument suggests
            the opposite: under fixed-SST conditions, both GHGs and aerosols increase tropospheric
            absorption of radiative energy, via increased absorption of longwave radiation in
            the case of GHGs and of shortwave radiation in the case of aerosols, and thus have
            suppressing effects on tropical mean precipitation

               <a>17</a>–
               <a>19</a></span>. Indeed, in our simulations, both forcers decrease tropical mean precipitation (by
            −1.2% for present-day GHGs and −0.74% for present-day aerosols).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our view, the antisymmetric spatial pattern of these precipitation reductions is
            driven mainly by the opposite land–SST contrast patterns (Fig. 
            <a>3c, d</a>) and associated monsoonal circulation changes, which are dynamical in nature. The
            aerosol cools the land surface relative to the ocean, decreasing rainfall preferentially
            over the land surface, while the GHGs warm the land surface relative to the ocean,
            increasing the rainfall preferentially over the land surface. Analysis as part of
            the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project finds similar
            behavior and mechanisms in the fast precipitation response to individual forcers

            <span><a>21</a></span>. Other, finer-scale features of the fast response to GHGs and aerosols that are evident
            in our simulations have also been confirmed in other analyses, such as weakening of

            <span>L</span>. Vertical longwave and shortwave radiative energy conservation dictates that the
            TOA ERF must equal the sum of the surface radiative perturbation (Δ
            <span>R</span><sub>surf</sub><span>)</span> and any net (i.e., absorption less emission) atmospheric absorption change (ERF = Δ
            <span>R</span><sub>surf</sub> + ΔAA). Thus, the surface heat flux perturbation over ocean will be equal to the
            total atmospheric absorption change over land and ocean plus the land surface radiative
            perturbation (Δ

            <span>O+L</span> + Δ
            <span>R</span><span>L</span><sub>surf</sub>), a balance that is evident in our simulations (Table 
            <a>1</a>). This coupling between the atmospheric and surface energetics over the land and
            the ocean dictates that most of the spatial heterogeneity in the initial TOA forcing
            cannot be maintained in the response and must be rapidly transformed (from radiation
            to heat) and redistributed (from the land surface and atmosphere to the ocean surface)
            by the atmospheric circulation. This circulation adjustment process is fundamentally
            responsible for the similar ocean heat flux perturbation patterns between GHGs and
            aerosols.

                  <p>Energy balance constraints on surface heat flux patterns. The top-of-atmosphere (TOA)
                     effective radiative forcings (ERF) over land and ocean (ERF
                     <span>L/O</span>) must equal the surface radiative perturbation (∆
                     <span>R</span><span>L/O</span><sub>surf</sub>) plus any atmospheric absorption (∆AA
                     <span>L/O</span>) by vertical radiative energy conservation. Because the atmosphere and land surface
                     cannot store energy long-term (
                     <span>R</span><span>L</span><sub>surf</sub> + 
                     <span>H</span><span>L</span><sub>surf</sub> = 0, assuming positive downward sign convention), the TOA ERFs must be balanced through
                     the ocean surface energy perturbation (
                     <span>R</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub> + 
                     <span>H</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub>). The ocean heat flux perturbation (
                     <span>H</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub>) will, therefore, be responsible for balancing the total atmospheric absorption change
                     plus the land surface radiative perturbation
