      <p>Despite distinct geographic distributions of top-of-the-atmosphere radiative forcing,
         anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have been found to produce similar patterns
         of climate response in atmosphere-and-ocean coupled climate model simulations. Understanding
         surface energy flux changes, a crucial pathway by which atmospheric forcing is communicated
         to the ocean, is a vital bridge to explaining the similar full atmosphere-and-ocean
         responses to these disparate forcings. Here we analyze the fast, atmosphere-driven
         change in surface energy flux caused by present-day greenhouse gases vs aerosols to
         elucidate its role in shaping the subsequent slow, coupled response. We find that
         the surface energy flux response patterns achieve roughly two-thirds of the anti-correlation
         seen in the fully coupled response, driven by Rossby waves excited by symmetric changes
         to the landâ€“sea contrast. Our results suggest that atmosphere and land surface processes
         are capable of achieving substantial within-hemisphere homogenization in the climate
         response to disparate forcers on fast, societally-relevant timescales.
