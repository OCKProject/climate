      <p>Anthropogenic aerosol and greenhouse gas concentrations are spatially uncorrelated,
         but the climate response to each shows a similar spatial pattern. Here the authors
         show that two-thirds of the spatial similarity in the full response manifests through
         fast-acting atmosphere and land surface processes alone.
