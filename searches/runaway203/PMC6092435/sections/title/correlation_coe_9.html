      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pearson correlation coefficients throughout are calculated via linear regression with
         area-weighting. Scatterplots of all data were analyzed to ensure insensitivity to
         outliers and qualitative linearity of relationships. Correlation values given are
         significant at the 95% level under a two-sided 
         <span>t</span> test, except where they are followed by an asterisk (*).
