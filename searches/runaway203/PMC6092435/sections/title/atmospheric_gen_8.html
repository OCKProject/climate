      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All simulations in this study are conducted in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s
         AM3 Atmospheric General Circulation Model
         <span><a>27</a></span> run with SSTs and sea ice prescribed from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
         6 data set prepared for the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
         <span><a>28</a></span>. The model contains 48 vertical layers in the atmosphere and has a cubed-sphere horizontal
         grid, with grid size varying from 163 to 231 km. AM3 contains fully interactive aerosols,
         which are transported and removed according to the internal meteorology and chemistry
         of the model. It simulates the first and second aerosol indirect effect in shallow
         convective and stratocumulus cloud, as well as internal mixing of black carbon and
         sulfate aerosol.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three experimental set-ups are used, all run with natural forcings held fixed at 1860
         values and with historically varying prescribed SST and sea ice: a 1860 forcing simulation
         with all anthropogenic and natural forcings held fixed at 1860 values (1860); an aerosol-only
         forcing simulation with historically varying anthropogenic aerosol emissions prescribed
         from Lamarque et al.
         <span><a>29</a></span> (AERO); and a GHG-only forcing simulation with historically varying concentrations
         of well-mixed GHGs. All experimental set-ups are run with five ensemble members, and
         years 1970–2014 of each simulation are used in analysis. The GHG signals referenced
         in this work are derived as the difference between the GHG ensemble and a subset of
         the 1860 ensemble; the aerosol signals are derived as the difference between the AERO
         ensemble and an independent subset of the 1860 ensemble. Different 1860 ensemble members
         are used in the aerosol and the GHG calculations. The signals are thus entirely independent.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical significances are calculated using a two-sided 
         <span>t</span> test using the variability across model years, with sample size adjusted for autocorrelation
         between model years
         <span><a>30</a></span>. It should be noted that the AM3 model has particularly high internal variability
         compared to other climate models included in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison
         Project
