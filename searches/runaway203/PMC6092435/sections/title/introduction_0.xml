  </span> suggest that the spatial similarities in the fully coupled response to GHGs and aerosols, analyzed in a subset of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, are strongly mediated by common patterns of ocean–atmosphere feedbacks that can be separated conceptually into a fast, atmosphere-only component and a slower, ocean–atmosphere coupled component. The degree of spatial similarity in the climate response to GHGs vs aerosols has significant implications for questions in the detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate change

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We probe the fast, atmosphere-and-land-only component of the formation of the spatial patterns of response to present-day GHGs and aerosols in an atmospheric general circulation model—a crucial intermediate step toward understanding the fully coupled response. We find that, although the atmospheric distributions of the two forcers are largely uncorrelated, their surface energy flux perturbation patterns achieve roughly two-thirds of the anti-correlation seen in the fully coupled response. Rapid land temperature and precipitation responses also show strong pattern similarity. Our analysis highlights the common modes of atmospheric circulation and surface energy adjustment that are triggered by both GHG and aerosol forcings. These produce antisymmetric (i.e., symmetric, but of opposite sign) spatial patterns of surface sensible and latent heat flux variations in response to the two forcers, particularly over the summertime Northern Hemisphere oceans. Our results suggest that atmosphere and land surface processes are capable of achieving substantial within-hemisphere homogenization in the climate response to disparate forcers on fast timescales, with implications for detection and attribution of near-term climate change and for understanding and predicting the regional climate impacts of anthropogenic GHGs and aerosols on societally-relevant timescales.</p>
