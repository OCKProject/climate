      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our work reveals that, even on the short timescales captured in fixed-SST simulations,
         GHGs and aerosols can be expected to produce strongly correlated spatial patterns
         of change across a range of variables. This is enforced by the symmetric perturbation
         to the extratropical circulation provided by landâ€“sea contrast, the spatial structure
         of which is fixed by the location of the landmasses and, thus, relatively insensitive
         to the structure of the initial forcing. Analysis of the spatial correlation of atmosphere-and-land-only
         change in response to GHGs and aerosols in a range of models will be crucial to improved
         understanding of this phenomenon. We have here presented a picture of the atmosphere-and-land-only
         dynamical and thermodynamical mechanisms that drive these similarities in our model,
         providing a bridge to understanding the fully atmosphere-and-ocean coupled spatial
         patterns described by Xie et al.
         <span><a>3</a></span> and others, and encourage continued analysis of this phenomenon in additional climate
         models.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The degree of similarity in the spatial pattern of the climate response to GHGs and
         aerosols has many implications for understanding and predicting the relative climate
         impacts of these forcers. Detection and attribution studies rely on spatial pattern
         as one component of the fingerprint of a given forcer, and similarity therein can
         result in a degradation of the ability to distinguish the signal from GHGs vs aerosols
         in climate phenomena
         <span><a>4</a></span>. Our identification here of additional climate variables in which spatial pattern
         similarity can be expected to emerge and the relatively rapid timescales on which
         they can be expected to do so (i.e., via decadal time-scale atmosphere and land adjustments)
         provide new inputs to determining spatial fingerprints for aerosols vs GHGs on the
         short-term timescales for which high quality, global observations are most available.
         A valuable extension to this work would be similar analysis of the role of atmosphere-and-land-only
         processes in setting the spatial pattern and fingerprint of response to scattering
         vs absorbing aerosols, which Xu and Xie
         <span><a>24</a></span> have found to produce similar response patterns in fully coupled simulations.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further, our understanding of the regional distribution of present and future climate
         change relies on constraining the spatial structure of the response to heterogeneous
         forcers like aerosols vs homogeneous forcers like GHGs
         <span><a>25</a>,
            <a>26</a></span>. Anthropogenic aerosols have been a primary mediator of GHG-driven climate change
         over the industrial era in the global mean
         <span><a>6</a></span>. Our findings indicate that the spatial distribution of the response to changes in
         global aerosol emissions will resemble that to GHGs even before slower coupled ocean
         processes kick in. This suggests that changes in global aerosol emissions may be capable
         of offsetting GHG-driven climate change on rapid, societally-relevant timescales not
         only in the global mean, but also in terms of the spatial distribution of climate
         change.
