      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA), all-sky, effective radiative forcings
         (ERFs)
         <span><a>6</a></span> of GHGs and aerosols are weakly anti-correlated (
         <span>R</span> = −0.39) in our simulations, comparable to values found in other studies
         <span><a>3</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). ERF is calculated as the difference in TOA radiative flux between simulations with
         and without the forcing agent after the atmospheric and land temperatures have been
         allowed to re-equilibrate GHGs’ TOA ERF pattern is by-and-large hemispherically symmetric
         and uniformly distributed (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>). Meanwhile, aerosols’ TOA ERF pattern (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>), due to aerosols’ short atmospheric lifetime, is dependent on regional factors like
         surface albedo and the location of emissions, and is concentrated in the Northern
         Hemisphere.

                  to greenhouse gases vs aerosols (blue dot) is substantially greater than that of the
                  atmospheric concentrations of the two forcers or the top-of-atmosphere effective radiative
                  forcing, and achieves approximately two-thirds of the spatial correlation in the eventual
                  sea surface temperature response

                  <span>c</span>) shows that the spatial correlation manifests most strongly in the surface heat fluxes
                  over the summertime Northern Hemisphere oceans

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TOA ERF patterns, however, are already subject to some homogenization through
         atmosphere and land adjustment to each forcer. The patterns of TOA ERF are, for example,
         substantially more spatially anti-correlated than are the aggregate concentrations
         of the forcers themselves (
         <span>R</span> = 0.03*). Although the concentrations of the forcers is not an appropriate proxy
         for the initial radiative effects of the two types of forcers
         <span><a>7</a></span>, it is valuable to note that the physical presence of the two forcers (as captured
         by their atmospheric concentrations) is entirely uncorrelated—highlighting that some
         homogenization occurs simply in how the climatological radiative environment interacts
         with the presence of a forcing agent.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further, the TOA ERF does not represent only the initial radiative effects of the
         forcers, but also includes the radiative effects of microphysical, thermodynamic,
         and dynamical cloud responses to the presence of the aerosols or GHGs, as well as
         the outgoing longwave signature of the land surface temperature changes and associated
         lapse rate and albedo effects
         <span><a>6</a></span>. The spatial anti-correlation of the change in total cloud cover between the two
         runs (
         <span>R</span> = −0.43) is comparable to that for the all-sky TOA ERF, indicating that the latter
         can be explained partially by antisymmetric (i.e., symmetric, but of opposite sign)
         cloud changes in response to the two forcers. The spatially similar climatological
         cloud masking of aerosols’ and GHGs’ radiative effects may also play a role, as suggested
         by the slightly lower spatial correlation of the clear-sky (i.e., cloud non-permitting)
         TOA ERF (
         <span>R</span> = −0.40). Other radiative forcing definitions, such as instantaneous forcing, that
         are calculated prior to full atmospheric adjustment would not include such responses.
         However, such forcing definitions are impracticable for calculating aerosol radiative
         effects in models like AM3 that contain aerosol indirect effects on clouds and interactive
         translation of aerosol surface emissions into atmospheric concentrations—both of which
         require tropospheric adjustment in order to manifest.
