 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The common pattern of surface heat flux change in response to each forcer is a manifestation of a wave perturbation to the atmospheric circulation that is produced by both GHGs and aerosols. Over the extratropical oceans, a barotropic stationary Rossby wave perturbation to the atmospheric flow, consistent with the wave pattern in surface heat fluxes, is evident in alternating positive and negative anomalies collocated in sea level pressure (SLP) and in geopotential height at the 500-hpa pressure level (

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a, b</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2a, b</a>). The patterns of SLP and

  <sub>500</sub> perturbations due to GHGs and aerosols are correlated at 
  <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.44 and 
  <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.71, respectively, during the Northern Hemisphere summertime when spatial correlation of Δ
  <span class="italic">S</span> is highest. Surface winds and temperature and specific humidity gradients between the surface and air, the primary controllers of surface heat fluxes, also exhibit strong wave patterns in the extratropics (Supplementary Figs.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rossby wave perturbations to the extratropical atmospheric flow can occur via wave sources located either in the extratropics or in the tropics. Wave excitation within the extratropics can result from changes in extratropical land–sea thermal and diabatic heating contrast caused by land surface temperature adjustments to forcing under the constraint of fixed SSTs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Excitation of extratropical waves from within the tropics, meanwhile, can occur due to changes in tropical deep convection and precipitation (and thus atmospheric latent heating), the signal from which then propagates into the extratropics

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GHGs and aerosols trigger these wave sources antisymmetrically. In the extratropics, the location of the landmasses serves as a potent fixed wave source in the presence of both forcers. The Northern Hemisphere summertime land–sea contrast (
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>L/S</sub>, quantified as the climatologically positive hemispheric-mean difference between land and ocean surface temperatures) decreases in the presence of aerosols (Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>L/S</sub> = −0.37 K) and increases in the presence of GHGs (Δ
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>L/S</sub> = 0.35 K). This perturbation to the climatological land–sea contrast constitutes a diabatic heating anomaly that acts as an extratropical source of Rossby waves
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. The surface temperature response to GHGs and aerosols (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c, d</a>) is constrained to the land in these prescribed SST runs. However, the land surface temperature response to the two forcers is spatially anti-correlated (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.56, in the Northern Hemisphere summertime mean), likely constrained by local surface energy availability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span> and regional sensitivities and feedbacks that are largely forcing independent
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. The substantially weaker spatial correlation of surface energy flux patterns during the Northern Hemisphere winter-time (DJF) may be attributable to the higher variability and greater influence of transient eddies on stationary Rossby wave patterns during the Northern Hemisphere wintertime
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>, which decreases the influence of the land–sea contrast mechanism proposed here.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the tropics, changes in deep tropical (20°S–20°N) precipitation due to GHGs and aerosols can also act as a source for extratropical Rossby waves. The fact that the simulated deep tropical precipitation changes are indeed antisymmetric (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.54) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e, f</a>) may contribute to the similar extratropical wave patterns. Interestingly, it is not straightforward why the two forcers would give rise to antisymmetric, rather than symmetric, precipitation changes. In fact, a thermodynamic scaling argument suggests the opposite: under fixed-SST conditions, both GHGs and aerosols increase tropospheric absorption of radiative energy, via increased absorption of longwave radiation in the case of GHGs and of shortwave radiation in the case of aerosols, and thus have suppressing effects on tropical mean precipitation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Indeed, in our simulations, both forcers decrease tropical mean precipitation (by −1.2% for present-day GHGs and −0.74% for present-day aerosols).
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our view, the antisymmetric spatial pattern of these precipitation reductions is driven mainly by the opposite land–SST contrast patterns (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c, d</a>) and associated monsoonal circulation changes, which are dynamical in nature. The aerosol cools the land surface relative to the ocean, decreasing rainfall preferentially over the land surface, while the GHGs warm the land surface relative to the ocean, increasing the rainfall preferentially over the land surface. Analysis as part of the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project finds similar behavior and mechanisms in the fast precipitation response to individual forcers

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
