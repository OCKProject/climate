      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial differences between the TOA ERF due to GHGs and that due to aerosols,
         however, are further homogenized in the surface energy flux perturbation due to each,
         achieving approximately two-thirds of the spatial similarity seen by Xie et al.
         <span><a>3</a></span> in the eventual sea surface temperature (SST) response. The pattern of surface energy
         flux perturbation (Δ
         <span>S</span>, defined as the change in total surface energy flux, composed of radiative shortwave
         and longwave, latent, and sensible energy) in response to the two forcers is more
         strongly anti-correlated (
         <span>R</span> = −0.52) than the TOA ERF, indicating an additional process of homogenization between
         the TOA perturbation and the surface perturbation. Because the surface energy balance
         over land rapidly re-equilibrates due to the low effective heat capacity of the land
         surface, Δ
         <span>S</span> is near zero for all land surfaces by necessity. The spatial correlation of Δ
         <span>S</span> is therefore calculated only over the ocean, although the values are similar with
         and without land-masking. The oceanic surface energy balance is not constrained to
         re-equilibrate on atmosphere-only timescales, and as such will reflect the atmospheric
         conditions setting surface fluxes.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Δ
         <span>S</span> can be construed as an intermediary between the TOA atmospheric perturbation of a
         forcing agent and the ocean response thereto, and is thus a telling manifestation
         of the fast, atmosphere-and-land-only pathway for fully atmosphere-and-ocean coupled
         response pattern formation. The annual-mean, global-mean Δ
         <span>S</span> correlation between GHGs and aerosols emerges most strongly in the surface sensible
         heat flux component of the surface energy balance (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). In contrast, the surface radiative (shortwave and longwave) flux change is little
         correlated (
         <span>R</span> = −0.13*), indicating that neither the radiative effects of climatological cloud
         masking nor of cloud change are responsible for the spatial similarities in Δ
         <span>S</span>. The strongest anti-correlation occurs largely during Northern Hemisphere summertime
         over the tropical and northern extratropical oceans, as indicated by the seasonal
         and latitudinal decomposition of Δ
         <span>S</span> (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>), and is driven by antisymmetric wave-like patterns in the surface latent and sensible
         heat flux change in response to each forcer (Fig. 
         <a>2c, d</a>).
