ERF is calculated as the difference in TOA radiative flux between simulations with and without the forcing agent after the atmospheric and land temperatures have been allowed to re-equilibrate GHGs’ TOA ERF pattern is by-and-large hemispherically symmetric and uniformly distributed (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1a</a>). Meanwhile, aerosols’ TOA ERF pattern (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1b</a>), due to aerosols’ short atmospheric lifetime, is dependent on regional factors like surface albedo and the location of emissions, and is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TOA ERF patterns, however, are already subject to some homogenization through atmosphere and land adjustment to each forcer. The patterns of TOA ERF are, for example, substantially more spatially anti-correlated than are the aggregate concentrations of the forcers themselves (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.03*). Although the concentrations of the forcers is not an appropriate proxy for the initial radiative effects of the two types of forcers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, it is valuable to note that the physical presence of the two forcers (as captured by their atmospheric concentrations) is entirely uncorrelated—highlighting that some homogenization occurs simply in how the climatological radiative environment interacts with the presence of a forcing agent.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further, the TOA ERF does not represent only the initial radiative effects of the forcers, but also includes the radiative effects of microphysical, thermodynamic, and dynamical cloud responses to the presence of the aerosols or GHGs, as well as the outgoing longwave signature of the land surface temperature changes and associated lapse rate and albedo effects
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. The spatial anti-correlation of the change in total cloud cover between the two runs (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.43) is comparable to that for the all-sky TOA ERF, indicating that the latter can be explained partially by antisymmetric (i.e., symmetric, but of opposite sign) cloud changes in response to the two forcers. The spatially similar climatological cloud masking of aerosols’ and GHGs’ radiative effects may also play a role, as suggested by the slightly lower spatial correlation of the clear-sky (i.e., cloud non-permitting) TOA ERF (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.40). Other radiative forcing definitions, such as instantaneous forcing, that are calculated prior to full atmospheric adjustment would not include such responses. However, such forcing definitions are impracticable for calculating aerosol radiative effects in models like AM3 that contain aerosol indirect effects on clouds and interactive translation of aerosol surface emissions into atmospheric concentrations—both of which require tropospheric adjustment in order to manifest.
