  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TOA ERF patterns, however, are already subject to some homogenization through atmosphere and land adjustment to each forcer. The patterns of TOA ERF are, for example, substantially more spatially anti-correlated than are the aggregate concentrations of the forcers themselves (
   <span class="italic">R</span> = 0.03*). Although the concentrations of the forcers is not an appropriate proxy for the initial radiative effects of the two types of forcers
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
   </span>, it is valuable to note that the physical presence of the two forcers (as captured by their atmospheric concentrations) is entirely uncorrelated—highlighting that some homogenization occurs simply in how the climatological radiative environment interacts with the presence of a forcing agent.
  </p>
  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further, the TOA ERF does not represent only the initial radiative effects of the forcers, but also includes the radiative effects of microphysical, thermodynamic, and dynamical cloud responses to the presence of the aerosols or GHGs, as well as the outgoing longwave signature of the land surface temperature changes and associated lapse rate and albedo effects
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span>. The spatial anti-correlation of the change in total cloud cover between the two runs (
   <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.43) is comparable to that for the all-sky TOA ERF, indicating that the latter can be explained partially by antisymmetric (i.e., symmetric, but of opposite sign) cloud changes in response to the two forcers. The spatially similar climatological cloud masking of aerosols’ and GHGs’ radiative effects may also play a role, as suggested by the slightly lower spatial correlation of the clear-sky (i.e., cloud non-permitting) TOA ERF (
   <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.40). Other radiative forcing definitions, such as instantaneous forcing, that are calculated prior to full atmospheric adjustment would not include such responses. However, such forcing definitions are impracticable for calculating aerosol radiative effects in models like AM3 that contain aerosol indirect effects on clouds and interactive translation of aerosol surface emissions into atmospheric concentrations—both of which require tropospheric adjustment in order to manifest.

   <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.52) than the TOA ERF, indicating an additional process of homogenization between the TOA perturbation and the surface perturbation. Because the surface energy balance over land rapidly re-equilibrates due to the low effective heat capacity of the land surface, Δ
   <span class="italic">S</span> is near zero for all land surfaces by necessity. The spatial correlation of Δ
   <span class="italic">S</span> is therefore calculated only over the ocean, although the values are similar with and without land-masking. The oceanic surface energy balance is not constrained to re-equilibrate on atmosphere-only timescales, and as such will reflect the atmospheric conditions setting surface fluxes.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Δ
   <span class="italic">S</span> can be construed as an intermediary between the TOA atmospheric perturbation of a forcing agent and the ocean response thereto, and is thus a telling manifestation of the fast, atmosphere-and-land-only pathway for fully atmosphere-and-ocean coupled response pattern formation. The annual-mean, global-mean Δ
   <span class="italic">S</span> correlation between GHGs and aerosols emerges most strongly in the surface sensible heat flux component of the surface energy balance (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In contrast, the surface radiative (shortwave and longwave) flux change is little correlated (
   <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.13*), indicating that neither the radiative effects of climatological cloud masking nor of cloud change are responsible for the spatial similarities in Δ

   <span class="italic">S</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), and is driven by antisymmetric wave-like patterns in the surface latent and sensible heat flux change in response to each forcer (Fig.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rossby wave perturbations to the extratropical atmospheric flow can occur via wave sources located either in the extratropics or in the tropics. Wave excitation within the extratropics can result from changes in extratropical land–sea thermal and diabatic heating contrast caused by land surface temperature adjustments to forcing under the constraint of fixed SSTs
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
   </span>. Excitation of extratropical waves from within the tropics, meanwhile, can occur due to changes in tropical deep convection and precipitation (and thus atmospheric latent heating), the signal from which then propagates into the extratropics

   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GHGs and aerosols trigger these wave sources antisymmetrically. In the extratropics, the location of the landmasses serves as a potent fixed wave source in the presence of both forcers. The Northern Hemisphere summertime land–sea contrast (
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>L/S</sub>, quantified as the climatologically positive hemispheric-mean difference between land and ocean surface temperatures) decreases in the presence of aerosols (Δ
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>L/S</sub> = −0.37 K) and increases in the presence of GHGs (Δ
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>L/S</sub> = 0.35 K). This perturbation to the climatological land–sea contrast constitutes a diabatic heating anomaly that acts as an extratropical source of Rossby waves
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
   </span>. The surface temperature response to GHGs and aerosols (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c, d</a>) is constrained to the land in these prescribed SST runs. However, the land surface temperature response to the two forcers is spatially anti-correlated (
   <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.56, in the Northern Hemisphere summertime mean), likely constrained by local surface energy availability
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
   </span> and regional sensitivities and feedbacks that are largely forcing independent
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span>. The substantially weaker spatial correlation of surface energy flux patterns during the Northern Hemisphere winter-time (DJF) may be attributable to the higher variability and greater influence of transient eddies on stationary Rossby wave patterns during the Northern Hemisphere wintertime
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
   </span>, which decreases the influence of the land–sea contrast mechanism proposed here.
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the tropics, changes in deep tropical (20°S–20°N) precipitation due to GHGs and aerosols can also act as a source for extratropical Rossby waves. The fact that the simulated deep tropical precipitation changes are indeed antisymmetric (
   <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.54) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e, f</a>) may contribute to the similar extratropical wave patterns. Interestingly, it is not straightforward why the two forcers would give rise to antisymmetric, rather than symmetric, precipitation changes. In fact, a thermodynamic scaling argument suggests the opposite: under fixed-SST conditions, both GHGs and aerosols increase tropospheric absorption of radiative energy, via increased absorption of longwave radiation in the case of GHGs and of shortwave radiation in the case of aerosols, and thus have suppressing effects on tropical mean precipitation

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span>. Indeed, in our simulations, both forcers decrease tropical mean precipitation (by −1.2% for present-day GHGs and −0.74% for present-day aerosols).
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our view, the antisymmetric spatial pattern of these precipitation reductions is driven mainly by the opposite land–SST contrast patterns (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c, d</a>) and associated monsoonal circulation changes, which are dynamical in nature. The aerosol cools the land surface relative to the ocean, decreasing rainfall preferentially over the land surface, while the GHGs warm the land surface relative to the ocean, increasing the rainfall preferentially over the land surface. Analysis as part of the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project finds similar behavior and mechanisms in the fast precipitation response to individual forcers

  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our above analysis of the mechanisms of surface pattern correlation demonstrates that the atmospheric circulation is an efficient homogenizer of heterogeneous forcings, even under fixed-SST conditions. Indeed, a simple energy balance analysis, based on energetic constraints alone, illuminates why this atmospheric homogenization must occur (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Because land surface and atmospheric energy perturbations rapidly equilibrate to zero, the total ocean surface energy perturbation (Δ

This coupling between the atmospheric and surface energetics over the land and the ocean dictates that most of the spatial heterogeneity in the initial TOA forcing cannot be maintained in the response and must be rapidly transformed (from radiation to heat) and redistributed (from the land surface and atmosphere to the ocean surface) by the atmospheric circulation. This circulation adjustment process is fundamentally responsible for the similar ocean heat flux perturbation patterns between GHGs and aerosols.

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Notably, the fast homogenization described in this work operates primarily within a single hemisphere. The ratio of Northern Hemisphere to Southern Hemisphere TOA ERF does not differ significantly from that of the surface energy perturbation (1.0 and 1.1, respectively, for GHGs and 3.2 and 3.3, respectively, for aerosols). Under fixed-SST conditions, the Hadley circulation, the main mode of atmospheric cross-equatorial transport, cannot readily respond to perturbations
