      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The underlying driver of atmospheric energy redistribution</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our above analysis of the mechanisms of surface pattern correlation demonstrates that
         the atmospheric circulation is an efficient homogenizer of heterogeneous forcings,
         even under fixed-SST conditions. Indeed, a simple energy balance analysis, based on
         energetic constraints alone, illuminates why this atmospheric homogenization must
         occur (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). Because land surface and atmospheric energy perturbations rapidly equilibrate to
         zero, the total ocean surface energy perturbation (Δ
         <span>R</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub> + Δ
         <span>H</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub>, with Δ
         <span>R</span> and Δ
         <span>H</span> denoting the radiative and heat components, respectively) must equal the TOA ERF
         over oceans (ERF
         <span>O</span>) plus that over land (ERF
         <span>L</span>) in the global mean: Δ
         <span>R</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub> + Δ
         <span>H</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub> = ERF
         <span>O</span> + ERF
         <span>L</span>. Vertical longwave and shortwave radiative energy conservation dictates that the
         TOA ERF must equal the sum of the surface radiative perturbation (Δ
         <span>R</span><sub>surf</sub><span>)</span> and any net (i.e., absorption less emission) atmospheric absorption change (ERF = Δ
         <span>R</span><sub>surf</sub> + ΔAA). Thus, the surface heat flux perturbation over ocean will be equal to the
         total atmospheric absorption change over land and ocean plus the land surface radiative
         perturbation (Δ
         <span>H</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub> = ΔAA
         <span>O+L</span> + Δ
         <span>R</span><span>L</span><sub>surf</sub>), a balance that is evident in our simulations (Table 
         <a>1</a>). This coupling between the atmospheric and surface energetics over the land and
         the ocean dictates that most of the spatial heterogeneity in the initial TOA forcing
         cannot be maintained in the response and must be rapidly transformed (from radiation
         to heat) and redistributed (from the land surface and atmosphere to the ocean surface)
         by the atmospheric circulation. This circulation adjustment process is fundamentally
         responsible for the similar ocean heat flux perturbation patterns between GHGs and
         aerosols.

               <p>Energy balance constraints on surface heat flux patterns. The top-of-atmosphere (TOA)
                  effective radiative forcings (ERF) over land and ocean (ERF
                  <span>L/O</span>) must equal the surface radiative perturbation (∆
                  <span>R</span><span>L/O</span><sub>surf</sub>) plus any atmospheric absorption (∆AA
                  <span>L/O</span>) by vertical radiative energy conservation. Because the atmosphere and land surface
                  cannot store energy long-term (
                  <span>R</span><span>L</span><sub>surf</sub> + 
                  <span>H</span><span>L</span><sub>surf</sub> = 0, assuming positive downward sign convention), the TOA ERFs must be balanced through
                  the ocean surface energy perturbation (
                  <span>R</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub> + 
                  <span>H</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub>). The ocean heat flux perturbation (
                  <span>H</span><span>O</span><sub>surf</sub>) will, therefore, be responsible for balancing the total atmospheric absorption change
                  plus the land surface radiative perturbation

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Notably, the fast homogenization described in this work operates primarily within
         a single hemisphere. The ratio of Northern Hemisphere to Southern Hemisphere TOA ERF
         does not differ significantly from that of the surface energy perturbation (1.0 and
         1.1, respectively, for GHGs and 3.2 and 3.3, respectively, for aerosols). Under fixed-SST
         conditions, the Hadley circulation, the main mode of atmospheric cross-equatorial
         transport, cannot readily respond to perturbations
