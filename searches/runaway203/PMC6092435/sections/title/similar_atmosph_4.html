      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The common pattern of surface heat flux change in response to each forcer is a manifestation
         of a wave perturbation to the atmospheric circulation that is produced by both GHGs
         and aerosols. Over the extratropical oceans, a barotropic stationary Rossby wave perturbation
         to the atmospheric flow, consistent with the wave pattern in surface heat fluxes,
         is evident in alternating positive and negative anomalies collocated in sea level
         pressure (SLP) and in geopotential height at the 500-hpa pressure level (
         <span>Z</span><sub>500</sub>) for both forcers (Fig. 
         <a>3a, b</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>2a, b</a>). The patterns of SLP and 
         <span>Z</span><sub>500</sub> perturbations due to GHGs and aerosols are correlated at 
         <span>R</span> = −0.44 and 
         <span>R</span> = −0.71, respectively, during the Northern Hemisphere summertime when spatial correlation
         of Δ
         <span>S</span> is highest. Surface winds and temperature and specific humidity gradients between
         the surface and air, the primary controllers of surface heat fluxes, also exhibit
         strong wave patterns in the extratropics (Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>3</a> and 
         <a>4</a>)—a consequence of the changes in extratropical atmospheric flow demonstrated in the
         SLP and 
         <span>Z</span><sub>500</sub> anomalies. SLP and 
         <span>Z</span><sub>500</sub> pattern correlations are weaker during the Southern Hemisphere summertime (
         <span>R</span> = −0.25* and 
         <span>R</span> = −0.11*, respectively) and in the annual mean (
         <span>R</span> = −0.19* and 
         <span>R</span> = −0.52, respectively), consistent with the seasonal dependence of the Δ
         <span>S</span> pattern correlation.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rossby wave perturbations to the extratropical atmospheric flow can occur via wave
         sources located either in the extratropics or in the tropics. Wave excitation within
         the extratropics can result from changes in extratropical land–sea thermal and diabatic
         heating contrast caused by land surface temperature adjustments to forcing under the
         constraint of fixed SSTs
         <span><a>8</a>,
            <a>9</a></span>. Excitation of extratropical waves from within the tropics, meanwhile, can occur
         due to changes in tropical deep convection and precipitation (and thus atmospheric
         latent heating), the signal from which then propagates into the extratropics
         <span><a>10</a>–
            <a>13</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GHGs and aerosols trigger these wave sources antisymmetrically. In the extratropics,
         the location of the landmasses serves as a potent fixed wave source in the presence
         of both forcers. The Northern Hemisphere summertime land–sea contrast (
         <span>T</span><sub>L/S</sub>, quantified as the climatologically positive hemispheric-mean difference between
         land and ocean surface temperatures) decreases in the presence of aerosols (Δ
         <span>T</span><sub>L/S</sub> = −0.37 K) and increases in the presence of GHGs (Δ
         <span>T</span><sub>L/S</sub> = 0.35 K). This perturbation to the climatological land–sea contrast constitutes
         a diabatic heating anomaly that acts as an extratropical source of Rossby waves
         <span><a>8</a></span>. The surface temperature response to GHGs and aerosols (Fig. 
         <a>3c, d</a>) is constrained to the land in these prescribed SST runs. However, the land surface
         temperature response to the two forcers is spatially anti-correlated (
         <span>R</span> = −0.56, in the Northern Hemisphere summertime mean), likely constrained by local
         surface energy availability
         <span><a>14</a></span> and regional sensitivities and feedbacks that are largely forcing independent
         <span><a>15</a></span>. The substantially weaker spatial correlation of surface energy flux patterns during
         the Northern Hemisphere winter-time (DJF) may be attributable to the higher variability
         and greater influence of transient eddies on stationary Rossby wave patterns during
         the Northern Hemisphere wintertime
         <span><a>16</a></span>, which decreases the influence of the land–sea contrast mechanism proposed here.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the tropics, changes in deep tropical (20°S–20°N) precipitation due to GHGs and
         aerosols can also act as a source for extratropical Rossby waves. The fact that the
         simulated deep tropical precipitation changes are indeed antisymmetric (
         <span>R</span> = −0.54) (Fig. 
         <a>3e, f</a>) may contribute to the similar extratropical wave patterns. Interestingly, it is
         not straightforward why the two forcers would give rise to antisymmetric, rather than
         symmetric, precipitation changes. In fact, a thermodynamic scaling argument suggests
         the opposite: under fixed-SST conditions, both GHGs and aerosols increase tropospheric
         absorption of radiative energy, via increased absorption of longwave radiation in
         the case of GHGs and of shortwave radiation in the case of aerosols, and thus have
         suppressing effects on tropical mean precipitation
         <span><a>11</a>,
            <a>17</a>–
            <a>19</a></span>. Indeed, in our simulations, both forcers decrease tropical mean precipitation (by
         −1.2% for present-day GHGs and −0.74% for present-day aerosols).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our view, the antisymmetric spatial pattern of these precipitation reductions is
         driven mainly by the opposite land–SST contrast patterns (Fig. 
         <a>3c, d</a>) and associated monsoonal circulation changes, which are dynamical in nature. The
         aerosol cools the land surface relative to the ocean, decreasing rainfall preferentially
         over the land surface, while the GHGs warm the land surface relative to the ocean,
         increasing the rainfall preferentially over the land surface. Analysis as part of
         the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project finds similar
         behavior and mechanisms in the fast precipitation response to individual forcers
         <span><a>20</a></span>, as does analysis of future impacts of GHG and aerosol forcing in the CMIP5 archive
         <span><a>21</a></span>. Other, finer-scale features of the fast response to GHGs and aerosols that are evident
         in our simulations have also been confirmed in other analyses, such as weakening of
         the South Asian monsoon in the fast response to historical aerosol emissions
         <span><a>22</a></span>.
