  <a rid="t02" ref-type="table" href="#t02">Table 2</a>) as end members of a mixing curve, we can derive a first-order approximation of the relative contribution needed to support a pelagic microbial assemblage with a specific Fe:P composition. Assuming that the suspended particulate matter Fe:P (0.004–0.005:1; 
  <a rid="t02" ref-type="table" href="#t02">Table 2</a>) is representative of the microbial community integrated biological demand, we derive an atmospheric contribution of ∼0.2–0.4% to the Fe:P
  <sub>i</sub> flux into the mixed layer, with the remaining flux (99.6–99.8%) being driven by nutrient diffusion and mixing at the base of the euphotic zone. This result suggests that interannual variations in the dust deposition rate may have a disproportionate effect on the elemental stoichiometry of the nutrient flux fueling the upper layers of the euphotic zone.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unfortunately, the biogenic particulate export of Fe is poorly constrained due to the overwhelming lithogenic Fe contribution to the particulate flux (
