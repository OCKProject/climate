 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over broad spatial and temporal scales, the elemental stoichiometry of ocean and atmospheric nutrient supply relative to that of biological demand defines the identity of the nutrient limiting the ecosystemâ€™s carrying capacity (

  <a rid="r66" ref-type="bibr" href="#r66">66</a>). For this reason, the uncoupling of nutrient inputs to surface waters through the diffusion and mixing of nutrient-enriched deep waters and from atmospheric sources in vast oligotrophic regions of the ocean may lead to important shifts in microbial diversity and ecosystem structure, without a discernable change in productivity or total biomass (

  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>, 
  <a rid="r67" ref-type="bibr" href="#r67">67</a>) have been explained primarily as ecosystem-level responses to changes in ocean stratification and advection (
  <a rid="r68" ref-type="bibr" href="#r68">68</a>) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5</a>). Our observations suggest that, because this oligotrophic pelagic ecosystem is colimited by P
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> and Fe, changes in atmospheric dust deposition driven by climate variations in basin-scale atmospheric circulation are an important factor in determining the nutrient that ultimately limits its carrying capacity, as well as the metabolic activity of its microbial assemblage. Furthermore, while small changes in Fe supply may lead to changes in cell physiology, larger sustained changes will affect the ecosystem structure and function (
  <a rid="r69" ref-type="bibr" href="#r69">69</a>). Hence, although ocean stratification and advection are important determinants of the pelagic ecosystem structure, our results indicate that the dynamics of atmospheric Fe deposition in this oceanic oligotrophic gyre can also contribute to the regulation of microbial functional diversity with potential cascading effects on new production and CO

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Present climate models reveal that atmospheric pressure gradients over midlatitudes in the Northern Hemisphere will change in response to the warming of the Arctic Ocean (
  <a rid="r70" ref-type="bibr" href="#r70">70</a>). Furthermore, secular trends in anthropogenic aerosol emissions rich in soluble Fe and fixed N, as well as in land desertification, may also lead to shifts in nutrient limitation in open ocean oligotrophic ecosystems (
  <a rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" href="#r54">54</a>, 
  <a rid="r71" ref-type="bibr" href="#r71">71</a>). To develop accurate ecosystem and biogeochemical models that help constrain uncertainties on the temporal evolution of these vast open ocean biomes, there is a need to improve our understanding of how changes in atmospheric pressure gradients and anthropogenic activity will affect the source, transport, and deposition of dust Fe and pollutants into the oligotrophic ocean and, in turn, how long-term shifts in atmospheric deposition will translate to ecosystem structure and function, affecting the biological coupling of energy and elemental cycles.
