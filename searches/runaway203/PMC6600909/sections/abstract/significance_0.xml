 <p>Characterizing the mechanisms driving spatial and temporal changes in the stoichiometry of nutrient supply is crucial to understand the controls of an ecosystemâ€™s carrying capacity and productivity. In marine oligotrophic regions, small changes in the ocean and atmospheric nutrient input ratio can shift the nature of the limiting nutrient. The present study documents such a shift at interannual scales between periods of phosphorus limitation and sufficiency in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. These shifts appear to be driven by interannual variations in the transport of iron-rich Asian dust across the North Pacific resulting from basin-scale changes in atmospheric pressure gradients, as reflected by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index, causing the ecosystem to oscillate between phosphorus and iron limitation.</p>
