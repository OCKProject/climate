 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What could be the root driver of the above changes? To investigate this, we analyse two sets of forced AMIP simulations: the first with 4 × CO
  <sub>2</sub> and the second with a 4 K warmer ocean. In the former, energy is injected immediately everywhere into the atmosphere, whereas in the latter the energy is stored in the ocean and may then affect the atmosphere through surface interactions. In the 4 × CO
  <sub>2</sub> runs, there is no significant change in 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> or 
  <span class="italic">θ</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Therefore, the greenhouse enhancement does not appear to radically alter the dynamical properties of atmospheric motions. There is instead a significant change in the dynamical properties when the ocean is 4 K warmer. In this world, which one may imagine akin to a Turkish bath, or hammam, the local dimension decreases (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and the inverse persistence increases (not shown). An intuitive explanation for this phenomenon could be that a warmer ocean implies a stronger mid-latitude jet and the partial suppression of meridional patterns, such as blocking or Atlantic Ridges
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. This leads us to hypothesise that the long-term trends in 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> discussed above may be associated to changes in SSTs, with higher SSTs in the North Atlantic corresponding to lower local dimensions in the atmosphere. We confirm this inference by computing the local dimension of the SSTs from the subset of CMIP5 models that have both pre-industrial control and 4 K warmer ocean runs. We find a significant increase in the average 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SST</sub> across the warmer simulations, pointing to concomitant and opposite in sign variations in the atmospheric and oceanic local dimensions, at least in the models analysed here (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>).

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We next verify whether a clear dependence between SST values and d
  <sub>SST</sub>   is also found in the reanalysis datasets. Above-median values of 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SST</sub> correspond to widespread cold anomalies across the Atlantic basin, while below-median values display anomalies of the opposite sign (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This is not directly comparable to Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>b, as we are looking at SST anomalies here. Nonetheless, it highlights a close coupling between d
  <sub>SST</sub> and basin-wide SSTs. For the historical period, all three reanalysis datasets display rapidly increasing SSTs (not shown), yet only one of these datasets (20CRv2c) displays a significant decrease in 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub>, as seen in the models. This points to differences in the ocean–atmosphere coupling as the key to the discrepancies between the three reanalyses. The CMIP5 simulations are coherent with the coupling found in the 20CRv2c reanalysis, since they display a decreasing 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> trend and a gradual increase in SSTs from the beginning of the historical period to the end of the century
