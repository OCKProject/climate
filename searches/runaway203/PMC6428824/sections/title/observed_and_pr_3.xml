 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first comment on the historical period and the reanalysis datasets (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The absolute values of 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">θ</span> for all datasets are reported in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>. The 20CRv2c ensemble shows a significant decreasing trend in 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub>, whereas the inverse persistence increases only over the early period of the reanalysis, before stabilising. This is possibly an effect of the scarcity of observational data in the 19th century and the consequent large spread of the members
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. The ERA20CM and CERA20C reanalyses broadly agree with 20CRv2c in 
  <span class="italic">θ</span>, as they show a weak neutral and positive trend, respectively, but only cover the period where the 20CRv2c 
  <span class="italic">θ</span> stabilises. Important discrepancies emerge in 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub>: ERA20CM displays no significant trend, while CERA20C displays a significant increasing trend, opposite in sign to the significant decreasing trend seen in 20CRv2c. All three datasets also display large interdecadal fluctuations, with ERA20CM showing a lower variability than the other two. It is encouraging to note that, during the common period, CERA20C shows the same interdecadal variability as 20CRv2c; nonetheless, the discrepancy in the long-term 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> trends between the three reanalyses remains to be explained. The main difference between ERA20CM and CERA20C is the presence, in the latter, of data assimilation and a coupled ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. To save computational time, it is common practice to restart the assimilation process of the reanalyses every 10 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. We speculate that this operation may affect the ocean dynamics because it does not give them time to settle on the attractor, as the trajectory is displaced every 10 years. On the contrary, it affects only marginally the atmosphere-only reanalyses without an active ocean component. This does not, however, explain the differences between ERA20CM and 20CRv2c, which must derive from differences in the numerical models and data assimilation schemes.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The historical CMIP5 simulations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) display a significant decreasing trend in 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub>, whereas 
  <span class="italic">θ</span> shows an increasing, albeit very weak, trend. Unlike the reanalyses, CMIP5 data does not display large interdecadal fluctuations in the two dynamical quantities. This is partly due to the fact that, since we are considering a multi-model mean, the interdecadal fluctuations between individual members average out. However, even when individual historical model runs are analysed, the standard deviations of 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">θ</span> are smaller than in 20CRv2c and CERA20C, and comparable to those of the ERA20CM dataset. These values increase to levels comparable to—or even exceeding—those of the two former datasets in the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We next discuss future climates using CMIP5 simulations run under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, as well as the Community Earth System Model (CESM) RCP 8.5 large ensemble. The CMIP5 models show a significant decreasing trend in 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> and a weak increasing trend in 
  <span class="italic">θ</span> for the RCP 8.5 scenario (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). CESM shows similar results for 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> but no significant change in 
  <span class="italic">θ</span>. There is a large spread among the CESM members—larger in fact than that among the different CMIP5 models. We also note that there is no large difference between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> trends. With the exception of the two ECMWF reanalyses, all datasets therefore display a decrease in 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> throughout the period 1850–2100, albeit in some cases modulated by a marked inter-decadal variability. This trend is primarily associated with the summer (June–August, JJA) and autumn (September–November, SON) seasons (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and Supplementary Tables 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Overall, the datasets with decreasing trends show a relative variation of 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> of about 5–8%.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to understand the origin of this trend, we revert to the analysis of the atmospheric configurations prevailing in each dataset. In general, high 
  <span class="italic">d</span> are associated with low-predictability meridional configurations, such as blocking or mid-Atlantic ridges. Low 
  <span class="italic">d</span> match instead high-predictability zonal configurations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. A shift of the upper and lower percentiles of the 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> distributions would therefore correspond to an enhanced zonality or meridionality of the flow. To test this idea, we repeat the analysis shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> for the top and bottom five percentiles of the 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> distributions (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). We find that the trends are consistent with those found for the mean values, implying an enhanced zonality of the flow associated with a decrease in mean 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub>. These results are also consistent with the dominant role of the summer and autumn seasons in the 
  <span class="italic">d</span> trends. Indeed, the summer NAO displays a long-term trend towards more positive values in the future, corresponding to an enhanced zonality of the flow
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. A future year-round increase in flow zonality over the North Atlantic, peaking in autumn, was also found by de Vries et al. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. The dynamical significance of our results is illustrated by Faranda et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>, where a low-dimensional model of the jet dynamics over the northern hemisphere is derived. The authors found that the jet dynamics is sensitive to small shifts in a control parameter (the meridional temperature gradient) and that the dimension 
  <span class="italic">d</span> is proportional to the number of discontinuities of the jet (a proxy of blocking). Finally, the observed jet dynamics correspond to a region of the parameter space that is sensitive to perturbations, where small changes in the dimension correspond to large dynamical changes. In the dynamical system jargon, this means that the system is close to bifurcation points.
