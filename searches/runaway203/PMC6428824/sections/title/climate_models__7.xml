  <sub>2</sub> atmosphere-only (AMIP) simulations. The historical simulations cover the period 1850–2000; the forcings are consistent with observations and include changes in: atmospheric composition due to anthropogenic and volcanic influences, solar forcing, emissions or concentrations of short-lived species and natural and anthropogenic aerosols or their precursors, as well as land use. RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 projections are projections of future climates (2006–2100) forced by two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. These result in a radiative forcing of 4.5 and 8.5 W m

AMIP simulations cover the 1979–2005 period and are performed by prescribing SSTs and sea ice boundary conditions to an atmosphere-only model. +4 K simulations impose a uniform 4 K warming to observed SSTs, while the 4 × CO
  <sub>2</sub> simulations impose quadrupled atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations relative to the pre-industrial control value of 280 ppm. We additionally analyse a 32-member ensemble of simulations from the CESM

  <span class="italic">θ</span> trends over the whole CESM period as opposed to performing separate analyses for historical and future trends.
