  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis is based on two dynamical systems metrics: the local (in phase space) dimension 
   <span class="italic">d</span> and the persistence 
   <span class="italic">θ</span>
   <span class="sup">−1</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>. In simple terms, they describe the recurrences of a system around a state 
   <span class="italic">ζ</span> in phase space. In our case, 
   <span class="italic">ζ</span> would be a latitude–longitude map of a given variable for a given day and dataset. Values of 
   <span class="italic">d</span> and 
   <span class="italic">θ</span>
   <span class="sup">−1</span> are obtained for every time-step (i.e. every state 
   <span class="italic">ζ</span>) in the dataset of interest. 
   <span class="italic">d</span> provides information on how the system can reach 
   <span class="italic">ζ</span> and how it can evolve from 
   <span class="italic">ζ</span>, and is a proxy for the system’s active number of degrees of freedom. This information is intrinsically linked to the predictability of 
   <span class="italic">ζ</span>, but is local in nature. 
   <span class="italic">d</span> can change rapidly over timescales of a few days meaning that, when applied to atmospheric fields, it cannot be interpreted in the same way as the error of a medium-range weather forecast initialised from 
   <span class="italic">ζ</span>. 
   <span class="italic">θ</span>
   <span class="sup">−1</span> describes the persistence of 
   <span class="italic">ζ</span> in time. A very persistent state is typically highly predictable, while a very unstable state yields low persistence. In this sense, the information provided by 
   <span class="italic">θ</span>
   <span class="sup">−1</span> is more directly linked to that provided by the error of a forecast initialised from 
   <span class="italic">ζ</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span>. 
   <span class="italic">d</span> and 
   <span class="italic">θ</span>
   <span class="sup">−1</span> therefore provide complementary information on the intrinsic predictability of an instantaneous state of the atmosphere. Details of how these two metrics are computed are provided in the Methods. We compute the above two dynamical systems metrics for the sea-level pressure field in the North Atlantic region (22.5°N–70°N and 80°W–50°E) for several datasets. These include the three longest reanalysis ensembles available over our domain, namely: the National Ocean and Atmosphere Administration’s (NOAA) atmospheric reanalysis of the twentieth century (20CRv2c)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
   </span> with 56 members covering the period 1851–2014; the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts’ (ECMWF) atmospheric model integrations of the twentieth century (ERA20CM, as ERA20C but with no synoptic meteorological data assimilated and all observational information incorporated in the boundary conditions and forcing
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span>), with 10 members covering the period 1900–2100; and ECMWF’s coupled climate reanalysis of the twentieth century (CERA20C)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span> with 10 members covering the period 1900–2010. They are complemented by a suite of state-of-the-art climate model simulations, including Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) model simulations from 1850 to 2100 (see Methods and Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> for the exact periods used in this study). The choice of region is motivated by the greater abundance of observations in the North Atlantic during the historical period than in other parts of the globe. The choice of SLP is similarly motivated by the fact that it is well constrained in the long reanalyses, as well as being representative of the main large-scale variability modes and atmospheric features of the North Atlantic region
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span>. The versatility of our metrics allows for their use in transient simulations with different horizontal resolutions, without the need for regridding or detrending. In order to corroborate our findings, we further analyse AMIP simulations with atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations increased by a factor four and ocean temperatures increased by 4 K. In ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
   </span> and in this study 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> ~12–13 for the North Atlantic. This is consistent with the results of ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span> that demonstrate that the low-frequency variability in the Northern Hemisphere is spanned by around half-a-score empirical normal modes, with growth rates of around 3–5 days in phase space.
  </p>
  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also compute 
   <span class="italic">d</span> for the SST fields of some of the above datasets. Hereafter, we specify whether we are referring to 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> or to 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SST</sub>. We do not adopt this notation for 
   <span class="italic">θ</span> as we compute it for the SLP field only. Finally, we note that the multi-model and ensemble-average 
   <span class="italic">d</span> and 
   <span class="italic">θ</span> discussed below are not the metrics computed on the mean SLP fields, but rather the mean values of the metrics computed on the SLP fields of each model or ensemble member. This avoids introducing spurious trends in the data

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first comment on the historical period and the reanalysis datasets (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The absolute values of 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">θ</span> for all datasets are reported in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>. The 20CRv2c ensemble shows a significant decreasing trend in 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub>, whereas the inverse persistence increases only over the early period of the reanalysis, before stabilising. This is possibly an effect of the scarcity of observational data in the 19th century and the consequent large spread of the members
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
   </span>. The ERA20CM and CERA20C reanalyses broadly agree with 20CRv2c in 
   <span class="italic">θ</span>, as they show a weak neutral and positive trend, respectively, but only cover the period where the 20CRv2c 
   <span class="italic">θ</span> stabilises. Important discrepancies emerge in 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub>: ERA20CM displays no significant trend, while CERA20C displays a significant increasing trend, opposite in sign to the significant decreasing trend seen in 20CRv2c. All three datasets also display large interdecadal fluctuations, with ERA20CM showing a lower variability than the other two. It is encouraging to note that, during the common period, CERA20C shows the same interdecadal variability as 20CRv2c; nonetheless, the discrepancy in the long-term 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> trends between the three reanalyses remains to be explained. The main difference between ERA20CM and CERA20C is the presence, in the latter, of data assimilation and a coupled ocean
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span>. To save computational time, it is common practice to restart the assimilation process of the reanalyses every 10 years
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span>. We speculate that this operation may affect the ocean dynamics because it does not give them time to settle on the attractor, as the trajectory is displaced every 10 years. On the contrary, it affects only marginally the atmosphere-only reanalyses without an active ocean component. This does not, however, explain the differences between ERA20CM and 20CRv2c, which must derive from differences in the numerical models and data assimilation schemes.

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and Table

   <sub>SLP</sub>, whereas 
   <span class="italic">θ</span> shows an increasing, albeit very weak, trend. Unlike the reanalyses, CMIP5 data does not display large interdecadal fluctuations in the two dynamical quantities. This is partly due to the fact that, since we are considering a multi-model mean, the interdecadal fluctuations between individual members average out. However, even when individual historical model runs are analysed, the standard deviations of 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">θ</span> are smaller than in 20CRv2c and CERA20C, and comparable to those of the ERA20CM dataset. These values increase to levels comparable to—or even exceeding—those of the two former datasets in the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios.
  </p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We next discuss future climates using CMIP5 simulations run under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, as well as the Community Earth System Model (CESM) RCP 8.5 large ensemble. The CMIP5 models show a significant decreasing trend in

   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> but no significant change in 
   <span class="italic">θ</span>. There is a large spread among the CESM members—larger in fact than that among the different CMIP5 models. We also note that there is no large difference between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> trends. With the exception of the two ECMWF reanalyses, all datasets therefore display a decrease in 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> throughout the period 1850–2100, albeit in some cases modulated by a marked inter-decadal variability. This trend is primarily associated with the summer (June–August, JJA) and autumn (September–November, SON) seasons (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and Supplementary Tables 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> and

   <sub>SLP</sub> of about 5–8%.
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to understand the origin of this trend, we revert to the analysis of the atmospheric configurations prevailing in each dataset. In general, high 
   <span class="italic">d</span> are associated with low-predictability meridional configurations, such as blocking or mid-Atlantic ridges. Low 
   <span class="italic">d</span> match instead high-predictability zonal configurations

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
   </span>. A shift of the upper and lower percentiles of the 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> distributions would therefore correspond to an enhanced zonality or meridionality of the flow. To test this idea, we repeat the analysis shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> for the top and bottom five percentiles of the 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> distributions (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). We find that the trends are consistent with those found for the mean values, implying an enhanced zonality of the flow associated with a decrease in mean 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub>. These results are also consistent with the dominant role of the summer and autumn seasons in the 
   <span class="italic">d</span> trends. Indeed, the summer NAO displays a long-term trend towards more positive values in the future, corresponding to an enhanced zonality of the flow
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
   </span>. A future year-round increase in flow zonality over the North Atlantic, peaking in autumn, was also found by de Vries et al. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span>. The dynamical significance of our results is illustrated by Faranda et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>, where a low-dimensional model of the jet dynamics over the northern hemisphere is derived. The authors found that the jet dynamics is sensitive to small shifts in a control parameter (the meridional temperature gradient) and that the dimension 
   <span class="italic">d</span> is proportional to the number of discontinuities of the jet (a proxy of blocking). Finally, the observed jet dynamics correspond to a region of the parameter space that is sensitive to perturbations, where small changes in the dimension correspond to large dynamical changes. In the dynamical system jargon, this means that the system is close to bifurcation points.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hammam effect</div>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What could be the root driver of the above changes? To investigate this, we analyse two sets of forced AMIP simulations: the first with 4 × CO
   <sub>2</sub> and the second with a 4 K warmer ocean. In the former, energy is injected immediately everywhere into the atmosphere, whereas in the latter the energy is stored in the ocean and may then affect the atmosphere through surface interactions. In the 4 × CO
   <sub>2</sub> runs, there is no significant change in 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> or 
   <span class="italic">θ</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Therefore, the greenhouse enhancement does not appear to radically alter the dynamical properties of atmospheric motions. There is instead a significant change in the dynamical properties when the ocean is 4 K warmer. In this world, which one may imagine akin to a Turkish bath, or hammam, the local dimension decreases (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and the inverse persistence increases (not shown). An intuitive explanation for this phenomenon could be that a warmer ocean implies a stronger mid-latitude jet and the partial suppression of meridional patterns, such as blocking or Atlantic Ridges
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
   </span>. This leads us to hypothesise that the long-term trends in 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> discussed above may be associated to changes in SSTs, with higher SSTs in the North Atlantic corresponding to lower local dimensions in the atmosphere. We confirm this inference by computing the local dimension of the SSTs from the subset of CMIP5 models that have both pre-industrial control and 4 K warmer ocean runs. We find a significant increase in the average 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SST</sub> across the warmer simulations, pointing to concomitant and opposite in sign variations in the atmospheric and oceanic local dimensions, at least in the models analysed here (Fig.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We next verify whether a clear dependence between SST values and d
   <sub>SST</sub>   is also found in the reanalysis datasets. Above-median values of 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SST</sub> correspond to widespread cold anomalies across the Atlantic basin, while below-median values display anomalies of the opposite sign (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This is not directly comparable to Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>b, as we are looking at SST anomalies here. Nonetheless, it highlights a close coupling between d
   <sub>SST</sub> and basin-wide SSTs. For the historical period, all three reanalysis datasets display rapidly increasing SSTs (not shown), yet only one of these datasets (20CRv2c) displays a significant decrease in 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub>, as seen in the models. This points to differences in the ocean–atmosphere coupling as the key to the discrepancies between the three reanalyses. The CMIP5 simulations are coherent with the coupling found in the 20CRv2c reanalysis, since they display a decreasing 
   <span class="italic">d</span>
   <sub>SLP</sub> trend and a gradual increase in SSTs from the beginning of the historical period to the end of the century
