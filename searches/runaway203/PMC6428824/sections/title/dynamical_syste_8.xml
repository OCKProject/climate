 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The attractor of a dynamical system is a geometric object defined in the space hosting all the possible states of the system (phase-space). Each point 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span> on the attractor can be characterised by two dynamical indicators: the local dimension (
  <span class="italic">d</span>), which indicates the number of degrees of freedom active locally around 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span>, and the persistence (
  <span class="italic">θ</span>
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), a measure of the mean residence time of the system around
