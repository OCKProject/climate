 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis is based on two dynamical systems metrics: the local (in phase space) dimension 
  <span class="italic">d</span> and the persistence 
  <span class="italic">θ</span>
  <span class="sup">−1</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. In simple terms, they describe the recurrences of a system around a state 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span> in phase space. In our case, 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span> would be a latitude–longitude map of a given variable for a given day and dataset. Values of 
  <span class="italic">d</span> and 
  <span class="italic">θ</span>
  <span class="sup">−1</span> are obtained for every time-step (i.e. every state 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span>) in the dataset of interest. 
  <span class="italic">d</span> provides information on how the system can reach 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span> and how it can evolve from 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span>, and is a proxy for the system’s active number of degrees of freedom. This information is intrinsically linked to the predictability of 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span>, but is local in nature. 
  <span class="italic">d</span> can change rapidly over timescales of a few days meaning that, when applied to atmospheric fields, it cannot be interpreted in the same way as the error of a medium-range weather forecast initialised from 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span>. 
  <span class="italic">θ</span>
  <span class="sup">−1</span> describes the persistence of 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span> in time. A very persistent state is typically highly predictable, while a very unstable state yields low persistence. In this sense, the information provided by 
  <span class="italic">θ</span>
  <span class="sup">−1</span> is more directly linked to that provided by the error of a forecast initialised from 
  <span class="italic">ζ</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. 
  <span class="italic">d</span> and 
  <span class="italic">θ</span>
  <span class="sup">−1</span> therefore provide complementary information on the intrinsic predictability of an instantaneous state of the atmosphere. Details of how these two metrics are computed are provided in the Methods. We compute the above two dynamical systems metrics for the sea-level pressure field in the North Atlantic region (22.5°N–70°N and 80°W–50°E) for several datasets. These include the three longest reanalysis ensembles available over our domain, namely: the National Ocean and Atmosphere Administration’s (NOAA) atmospheric reanalysis of the twentieth century (20CRv2c)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> with 56 members covering the period 1851–2014; the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts’ (ECMWF) atmospheric model integrations of the twentieth century (ERA20CM, as ERA20C but with no synoptic meteorological data assimilated and all observational information incorporated in the boundary conditions and forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>), with 10 members covering the period 1900–2100; and ECMWF’s coupled climate reanalysis of the twentieth century (CERA20C)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> with 10 members covering the period 1900–2010. They are complemented by a suite of state-of-the-art climate model simulations, including Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) model simulations from 1850 to 2100 (see Methods and Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> for the exact periods used in this study). The choice of region is motivated by the greater abundance of observations in the North Atlantic during the historical period than in other parts of the globe. The choice of SLP is similarly motivated by the fact that it is well constrained in the long reanalyses, as well as being representative of the main large-scale variability modes and atmospheric features of the North Atlantic region
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. The versatility of our metrics allows for their use in transient simulations with different horizontal resolutions, without the need for regridding or detrending. In order to corroborate our findings, we further analyse AMIP simulations with atmospheric CO

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span> and in this study 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> ~12–13 for the North Atlantic. This is consistent with the results of ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> that demonstrate that the low-frequency variability in the Northern Hemisphere is spanned by around half-a-score empirical normal modes, with growth rates of around 3–5 days in phase space.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also compute 
  <span class="italic">d</span> for the SST fields of some of the above datasets. Hereafter, we specify whether we are referring to 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> or to 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SST</sub>. We do not adopt this notation for 
  <span class="italic">θ</span> as we compute it for the SLP field only. Finally, we note that the multi-model and ensemble-average 
  <span class="italic">d</span> and 
  <span class="italic">θ</span> discussed below are not the metrics computed on the mean SLP fields, but rather the mean values of the metrics computed on the SLP fields of each model or ensemble member. This avoids introducing spurious trends in the data

  </span>. Since we are interested in long-term changes in predictability, we apply a 5-year running average to each quantity.
