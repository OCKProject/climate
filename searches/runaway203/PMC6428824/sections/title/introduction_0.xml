 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Will the difficulty of forecasting weather be affected by climate change? To answer this question, the first step is to recognise the chaotic nature of atmospheric dynamics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Despite the increase in resolution and complexity of weather forecast systems, atmospheric forecasts face an insurmountable predictability limit
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. This stems from the intrinsic properties of the atmospheric attractor—a high-dimensional geometric object on which all the possible atmospheric states settle—and is often referred to as the “butterfly effect”, or dependence on initial conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Atmospheric turbulence injects energy at all spatial and temporal scales, generating chaos and limiting short-term predictability. Predictability further depends on space and time, so that the detection and interpretation of changes is extremely complex
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Indeed, predictability is not a constant, and can be strongly affected by the large-scale atmospheric configuration from which the forecast is initialised
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. For example, mid-latitude transitions from blocked to zonal atmospheric states are less predictable than a persistent large-scale zonal flow
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. By large-scale zonal flow, we refer to a strong eastward (zonal) jet with few meridional oscillations. If the proportion of predictable vs. unpredictable patterns were to change under anthropogenic forcing, the atmosphere’s intrinsic predictability would also change accordingly. The task of diagnosing changes in atmospheric predictability—and more generally in mid-latitude atmospheric dynamics—under anthropogenic forcing is therefore beset with difficulties
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Achieving this when focusing on averaged quantities, such as climate variability indices, presents serious challenges
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we diagnose predictability by relying on two objective metrics that sample the properties of the atmospheric attractor. Such metrics provide information on the number of active degrees of freedom of the system and on the typical timescales of the flow, and hence a measure of the intrinsic predictability of an atmospheric state. This is in contrast to predictability defined relative to the performance of a numerical weather prediction model. Computing such metrics was a major challenge until recently
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. However, advances in dynamical systems theory now allow us to compute them for instantaneous atmospheric states
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Their calculation is based on analogues, or recurrences, of instantaneous (weather) patterns. Recent results have demonstrated their effectiveness in classifying weather patterns leading to climate extremes in the North Atlantic region
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, as well as hemisphere-wide atmospheric variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We specifically focus on evaluating changes in the intrinsic predictability of the atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic under anthropogenic forcing, as represented by the above dynamical systems indicators. In the historical period, there is disagreement between reanalysis datasets. For the future period, most of the projections analysed here point to an increase in the atmosphere’s intrinsic predictability. The analysis of Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) simulations with 4 K warmer oceans and four times atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations points to the prominent role of a warmer ocean in driving this increase. We name this robust signal the hammam effect. This occurs through the enhancement of zonal atmospheric patterns, which are more predictable than meridional configurations.
