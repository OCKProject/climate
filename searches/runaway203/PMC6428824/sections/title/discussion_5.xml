 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have shown that the atmospheric circulation’s intrinsic predictability in the North Atlantic has increased in the recent past, and will continue to do so in a future with continued high levels of anthropogenic emissions. The local dimension 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub>, which we take to be representative of large-scale atmospheric motions, decreases. At the same time, the persistence 
  <span class="italic">θ</span>
  <span class="sup">−1</span> shows a weaker decrease. Thus, the effect of increasing dimension dominates. The main driver of the trend in 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> appears to be the warmer (Atlantic) SSTs, which act to strengthen the zonality of the large-scale atmospheric flow and reduce the meridional patterns responsible for the more unpredictable situations. Warmer SSTs also correspond to more predictable atmospheric configurations, since 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> is lower for warmer ocean states. We named this robust response the hammam effect.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It remains to explain why an increase in the temperature of the climate system, which corresponds to an increase in the Reynolds number for turbulent flows, could lead to more predictable states. For most of the flows, increasing the Reynolds number corresponds to an increase of the number of degrees of freedom. However, there are several examples of the opposite behaviour. A first example is the von Karman flow dynamics: Faranda et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span> showed that there is a region of very high Reynolds number where a low-dimensional dynamics emerges out of featureless turbulence. Another example is provided by Faranda et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> who analysed the jet stream dynamics using a low-dimensional model obtained by embedding the data. The bifurcation sequence, when increasing the control parameter (a surrogate of the Reynolds number), evolves from a high-dimensional noisy fixed point to a lower dimensional structure where the dynamics of the jet switches between blocked and zonal flows. Possible explanations of these phenomena of noise-induced order are investigated in the framework of stochastic dynamical systems

  </span>.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our conclusions come with some caveats. First, the ECMWF reanalyses do not show a decrease in dimensionality, but rather show either an increase of 
  <span class="italic">d</span>
  <sub>SLP</sub> with time (CERA20C) or no trend (ERA20CM). Although the ERA20CM trend is compatible with those observed in some of the CMIP5 models, the CERA20C case is unique amongst the analysed data. We hypothesise that this may be due to the way the observations are assimilated into the reanalyses. For example, they are reinitialised every ten years, possibly leaving the ocean in an unstable transient state. Differences in ocean–atmosphere coupling between the reanalysis datasets may also play an important role. Moreover, our analysis does not allow us to draw conclusions concerning the global circulation nor small-scale phenomena. Indeed, it relates more to the predictability of large-scale motions than to conventional weather predictability, although a relevant correlation between the variation of local dimensions and persistence and the spread in numerical forecasts of SLP fields exists
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Finally, the validity of our results is restricted to the North Atlantic region, chosen because of the comparative abundance of observational data during the early reanalysis period. This is, however, also a strength of our methodology: the possibility of focusing on a specific region and scale by choosing the appropriate observable fields allows for future targeted studies addressing changes in predictability occurring, for example, in tropical or monsoonal regions, as well as analyses of the role of small-scale phenomena.
