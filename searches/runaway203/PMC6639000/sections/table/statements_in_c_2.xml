It should be noted that there is significantly polarized debate on the issue among scientists. Students should be justifiably cautious about accepting unsubstantiated claims about global warming. This issue provides an opportunity to engage students in the patterns of behaviour that occur within science during what can be termed a “crisis” situation.” [
