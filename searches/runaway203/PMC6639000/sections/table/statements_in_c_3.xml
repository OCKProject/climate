     <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Not all the projected effects of climate change are negative. Ontario is a major farming province, with over 82 000 farmers and 5.5 million hectares under cultivation … As climate change brings warmer temperatures, the length of the growing season will increase, and farmers will be able to increase crop yields and grow crops that require more heat. As the sea ice on the Arctic Ocean melts, the Northwest Passage shipping route will be open water every summer. Sailing through the Arctic islands will substantially shorten the shipping distance from Europe to China and Japan, reducing the cost of transporting goods. Cruise ships can sail farther north than before, so tourists can follow in the wake of Arctic explorers such as Henry Hudson and John Franklin.</td>
