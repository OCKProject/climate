 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that most Canadian secondary school curricula did not provide full coverage of six core topics associated with increased concern for the issue of climate change. Our analysis of curriculum documents revealed no clear pattern between the politics of a province and their curricular coverage of climate change. This is consistent with the statements provided by curriculum writers who described a curriculum design process that is independent of partisan direction. Textbooks and curriculum documents, however, often contained statements that might cause students to doubt the very robust existing consensus in the scientific community on the human causes of climate change and its negative impacts and risks.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Curriculum analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earlier we noted that while scientists and the Canadian government consider climate change to be a serious issue, concern for climate change is not overwhelming amongst young Canadians. One hypothesis that has been considered for the small risk perception associated with climate change is a lack of scientific literacy [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref066">66</a>]. Taken further, this hypothesis suggests that in order to solve the issue of apathy towards climate change we need more science education. However, Kahan et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref067">67</a>] found that scientific literacy does not correlate with concern for climate change among adults, but instead correlates with high polarization on the issue. However, among children ages 11 to 14, increased knowledge of climate change specifically (not general scientific literacy) is correlated with increased acceptance of the anthropogenic cause of climate change, and risk perception of climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref068">68</a>]. It is conjectured that this age-related discrepancy is due to the lack of ideological constraints at a young age. This is further evidenced by examples of teachers who do not themselves believe in anthropogenic climate change delivering climate change material to students who deduce anthropogenic causes independent of the beliefs of their teachers [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref069">69</a>]. Since education offers a way to promote acceptance of agreed upon concepts, it is important that teachers are instructed (through curriculum documents) to present the most relevant material regarding climate change.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our review of curriculum documents, we listed six core teaching topics related to climate change, five of which were associated with support for mitigation policies (see 
   <a rid="pone.0218305.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218305.t001">Table 1</a>). The remaining topic (It’s climate) simply describes those learning objectives associated with scientific literacy about the general climate, such as the existence and function of ocean currents, or the greenhouse effect. If scientific knowledge did lead to concern about climate change, then this focus on climate knowledge would be sufficient. However, studies have shown that knowledge about the environment does not lead to action for the environment [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref070">70</a>] nor for climate change mitigation [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref067">67</a>]. Yet we see that many provinces neglect to choose standards that go beyond scientific literacy and would actually lead to increased concern or action for climate change in their student populations. Instead they focus solely on what Kaiser and Fuhrer [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref044">44</a>] describe as declarative knowledge, when procedural or effectiveness knowledge (“We can fix it”) would lead to increased environmental citizenship practices. This is consistent with our review of international studies, which also found an emphasis on knowledge at the expense of civic-oriented teachings. We therefore suggest that as curriculum documents are revised in various provinces, more emphasis should be placed on “It’s warming”, “It’s us”, “It’s bad”, “Experts agree” and especially on “We can fix it”. In this process, the curriculum of Saskatchewan may serve as a model, as it performed best in our analysis.
  </p>
  <sec id="sec017" class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limitations in the curriculum analysis</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This analysis does not provide a complete picture on climate change education in secondary schools in Canada. Only curriculum documents that were available on government websites were examined, which would exclude locally developed courses (courses which are created for a small area or even a single school). International Baccalaureate courses, which are offered at 156 of the 3400 (or 4%) secondary schools in Canada [
    <a rid="pone.0218305.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref071">71</a>], and Advanced Placement courses, which are taken by less than 1% of Canadian secondary students [
    <a rid="pone.0218305.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref072">72</a>], were also not considered. Finally, it should be noted when comparing the different curricula that a province which covers more core teaching topics is not necessarily giving a more thorough treatment of climate change than a province covering fewer topics. For instance, British Columbia covers three topics, but does so in a mandatory course, while Alberta covers four topics, but in a course that not every student will take. In some provinces climate change may have received a more detailed treatment in a different course, for instance in a geography or social science course, or prior to the secondary level. However, we only examined science courses.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses such as this one also have temporal limitations: they are snapshots in time, and curriculum development is an ongoing effort. For instance, in June 2018 British Columbia published a major update to its science curriculum, with a full transition expected by the 2019/2020 school year [
    <a rid="pone.0218305.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref073">73</a>]. The three mandatory learning objectives shown in 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218305.g001" href="#pone.0218305.g001">Fig 1</a> have been removed from Grade 10 in the draft documents for the new curriculum (though these objectives are retained at the elementary level) while new, optional courses in Grade 11 and 12 cover every core topic except for “Experts agree”. Some of these updates, such as acknowledging the importance of vegetarian diets to climate mitigation, are excellent examples of education making changes to reflect the latest scientific understanding [
    <a rid="pone.0218305.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref004">4</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0218305.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref074">74</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0218305.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref075">75</a>]. Because our interviews with curriculum writers referred to the old curriculum documents we make use of the old curriculum in our analysis, but provide details for the new draft documents in 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218305.s003" href="#pone.0218305.s003">S1 Table</a>.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are also numerous ways of presenting climate change (or environmental education) in the curricula. Some provinces might attempt to infuse such a topic throughout many different courses and grade levels (“mainstreaming”), while others might design one course with a significant environmental component to cover all desired learning objectives. It is also possible that teachers spend more time on environmental issues in other subjects or use climate change as an example in other units in the science curriculum.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But there is some evidence that mainstreaming climate change produces inferior results, and it is better to have dedicated courses or units on important topics. When the Ontario government eliminated the environmental science course, intending for ecological concepts to be taught throughout the curriculum, teachers tended to neglect environmental science in favour of the core curriculum [
    <a rid="pone.0218305.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref076">76</a>]. Another, more recent study consisting of interviews with 11 educators teaching climate change in Alberta found that teachers were already wary of the subject of climate change, partially due to its inherently interdisciplinary nature and the perception of it being a fringe subject in the curriculum [
    <a rid="pone.0218305.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref077">77</a>]. Not all teachers have interdisciplinary training, so spreading environmental issues throughout many courses may result in them not properly addressing those issues. It also eliminates the credibility that the issue gains by being part of the explicit curriculum. Conversely, if teachers receive proper training and feel comfortable integrating these topics, it might prove to be a more effective method. One curriculum development interviewee, for instance, saw the integration of sustainability concepts throughout different grades and courses as a strong, positive characteristic of their province’s education system.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Curriculum development</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of how the curriculum is delivered, and even the practices of those who design the curriculum, Canadian education sometimes tends towards balance rather than evidence (
   <a ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pone.0218305.box002" href="#pone.0218305.box002">Box 2</a>). Being able to weigh the scientific merit of an argument is certainly a useful skill within scientific literacy, but should students be evaluating balance for issues where a scientific consensus already exists? Some members of society may see climate change as bad while others consider it beneficial, but the scientific evidence overwhelmingly points to negative outcomes both for humanity and the biosphere [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref033">33</a>], highlighting that additional warming entails more and longer heatwaves, more intense and more frequent extreme precipitation events, increased ocean acidification and increased sea level rise [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref020">20</a>]. With global temperatures threatening to cause extinction for one in six species [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref042">42</a>] and 250 000 human deaths per year predicted in the coming decades due to climate change under business as usual emissions [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref078">78</a>], an evidence-based approach would need to convey the seriousness of this issue. The desire of curriculum developers to take a balanced, neutral approach to topics that generate political debate is laudable, so long as the balance of evidence presented falls within the boundaries of scientific consensus.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several curriculum contributors firmly denied feeling any direct political pressure while writing the curriculum. While these interviews were retrospective, and perhaps subject to biases from self-evaluation, the results agree with our curriculum analysis, which shows no obvious relationship between a province’s politics and their approach to climate change. The current curriculum for British Columbia, which was the first province to institute a carbon tax [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref079">79</a>] and the only province where a Member of Parliament from the Green Party has been elected [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref080">80</a>] has a similar score in our framework as Alberta, which, until 2015, had the same conservative political party in leadership for over forty years [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref081">81</a>]. It is reassuring that we found no evidence for the effect of political intervention on curriculum development.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some curriculum developers noted a conflict between keeping content to a manageable level in courses and including a variety of topics. If climate change is to receive more coverage, especially in provinces which did not address it fully, then curriculum writers would need to be convinced that it truly merits special treatment. But overall, our interviewees report that the curriculum development process seems to function well, encourages a balanced approach, and relies on expert opinion from a variety of sources including researchers and university faculties of education. Combined with the tendency to follow other provinces that are showing leadership on subjects like climate change, we would suggest that this aspect of climate change education will continue to improve as curricula undergo their regular updates and revisions. Perhaps the central flaw with curriculum documents is their turnover time, often more than 15 years (Manitoba and New Brunswick’s curricula were written in 2001 and 2002 respectively). Learning objectives in these documents that run counter to the scientific consensus may be attributed more to age than to intentional misrepresentations. But for a subject like climate change where the science is improving so quickly, updates may be needed more frequently. Additionally, online resources based on the latest peer-reviewed knowledge could be updated with more ease, and professional development could help to bridge the gap between current science and teacher understanding.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Controversies in curricula and textbooks</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the textbooks and the curriculum documents we analyzed contained statements that suggest some views outside the scientific consensus on climate change (
   <a rid="pone.0218305.t004" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218305.t004">Table 4</a>), which tend to fall in three categories: (1) disputing the trend (denying that the earth is warming), (2) disputing attribution (denying that warming is caused by humans), or (3) accepting 1 and 2, but believing climate impacts will be delayed or not harmful, and therefore disputing the need for action [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref082">82</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref083">83</a>]. Because there have been organized efforts to manufacture uncertainty and controversy by such techniques as cherry-picking studies and manipulating statistical results regarding climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref084">84</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref085">85</a>] students may be exposed to arguments that are designed to undermine support for climate science, and the mitigation policies that address the serious consequences of climate change. It is therefore important for climate change communicators and educators to be especially careful of how they address the more controversial aspects of climate change.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While textbooks seemed to encourage controversy, teachers can lead classroom discussion in a way that shows students how the media has heightened controversy, and indeed, teachers may already be doing this. One textbook says, “However, some people argue that today’s global warming could just be part of a natural climate cycle that occurs over thousands of years” [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref064">64</a>]. In the context of a teacher describing the controversy surrounding climate change in the media or the public, this quotation would indeed be appropriate (assuming that “some people” is taken to mean members of the public or an extreme minority of scientists).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, one textbook in particular contains statements inconsistent with the scientific consensus, stating, “This question is at the centre of the controversy about whether humans can cause Earth’s climate to change significantly” [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref065">65</a>]. As we have discussed above, there is no scientific question of whether humans can cause Earth’s climate to change significantly [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref036">36</a>]–stating this in a textbook confuses the issue for students. Additionally, the word ‘may’ in the statement “Human activities … may result in climate change” [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref065">65</a>] also suggests that there is scientific uncertainty over whether human activities are causing climate change, when no such scientific uncertainty exists. Unlike in the preceding examples, this belief is not attributed to an ambiguous outside group, but instead comes from the authoritative voice of the textbook authors themselves. The presence of such statements manufactures doubt in the minds of students where it does not exist in scientific discussions and does not serve a helpful purpose in educating scientifically literate students. Educational researchers have described best practice for discussing scientific controversies in the classroom, and exclude climate change as a possible topic both because it is not a scientific controversy (it is a social controversy) and because the scope of the debate is too broad to be handled by school students [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref086">86</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research has shown that certain messages (such as the existence of scientific consensus) can mitigate the effect of misinformation, especially if subjects are warned of future misinformation and given advanced arguments to discredit the misinformation [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref087">87</a>]. In some cases, it seems that the textbook writers may have been using variants of these strategies. We would suggest however that when textbooks present arguments not supported by the scientific consensus, they should be paired with refutations and that if the benefits of climate change are communicated, they should be communicated in reference to their relative importance. Phrasing the economic benefits of increased crop yield next to the economic costs of damages, for instance, would allow students to make a more reasoned comparison.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such an approach would be more conservative than teaching strategies in subjects like health and physical education classes where normative learning objectives explicitly promote the well-being of students and society, in line with accepted social and political goals. In these subjects the minor benefits of activities like smoking (stress relief, weight loss, social acceptance in certain groups) are not always provided to students since they are dwarfed by the negative health outcomes. Certainly, one would not expect to see the statement, “Most discussions of [smoking] give the impression that the impacts of [smoking] will always be negative. However, there may also be some positive impacts” in a high school health textbook.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, greater discussion of “Experts agree” and scientific consensus as a concept might benefit students, for reasons beyond climate change education. Research demonstrates that both conservatives and liberals showed poor understanding of scientific consensus, mostly taking it to mean whatever view supported their own ideological preference [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref088">88</a>], rather than a conclusion supported by the balance of evidence in peer-reviewed literature. This is important for any issue where scientific understanding may differ from public opinion, as is the case with the anti-vaccination movement, which has caused a resurgence of easily preventable diseases in developed countries [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref089">89</a>]. It is possible that some of these issues could be avoided with more education on the matter.
