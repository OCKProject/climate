 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three male and three female interviewees, from six different provinces, with a range of 8 to 35 years of experience as educators, participated in the interviews. Interviews revealed moderate differences in the curriculum development process that appear to be responsible for the variations between provincial curriculum documents on the topic of climate change (as opposed to external factors such as political input).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to interviewees, the process for selecting individuals to contribute to curriculum design varied from several different formal application processes to recommendations from school boards to hiring due to circumstance. This could introduce an element of randomness that would partially explain some interprovincial disparities, especially as one interviewee commented that “…it’s really the luck of the draw who ends up on a committee and what they’re interested in can absolutely, totally change the direction of what a course might be.” Although there is a larger framework, called the Common Framework of Science Learning Outcomes K to 12, which provides guidance [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref024">24</a>], some provinces rely on it more than others, and one interviewee noted that it provides little detail beyond grade 10.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewees reported that numerous factors influence how much space in the curriculum is given to climate change including: feedback from teachers; input from university faculties of education, researchers and environmental groups; the approaches taken by other provinces and jurisdictions; and the availability of teaching resources (textbooks, etc.) for the subject. While interviewees acknowledged that climate change can be politically controversial, and that pressures regarding curriculum content are applied from government officials, NGOs and the public, no interviewee described direct interference in the curriculum writing process (

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Box 1. Interviewees on the topic of addressing external pressures when designing curriculum documents, responding to the question from the researcher: “Politically, climate change is a very controversial topic. Did that influence the approach taken to writing parts of the curriculum that related to climate change?” (if so: “How?”)</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 4: …politics doesn’t influence when it comes to that aspect of it. That aspect of writing curriculum.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 1: We weren’t being told by the government—we had a lot of freedom with the document.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 2: There wasn’t really a place to go that said, “This is a good thing to do”. There certainly wasn’t any pressure at any government level to say, “You must incorporate climate change in your curriculum”.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 2: So we do get questions asked a lot from the Ministry of the Environment, but no direction.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 3: It can weigh into our considerations if we have groups come forward and exert pressure to include certain areas in the curriculum. But we really look for a balanced approach to the curriculum.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 6: …but nobody tells us that you have to teach this. But on the other hand there are so many, many groups that want you to teach what they want. Like…</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewer: NGOs?</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 6: Environmental groups, yeah, NGOs. So many of all kinds, that want you to teach whatever, that don’t understand why you’re not doing X, Y or Z. Not just for science, for everything. But certainly for all the sciences also.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 5: No, climate change was included as a factual component of the curriculum based on the recommendation from [name of provincial report].</p>
  </sec>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Instead, five of the six interviewees made comments about how documents in other jurisdictions and provinces can influence the curriculum writing process. Often, a scan of educational materials from other locations was one of the first steps mentioned in the development process. As an example of this interprovincial relationship, the science consultant for one province described a conversation with colleagues from another province about a change in senior science curriculum to emphasize courses based on subjects or problems rather than traditional subjects like chemistry: “every single one of them said, ‘Well, we’d never pull this off in our province politically, but if you can get it going in [your province], then we might be able to afterwards.’” Overall, we found that in Canadian climate change curricula, external influence is minimal, but change in one province may give momentum to other provinces considering change in the same direction.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another recurring theme amongst curriculum developers was the belief that educators had a responsibility to dispassionately provide students with information, or that students needed to learn the right skills to evaluate the issue of climate change for themselves (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 1: So is it, is it a political issue? Yeah, absolutely. How you deal with it–it has to be a very balanced approach.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 1: Like I said, you basically have to be fence-sitting even if you’re very passionate about these issues. And I know that it’s probably not that easy with some teachers, and it’s probably not even always easy with me on some issues because I get so passionate about them. I, you know, I weigh in on it. But at the end of the day it has to be a very neutral approach otherwise you’re going to introduce a bias into all of these documents that you’ve put together.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 2: I think we’ve sort of minimized the concern out there, and I’m sure there’s some groups would like a little more on climate change. But again, I’ll say to them, “Our job’s to open the door to talk about it, … our job as teachers isn’t to say climate change is good or bad, right?” It’s to say, “We want students to understand how scientists develop the information that they do.”</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 3: …so I think that, yes, the fact that people can have strong interests and can try to sway individuals for favour, for power, for money or whatever—we want students to be able to have the skills to be able to sift through information and make informed decisions that will enable them to survive better and flourish.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviewee 4: I always tell my students, I may share my opinion, but it’s nothing more than, and I never ask them to agree with me. In fact, I would prefer for them—my goal is to say, “this is just one more piece of information that you have got to verify and agree or disagree with.”</p>
