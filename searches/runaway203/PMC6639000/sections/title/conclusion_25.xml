 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have seen that in several regards Canadian climate change education is not consistent with scientific understanding. Doubts are cast on scientific consensus in curriculum documents and textbooks, and debate is encouraged on issues that scientists have already settled. Teaching students to evaluate scientific evidence is an important skill, but it is a skill that can be nurtured by debating issues that are still under contention amongst scientists, thereby avoiding a false uncertainty over the existence of anthropogenic climate change. Curriculum documents often focus on knowledge about climate systems (“It’s climate”), missing opportunities to educate students on outcomes that would motivate them to contribute to actual solutions. Still, existing curricula and textbooks provide good models for how climate change can be communicated, and curriculum developers, unencumbered by political interference, will probably continue to improve on climate change education. Although our results are taken from the Canadian educational system, the framework that we have employed could be used to evaluate the breadth of climate change education in other jurisdictions and highlight areas for improving education to reflect the latest science while contributing to societal challenges faced by 21
