  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Manitoba’s science curriculum, which is among the oldest in Canada (dating from 2001), displayed a tendency to depart from the scientific consensus. For instance, specific learning objectives moderated the idea of anthropogenic climate change, saying that the climate “can be influenced” by humans [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref057">57</a>] rather than describing humans as the major driver of current climate change. But divergence from scientific understanding was much more pronounced in supplementary materials in Manitoba’s curriculum, which recommended reading material produced by “Friends of Science”, an organization described as opposing the IPCC understanding of climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref058">58</a>]. The curriculum document adds, “It should be noted that there is significantly polarized debate on the issue among scientists. Students should be justifiably cautious about accepting unsubstantiated claims about global warming” [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref058">58</a>]. This is particularly concerning given that there actually is no polarized debate in the scientific community [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref017">17</a>]. Furthermore, individuals who hold the misconception that there is widespread disagreement amongst scientists on this issue are less likely to support policies to mitigate climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref039">39</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Manitoba was not the only province with curriculum documents conveying disagreement amongst the scientific community (
   <a rid="pone.0218305.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218305.t003">Table 3</a>). The supporting documentation for both Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island undermine the notion of a scientific consensus, suggesting that debate should be encouraged amongst students on the cause of current climate change. This raises the question of how climate change is best taught, and whether debate on the biophysical existence and anthropogenic cause of warming should encouraged on the issue, as it may lead students to incorrectly conclude that there remains scientific disagreement on these topics.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While some provinces (and textbooks) suggest teaching the existence of human-caused climate warming (“It’s Us”) as a debate, few are teaching the scientific consensus of the current human-caused climate warming. Only one province (Saskatchewan) covered the core teaching topic “Experts agree”, and only in a non-mandatory course (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218305.g001" href="#pone.0218305.g001">Fig 1</a>). The “We can fix it” topic was also sparsely covered, with only five provinces addressing this concept in their objectives. But the way in which “We can fix it” is covered is also an area of interest. For instance, some provincial curricula suggest individual actions that would lead to climate change mitigation [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref061">61</a>], largely focusing on energy efficiency and recycling, while others discuss the political steps that can be taken [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref059">59</a>]. But no province connects these two things–i.e., how can an individual contribute to political or structural changes. Some textbooks fill these gaps, discussing both the meaning [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref062">62</a>] and existence of scientific consensus [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref063">63</a>], as well as prompting students to participate in political processes: “Make a list of five ways you can reduce your personal impact on climate change and three ways you can influence corporate and/or governmental action of climate change” [
   <a rid="pone.0218305.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref064">64</a>]. So even with little prompting from the curriculum, some textbooks encourage positive personal and political participation regarding climate change.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Textbooks are created as a resource available to teachers based on the learning objectives provided in curriculum documents. In our textbook analysis we noted statements that suggest debate or controversy on subjects that the majority of scientists would agree upon (
   <a rid="pone.0218305.t004" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218305.t004">Table 4</a>). In these examples, doubt is cast on the consensus position that humans are driving climate change (“It’s us”) as well as on the scientific consensus itself (“Experts agree”). Benefits from climate change are discussed, without a clear context to show that they are far outweighed by costs. The three textbooks cited were written for the Ontario curriculum.
