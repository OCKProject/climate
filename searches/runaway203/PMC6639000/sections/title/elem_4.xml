 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to analyze the high school science curricula from the 13 Canadian provinces and territories, we grouped learning objectives into six core topics (see 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218305.t001">Table 1</a>) associated with statements from the IPCC Fifth Assessment report [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref030">30</a>]. The IPCC makes use of a rigorous peer review process featuring 600 authors and several rounds of review, which is why it is regarded as the most reputable source of scientific understanding on climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref031">31</a>]. Understanding of five of the six core topics has also been associated with support for climate change mitigation policies (see 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218305.t001">Table 1</a>). The topics include: foundational knowledge of the physical climate system (abbreviated as “It’s climate”), observations and proxies of rising temperature (“It’s warming”), anthropogenic contributions to climate change (“It’s us”), the scientific process of obtaining consensus (“Experts agree”), the various impacts associated with climate change (“It’s bad”), and the approaches and policies that can be used for mitigation (“We can fix it”).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarize the current scientific consensus on climate change: warming of the climate is unequivocal [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref031">31</a>] and its human cause has been established by exhaustive analyses of scientific literature and the scientific community [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref032">32</a>]. While some regions and sectors may experience slight benefits from climate change, a review of 3280 research papers concluded the overwhelming impacts on human and natural systems are negative and that the “small set of positive and neutral impacts cannot counterbalance any of the many detrimental impacts that were uncovered in our literature search, particularly when many of these impacts are related to the loss of human lives, basic supplies such as food and water, and undesired states for human welfare such as access to jobs, revenue and security” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref033">33</a>]. In terms of human health for instance, the IPCC projects that “Any increase in global warming is projected to affect human health, with primarily negative consequences” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref021">21</a>]. Looking ahead, staying below the internationally agreed temperature targets will reduce risks and requires deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions within the coming decade [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref021">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the extent to which different provinces were covering the current state of climate change knowledge (Column 1 of 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218305.t001">Table 1</a>), we read all high school science curriculum documents, and divided their relevant learning objectives into the six core topics. Learning objectives were not included if climate change was referenced as only one of several possible examples. For instance, in the Gr. 12 University/College Science Preparation course (SNC4M), one learning objective says, “explain the impact of various threats to public health, including infectious diseases (e.g., hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, sexually transmitted diseases), chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma), and environmental factors (e.g., climate change, air pollution, chemical pollutants, radiation)” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref045">45</a>]. Although climate change is listed as a threat to public health (a statement that could fall under “It’s Bad”), in this case, because a teacher could choose many other examples to meet the objective instead, it did not count in our assessment. Similarly, if climate change was mentioned in supporting documentation (suggested resources, optional activities etc.), it was not counted towards any of the categories. Lastly, we noted when a course was mandatory for graduation from secondary school, or merely optional.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Canada has a parliamentary democratic system, with five major political parties in government as of early 2019. The parties range from the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC), whose leadership candidates mostly argue against climate change mitigation measures [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref046">46</a>], to the Green Party of Canada who propose halting expansion of the country’s lucrative oil sands [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref047">47</a>]. More generally, the strength of Green Parties in democratic systems has been found to have a positive effect on measurable environmental indicators such as air quality [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref048">48</a>] while political conservativism has been associated with lower levels of environmental concern [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref049">49</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref050">50</a>] and lower levels of concern for climate change, even across different nations [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref014">14</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref051">51</a>]. We therefore compared the provincial coverage of climate change in the curricula documents with the per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the provinces, as well as with the breakdown of votes in the last federal election to search for indications that political forces influenced curriculum design. In undertaking this analysis, we suspected that certain provinces with a history of fossil fuel extraction (e.g. Alberta, Saskatchewan) would have less coverage of climate change in their curricula than provinces that have enacted climate policies such as a carbon tax (e.g. British Columbia, Ontario).
