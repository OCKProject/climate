 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A host of political issues demanding some level of scientific literacy face the present and future citizens of any democratic country. We take scientific literacy to mean “a civic competency required for rational thinking about science in relation to personal, social, political, economic problems, and issues that one is likely to meet throughout life” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref001">1</a>]. Climate change is an example of a global issue with ramifications in the personal, social, political and economic spheres of life.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Planetary warming brought on by human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has begun and as temperatures increase, so do the risks of coastal flooding, food insecurity, and deaths from extreme heat [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref002">2</a>]. Meeting the Paris temperature targets will require at least 50% reduction every decade in gross CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref003">3</a>], a task that will entail behavioural changes from citizens (especially those in developed countries like Canada) [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref004">4</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref005">5</a>]. At present, the Canadian government is attempting to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions through a price on carbon [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref006">6</a>], while simultaneously expanding its fossil fuel infrastructure [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref008">8</a>], in contradiction to its climate goals. In the future, governments and citizens may be asked to weigh the merit of high-risk geoengineering schemes that offer a final chance to act on climate change if mitigation efforts across society have proved insufficient to meet internationally agreed climate targets [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref009">9</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref010">10</a>]. Since these critical issues will persist for decades, climate change education will continue to be necessary for Canadian citizens for the foreseeable future.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through its rhetoric and its international commitments, the government of Canada has shown that it regards the issue of climate change as a serious, global threat. The official website of the government agency, Environment Canada says “The scientific evidence is clear: climate change is one of the greatest threats of our time” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref011">11</a>]. In his speech at the United Nations Paris Climate Summit (COP 21), Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, “Canada can and will do more to address the global challenge of climate change. We will do so because the science is indisputable, and tells us that our planet is already changing in ways that will have profound impacts on our future… Our government is making climate change a top priority” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref012">12</a>]. The Canadian Government has also supported an ambitious target to limit global warming to 1.5°C [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref013">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet there appears to be a gap between what the government says and what its citizens believe. Only 61% of Canadians believe that “the science is conclusive that global warming is happening and caused mostly by human activity” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref014">14</a>]. That figure increases to 78% when considering the age group 18–24, but 15% of those young adults believe that climate change may not be caused by humans, and 7% aren’t sure that climate change is happening at all [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref014">14</a>]. That same demographic scores low on concern for climate change, with 52% falling in the range between “somewhat concerned” and “not at all concerned” about climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref014">14</a>]. Not long ago the vast majority of those young people were school students, and should have received education on climate change as part of compulsory education, as evidenced by Canada’s low drop-out rates [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref015">15</a>]. It stands to reason that education in Canada has not adequately convinced young people of the scope and urgency of this issue.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike the Canadian public, the scientific community shows strong agreement on human-caused climate change and its increasingly harmful effects. An analysis of 928 peer-reviewed journal articles on the subject of climate change found that none explicitly rejected the consensus view that humans were causing climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref016">16</a>]. A more recent study of 11 944 peer-reviewed climate science abstracts found that of those papers which expressed a view on anthropogenic climate change, 97% supported the view that humans are causing climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref017">17</a>]. Others found that the level of agreement on the subject of anthropogenic climate change increases with the level of expertise on the subject [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref018">18</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref019">19</a>]. The evidence therefore shows a scientific consensus (which we define as general agreement amongst scientists as expressed in peer-reviewed literature) that humans are causing climate change. Further, comprehensive scientific assessments from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warn of increasing “the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref020">20</a>] from continued warming. Human impacts from climate change have already been observed, but risks to health, livelihood, water security, and economic growth are projected to increase with greater warming, with high or very high risks across sectors and regions illustrated by the “Reasons for Concern” at 2°C of warming [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref021">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The context of the problem can therefore be summarized as this: climate change poses huge risks to humanity and the biosphere which are recognized both by scientists and the Canadian government, and yet survey data show that even those Canadians who have received education on climate change often do not support this scientific consensus. As public opinion and collective action are important precursors to policy change [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref022">22</a>], raising Canadians’ environmental citizenship (“those values and practices appropriate to the achievement of sustainability” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref023">23</a>]) may increase the motivation of government officials to act to mitigate emissions in line with their pledged reductions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Canada, fostering responsible environmental citizenship by students on issues such as climate change is a goal stated in several important government documents. For instance, the Common Framework of Science Learning Outcomes K-12, a foundational document for curriculum design in Canada, says, “Students will be encouraged to develop attitudes that support the responsible acquisition and application of scientific and technological knowledge to the mutual benefit of self, society, and the environment” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref024">24</a>]. Some provinces provide more detail; the Ontario curriculum guidance document “Shaping Our Schools, Shaping Our Future” says that environmental education “seeks to promote an appreciation and understanding of, and concern for, the environment, and to foster informed, engaged, and responsible environmental citizenship” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref025">25</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast with Canada’s ambitious goals for fostering environmental citizenship, research suggests this topic is often added to curricula as an afterthought. For example, an analysis of Turkish and Bulgarian curricula found that substantially more attention is paid to knowledge than environmentally responsible behaviors [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref026">26</a>]. Researchers analyzing climate change in the science curriculum in Singapore described learning objectives that were focused on content knowledge ranging from the carbon cycle to the human impact on climate change, with no mention of how students could positively participate in this issue [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref027">27</a>]. A study of the national curriculum in England and Wales found that those guidelines that teachers are legally bound to teach focus on information, whereas topics like citizenship or education for sustainable development are suggested only if time and space allows [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref028">28</a>]. Our previous work on Canadian science textbooks found that they focus on low or medium-impact individual climate actions such as recycling or changing lightbulbs, and only infrequently mention the behaviours that most reduce a person’s carbon footprint, such as living car, flight, and meat-free [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref005">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate how well existing education aligns with international scientific consensus and national policy goals in Canada, in this paper we analyze how secondary school climate change curricula are designed, noting areas where educational guidelines are firmly supported by scientific evidence and where they are not. We also make recommendations for changes that could be made without the need for greater alterations in the educational system. Our research questions are as follows:</p>
