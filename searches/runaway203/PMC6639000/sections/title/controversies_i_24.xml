 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the textbooks and the curriculum documents we analyzed contained statements that suggest some views outside the scientific consensus on climate change (
  <a rid="pone.0218305.t004" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218305.t004">Table 4</a>), which tend to fall in three categories: (1) disputing the trend (denying that the earth is warming), (2) disputing attribution (denying that warming is caused by humans), or (3) accepting 1 and 2, but believing climate impacts will be delayed or not harmful, and therefore disputing the need for action [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref082">82</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref083">83</a>]. Because there have been organized efforts to manufacture uncertainty and controversy by such techniques as cherry-picking studies and manipulating statistical results regarding climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref084">84</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref085">85</a>] students may be exposed to arguments that are designed to undermine support for climate science, and the mitigation policies that address the serious consequences of climate change. It is therefore important for climate change communicators and educators to be especially careful of how they address the more controversial aspects of climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While textbooks seemed to encourage controversy, teachers can lead classroom discussion in a way that shows students how the media has heightened controversy, and indeed, teachers may already be doing this. One textbook says, “However, some people argue that today’s global warming could just be part of a natural climate cycle that occurs over thousands of years” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref064">64</a>]. In the context of a teacher describing the controversy surrounding climate change in the media or the public, this quotation would indeed be appropriate (assuming that “some people” is taken to mean members of the public or an extreme minority of scientists).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, one textbook in particular contains statements inconsistent with the scientific consensus, stating, “This question is at the centre of the controversy about whether humans can cause Earth’s climate to change significantly” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref065">65</a>]. As we have discussed above, there is no scientific question of whether humans can cause Earth’s climate to change significantly [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref036">36</a>]–stating this in a textbook confuses the issue for students. Additionally, the word ‘may’ in the statement “Human activities … may result in climate change” [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref065">65</a>] also suggests that there is scientific uncertainty over whether human activities are causing climate change, when no such scientific uncertainty exists. Unlike in the preceding examples, this belief is not attributed to an ambiguous outside group, but instead comes from the authoritative voice of the textbook authors themselves. The presence of such statements manufactures doubt in the minds of students where it does not exist in scientific discussions and does not serve a helpful purpose in educating scientifically literate students. Educational researchers have described best practice for discussing scientific controversies in the classroom, and exclude climate change as a possible topic both because it is not a scientific controversy (it is a social controversy) and because the scope of the debate is too broad to be handled by school students [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref086">86</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research has shown that certain messages (such as the existence of scientific consensus) can mitigate the effect of misinformation, especially if subjects are warned of future misinformation and given advanced arguments to discredit the misinformation [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref087">87</a>]. In some cases, it seems that the textbook writers may have been using variants of these strategies. We would suggest however that when textbooks present arguments not supported by the scientific consensus, they should be paired with refutations and that if the benefits of climate change are communicated, they should be communicated in reference to their relative importance. Phrasing the economic benefits of increased crop yield next to the economic costs of damages, for instance, would allow students to make a more reasoned comparison.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such an approach would be more conservative than teaching strategies in subjects like health and physical education classes where normative learning objectives explicitly promote the well-being of students and society, in line with accepted social and political goals. In these subjects the minor benefits of activities like smoking (stress relief, weight loss, social acceptance in certain groups) are not always provided to students since they are dwarfed by the negative health outcomes. Certainly, one would not expect to see the statement, “Most discussions of [smoking] give the impression that the impacts of [smoking] will always be negative. However, there may also be some positive impacts” in a high school health textbook.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, greater discussion of “Experts agree” and scientific consensus as a concept might benefit students, for reasons beyond climate change education. Research demonstrates that both conservatives and liberals showed poor understanding of scientific consensus, mostly taking it to mean whatever view supported their own ideological preference [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref088">88</a>], rather than a conclusion supported by the balance of evidence in peer-reviewed literature. This is important for any issue where scientific understanding may differ from public opinion, as is the case with the anti-vaccination movement, which has caused a resurgence of easily preventable diseases in developed countries [
  <a rid="pone.0218305.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218305.ref089">89</a>]. It is possible that some of these issues could be avoided with more education on the matter.
