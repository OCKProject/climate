 <div class="table-wrap-foot">
  <p>The depth with significant differences in SOC stocks is the deepest depth in the profile with a change in SOC stock that does not include 0 (See Figure 1 for differences in SOC between management practices from 0 to 80 cm). The Delta SOC estimate is based on a minimum depth of 30 cm, but includes differences in SOC to deeper depths if the depth with significant differences was greater than 30 cm (See Figure 1 for differences in SOC between management practices at depths from 0 to 80 cm). Loamy, silty and clayey soils were adjusted for mass equivalency.</p>
