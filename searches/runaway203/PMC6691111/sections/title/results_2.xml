 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first evaluated differences in SOC stocks (ΔSOC) at specific depths in the soil profile. The ΔSOC varied by depth between full tillage and no-till management, consistent with previous studies

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Two trends were evident based on the modelled responses of ΔSOC with soil depth: a) no-till had higher SOC stocks in the surface topsoil at depths less than 20 cm and b) soils with full tillage management had higher SOC at depths greater than 20 cm, which extended below the typical plough layer depth of 20–25 cm (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were differences among climate and soils types. The impact of tillage extended deeper in the profile for loamy, silty and clayey soils in tropical and warm temperate climates, compared to sandy soils in those climates. For example, the confidence interval for ΔSOC did not include 0 at depths around 60 cm for warm temperate dry climates (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1E</a>, Blue Shading), while sandy soils did not have a significant impact on ΔSOC at depths below 35 cm for warm temperate dry climates (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1F</a>, Blue Shading). This trend was reversed in cool temperate climates with significant impacts on ΔSOC around 20 cm for loamy, silty and clayey soils (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1I,K</a>), but extending to depths around 40 cm for sandy soils (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1J,L</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beyond 60 cm, limited data were available to assess differences in SOC storage for any of the soil types and climatic conditions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), and so it was not feasible to statistically evaluate the impact of no-till management deeper in the soil profile
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. In addition, there was generally less data coverage across depths for sandy soils regardless of climate conditions and edaphic characteristics, and consequently larger uncertainties existed in estimated impacts of no-till management compared to the results for loamy, silty and clayey soils. In terms of climate, there were less data for tropical climates compared to temperate climates with the exception of loamy, silty, and clayey soils in wet/moist conditions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One mechanism contributing to changes in ΔSOC with depth is that full tillage reduces bulk density and essentially raises the soil surface and increases the depth of the soil profile
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. This leads to a larger mass of soil in the surface topsoil with no-till management, and therefore a higher SOC stock when calculated on a volumetric basis. We evaluated the change in soil mass with depth based on the studies that provided enough information to calculate the mass (See Supplementary Information). Soils with loamy, silty and clayey textures under no-till management did have greater mass in the surface topsoil and less mass below the topsoil based on a statistical analysis of studies providing data on soil mass (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a> in Supplementary Information). There was no evidence of differences in mass for the surface and subsurface layers of sandy textured soils. Therefore, SOC stock estimates for loamy, silty and clayey textured soils were adjusted for mass equivalency between full tillage and no-till management. Mass equivalency adjustments ensure that the observed changes in SOC stocks are due to enhanced levels of organic C in the soil from processes such as protection of organic matter in microaggregates, and not due to sampling a different mass of soil.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second part of the analysis, we predicted ΔSOC stock changes with conversion of full tillage management to no-till for each of the climate and soil types. The predictions are based on the cumulative change to a minimum depth of 30 cm, or to a deeper depth if there are significant ΔSOC at a deeper depth based on the first part of the analysis. For the first 20 years following conversion from full tillage to no-till, the change in SOC stocks is predicted to be greatest in loamy, silty and clayey soils of tropical moist/wet climates at 0.54 tonnes C ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.04 to 1.02 tonnes C ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Sandy soils in warm temperate moist climates also have relatively large changes in SOC predicted to be 0.5 tonnes C ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.24 to 0.76 tonnes C ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Higher amounts of SOC, between 0.27 and 0.39 tonnes C ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, are also predicted for sandy soils in cool temperate moist and tropical climates, in addition to loamy, silty and clayey soils in cool and warm temperate moist climates. Predictions for all remaining combinations of soil types and climates have estimated ΔSOC that are positive, but the confidence intervals for these climates and soil types include values that are less than 0. This includes all soil types in cool and warm temperate dry climates, and loamy, silty, and clayey soils in tropical dry climates.

    <p>The depth with significant differences in SOC stocks is the deepest depth in the profile with a change in SOC stock that does not include 0 (See Figure 1 for differences in SOC between management practices from 0 to 80 cm). The Delta SOC estimate is based on a minimum depth of 30 cm, but includes differences in SOC to deeper depths if the depth with significant differences was greater than 30 cm (See Figure 1 for differences in SOC between management practices at depths from 0 to 80 cm).
