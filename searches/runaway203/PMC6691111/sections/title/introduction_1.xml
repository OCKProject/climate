 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over two decades ago, scientists began proposing no-till management as a way to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through carbon (C) storage in soils
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. No-till, as the name implies, is the practice of direct-seeding of crops in a field without ploughing. The initial rationale for developing and adopting no-till management during the latter half of the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> Century was to reduce soil degradation from erosion, and no-till has proven highly effective for achieving this goal
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. No-till can also improve nutrient cycling
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>, and in semi-arid and arid regions where water limits crop production, no-till can conserve water in the soil by improving infiltration and reducing evaporation with a sufficient cover of crop residues or cover crops
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Therefore, no-till management has been promoted as a win-win situation for climate change policy by addressing GHG mitigation goals and enhance resilience to meet adaptation goals.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scientists had a seemingly strong basis for promoting adoption of no-till management in croplands as part of a group of options to reduce the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere and stabilize the climate system
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. First, it was well known that conversion of forests and grasslands to croplands, which are cultivated by ploughing, leads to a large decline in soil organic C (SOC)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Second, research demonstrated that no-till enhanced macroaggregate stability and microaggregate formation that led to greater protection of C from microbial decomposition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. Third, meta-analyses provided empirical evidence that there was more C in soils with conversion from an intensive, full tillage practice to no-till management
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Consequently, both empirical and mechanistic studies appeared to confirm that no-till led to higher amounts of C in soils, and over the past two decades, no-till has generally been a key part of GHG mitigation analyses
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, scientists began asking questions about the effectiveness of no-till as a way to mitigate GHG emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. After all, not all studies found that SOC stocks increased with no-till management
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. Studies analyzed from Eastern Canada showed that inversion tillage incorporates crop residue C deeper into the soil profile, slowing decomposition and negating some of the benefit of no-till for storing C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. This led investigators to the conclusion that no-till management tends to increase C in the surface layer, but full tillage increases SOC deeper in the profile
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. In addition, no-till tends to compact the topsoil, which increases the mass of the soil in the upper layer, compared to a soil that is ploughed. In fact, studies showed that there is no difference in the amount of C in soils with adoption of no-till management compared to full tillage, and that differences in SOC from the surface to the subsoil below the plow layer are explained by compaction and redistribution of SOC
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. However, it has also been recognized that limited data have been collected at deeper depths, and that more samples are required to determine if no-till has an influence on the amount of SOC in the subsoil due to greater inherent variability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. These studies highlight the critical need for measuring SOC in the subsoil to determine the potential for no-till to sequester C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A variety of implements can be used to prepare soils for planting crops that lead to different levels of soil disturbance and incorporate C in plant residue litter from the surface to different depths. Full tillage with a traditional moldboard plough involves inversion of the soil, but tillage can also be done with implements that mix the soil without inversion, such as chisels, sweeps, and/or discs. In a global meta-analysis, investigators
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> found that mixing tillage led to larger SOC stocks to 15 cm compared to inversion tillage. However there was also a trend of less SOC below 15 cm for non-inversion tillage such that there was no apparent difference in SOC stocks between mixing and inversion tillage. In addition, some studies have found no differences between the amount of SOC in surface soils managed with mixing tillage implements and no-till
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>, although other studies have found more C in soils managed with no-till
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Regardless, mixing tillage is frequently shallower than inversion tillage and the potential increased C retention with mixing tillage has been attributed to less soil disturbance compared to deeper inversion tillage management
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. In addition to redistribution of organic C in the soil profile, crop production and the input of organic C to soils may decline with no-till management, especially in cooler and wetter climates, suggesting that SOC stocks may be reduced with conversion from full tillage to no-till
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. However, crop production may not change or may even increase with no-till; for example, production is enhanced in dry climates if no-till is adopted in combination with residue retention in fields and planting of cover crops
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No-till has become a controversial contribution in a portfolio of options for stabilizing the climate. Regardless, no-till is still a prominent part of GHG mitigation discussions, such as the 4 per mille initiative that has an ambitious goal of increasing global SOC stocks by 0.4% per year
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. Therefore, we have compiled a comprehensive global dataset of 178 experimental sites with 1205 observations of changes between full tillage and no-till management to further evaluate this practice and determine if it is a viable mitigation option (See Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Full tillage typically refers to soil management with a farming implement that inverts or mixes soil to 15 cm or deeper, and leaves less than 30% of the soil’s surface covered with leftover crop residues or litter. No-till is direct seeding of cropland without preparing the soil with a tillage practice, and typically has more than 30% cover of the soil surface with residues. However, these criteria vary regionally depending on the climate and productivity of the system. For example, crop production in rain fed systems of semi-arid regions does not always produce enough residues to cover 30% of the soil surface due to low productivity. This would lead to classification as full tillage based on the general criteria even if no-tillage was practiced. To address these discrepancies, we accepted local classifications of full tillage and no-till as designated by the investigators in their publications even if they differed from the general criteria.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our objective is to address the influence of no-till adoption on C storage potential of soils across a range of climatic conditions and soil types. With a global dataset, we have evaluated differences among cool temperate, warm temperate and tropical climates with moist/wet and dry moisture regimes, as well as sandy versus loamy, silty and clayey textured soils. If policy programs are to encourage no-till adoption, it is critical to know the conditions in which this practice can enhance SOC stocks. In addition, this analysis is unique from other studies in that we have analyzed the impact of no-till on SOC stocks as a continuous function of depth
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. This allowed us to use all of the available studies and model SOC without aggregating data to specified depth increments or eliminating studies that did not measure soil C to a specified depth.
