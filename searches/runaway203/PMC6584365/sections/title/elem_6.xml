 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the beginning of the 21st century, mass loss was roughly equally split between surface meltwater runoff and ice discharge (sum of mechanical calving and frontal melt) into the surrounding ocean, albeit with high year-to-year variations (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>). Our simulated mass loss for the same period is consistent with this observation (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). During the 21st and 22nd centuries, ice discharge remains a major contributor to mass loss regardless of the emissions scenario (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figs. 1</a>, D and E, and 
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">3</a>), contributing 2 to 39 cm to sea level by 2200, corresponding to 6 to 45% of the total mass loss. Over time, however, the relative importance of ice discharge diminishes, except for RCP 8.5. Under this scenario, mass loss is sufficiently large for the ice margin to retreat into interior areas below sea level, resulting in large calving fronts and increased ice discharge. The exact timing of this increase varies across RCP 8.5 ensemble members, resulting in a marked increase in the variance of the relative contribution of ice discharge to mass loss at the beginning of the 23rd century.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a warming climate, precipitation (and thus snow accumulation) is expected to increase because of the higher moisture holding ability of warmer air. Here, we increase precipitation by 5 to 7% for each degree of warming (
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>). We find that in our simulations, total snow accumulation over the ice sheet remains relatively steady over time for RCPs 2.6 and 4.5 (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3, D and E</a>), since decreasing ice sheet area is offset by an increase in snow accumulation per unit area due to increasing precipitation (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3, J and K</a>). Under RCP 8.5, however, the decrease in snow accumulation due to accumulation area reduction (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3C</a>) outpaces the increase in snow accumulation due to warming, and thus, total snow accumulation decreases after around year 2200 (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3F</a>). Toward the end of the millennium, snow accumulation per unit area increases as the Greenland Ice Sheet is reduced to a few high-elevation areas in the southeast (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3I</a>). For RCP 8.5, ice sheet–wide surface meltwater runoff rates decrease after passing a maximum around year 2500 despite continuously increasing runoff rates per unit area. At the time of the maximum, runoff exceeds snow accumulation by a factor of about 17. Surface melt is amplified by the positive surface mass balance–elevation feedback as surface lowering exposes the ice to higher air temperatures. To assess the role of this feedback in driving increases in surface melt, we perform a simulation assuming no changes in surface elevation for the calculation of the air temperatures (i.e., setting the temperature lapse rate to zero). We find that in all scenarios, the increased melt rates per unit area caused by higher air temperatures due to climate change exceeds the impact of higher temperatures due to surface lowering (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3, G to I</a>). In our simulations, temperatures are kept constant beyond the year 2500, yet Greenland continues to lose mass in part because of the surface mass balance–elevation feedback. This committed sea level rise (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>) demonstrates that stabilization of mass change will be more difficult as time passes.
