 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ice flow model requires climatic mass balance (i.e., the balance of accumulation, melt, and refreezing) as a surface boundary condition for mass conservation and temperature for conservation of energy. Accumulation is computed from precipitation and 2-m air temperature; precipitation falls as snow at temperatures below 0°C and as rain at temperatures above 2°C, with a linear transition in between. Surface melt is computed by a temperature index model (

  </a>), which uses 2-m air temperature as input. Melt factors for snow are used if snow or firn is exposed at the surface, and melt factors for ice are used otherwise.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use a simple firn model that only allows removal of firn. At the beginning of the simulation, the firn layer thickness is set to the average depth of the 750 kg m

  </a>), where the density and cold content of the snow layers determine the refreezing capacity. Where firn is present, the firn layer thickness is reduced by the amount of melted firn.
