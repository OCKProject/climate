 <p>Values represent the percentage of variance in mass loss attributable to the variance in a given parameter. Large values imply that uncertainty in that parameter is responsible for a commensurately large uncertainty in mass loss. Small values imply that uncertainty in a given parameter has relatively little effect on uncertainty in total mass loss. Numbers for the variance in air temperature for year 3000 are in parentheses because they do not reflect the GCM intermodel variability but the choice of extrapolation.</p>
