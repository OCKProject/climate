 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulations suggest that by following the RCP 8.5 scenario, the Greenland Ice Sheet will disappear within a millennium and that the contribution of discharge from outlet glaciers will remain a key component of mass loss over the next centuries. Better quantification of feedbacks that interlink and amplify mass loss processes will help in understanding the extent to which these feedbacks make changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet nonreversible. Because of these feedbacks, delaying mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is likely to increase sea level rise, even with future significant reductions of emissions.</p>
