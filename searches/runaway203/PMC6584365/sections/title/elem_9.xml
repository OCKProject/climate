 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observations indicate that Greenland’s 200+ major outlet glaciers have displayed a marked asynchronicity in retreat behavior (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). Even adjacent glaciers that experience similar environmental conditions may behave differently because retreat is strongly controlled by glacier geometry (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>). Our simulations produce similar behavior, as illustrated by two examples. In west-central Greenland, Store Gletscher’s current extent is strongly controlled by geometry because its terminus resides on a local bedrock high, and high frontal melt rates are required to thin the glacier to flotation and cause retreat (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>). In our simulations, once Store Gletscher loses contact with the bedrock high, it retreats within a decade or less over a distance of about 25 km until it becomes land terminating (
  <a rid="F4" ref-type="fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). This behavior is observed in all three RCP scenarios but occurs later under lower emissions scenarios (not shown). Upernavik Isstrøm South, in the same region, exhibits a more gradual retreat in the simulations due to a smoother bed topography. Both glaciers accelerate during retreat and then slow down at stable front positions on bedrock highs while thinning continues. Once thinned to flotation at this local high point, the glaciers retreat again. In our simulations, both Store Gletscher and Upernavik Isstrøm South undergo several episodes of fast retreat. During these episodes, maximum speeds are comparable between individual episodes, but maximum fluxes (product of ice thickness and vertically averaged velocity) decline over time because of thinning, a behavior that was also reported by Nick

    <span class="bold">A</span>) Upernavik Isstrøm South (UIS) shows a gradual retreat of about 50 km over the next 200 years. (
    <span class="bold">B</span>) Store Gletscher (SG) is currently in a very stable position on a bedrock high. It takes almost a hundred years before substantial retreat happens. However, once the glacier loses contact with the bedrock high, retreat of 25 km occurs in less than a decade. The glacier retreats quickly until it is out of the water. Every line represents a year (A and B). (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over time, ice sheet–wide ice discharge decreases because of outlet glacier thinning and outlet glaciers becoming land terminating (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). Because the flow of outlet glaciers is strongly controlled by geometry (
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>) and most of the submarine channels beneath large outlet glaciers extend only to about 100 km inland, their potential for sustained fast retreat (and large ice discharge) is limited. Jakobshavn Isbræ, Humboldt Gletscher, and Petermann Gletscher, however, have channels that extend far into the ice sheet interior (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>), and these glaciers are responsible for much of the asymmetric retreat (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2, F and G</a>). By the year 2300 (RCP 8.5) or 2500 (RCP 4.5), almost all outlet glaciers in northwest Greenland have become land terminating, and ice discharge there is greatly reduced. In contrast, in southeast Greenland, outlet glaciers retreat substantially only for the RCP 8.5 scenario, and ice discharge remains an important contributor to mass loss even for the RCP 8.5 scenario until the 23rd century. However, future ice discharge in the southeast may be underestimated in our simulations because of inaccurate subglacial topography. Aschwanden 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>) already reported poor agreement between observed and modeled surface speeds for several glaciers in southeast Greenland and attributed the mismatch to poorly constrained ice thickness. This hypothesis was recently corroborated by inversion of gravimetric data that revealed glacial fjords several hundreds of meters deeper than previously assumed (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To characterize the importance of capturing outlet glacier flow, we performed a simulation where flow was calculated because of vertical shearing at a coarse horizontal grid resolution of 18 km, ignoring longitudinal stresses relevant for outlet glacier flow. For RCPs 2.6 and 4.5, this approach underestimates mass loss by a meter sea level equivalent at year 3000 compared to the control simulation (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>), with a projected mass gain of 25 cm sea level equivalent for RCP 2.6. While under RCP 8.5, Greenland will become ice free whether outlet glaciers are resolved or not, larger mass loss occurs in the early centuries in the control simulation, with the nonresolving simulation underestimating mass loss by &gt;10% by the year 2300. Large mass loss in early centuries may make a recovery harder, even if climate warming were to reverse. Consequently, it is crucial to resolve outlet glaciers to reduce uncertainties in mass loss projections.
