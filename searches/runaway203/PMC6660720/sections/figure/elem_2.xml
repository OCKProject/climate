 <div class="caption">
  <p>Evolution of a 500-member ensemble of ISSM simulations of Thwaites Glacier evolution over 500 y (where year 0 in model time is the modern glacier state) in response to decadal variability and constant average in maximum subice shelf melt rate. (
   <span class="italic">A</span>) Evolution of ensemble PDF over time, plotted every 25 y, with probability on the 
   <span class="italic">y</span> axis and Thwaites Glacier ice volume (in cm sea-level equivalent [SLE]) on the 
   <span class="italic">x</span> axis. (
   <span class="italic">B</span>) Black lines are simulated ice volume contained in Thwaites Glacier catchment in cm SLE for all ensemble members. (
   <span class="italic">C</span>) Black dots are evolving grounding-line migration rates for all ensemble members (based on the centroid of the 2D grounding line). (
   <span class="italic">D</span>) Snapshots (red, orange, and pink lines) of grounding-line positions at year 635 in model time, from 5th percentile, 50th percentile, and 95th percentile ice volume ensemble members.
