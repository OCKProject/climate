  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0055">2013</a>), which reduces outgoing SW radiation. There is no agreement between models on the sign of the LW cloud adjustment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 10xBC, a downward shift of clouds occurs. Many competing processes that affect cloud adjustments occur in response to a BC forcing, such as cloud burn off (reduction in clouds), increased convection (increasing clouds), and changes in atmospheric stability, which could increase or decrease clouds depending on the altitude of the BC perturbation (Koch &amp; Del Genio, 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0025">2010</a>; Samset &amp; Myhre, 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0036">2015</a>). Every model shows a negative LW cloud adjustment to 10xBC, whereas there is no agreement on the sign of SW cloud adjustments. However, those models with a substantial negative cloud adjustment to 10xBC (ECHAM6‐HAM2 and CanESM2) show a large increase in cloud liquid water content in the lower or middle troposphere that is not present in other models, suggesting a possible mechanism.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For 5xSul, there is a large spread in the strength of the cloud adjustment, dominated by the SW effect, which is particularly strong in the HadGEM3 model. Further analysis is undertaken with the APRP method for SW cloud adjustments in the seven models for which diagnostics permit (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58185-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supitem-0001">S8</a> in 
  <a rid="grl58185-supInfo-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supInfo-0001">supporting information</a>). This shows that the ERF for 5xSul is substantially more negative in HadGEM3 than for other models, driven by a large contribution from the RFaci (RF due to aerosol‐cloud interactions or cloud microphysical effect). The direct aerosol forcing (RF due to aerosol‐radiation interactions, RFari) in HadGEM3 is in line with other models. The APRP highlights the varying strength in RFaci, which ranges from 33% (in CanESM2) to 63% (in HadGEM3) of the ERF in models, which include cloud microphysical changes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One limitation of the APRP method is that it does not appear to work well with models that do not include interactive cloud microphysical changes in their configurations, such as the apparent positive RFaci in NCAR‐CESM1‐CAM4 and GISS‐E2‐R. Furthermore, the computed SW cloud adjustments with the MMPRP and APRP methods do not agree in magnitude, and the kernel difference method, which is only available in three models due to the availability of double calls, only agrees with the MMPRP where cloud microphysical changes are not included (i.e., in NCAR‐CESM1‐CAM4; Figure 
  <a rid="grl58185-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58185-supitem-0001">S3</a>). The differences obtained with different methods highlight the difficulties in estimating cloud adjustments. A direct estimate of cloud adjustments can be obtained using a cloud kernel (Zelinka et al., 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0054">2012</a>) and model output of International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) simulator diagnostics (Bodas‐Salcedo et al., 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0005">2011</a>; Klein &amp; Jakob, 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0024">1999</a>; Webb et al., 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0051">2001</a>). These diagnostics were not part of the PDRMIP data request and are generally not output by models outside of the CFMIP protocol (Webb et al., 
  <a rid="grl58185-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58185-bib-0050">2017</a>). Inclusion of these diagnostics as standard in more models would aid understanding of cloud adjustment mechanisms.
