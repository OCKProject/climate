 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have shown that the variations in stratospheric ozone in the northern and southern high latitudes could significantly influence changes in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere climate. However, the stratospheric ozone variations specified in many climate models are not in good agreement with the observed stratospheric ozone variations. This led us to consider whether part of the deviation between the simulated and observed variabilities of climatic elements from a large number of models is related to the poor agreement between observed ozone variations and the stratospheric ozone forcing applied in the climate models. Here, we investigated the improvement of simulated surface temperature by replacing the original specified ozone forcing with MERRA2 ozone in WACCM4.</p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Replacing the original specified stratospheric ozone forcing with MERRA2 stratospheric ozone improved the variability of global average surface temperature simulated by WACCM4. The main regions where the simulated surface temperature is significantly improved are the middle of the Eurasian continent and at lower latitudes. The improved stratospheric ozone variations improve the simulated variability of stratospheric temperature and circulation in both hemispheres at high latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, the ASO variations first influence the circulation over the north polar upper troposphere. The Rossby waves generated by the disturbed circulation over the north polar upper troposphere propagate eastward along a line of latitude and then reach the middle of the Eurasian continent to influence the local circulation and surface temperature. We found that the improved stratospheric ozone forcing improves the simulated variations of the Victoria Mode, which improves the simulation of ENSO variations and surface temperature changes over the Indian Ocean and Indo Pacific warm pool. In the Southern Hemisphere, improved stratospheric circulation variations resulting from improved Southern Hemisphere stratospheric ozone variations influence the simulation of westerly winds. This helps to improve the simulation of surface temperature in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study focuses on the influence of stratospheric ozone variability on surface temperature variability. Here, we briefly discuss the influence of stratospheric ozone trend on surface temperature trend. Two additional experiments (E
  <sub>7</sub> and E
  <sub>8</sub>) are performed. E
  <sub>7</sub> is a historical simulation covering the period 1955–2005. E
  <sub>8</sub> is the same as E
  <sub>7</sub>, but the linear trend of specified ozone forcing in the stratosphere was removed. An overview of the experiments (E
  <sub>7</sub> and E
  <sub>8</sub>) is given in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. The influence of stratospheric ozone trend on surface temperature can be obtained by comparing the results of E
  <sub>7</sub> and E
  <sub>8</sub>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a,b</a> shows the linear trends of global surface temperature for the period 1955–2005 from GISTEMP and E
  <sub>7</sub>. In general, WACCM4 simulated the global warming trend fairly well compared with the observations, except that the simulated linear trend at high latitudes in northern Eurasia is evidently larger than that observed and there is a warming trend over the North Pacific in the simulation that is not seen in the observations. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a> shows the linear trends of global surface temperature from E
  <sub>8</sub>. The linear trends in E
  <sub>8</sub> are weaker than those in E
  <sub>7</sub> in both hemisphere high latitudes. This feature is easier to see in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>, which shows the difference of linear trends between E
  <sub>8</sub> and E
  <sub>7</sub>. It is well known that stratospheric ozone decreased from 1955 to 2005. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a> implies that the decreasing trend of stratospheric ozone may have enhanced the warming trend in both hemisphere high latitudes during the second half of the 20th century. Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a> shows the linear trend in surface temperature for the period 1955–1995. It shows that the warming trends in the Arctic and Antarctic from 1955 to 1995 (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>) are larger than those from 1955 to 2005 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). This means that the behavior of trend variations in surface temperature during 1955–2005 is similar to those for ozone. The possible reasons why decreased stratospheric ozone warms high latitudes, and whether the Arctic stratospheric ozone decrease would contribute to the Arctic amplification effect, are open questions that deserve further investigation. Recently, a study found that Arctic stratospheric polar vortex possibly contributed to and sustained the recent hiatus in Eurasian winter warming
