     <sub>1</sub> based on original CESM input data. Note that the specified ozone forcing for 1979–2005 was derived from the CMIP5 ensemble mean ozone output. The specified ozone forcing was named ghg_forcing_1955–2005_CMIP5_EnsMean.c140414.nc, and can be downloaded at

     <sub>1</sub>–E
     <sub>6</sub> performed from 1979 to 2005 is because the MERRA2 data started in 1979 and simulation in WACCM4 is limited to 2005. Ozone outside of the region 90°S–90°N, at 300–1 hPa is the same as E
