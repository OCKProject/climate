 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,d</a> shows that the simulated surface temperature variations from E
  <sub>4–6</sub> are significantly correlated with observations (GISTEMP/HadCRUT4) in many regions. The two main features are: first, in the middle of the Eurasian continent the correlation coefficients between surface temperatures from E
  <sub>4–6</sub> and from observations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,d</a>) are much larger than those between surface temperatures from E
  <sub>1–3</sub> and from observations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,c</a>). Second, in the lower latitudes the correlation coefficients are significantly improved in E
  <sub>4–6</sub> compared with those in E
  <sub>1–3</sub>. It means that the improved stratospheric ozone forcing in E
  <sub>4–6</sub> compared with in E
  <sub>1–3</sub> mainly improves simulated surface temperature in the middle of the Eurasian continent and in lower latitudes, which is responsible for the improved simulation of global average surface temperature in E
  <sub>4–6</sub> compared with that in E
  <sub>1–3</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). In the following paragraphs we will discuss the mechanisms by which improved ozone forcing improves the surface temperature simulation over these two major areas.

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1a,b</a> shows the distributions of correlation coefficients between observed surface temperature and ASO. The variations in ASO are closely linked to surface temperature changes in the middle of the Eurasian continent. This phenomenon has been reported in previous studies using observations

  <sub>4–6</sub> as a result of improved stratospheric ozone forcing.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies showed that the surface temperature anomalies were strongly connected with westerly wind variations over the middle of the Eurasian continent caused by ASO changes

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. In order to understand how improving ozone forcing would improve the surface temperature simulation over the middle of the Eurasian continent, we have to first build a bridge between the circulation anomalies in the middle of the Eurasian continent and in the northern high-latitude stratosphere.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies have presented evidences suggesting that variability in the stratospheric polar vortex has a substantial impact on the circulation of the troposphere
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. Thus, a possible pathway for northern high-latitude stratospheric circulation anomalies to affect circulation anomalies over the middle of Eurasian continent may involve two steps: a high-latitude stratosphere-to-troposphere vertical pathway and an Arctic-to-Eurasia horizontal teleconnection. The high-latitude stratosphere-to-troposphere vertical pathway has been investigated
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. They pointed out that the region 60°–90°N, 180°–120°W is the possible location of the main tunnel through which Arctic stratospheric circulation anomalies caused by the ASO changes reach down into the troposphere. To study the horizontal propagation of circulation anomalies from the Arctic to Eurasia in detail, the ray paths of waves at 200 hPa generated by the perturbed circulation over the region 60°–90°N, 180°–120°W are shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>. The wave ray paths represent the climate teleconnections; i.e., the propagation of stationary waves in realistic flows. The calculation of the wave ray paths and application of the barotropic model are described in detail by previous studies

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>. We found that the Rossby waves generated by the perturbed circulation over the north polar upper troposphere mainly propagate eastward along a line of latitude; after almost circling the earth, the Rossby waves reach the middle of the Eurasian continent in about 15 days. The above analysis establishes a connection between the northern high-latitude stratospheric circulation anomalies and circulation variations over the middle of the Eurasian continent. This may be why previous studies found that westerly wind variations over the middle of the Eurasian continent were influenced by ASO changes

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a,d,g,j</a> shows that the ozone forcing in E
  <sub>4–6</sub> is mainly improved in the high-latitude stratosphere of both hemispheres. This implies that the improved surface temperature simulation is mainly related to the improved high-latitude stratospheric ozone variability. The variations in ASO first influence Arctic polar stratosphere temperature by radiative processes. It is well known that a cooler (warmer) polar stratosphere strengthens (weakens) the temperature gradient from the tropics to the Pole. According to the thermal wind relationship, this situation results in a stronger (weaker) stratospheric polar vortex. Thus, improving the high-latitude stratospheric ozone variability should first improve the simulated stratospheric temperature and circulation at high latitudes. We compare the simulated stratospheric temperature and circulation of the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes from E
  <sub>1–3</sub> and from E
  <sub>4–6</sub> with observations. Taking the temperature and zonal wind from ERA-Interim for the period 1979–2005 as the references, the correlation coefficients between stratospheric temperature from E
  <sub>4–6</sub> and from ERA-Interim are larger than the correlation coefficients between stratospheric temperature from E
  <sub>1–3</sub> and from ERA-Interim (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3a</a>). The improved simulations of stratospheric temperature variability over the North Pole improve the simulation of stratospheric circulation variability in E
  <sub>4–6</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3b</a>). According to the above established connection between the northern high-latitude stratospheric circulation anomalies and circulation variations over the middle of the Eurasian continent, the improved simulation of Arctic stratospheric circulation variability in E
  <sub>4–6</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3b</a>) explains how improved ozone forcing improves the surface temperature simulation over the middle of the Eurasian continent.

  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> compares the simulated Victoria Mode and ENSO variations from E
  <sub>1–3</sub> and from E
  <sub>4–6</sub> with observations. Taking the Victoria Mode variations from HadSST and ENSO index from Climate Prediction Center/NOAA for the period 1979–2005 as the references, the correlation coefficients between the Victoria Mode (ENSO) from E
  <sub>4–6</sub> and from HadSST (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b,d</a>) are larger than those between the Victoria Mode (ENSO) from E
  <sub>1–3</sub> and from HadSST (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a,c</a>). Since the simulation of ENSO variations is improved as a result of improved ASO variations, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,d</a> shows that the pattern of improved surface temperature over the eastern Pacific is similar to the pattern of ENSO. It is well known that ENSO links the SST change over the Indian Ocean and Indo Pacific warm pool via the Walker circulation. Thus, the simulations of surface temperature over the Indian Ocean and Indo Pacific warm pool are also improved in E
