  <p>The time series of simulated VM and ENSO indices. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Time series of spring Victoria Mode index for the period 1979–2005 from E
   <sub>1–3</sub> (blue line) and HadSST (red line). (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), but for spring Victoria Mode index from E
   <sub>4–6</sub> (blue line) and HadSST (red line). (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Time series of winter ENSO index for the period 1979–2005 from E
   <sub>1–3</sub> (blue line) and from the Climate Prediction Center/NOAA (red line). (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), but for the winter ENSO index from E
   <sub>4–6</sub> (blue line) and from the Climate Prediction Center/NOAA (red line). The correlation coefficients (
   <span class="italic">r</span>) between the two lines are shown in the top right corner and the “*” means 
   <span class="italic">r</span> is significant at 95% confidence level. The values in bracket are uncertainty range for the correlation coefficient at the 95% confidence level.
