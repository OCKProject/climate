  <p>The time series of simulated globally averaged surface temperature. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Time series of globally averaged annual surface temperature anomalies for the period 1979–2005 from E
   <sub>1–3</sub> (blue line) and GISTEMP (red line). (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), but for surface temperature from E
   <sub>4–6</sub> (blue line) and GISTEMP (red line). (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), but for surface temperature from E
   <sub>1–3</sub> (blue line) and HadCRUT4 (red line). (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), but for surface temperature from E
   <sub>4–6</sub> (blue line) and HadCRUT4 (red line). The anomalies are obtained by removing the seasonal cycle and the time series are detrended. The correlation coefficients (
   <span class="italic">r</span>) between the two lines are shown in the top right corner and the “*” means 
   <span class="italic">r</span> is significant at the 95% confidence level. The values in bracket are uncertainty range for the correlation coefficient at the 95% confidence level.
