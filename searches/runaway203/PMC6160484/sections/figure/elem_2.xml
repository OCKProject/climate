  <p>The spatial distribution of simulated global surface temperature. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Horizontal distribution of correlation coefficients between global surface temperature variations from E
   <sub>1–3</sub> and GISTEMP for the period 1979–2005. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), but for surface temperature from E
   <sub>4–6</sub> and GISTEMP. (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), but for surface temperature from E
   <sub>1–3</sub> and HadCRUT4. (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), but for surface temperature from E
   <sub>4–6</sub> and HadCRUT4. Surface temperature variations are obtained by removing the seasonal cycle and are detrended. Only positive correlations coefficients are shown. In the color bar, the values 0.136, 0.255, 0.323, 0.381, 0.445 and 0.487 correspond to the 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% and 99.9% confidence levels, respectively.
