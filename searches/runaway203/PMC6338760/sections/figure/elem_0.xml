  <p>The Antarctic Peninsula and the recent shifts of the ice shelf boundary. Shown is the drastic retreat of ice shelves (Larsen A and B) along the EAP margin since 1986, the recent crack of the Larsen C since 2010, the study site (JPC-38) (63.717°S, 57.411°W, 760 m water depth) (blue star) and the JRI ice core (black star)

   </span>. The arrows show the circulation of the CDW (orange) and WDW (light brown) around the Peninsula. Reanalyzed data and model simulations have been computed along the EAP margin (i.e., in the gray area). Dark and light blue lines correspond to the bathymetry at 2000 and 1000 m depth and delineate the continental shelf from the abyssal Weddell Sea basin
