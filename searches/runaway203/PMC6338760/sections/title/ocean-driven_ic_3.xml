 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the ice core-derived SAT were overall warmer throughout the Holocene than during the last two millennia and could have hence favored the EAP ice shelf surface melting during the entire period, the slow and gradual atmospheric cooling trend can hardly explain the initiation of the EAP ice shelf regression and its rapid disintegration between 8200 and 6000 years BP. Therefore, other mechanisms must be investigated. A good candidate is an ocean warming at depth over the Holocene, as observed for the most recent times. To investigate such a potential link, we provide the first EAP SOT record spanning the last 9000 years at a 100-year resolution. We use the well-dated marine 20-m-long Jumbo Piston core NBP99–03–38 (JPC-38)

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our record reveals a sharp SOT increase from 
  <span class="bold">~</span>8200 to 7000 years BP, followed by a continuous and slow ocean warming of +0.3 °C over the course of the mid-to-late Holocene (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), which is supported by diatom census counts in the same core
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. A similar warming has been recorded over the nearby South Orkney Plateau, in the northeast of the Powell Basin, where diatom assemblages reveal a pronounced decline in winter sea-ice cover possibly associated with a warming ocean between ~8200 and 4800 years BP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. In contrast to the SAT, which started to cool ~10,000 years BP ago, the abrupt ocean warming recorded at the JPC-38 core site occurred synchronously with the inferred retreat of the EAP ice shelves. Several studies reported an intensification and southward migration of SWW during the same period of time
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>

  </span>, South America (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). Building on modern observations, we suggest that this reorganization in the wind fields, including the strengthening and poleward displacement of the convergence zone between the SWW and the northward winds, promoted the upwelling and intrusion of warm deep waters on the EAP continental shelf. We propose that the increase in SOT initiated the ice shelf regression in the northeast EAP through enhanced basal/frontal melting and possibly iceberg calving. Our assumption is consistent with some recent findings in the Amundsen Sea, in southwestern Antarctic Peninsula, where the ice shelf shrinkage during the early Holocene has been similarly attributed to CDW shoaling driven by a more southern position of the SWW during the early Holocene

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The long-term SOT increasing trend at the JPC-38 core site was punctuated by up to 1.5 °C warm events at the centennial scale, while cold events dwarfed over the course of the Holocene (Fig.

Moreover, episodic peaks in SOT throughout the Holocene, resulting from additional supply or warming (or both) of deep water, which may have prevented the ice shelf from re-expanding during colder atmospheric phases, thus causing its progressive disintegration.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimating the impact of such an ocean warming on the ice shelf basal melting throughout the Holocene is not straightforward as it depends on many complex processes. Nevertheless, an order of magnitude including large uncertainties can be obtained using a simple parameterization
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. We assume a linear relationship between basal ice shelf melting and ocean temperature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. We consider an ice shelf front with a typical length of 250 km, i.e., the length of the Larsen A, B and Prince Gustav Channel ice shelf fronts before collapse (i.e., 1970s), which is shorter to the early-to-mid Holocene period given the large extension of the ice shelves in the northern part of the EAP at this time. As SOT constraints, we used a +0.3 °C (Holocene trend) and +1.5 °C (early Holocene) warming.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When considering an average SOT warming of +0.3 °C as observed in our records over the last 7400 years BP, we estimate a minimum net heat flux from the ocean to the ice shelf of 
  <span class="bold">~</span>3 × 10
  <span class="sup">11</span> J s
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and a melting rate of 
  <span class="bold">~</span>3 × 10
  <span class="sup">10</span> m
  <span class="sup">3</span> year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (or ~1 mSv) (see Methods). This would correspond to a melting of at least 
  <span class="bold">~</span>10 m of ice per year on a surface covering the whole ice shelf front and penetrating 12 km below the ice shelves. If instead we take the surface of the 1970s EAP ice shelves for which we have a reasonable estimate (around 12,300 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> when summing up the Larsen A and B and the Prince Gustav Channel ice shelf area), this would correspond to an average melt rate of the ice shelf of about 2.4 m per year. A +1.5 °C SOT warming as recorded between 
  <span class="bold">~</span>8200 and 7000 years BP in the EAP would imply a five times larger melt rate following the same parameterization. This clearly appears sufficient to have a large impact on ice shelf dynamics, especially as parameterizations using simple linear relations between ocean temperature and melting
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span> likely provide a lower estimate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. Therefore, although both ocean and atmosphere thermal forcing impacts on ice shelf instability, we conclude that, during the ocean warming phases, the SOT must have played a major role on controlling the regional ice shelf retreat.
