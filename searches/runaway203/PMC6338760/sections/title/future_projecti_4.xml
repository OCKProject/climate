 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the light of these new findings, we scrutinize the evolution of the SAT and SOT in projections from 26 climate models in order to anticipate the possible evolution of the ice caps of the Antarctic Peninsula during the next century. We focus on two different IPCC scenarios (referred to as the RCP 2.6 and 8.5), differing by their radiative forcing trajectories throughout the twenty-first century

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). We averaged the results of the different model simulations, thus filtering out most of the model internal variability, which allows to retrieve the forced temperature signal considered as the main response to potential anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the RCP2.6 scenario, we find that both SAT and SOT trends for the next century are relatively weak and remains in the range of reconstructed variations over the Holocene period, each of the trends being &lt;+1 °C and +0.1 °C over the next 90 years, respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). Placing these results in a Holocene context, regional temperatures variations suggest that the RCP2.6-forced simulated warming trends may lead to limited ice shelf disintegration in the near future, unless the ongoing warming may determine the ice shelf fate
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. In comparison, for the RCP8.5 scenario, projections exhibit regional atmospheric and oceanic warming trends that are three-to-four times higher than in the RCP2.6 scenario (warming by up to +3.5–4.5 °C and +0.3–0.4 °C in the atmosphere and subsurface ocean by 2100, respectively) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). Such subsurface ocean warming is comparable to the +0.3 °C increase inferred for the last 7400 years BP in core JPC-38 and similar to the SOT trend observed in reanalyses over the last decades.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the recent impact of the +0.3 °C warming on the ice shelf as well as during the Holocene, we anticipate an accelerated melting of EAP ice shelves over the next decades due to projected anthropogenic forcing. Together with the simulated +3 °C atmospheric warming, they will probably substantially increase the occurrence of huge collapses if the climatic trend continues to follow the RCP8.5 scenario. Since features such as wind-driven ocean circulation, sea-ice cover or the amount and distribution of the freshwater released to the ocean though ice-melt still need to be improved in climate models

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>, the warming of ocean temperature may be subdued in model projections. Consequently, the impact of changes in the wind forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> on the shoaling and further penetration of the warm deep waters on the continental shelf remains potentially underestimated. Thus, the future of the EAP ice shelf may be possibly more marked than projected. If the warm deep waters were to be redirected toward the continental shelf in the southernmost part of the Weddell Sea, enhanced heat content could increase by ~20% the yearly basal ice-melt underneath the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. Would such a predicted warming affect the whole Weddell Sea region, its impact on the surrounding ice sheets and glaciers would be marked for sea-level rise.
