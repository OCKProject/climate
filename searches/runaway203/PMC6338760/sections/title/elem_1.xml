   </span>, we first computed the variations of the Ekman pumping along the EAP margin since 1950 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) to decipher the link between wind forcing, in terms of strength and position, and evaluate its impact on the SOT. Ekman pumping anomalies experienced mainly negative values until the late 1970s and after the early 2000s (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>), indicating a downward velocity. This dominant downwelling regime over our study area probably results from a northern position of the convergence zone between the SWW and the southerly winds, blowing northward along the south EAP (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Conversely, the anomalies switched toward positive values during the 1980s (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) to peak in the 1990s, thus implying a shift toward a dominant upwelling regime. This shift from regionally downwelling to upwelling conditions is probably tied to the intensification and poleward displacement of the SWW circulation at that time
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>, which would have enlarged its influence at the expense of the northward wind fields. As such, dominant SWW, offshore winds would have favored the upward transport of deeper water masses.

Nevertheless, a certain time lag is sometimes observed between SOT and Ekman pumping variations, especially in the early 2000s. The subsurface temperature should quickly respond to variations in wind-driven upwelling of warmer deep ocean water. However, we suggest that the response is slowed down because of heat exchange between the upwelled water and the much colder atmosphere and surface waters. Other factors like a significant change in the temperature of the deep-water masses
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
   </span> may also have participated to the delay between the two records. We therefore argue that the SOT increase and associated warming of the EAP shelf resulted from two synergistic processes: (i) the enhanced penetration of warm deep waters on the shelf due to intensified wind-driven upwelling linked to a regional or global shift of the surface wind fields

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also find that the most rapid and abrupt SOT warming reconstructed around the EAP ice shelf over the last centuries concurred with the Larsen B ice shelf collapse, thus strongly suggesting that a slight SOT increase, in concert with atmospheric warming, has been pivotal in controlling the Larsen B ice shelf instability. While we miss robust observation data prior the 1970s, the continuous SOT increase during phases of smaller collapses may imply that SOTs have potentially contributed to other smaller ice shelf collapses along the EAP and around Antarctica. Comparatively, cold SOTs as observed in the early 2000s, probably due to a dominant downwelling forcing, during a period of pronounced SAT cooling

Our results suggest that both the ocean (through wind-driven circulation and off-shelf water temperature changes) and atmosphere (through SAT and wind stress changes) forcing have closely acted together over the last decades to either strongly destabilize the EAP ice shelves or, inversely, to limit their dislocation.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the ice core-derived SAT were overall warmer throughout the Holocene than during the last two millennia and could have hence favored the EAP ice shelf surface melting during the entire period, the slow and gradual atmospheric cooling trend can hardly explain the initiation of the EAP ice shelf regression and its rapid disintegration between 8200 and 6000 years BP. Therefore, other mechanisms must be investigated. A good candidate is an ocean warming at depth over the Holocene, as observed for the most recent times. To investigate such a potential link, we provide the first EAP SOT record spanning the last 9000 years at a 100-year resolution. We use the well-dated marine 20-m-long Jumbo Piston core NBP99–03–38 (JPC-38)

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span>. A similar warming has been recorded over the nearby South Orkney Plateau, in the northeast of the Powell Basin, where diatom assemblages reveal a pronounced decline in winter sea-ice cover possibly associated with a warming ocean between ~8200 and 4800 years BP
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
   </span>. In contrast to the SAT, which started to cool ~10,000 years BP ago, the abrupt ocean warming recorded at the JPC-38 core site occurred synchronously with the inferred retreat of the EAP ice shelves. Several studies reported an intensification and southward migration of SWW during the same period of time

   </span>, South America (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). Building on modern observations, we suggest that this reorganization in the wind fields, including the strengthening and poleward displacement of the convergence zone between the SWW and the northward winds, promoted the upwelling and intrusion of warm deep waters on the EAP continental shelf. We propose that the increase in SOT initiated the ice shelf regression in the northeast EAP through enhanced basal/frontal melting and possibly iceberg calving. Our assumption is consistent with some recent findings in the Amundsen Sea, in southwestern Antarctic Peninsula, where the ice shelf shrinkage during the early Holocene has been similarly attributed to CDW shoaling driven by a more southern position of the SWW during the early Holocene

Moreover, episodic peaks in SOT throughout the Holocene, resulting from additional supply or warming (or both) of deep water, which may have prevented the ice shelf from re-expanding during colder atmospheric phases, thus causing its progressive disintegration.

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimating the impact of such an ocean warming on the ice shelf basal melting throughout the Holocene is not straightforward as it depends on many complex processes. Nevertheless, an order of magnitude including large uncertainties can be obtained using a simple parameterization
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
   </span>. We assume a linear relationship between basal ice shelf melting and ocean temperature
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
   </span>. We consider an ice shelf front with a typical length of 250 km, i.e., the length of the Larsen A, B and Prince Gustav Channel ice shelf fronts before collapse (i.e., 1970s), which is shorter to the early-to-mid Holocene period given the large extension of the ice shelves in the northern part of the EAP at this time. As SOT constraints, we used a +0.3 °C (Holocene trend) and +1.5 °C (early Holocene) warming.
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When considering an average SOT warming of +0.3 °C as observed in our records over the last 7400 years BP, we estimate a minimum net heat flux from the ocean to the ice shelf of 
   <span class="bold">~</span>3 × 10
   <span class="sup">11</span> J s

   <span class="sup">−1</span> (or ~1 mSv) (see Methods). This would correspond to a melting of at least 
   <span class="bold">~</span>10 m of ice per year on a surface covering the whole ice shelf front and penetrating 12 km below the ice shelves. If instead we take the surface of the 1970s EAP ice shelves for which we have a reasonable estimate (around 12,300 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> when summing up the Larsen A and B and the Prince Gustav Channel ice shelf area), this would correspond to an average melt rate of the ice shelf of about 2.4 m per year. A +1.5 °C SOT warming as recorded between 
   <span class="bold">~</span>8200 and 7000 years BP in the EAP would imply a five times larger melt rate following the same parameterization. This clearly appears sufficient to have a large impact on ice shelf dynamics, especially as parameterizations using simple linear relations between ocean temperature and melting

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). Such subsurface ocean warming is comparable to the +0.3 °C increase inferred for the last 7400 years BP in core JPC-38 and similar to the SOT trend observed in reanalyses over the last decades.

  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the recent impact of the +0.3 °C warming on the ice shelf as well as during the Holocene, we anticipate an accelerated melting of EAP ice shelves over the next decades due to projected anthropogenic forcing. Together with the simulated +3 °C atmospheric warming, they will probably substantially increase the occurrence of huge collapses if the climatic trend continues to follow the RCP8.5 scenario. Since features such as wind-driven ocean circulation, sea-ice cover or the amount and distribution of the freshwater released to the ocean though ice-melt still need to be improved in climate models

Thus, the future of the EAP ice shelf may be possibly more marked than projected. If the warm deep waters were to be redirected toward the continental shelf in the southernmost part of the Weddell Sea, enhanced heat content could increase by ~20% the yearly basal ice-melt underneath the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf
