 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first assess the strength of the relationship between the three climate indices and catchment-averaged precipitation at 1263 gaging sites over seven decades. Marked spatial variations can be seen across the USA (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>): precipitation correlates positively with AOI in the central and south-western USA (Spearman’s ρ &gt; 0.6 in parts of the Midwest and Southwest), but negatively in the western USA (ρ &lt; −0.3 along parts of the West Coast). In the north-eastern USA, precipitation correlates positively with AOI but negatively with ONI. The AMOI correlates positively with rainfall over most of the low-lying parts of the northern USA and negatively over much of the southern USA (ρ often &lt; −0.3 from southern Texas to South Carolina but excluding Florida). These continental relationships between climate indices and precipitation/streamflow echo well-known spatial patterns (such as the prevalence of warmer and wetter conditions during a positive AOI in the central USA) but may depart from previous work due to different study periods

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Broadly, we find the influence of climate variability on precipitation patterns is reflected by streamflow. Differences among basins in the response of streamflow to climate variability are likely a function of catchment characteristics such as basin area, evapotranspiration, land cover
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>/vegetation, anthropogenic stresses
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span> such as flow abstraction/augmentation and groundwater exploitation, fraction of flow from snow/ice melt, and geological conditions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Catchments with more subdued flow regimes may reflect climate variability and changes in wetness better than smaller, flashier catchments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span> over these timescales (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). However, the extent of scatter in the underlying data suggests that across the USA other drivers, such as human impacts, modulate fluvial sensitivity to climate.
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next we consider the extent to which aspects of river channel 
  <span class="italic">form</span> reflect these climate-driven variations in precipitation and streamflow over inter- to multi-decadal time periods. At sites where the precipitation and streamflow rates are positively (negatively) correlated with a particular mode of climate variability, we expect that a positive phase of the climate mode may result in a larger (smaller) channel conveyance capacity. We hypothesize, following equilibrium theory
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>, that channel conveyance capacity may increase – on average – in wetter years (although channels may also aggrade during individual floods, but there are insufficient data to evaluate the role of sediment here). Variability in channel response (increased/decreased conveyance) is expected to arise from natural variability in river systems, anthropogenic impacts upstream, and/or uncertainties/error in the underlying channel geometry measurements.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We provide a detailed illustration of the relationship between the climate indices, precipitation, streamflow, and channel capacity/geometry at three sites, chosen for their data quality and contrasting response to different modes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). At Clear Creek (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>) over seven decades, precipitation and streamflow records are positively correlated (ρ = 0.86), as are the AOI and streamflow (ρ = 0.57). The normalized river channel conveyance capacity exhibits phases of expansion and contraction after the removal of any long-term trend. Despite considerable variability in the underlying stream measurements, the AOI and channel conveyance capacity (as well as area and mean flow velocity) are positively correlated (ρ = 0.47). At Deer Creek and Leaf River (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,c</a>), in contrast, we find a negative relationship between the ONI/AMOI and streamflow (ρ = −0.71/ρ = −0.54 respectively), which is also reflected in the channel capacity adjustments (ρ = −0.33/ρ = −0.60, respectively). The association between the climate index and channel geometry can sometimes be stronger than the relationship between the streamflow and channel geometry (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>; Supplementary Figs S5–S205), suggesting that discharge only partly explains changes in channel form. In other words, the climate modes may also be a proxy for other direct/indirect determinants of channel response, such as sediment delivery
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span> or variability in riparian/catchment vegetation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. To obtain a broader picture of channel response – acknowledging that the quality and reliability of measurements and computed relationships may vary across sites – we pool the data across all 67 rivers (their location is shown in Supplementary Figs S5–S205).

    <p>Temporal variations in climate indices, precipitation, streamflow, and river channel conveyance/geometry at three illustrative sites: (
     <span class="bold">a</span>) site 05454300: Clear Creek near Coralville, Iowa (AOI), (
     <span class="bold">b</span>) site 01580000: Deer creek at Rocks, Maryland (ONI); (
     <span class="bold">c</span>) site 02475000: Leaf River near McLain, Mississippi (AMOI). All graph units are standardised anomalies (
     <span class="italic">z</span>), except for the streamflow time series (m
     <span class="sup">3</span>/s) and Date. Within each panel, the time series indicate, from top to bottom: the climate index (
     <span class="italic">z</span>), streamflow (m
     <span class="sup">3</span>/s), the cross-sectional channel conveyance capacity (‘Channel capacity’, 
     <span class="italic">z</span>), the cross-sectional flow area (‘Area’, 
     <span class="italic">z</span>), and the cross-sectional average flow velocity (‘Flow velocity’, 
     <span class="italic">z</span>). Grey circles indicate field measurements (
     <span class="italic">z</span>) at different points in time (see Methods). Five-year median values (red lines) reflect average channel form, reducing the effects of noise and accounting for lag times between the climate index and the response of the river system. Scatterplots indicate the relationship between: (row 2) precipitation/flow and climate index/flow; (row 3): streamflow/channel capacity and climate index/channel capacity; (row 4); streamflow/area and climate index/area; (row 5); streamflow/flow velocity and climate index/flow velocity. Red lines indicate the corresponding linear regressions (standard error is in grey), with the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) in red for the five-year median values. Equivalent graphs (including five- and ten-year aggregates) are provided for all sites in the Supplementary information, including graphs of channel width and riverbed elevation.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assess the imprint of climate variability on alluvial channel morphology at each site by considering whether the correlation (ρ) between the climate index and precipitation displays the same sign as the correlation between the same climate index and the channel geometry. Despite considerable variability and uncertainty/noise in the underlying measurements, broadly, a positive (negative) correlation between the indices and precipitation emerges between the same indices and channel conveyance capacity at 63% of sites (based on 201 combinations of 67 sites and 3 climate indices; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). Split by mode, this represents 67% of sites for AMO, 57% for AO, and 66% for ONI. For comparison, repeating the same analysis with the non-detrended data indicates that the relationship holds in 70% of sites (67% AMO, 78% AO and 66% ONI). Hence, detrending reduces the number of sites with a detectable AO imprint (as expected, because AO displays a positive monotonic trend, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Thus, overall, the imprint of the modes is detectable with varying levels of strength in about two-thirds of the sites.

     <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) are used to compute the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) (i) between each climate index and precipitation (x-axes) and (ii) between the climate index and channel geometry (y-axes; from (

Climate indices are indicated as shapes and colours: orange circles (AOI), blue triangles (ONI), green squares (AMOI), with size of shapes indicating the drainage area.

 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An association between channel form and the climate indices is also evident for the cross-sectional flow area, cross-sectional mean flow velocity, channel width, and mean bed elevation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b–e</a>), although at any given site, the flow velocity, width, and depth do not necessarily exhibit the same direction of change, due to differences in channel adjustment. All three modes appear to associate with channel form, suggesting that the importance of large-scale climate patterns in driving channel form depends less on their periodicity than on the strength of their influence on regional rainfall/streamflow regimes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The clustering of orange circles in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> indicates that most sampled sites are in regions where there is a positive correlation between the AOI and precipitation (see Supplementary Figs S5–S205). Further research is needed to determine which catchment characteristics modulate the strength of this imprint; preliminary statistical tests indicate no significant differences in the slopes of the relationships shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> when data are stratified by basin area or mean annual precipitation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the response of river channels to large-scale modes of climate variability suggests that river networks may be viewed as dynamic, breathing systems that expand and contract over interannual to multidecadal timescales in synchrony with regional climate. Detecting robust morphological signals within the noise of transect data is technically demanding. However, this preliminary exploration provides evidence that channel form may well respond to modes of climate variability: wetter- or drier-than-average conditions are often associated with periodic increases/decreases in channel geometry and conveyance. The existence of links between climate indices and channel hydro-morphology (but also with river network properties such as active channel length, density, or fractal dimension) could be further evaluated using long-term measurements from remotely sensed data (e.g. satellite imagery). However, we do not expect channel conveyance to systematically increase everywhere in response to increased flow and caution that fluvial adjustments reflect the complex interplay of nonstationary anthropogenic and climatic influences within each basin, including feedback mechanisms
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. This variable behaviour typically precludes straightforward generalizations about channel response without assessing long term channel trajectories, local sediment yield conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>, and landcover history on a site-by-site basis.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings have implications for flood modelling, estimates of flood recurrence, and the design of riverine infrastructure in a changing climate. In flood models, channel geometry and conveyance are typically considered stationary and are recognised as one of the greatest sources of model uncertainty
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. Since channel conveyance capacity directly influences bankfull flood recurrence intervals
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, this work suggests that the assumption of channel stationarity may lead to systematic over- or under-prediction of the frequency of out-of-bank flow (i.e. flood return periods, duration, and inundation extent). Additionally, in engineering, if flood designs are based on data gathered during periods where climate modes favoured decreased channel conveyance there is a danger that surveyed channel dimensions and flood conveyance are underestimated over the longer-term. The existence of potential periodicities in river channel conveyance implies that flood models, infrastructure, and flood recurrence estimates should be designed to incorporate the temporal variability in channel dimensions, particularly in regions with rapidly changing hydroclimatic regimes and river morphodynamics. In due course, it may even be possible to assign quality markers to individual streamflow gauging stations according to the sensitivity of their cross-sections to climate variability.
