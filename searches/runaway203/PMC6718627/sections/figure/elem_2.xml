  <p>Temporal variations in climate indices, precipitation, streamflow, and river channel conveyance/geometry at three illustrative sites: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) site 05454300: Clear Creek near Coralville, Iowa (AOI), (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) site 01580000: Deer creek at Rocks, Maryland (ONI); (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) site 02475000: Leaf River near McLain, Mississippi (AMOI). All graph units are standardised anomalies (
   <span class="italic">z</span>), except for the streamflow time series (m
   <span class="sup">3</span>/s) and Date. Within each panel, the time series indicate, from top to bottom: the climate index (
   <span class="italic">z</span>), streamflow (m
   <span class="sup">3</span>/s), the cross-sectional channel conveyance capacity (‘Channel capacity’, 
   <span class="italic">z</span>), the cross-sectional flow area (‘Area’, 
   <span class="italic">z</span>), and the cross-sectional average flow velocity (‘Flow velocity’, 
   <span class="italic">z</span>). Grey circles indicate field measurements (
   <span class="italic">z</span>) at different points in time (see Methods). Five-year median values (red lines) reflect average channel form, reducing the effects of noise and accounting for lag times between the climate index and the response of the river system. Scatterplots indicate the relationship between: (row 2) precipitation/flow and climate index/flow; (row 3): streamflow/channel capacity and climate index/channel capacity; (row 4); streamflow/area and climate index/area; (row 5); streamflow/flow velocity and climate index/flow velocity. Red lines indicate the corresponding linear regressions (standard error is in grey), with the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) in red for the five-year median values. Equivalent graphs (including five- and ten-year aggregates) are provided for all sites in the Supplementary information, including graphs of channel width and riverbed elevation.
