 <div class="caption">
  <p>Relationships between climate indices and precipitation reflected in the channel geometry at each of 67 sites. Five-year median values of all variables (as in Figs 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) are used to compute the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) (i) between each climate index and precipitation (x-axes) and (ii) between the climate index and channel geometry (y-axes; from (
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">e</span>): channel conveyance capacity, cross-sectional flow area, cross-sectional mean flow velocity, channel width, and mean riverbed elevation). Note: Supplementary Figs S2 and S3 show the same plot with 
   <span class="italic">two- and ten-year</span> aggregation windows. Climate indices are indicated as shapes and colours: orange circles (AOI), blue triangles (ONI), green squares (AMOI), with size of shapes indicating the drainage area. Linear regression is shown for each index with confidence intervals in transparent colours. Note: Supplementary Fig. S4 shows the same plot but with the correlation between 
   <span class="italic">streamflow</span> and the climate index on the x-axis.
