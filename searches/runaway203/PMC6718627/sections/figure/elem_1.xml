  <p>Strength of the relationship between three climate indices and precipitation/streamflow at 1263 stream gages, 1950–2017, using 5-year median values. Rows indicate three indices: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) AOI, (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) ONI, (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) AMOI. Left column: Strength of correlation (Spearman’s ρ) between the climate indices and precipitation (background) or between the same climate indices and streamflow (circles). Red shades indicate negative relationship, blue positive relationship, white insignificant relationship. Right column: Correlations at every site (using the catchment-averaged precipitation and the streamflow at the gage). The strength of the association (ρ and linear regression with confidence intervals) is shown for all data (black), and for four groups reflecting streamflow variability (yellow to red, where red has the highest flow variability). Flow variability (or flashiness) is measured by the ratio of the 99
   <span class="sup">th</span> percentile of streamflow (high flow, Q
   <sub>99</sub>), to the 50
   <span class="sup">th</span> percentile of streamflow (median flow, Q
   <sub>50</sub>), over the entire period of record. Basin drainage area is indicated by circle size.
