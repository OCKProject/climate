  <p>Schematic illustrating the hypothesised response of an idealized catchment and river channel cross-section during a wet (left column) and a dry (right column) phase of a mode of climate variabilityÂ (over multiple years). (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Extension and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) contraction of the active fluvial network is symbolized by channel heads (red circles: only a selection is represented). During wet periods (left column), the length of the channel network may extend

   </span> migrate upstream and the active drainage network becomes more dense in response to heightened runoff; the reverse is true during dry periods. Below, a conceptual illustration of single-thread river channel cross-section indicates (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) increased conveyance during wet years and (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) decreased conveyance during dry years. Under constant sediment supply, enhanced runoff may result in more geomorphically effective (sediment-displacing) flow, thereby increasing channel cross-sectional conveyance capacity due to increased flow velocities and erosion of the river channel boundaries.
