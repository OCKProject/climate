 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigate 67 sites that have a high number and regular temporal density of transect measurements made consistently over five to seven decades at the same location. We sought to retain as many sites as possible. However, most gaging sites have either a sparse/irregular temporal density of measurements or inconsistent/unreliable transect location. Every page in Supplementary Figs S5–S205 indicates one site and one climate index. We used metadata from the USGS Annual Water Data reports to obtain information about any changes in gage location at all the sites. Sites with a change in gage location since 1950 were removed. Any minor changes in gage datum (i.e. at the same location) were corrected following ref.
