 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We computed standardised anomalies of the streamflow and precipitation aggregates (by subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the sample standard deviation)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>
  </span>, to facilitate comparisons with the climate indices and among sites with different physical and climate characteristics. The mean values of Q
  <sub>50</sub> and of Q
  <sub>99</sub>/Q
  <sub>50</sub> were computed using the 50
  <span class="sup">th</span> and 99
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentiles of the daily streamflow distribution using all available data (where Q
  <sub>99</sub> indicates the flow that is exceeded 1% of the time). Time series of estimated cross-sectional channel geometry, climate indices, streamflow, and precipitation data were all aggregated using the median value over two-, five- and ten-year periods starting on 1950-01-01. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (ρ) were computed between variables (e.g. precipitation and channel geometry) using two-, five- and ten-year median values calculated over identical timeframes. Across all sites (201 combinations), the mean sample size on which these correlations are based is 31 values (two-year aggregates), 13.1 (five-year) 6.7 (ten-year).
