 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate channel geometry adjustment to patterns of climate variability we use hydrometric measurements gathered by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) between 1950 and 2017

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Channel transect measurements are made at regular (monthly-seasonal) intervals to update streamflow rating curves, but can also be used to monitor changes in channel form

  </span>. One important caveat with channel transect measurements is that they are purposely located in stable sites along the river, thus detectable responses in channel form to climate modes are likely to be conservative. Here, we identified a subset of 67 gaging sites with exceptional temporal density of transects and consistent measurement location over time (predominantly in the eastern USA, where most of the long-term records are located; Supplementary Figs S5–S205). Time series of cross-sectional channel conveyance capacity (m
  <span class="sup">3</span>/s), cross-sectional flow area (m
  <span class="sup">2</span>), mean cross-sectional flow velocity (m/s), channel width (m), and riverbed elevation (m) were computed using residuals from rating relationships
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. We excluded sites with abrupt artificial shifts in flow over the period of record. Additionally, because channels may exhibit gradual positive/negative trends in conveyance capacity over time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span> (e.g. due to changes in sediment delivery from climatic and anthropogenic changes upstream, such as glacial melt, logging, or urbanisation), the data were detrended to remove such signals (and thus avoid spurious correlations with the climate indices) by computing standardised residuals of a linear regression model (see Supplementary Fig. S1). In practice, this means that some of the river channels may have become considerably wider/narrower, deeper/shallower over the seven decades, but we focus solely on the annual to multi-decadal fluctuations to assess whether they reflect climate variability. Thus, we question whether the prevailing assumption of stationarity (or quasi-equilibrium
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>) in channel form (i.e. the notion that channels reflect stationary, time-averaged distributions of streamflow) is reasonable, and appropriate for broader applications such as global flood modelling (e.g.
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. All data were aggregated (medians of channel form, precipitation, streamflow, and climate indices) over common non-overlapping two-, five- and ten-year blocks starting in 1950 (thus testing the sensitivity of channel response over different block lengths, acknowledging that temporal aggregation could dampen the climate signals). These temporal aggregates provide more robust estimates of average channel form than individual field measurements by reducing the influence of noise/gaps in the data and accounting for lag times (e.g.,
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>) in the response of channels to changing streamflow and sediment regimes. The use of identical aggregation periods for all variables provides a common baseline to assess whether climate variability (i.e. the occurrence of 
  <span class="italic">wetter- or drier-than-average phases</span>) is reflected in average conditions of precipitation, streamflow, and thereafter, channel morphology. Standardised anomalies of precipitation and streamflow aggregates were computed at each site by subtracting the long-term mean and dividing by the standard deviation, for comparability with the standardised channel geometry and climate indices (Supplementary Figs S5–S205).
