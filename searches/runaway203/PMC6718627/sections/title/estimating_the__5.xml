 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We quantify how channel conveyance and geometry vary over time using the residuals of the relationships between log-transformed estimates of channel dimensions and gage height. The approach is similar to
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span> and simplified from our earlier work
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span> because here we only require standardised residuals and not dimensional estimates of channel form. The method removes the influence of gage height on the relationship between the channel dimensions and time
  <span class="sup">

  </span>. Values of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>, 
  <span class="italic">A</span>, 
  <span class="italic">V, W</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">B</span> are transformed using the natural logarithm. We fit a Loess (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) curve with a span of alpha = 0.25 (found to be appropriate for all sites by examining all plots of the estimated channel measurements) to the relationships between 
  <span class="italic">G</span>-
  <span class="italic">lnQ</span>, 
  <span class="italic">G</span>-
  <span class="italic">lnA, G</span>-
  <span class="italic">lnV, G</span>-
  <span class="italic">lnW, and G</span>-
  <span class="italic">lnB</span> (all Loess fits are shown in Supplementary Figs S5–S205). The Loess fit represents time-averaged values of 
  <span class="italic">lnQ</span>, 
  <span class="italic">lnA, lnV, lnW, and lnB</span> for every value of 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. We compute the regression residuals (i.e. the observed minus the predicted values of the relationship) and transform the residuals back to dimensional units using the antilog (exp). These residuals provide an indication of variations in channels dimensions over time. However, to compare changes in channel form with precipitation, streamflow, and the channel indices, we must still detrend the data as described next.
