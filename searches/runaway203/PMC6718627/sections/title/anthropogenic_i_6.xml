 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Very few USGS stream gages can be defined as ‘pristine’ (i.e. have not experienced any human impacts on their sediment and/or streamflow regimes). Thus, restricting the data to pristine sites would have limited the analysis considerably given the strictness of our filtering criteria. Further, this analysis seeks to assess whether climate signals can be detected broadly across many USA sites – not just in pristine, unpopulated catchments (which are of lesser relevance to risk management). We remove any systematic long-term trajectories in the channel data (e.g., due to progressive shifts in sediment delivery from upstream) to minimize any potentially spurious correlations with the climate indices. For instance, long-term trends in channel geometry due to anthropogenic influences might coincide with an upward trend in the AOI. Channel measurements are thus detrended by extracting the standardised residuals from the linear regression between the dimensional residuals and the date, using the MASS

  </span> package in R. The effects of detrending are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1: after detrending, the relationship between channel geometry and streamflow/AMOI is still present, but not as strong as before.
