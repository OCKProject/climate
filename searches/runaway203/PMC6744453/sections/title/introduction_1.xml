 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a growing demand for a more accurate prediction and understanding of Arctic weather and climate, which puts great expectations on the global and regional forecasting and reanalysis systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Currently, weather and climate models are subjected to having various systematic errors, which induce large spread in results of different climate models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> and have a significant impact on the local and mid-latitude prediction skill
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Also, contemporary global reanalysis products, often used in climate research in order to monitor climate change and variability, or to evaluate climate model systems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>, have large biases in temperature, humidity and wind speed in the Arctic

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specifically, in the Arctic surface energy balance significant deviations between climate models are found
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Within the coupled atmosphere, ocean, snow, and sea-ice system, this energy balance controls the growth and melt of sea-ice, as well, as the thermal stratification of the lower atmosphere. Thus, the accurate simulation of the Arctic surface energy budget is key for improving our understanding of the rapid climate change in the Arctic, as well as, advancing long term prediction of sea-ice properties in the future.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During Arctic winter clear-sky events (CSE) over sea-ice, with the absence of solar radiation and the strong longwave radiative cooling, the air temperatures can drop to −40 °C. Studies of the winter Arctic surface energy budget show that the radiative cooling of the troposphere is balanced by the advection of heat from lower latitudes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. In addition, in sea-ice covered regions the ocean moderates the low temperatures during CSEs in contrast to the land surfaces, where minimum temperatures of −50 to −60 °C occur
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, we investigate the ability of contemporary regional and global weather prediction systems and global reanalysis systems to simulate the low temperatures observed during CSEs. We use the in-situ data set from the N-ICE 2015 drift campaign
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span> and a pan-Arctic sea-ice surface temperature satellite product. We find a warm bias in almost all analysed model systems and show that it is induced by a missing representation of snow on sea-ice. Furthermore, the simplistic representation of sea-ice thickness and concentration in the analysed model systems contribute to inconsistencies in the simulation of sea-ice surface temperatures.
