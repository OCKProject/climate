  <span class="italic">bisanensis</span>, which is currently an abundant species in the closed bay and brackish lake bottoms around the Japanese Island, were picked from each residual sediment sample (Supplementary Table

  </span>. The δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C records of the ostracode shells from a total of 176 measurements were explored using an IsoPrime mass spectrometer with an automated carbonate preparation system (IsoPrime Multiprep) (Isoprime Ltd., U.K.) at the Center for Advanced Marine Core Research, Kochi University, Japan. The δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C values were calculated by means of six repeated measurements. The values are expressed on a VPDB (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) scale. The analytical precision was confirmed by repeated measurements of standard IAEA-CO-1 (δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C: +2.49‰, δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O: −2.4‰) and IAEA603 (δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C: +2.46‰, δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O: −2.37‰). The analytical errors of δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>C and δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O were ±0.05‰ and ±0.06‰, respectively.
