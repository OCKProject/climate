  </span>. The East Asian monsoon, which is one of the largest monsoon systems, covers the regions including China, the Korean Peninsula and Japan
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. The East Asian monsoon is composed of southeastern winds in summer and northwestern winds in winter. The summer monsoon transports a large volume of water vapour to the continents, providing important water resources. High-resolution speleothem records from caves have clarified the variations in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and their relations to other climate and sun patterns. In particular, new records from various regions over the last two decades have improved the understanding of monsoon mechanisms and the driving forces during the Quaternary

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Numerous EASM records, particularly those from stalagmites in Chinese caves, have indicated that both the orbital-scale and millennial-scale EASM variations are mainly due to solar insolation

  </span>, and climate in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> have been proposed to be strongly linked to the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon. However, due to the small number of centennial-scale EASM records compared to the number of orbital- and millennial-scale records, coherent centennial-scale EASM variations and the relationships between the centennial-scale EASM variations and solar activity remain vague.

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regardless of the significance and usefulness of the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O records in stalagmites, their inconsistencies between nearby caves have been recognized
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, there are controversies that the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O records in stalagmites from southern China reflect the isotopic compositions of water vapour from the upstream source region and not the EASM intensity in southern China

According to the EASM records based on this method, centennial-scale EASM variations with periodicities of 300–500 yrs and no relationship with solar activity during the last 1.8 kyrs were defined. This result disagreed with the previous observations that the EASM was strongly linked to solar activities, as found in orbital- and millennial-scale EASM variations. In the present study, we reconstructed the centennial-scale EASM intensity over the last 3 kyrs to reveal the common EASM intensity and its relation to solar activity.
