  <span class="sup">

  </span> was also compared to our data (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). The standardized values and their comparisons show the variability of the multi-centennial-scale EASM intensity and coherence in Asian monsoonal regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Some weak millennial-scale EASM events that existed in the records from Baeg-nyong Cave, the Korean Peninsula

  </span>, Niu Cave, Central China

  </span> and Dongge Cave
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> were identical. Some of the events were correlated with the weak period in our records, inferring that some of the millennial-scale EASM weak periods found in the present study coincide with the EASM variations of a much longer timescale.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A common ~200 yr periodicity of both the core and atmospheric 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C was identified from the spectral analysis of the standardized values of the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O records of adult ostracode shells (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Furthermore, wavelet analysis inferred that the ~200 yr periodicity dominated between BC 900 and BC 100 in both the N2015 core and atmospheric 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C. No distinguishable cycle was recognized between BC 100 and AD 400. Strong 300–500 yr periodicities, which differ from the cycles found in atmospheric 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C, were observed since AD 400 in the N2015 and X cores (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). In addition to these periodicities, the comparisons of the EASM records infer that the EASM variations over the last 3 kyrs were divided into three intervals according to the timing of EASM intensity and relations to solar activity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Interval I was recognized between BC 800 and BC 100. Strong EASM intervals in Lake Nakaumi were precisely correlated with those in Dongge Cave
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> and approximately correlated with those in Heshang Cave
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, in addition to the predominance of the 200 yr periodicity. Interval II, which occurred between BC 100 and AD 400, was characterized by EASM variations with relatively small amplitudes from Lake Nakaumi, as well as small amplitudes in the atmospheric 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C variations. However, distinguished small amplitudes were never exhibited in the stalagmite records from East Asia. There was no correlation between the EASM intensity and periodicity in both our records and those from stalagmites. The common 300–400 yr periodicities that were never recognized from atmospheric 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C were dominant in both cores from Lake Nakaumi during Interval III (AD 400–1800). The EASM intensity in Lake Nakaumi agrees with those in Wanxiang Cave, which is located farthest north of the three caves, whereas the EASM intensity from Lake Nakaumi disagrees with the stalagmite records from Dongge and Heshang Caves during this interval.
