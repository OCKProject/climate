 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 200 yr cycles found in Interval I which are called the De Vries/Suess cycle, are frequently identified in climate change records such as temperature and precipitation variations during the Holocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. These cycles are thought to be associated with solar activity because 200 yr periodicity has been observed in the production rates of the cosmic isotopes 
  <span class="sup">10</span>Be and 
  <span class="sup">14</span>C
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. Several previous investigations identified correlations between the EASM intensity and solar cycles, particularly in millennial and orbital time scales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. The cycle with a periodicity of 200 yr was found in the EASM intensity derived from the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O records in stalagmites from Dongge Cave, southern China, as well as 80 and 340 yr cycles during the last 4.2 kyrs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Coherent centennial-scale EASM variations within the regions affected by the EASM and the predominance of the 200 yr periodicity between BC 800 and BC 100 imply that solar activity strongly affected the EASM intensity, and the EASM variability was controlled by the common occurrence of the system in East Asia.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conversely, the EASM variations and the factors controlling them are slightly inconsistent since BC 100. Limited association of the EASM variations with solar activity was confirmed. The EASM variations in the Japanese archipelago, expanding to Wanxiang Cave, central China, differed from those covering Dongge Cave, southern China, suggesting that consistent EASM variations were restricted to a particular region after BC 100. The precipitation-based ENSO cycle indicated by the high intensity of Launa Pallcacocha sediments, southern Ecuador
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>, coincided with other broad climatic records from East Asia
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>, suggesting that this record is one of the representative ENSO variation during the late Holocene. The enhanced ENSO (prominent El Niño) represents a good correlation to the strong centennial-scale EASM variations from Lake Nakaumi after AD 400 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This observation reveals that EASM fluctuations are linked to sea surface temperature anomalies in the equatorial Pacific Ocean related to ENSO since BC100. A strong correlation between the centennial-scale EASM intensity and ENSO was observed from stalagmite records over the past 3 kyrs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> as well as for the Asian summer monsoons derived from other proxy records
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Lu 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span> suggested that ENSO was responsible for drought and flooding in China during the late Holocene, although these relations were never found in the mid-Holocene. Generally the weak millennial-scaled EASM events were correlated with the prominent ENSO periods
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>, which is opposite of the correlations found in this study. Enhanced ENSO causes low surface temperatures in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean. This situation induces the development of relatively cold air in the middle latitudes of the western Pacific Ocean. As a result, high-pressure conditions occur in the mid-latitudes of the Pacific Ocean, which produces a low EASM intensity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. However, recent investigations identified regional contrast in precipitation between low- and mid-latitudinal areas in the Northern Hemisphere of the western Pacific during the past millennia. These regional variations are induced by Pacific Walker circulation variations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span> and meridional circulation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span> which profoundly affect precipitation in tropical Pacific regions and the mean position of the intertropical convergence zone. Hence our finding of a positive correlation between EASM intensity and ENSO is explained by these phenomena, although the mechanisms of EASM variation are complicated.
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unless ENSO showed a prominent coincidence with the EASM variations in and around the Japanese archipelago, solar activity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> and North Atlantic circulation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span> were proposed as factors that affected the centennial-scale EASM variations in southern China, as well as air temperature in North China
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span> during the last 2 kyrs. In addition, the stalagmite δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O records from Baeg-nyong Cave in Korea indicated that the EASM variations accompanying the periodicity that was shorter than the millennial scale occurred independently from the North Atlantic climate system over the past 4 kyrs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>, corresponding to our results. This evidence infers that the prominent factors that affected the centennial-scale EASM variations varied in each region since 2 kyr, inferring that the EASM system around the Japanese archipelago was separated at least from southern and northern China.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, we observed that solar activity was the most exclusive factor that controlled the EASM prior to BC 100, and then, the main factor modulating the EASM variations changed, at least in and around the Japanese archipelago. Furthermore, the primary factor was not common throughout the EASM region, although ENSO-induced sea surface temperature gradients were the main factor in and around the Japanese archipelago since BC 100. A prominent shift in climate variations was found at approximately 2 kyr, which is termed the “2 kyr shift”
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. The relationships between the millennial-scale EASM intensity from the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O records of stalagmites in Sanbao Cave and insolation shifted from positive to negative at 2 kyr. The 2 kyr shift agrees with our findings that the EASM system changed drastically at BC 100. A few reasons for the 2 kyr shift have been proposed. The shift was invoked by the strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> and increases in greenhouse gasses
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>, although there is little evidence for this phenomenon. Monsoon variations are affected by external forcing, including solar insolation and internal feedback, such as Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, high latitude climate changes and ENSO. As previously mentioned, solar insolation is an important factor that directly controls the EASM. Insolation at 30°N in July has decreased from BC 800 to present
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), although the amplitude of this decrease is small. Earth’s climate as well as the Indian summer monsoon are quite sensitive to small variations in solar irradiance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. The reduction in insolation might have induced a shift in the factors modulating the centennial-scale variations in the EASM intensity from solar activity to external factors at BC 100 in both the Japanese archipelago and Sanbao Cave. Subsequently, indirect relationships between EASM variations and solar insolation were recognized. The amplitude of the orbital-scale EASM variation is not necessarily consistent with that of insolation during the periods in which insolation was weak, particularly during glacial periods of 20 kyr, 70 kyr and 110 kyr BP, suggesting that there were nonlinear responses for the centennial-scale EASM variations that occurred during those intervals
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results and compiled data propose that insolation variation was a primary factor of the centennial-scale EASM variations in all regions affected by the EASM during periods of high insolation, as noted in previous studies. However, we suggest that the factor exerting the EASM variations, at least at the centennial scale, has varied in the past due to low solar insolation intensity and was variable throughout the monsoonal areas in some situations. From this point of view, similar turnovers of the dominant factors for the EASM variations were observed in Gonghan Lake in China
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>, Qinghai Lake, northeastern Tibetan Plateau
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>, and Lake Biwa, central Japan
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. In particular, the facts that solar activities are partly responsible for the variations in the Asian summer monsoon and the dominant factor changed after 32 ka in Qinghai Lake support our idea that the dominant forcing of EASM variations most likely changed according to the intensity of solar insolation.
