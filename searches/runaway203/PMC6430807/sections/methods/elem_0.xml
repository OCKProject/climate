  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The N2015 core (35°28.205′N, 133°10.894′E) was taken from the central part of Lake Nakaumi at a depth of 6.3 m in 2015 by an air-pressured piston corer. The core was mostly composed of mud bearing shell fragments. The core sediments were cut into one-cm-thick slices and washed on a 63 µm opening sieve. Then, the residual materials were dried at room temperature. Eight samples of plant materials and molluscan shells were used for 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C dating (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). The age model was calculated by a cubic equation based on the median age of eight calculated 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C ages, suggesting that the age of the core dated back to BC 800 and deposition had been successive (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). An average marine reservoir age of 400 yrs was subtracted from each 
   <span class="sup">14</span>C age following the methods of Yamada 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.

The δ

   <span class="sup">18</span>O: −2.4‰) and IAEA603 (δ
