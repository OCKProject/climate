   <span class="italic">B</span>) Paleothermometer values for each individual simulated DO warming event. Coefficients are shown from five ice core sites. Each coefficient is calculated for a single DO event (

   <span class="italic">r</span> values suggest that sea ice reconstructions based on DYE3 ice would be invaluable. Note that
