  <p>(a) Difference in near‐surface accumulation mode aerosol number concentration averaged from 2070 to 2099 (experiment minus LENS control); (b) black carbon, OC, and SO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions north of 66.5°N from trans‐Arctic shipping (red curves; SO
   <sub>4</sub> calculated as 2.5% of SO
   <sub>2</sub> at the surface) added to experiment runs, along with black carbon, OC and SO
   <sub>2</sub> loadings from shipping in IPCC AR5 (blue curves) and from all sources in IPCC AR5 (green curves) in experiment and LENS control runs. Emissions are shown as monthly means for every 10 years (2010, 2020, …, 2100) and linearly interpolated in years between in model simulations. DJF = December‐January‐February; MAM = March‐April‐May; JJA = June‐July‐August; SON = September‐October‐November.
