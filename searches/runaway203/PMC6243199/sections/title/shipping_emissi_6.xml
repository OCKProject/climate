 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to technical accessibility, Arctic routes require a cost incentive to justify their use over the traditional Suez Canal route. A cost incentive is assumed when the cost of transporting a unit of cargo via the Arctic is lower than via the Suez Canal. Owing to beam and draft limitations along the Northern Sea Route (Brigham et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0004">1999</a>), a standard Panamax vessel (80,000 deadweight tons [dwt] capacity) is assumed for Arctic transits, while a larger 
  <span class="italic">New Panamax</span> (120,000 dwt capacity) is assumed for Suez transits (Stott, 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0058">2012</a>). Ships are assumed to operate at full capacity. The transport cost per unit of cargo (2010 dollars) via the Arctic is calculated as:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emissions from Arctic shipping in a given month are derived from the aggregate fuel consumption of Arctic transits, determined from the number of fully laden transits (rounded up) using an 80,000‐dwt vessel that would be required to transport the quantity of traded goods projected for each Europe‐Asia port pair in a given month. Aggregate fuel consumption is calculated by multiplying the fuel consumption per transit by the number of required transits for each port pair, then summing for all port pairs. Gridded fuel consumption is estimated by distributing the aggregate quantity of fuel consumed over the least‐cost routes determined in section 
  <a rid="grl58008-sec-0005" ref-type="sec" href="#grl58008-sec-0005">2.1.1</a>, weighted by the number of vessels passing through the grid cell. Gridded fuel consumption is converted to emissions of BC, OC, and SO
  <sub>2</sub> based on emissions factors described by Buhaug et al. (
