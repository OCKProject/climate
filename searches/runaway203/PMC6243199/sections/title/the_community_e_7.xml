 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate climate responses to the projected trans‐Arctic shipping emissions, we use the latest version (1.2.2) of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (Hurrell et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0022">2013</a>). CESM is a fully coupled global climate model that provides the state‐of‐the‐art simulations of climate states without any 
  <span class="italic">flux adjustment</span>. It consists of atmosphere (Community Atmosphere Model, CAM5), land (Community Land Model, CLM4.0 including Carbon and Nitrogen cycles), ocean (Parallel Ocean Program, POP2), and sea ice (Los Alamos Sea Ice Model, CICE) components at 1° resolution.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimated monthly trans‐Arctic shipping emissions (BC, OC, SO
  <sub>2</sub>, and SO
  <sub>4</sub>) are injected into the lowest atmospheric model layer along with other emission inventories from IPCC AR5 (Lamarque et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0030">2010</a>) under the RCP 8.5 scenario. BC, OC, and SO
  <sub>4</sub> from shipping emissions are injected in the accumulation mode (between 0.1 and 2.5 μm). SO
  <sub>4</sub> from shipping is estimated as 2.5% of SO
  <sub>2</sub>, consistent with other emission inventories from IPCC AR5, while the remaining 97.5% of SO
  <sub>2</sub> is injected to the bottom layer of the model and eventually converts to SO
  <sub>4</sub> in different size modes through a series of chemical and aerosol microphysical processes (X. Liu et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0034">2012</a>). Following one spin‐up year (2005) branched from a 20th‐century transient climate simulation, we simulate and analyze the period 2006–2099. The 2005 spin‐up year allows atmospheric processes at local to regional scales to equilibrate to initial aerosol forcing (Simmonds, 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0052">1985</a>), after which seasonal trans‐Arctic shipping emissions increase (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0001">1</a>b). Five ensemble runs with slight perturbations in their initial temperatures comprise the experiment. Results are compared to a 40‐member average of control simulations from the CESM Large Ensemble Project (LENS), an ensemble of fully coupled CESM1 simulations under RCP 8.5 (Kay et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0026">2015</a>). A control run using the same model version and component set as the experiment was also performed for comparison with LENS simulations. Except for trans‐Arctic shipping emissions, external forcing in the experiment runs is identical to that of the LENS ensemble.

  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0001">1</a> shows (a) the difference in near‐surface aerosol number concentration in the accumulation mode averaged from 2070 to 2099 between the experiment runs and LENS ensemble‐average control runs and (b) added trans‐Arctic shipping emissions and emissions from nonshipping sources. Near‐surface averages rather than whole‐column averages are shown in order to clearly illustrate aerosol distributions added to the model along shipping tracks at the surface. By 2070, most optimal trans‐Arctic routes pass over the North Pole rather than along the coastal NSR, leading to the accumulation pattern shown in Figure
