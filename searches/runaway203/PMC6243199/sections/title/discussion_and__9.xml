 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulations assume a future of continued overall Arctic ice decline, growing global economic output, and sustained (though not necessarily increasing) integration of Asian and European markets in line with IPCC high‐emissions scenario assumptions (Riahi et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0044">2011</a>). However, even as the Arctic continues to warm at twice the rate of the global average, we find that the net regional climatic impact of trans‐Arctic shipping emissions will likely be less warming. This is because in contrast to previous studies, increased BC emissions do not cause significant warming in our simulations relative to cloud radiative effects, in line with minor BC radiative forcing found in the Arctic from in situ measurements (0.06 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and previous model simulations (0.51 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>; Dang et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0017">2017</a>; Qian et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0043">2014</a>). Instead, aerosol direct effects are offset by reduced water vapor enabling increased shortwave downwelling and reduced surface albedo from BC is counteracted by substantial increases in cloud albedo. In short, cooling driven by sulfate‐induced liquid cloud formation dominates in our experiment. However, we emphasize that the magnitude of this cooling effect (~1 °C) is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the overall regional warming in RCP 8.5 (~10 °C). Although the CESM model that we use is more sophisticated than those used in prior studies, it is possible that the cooling we simulate may reflect enhanced liquid water path caused by a large decrease in the rate of conversion of cloud to rainwater when cloud droplet number increases (Wang et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0066">2013</a>; Zhou &amp; Penner, 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0071">2017</a>). The current atmospheric component of CESM (CAM5) has a more realistic representation of cloud properties than its predecessor (CAM4), with a substantial improvement in Arctic cloud seasonal cycle (Kay et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0027">2012</a>). CAM5 has been shown to underestimate cloud liquid water path and ice water path in the Arctic relative to observations, though to a lesser degree than other CMIP5 models (Komurcu et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0029">2014</a>). Further improvements in the representation of cloud‐aerosol physics in ESMs will be necessary to confirm or alter our conclusions and further reduce uncertainty in climate projections (Schneider et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0048">2017</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results should not be taken as an endorsement of Arctic shipping as a solution to climate change. In addition to enhancing the risk of oil spills in ice‐covered waters, shipping enables extraction of new Arctic hydrocarbon resources, accelerating warming and delaying the transition toward a low‐carbon energy system. For example, investment in ice‐class carriers is often cited as a prerequisite for further development of Russian Arctic oil, gas, and mineral projects along the Northern Sea Route, such as Yamal LNG and Norilsk Nickel (Orttung &amp; Reisser, 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0041">2014</a>; Stephenson &amp; Agnew, 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0054">2016</a>). As shipping will likely contribute a minor share of the total Arctic aerosol emissions by midcentury (Browse et al., 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0005">2013</a>), BC from such coastal sources may counteract the cooling effect from enhanced clouds. Furthermore, planned global limits on ships' SO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions after 2020 (IMO, 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0023">2018</a>) will reduce aerosol cooling from shipping in much the same way that air quality improvements since the 1970s have unmasked GHG warming in urban areas. In this way, the net climatic impact of Arctic shipping will ultimately depend on international regulatory and trade agreements in addition to marine access. Our results thus highlight a need for integrated analysis of climatic and transport systems to further clarify the reciprocal relationship of climate and human activities in the Arctic.
