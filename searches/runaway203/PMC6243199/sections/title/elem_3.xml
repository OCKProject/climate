  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projected emission inventories from trans‐Arctic shipping during the period 2006–2099 were derived from simulated voyages computed by combining ESM‐projected sea ice distribution with projected Europe‐Asia trade. Transits take place when two conditions are met: (1) sea ice conditions enable technical access between Europe and Asia; (2) operating costs of shipping via the least‐cost Arctic route are lower than via the Suez Canal route.

    <a rid="grl58008-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0056">2015</a>). Monthly projected sea ice concentration and thickness data are obtained from 10 ESMs shown to simulate well the observed climatology, trend, and seasonal amplitude of 20th‐century and early 21st‐century sea ice extent and volume (Jahn et al., 
    <a rid="grl58008-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0025">2012</a>; J. Liu et al.,

    <a rid="grl58008-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0056">2015</a>). Monthly data are averaged across models to form the ensemble average of sea ice concentration and thickness from 2006 to 2099. Optimal least‐cost navigation routes are derived from ESM data following the Arctic Ice Regime Shipping System framework (Transport Canada, 
    <a rid="grl58008-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0063">1998</a>) described in detail by Stephenson et al. (
    <a rid="grl58008-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0057">2013</a>). Pairwise Europe‐Asia routes are computed using a least‐cost path algorithm between 4 European and 14 East Asian port regions (combining ports serving common regional markets) that are among the top 50 ports worldwide in 2010 
    <span class="italic">twenty‐foot equivalent unit</span> traffic (Containerisation International, 
    <a rid="grl58008-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0011">2012</a>). Route paths are allowed to vary to minimize transit time, encompassing coastal routes such as the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage as well as direct transits over the North Pole.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to technical accessibility, Arctic routes require a cost incentive to justify their use over the traditional Suez Canal route. A cost incentive is assumed when the cost of transporting a unit of cargo via the Arctic is lower than via the Suez Canal. Owing to beam and draft limitations along the Northern Sea Route (Brigham et al., 
    <a rid="grl58008-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0004">1999</a>), a standard Panamax vessel (80,000 deadweight tons [dwt] capacity) is assumed for Arctic transits, while a larger 
    <span class="italic">New Panamax</span> (120,000 dwt capacity) is assumed for Suez transits (Stott, 
    <a rid="grl58008-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0058">2012</a>). Ships are assumed to operate at full capacity. The transport cost per unit of cargo (2010 dollars) via the Arctic is calculated as:

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emissions from Arctic shipping in a given month are derived from the aggregate fuel consumption of Arctic transits, determined from the number of fully laden transits (rounded up) using an 80,000‐dwt vessel that would be required to transport the quantity of traded goods projected for each Europe‐Asia port pair in a given month. Aggregate fuel consumption is calculated by multiplying the fuel consumption per transit by the number of required transits for each port pair, then summing for all port pairs. Gridded fuel consumption is estimated by distributing the aggregate quantity of fuel consumed over the least‐cost routes determined in section 
    <a rid="grl58008-sec-0005" ref-type="sec" href="#grl58008-sec-0005">2.1.1</a>, weighted by the number of vessels passing through the grid cell. Gridded fuel consumption is converted to emissions of BC, OC, and SO

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate climate responses to the projected trans‐Arctic shipping emissions, we use the latest version (1.2.2) of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (Hurrell et al., 
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0022">2013</a>). CESM is a fully coupled global climate model that provides the state‐of‐the‐art simulations of climate states without any 
   <span class="italic">flux adjustment</span>. It consists of atmosphere (Community Atmosphere Model, CAM5), land (Community Land Model, CLM4.0 including Carbon and Nitrogen cycles), ocean (Parallel Ocean Program, POP2), and sea ice (Los Alamos Sea Ice Model, CICE) components at 1° resolution.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimated monthly trans‐Arctic shipping emissions (BC, OC, SO
   <sub>2</sub>, and SO
   <sub>4</sub>) are injected into the lowest atmospheric model layer along with other emission inventories from IPCC AR5 (Lamarque et al., 
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0030">2010</a>) under the RCP 8.5 scenario. BC, OC, and SO
   <sub>4</sub> from shipping emissions are injected in the accumulation mode (between 0.1 and 2.5 μm). SO
   <sub>4</sub> from shipping is estimated as 2.5% of SO
   <sub>2</sub>, consistent with other emission inventories from IPCC AR5, while the remaining 97.5% of SO
   <sub>2</sub> is injected to the bottom layer of the model and eventually converts to SO
   <sub>4</sub> in different size modes through a series of chemical and aerosol microphysical processes (X. Liu et al., 
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0034">2012</a>). Following one spin‐up year (2005) branched from a 20th‐century transient climate simulation, we simulate and analyze the period 2006–2099. The 2005 spin‐up year allows atmospheric processes at local to regional scales to equilibrate to initial aerosol forcing (Simmonds, 
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0052">1985</a>), after which seasonal trans‐Arctic shipping emissions increase (Figure 
   <a rid="grl58008-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0001">1</a>b). Five ensemble runs with slight perturbations in their initial temperatures comprise the experiment. Results are compared to a 40‐member average of control simulations from the CESM Large Ensemble Project (LENS), an ensemble of fully coupled CESM1 simulations under RCP 8.5 (Kay et al., 
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0026">2015</a>). A control run using the same model version and component set as the experiment was also performed for comparison with LENS simulations. Except for trans‐Arctic shipping emissions, external forcing in the experiment runs is identical to that of the LENS ensemble.
