Monthly projected sea ice concentration and thickness data are obtained from 10 ESMs shown to simulate well the observed climatology, trend, and seasonal amplitude of 20th‐century and early 21st‐century sea ice extent and volume (Jahn et al.,

Monthly data are averaged across models to form the ensemble average of sea ice concentration and thickness from 2006 to 2099. Optimal least‐cost navigation routes are derived from ESM data following the Arctic Ice Regime Shipping System framework (Transport Canada,

Pairwise Europe‐Asia routes are computed using a least‐cost path algorithm between 4 European and 14 East Asian port regions (combining ports serving common regional markets) that are among the top 50 ports worldwide in 2010
