 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our experiment demonstrates a clear and small yet significant slowing of Arctic warming as a result of trans‐Arctic shipping emissions. Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0002">2</a> shows that by 2099, sea surface temperature (SST) north of 66.5
  <span class="bold">°</span>N is nearly 1 °C cooler, and sea ice extent greater by nearly 500,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, in the experiment runs compared to the LENS control. The shipping‐induced cooling (~1 °C) is a small fraction of net RCP8.5 warming (~10 °C), comparable in magnitude (though opposite in sign) to Arctic warming from anthropogenic CH
  <sub>4</sub> scaled to the LENS control results over the same period, based on CH
  <sub>4</sub> effective radiative forcing (IPCC, 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0024">2013</a>). Patterns of relative cooling vary spatially and seasonally. The greatest cooling and sea ice growth occur throughout the central Arctic basin in winter (DJF) and along the Greenland‐Barents Sea ice edge in spring (MAM; Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0003">3</a>). This seasonal pattern is driven mainly by the ice‐ocean contrast, as new sea ice depresses surface temperature due to reduced ocean‐atmosphere heat exchange and increased albedo (Ruddiman, 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0045">2001</a>). Cooling occurs throughout the Arctic rather than along the ocean swaths corresponding to least‐cost shipping routes, indicating that climatic impacts from shipping will be regional rather than local in scale. Cooling is most significant from 2060 onward due to a step change in emissions in late winter/early spring, owing to a 613% increase in shipping transits in MAM from 2060 to 2099 compared with a 143% increase during the rest of the year over this period. Period‐averaged differences in key climatic variables between experiment and control runs, with significance indicators from a two‐tailed Student's 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test, are in Table

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cooling trends in the experiment are underpinned by robust increases in cloud cover and liquid water content, primarily along shipping routes, driven by sulfate (SO
  <sub>4</sub>) aerosol enhancement. Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S1</a> depicts increases in total cloud fraction of over 0.3% per year and in cloud liquid water path of over 0.3 g/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> per year from 2006 to 2099 in the experiment runs, leading to cumulative increases of approximately 35% and 5 g/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, respectively, by 2099. The experimental cloud fraction and cloud liquid water path substantially exceed one standard deviation beyond their LENS control counterparts. Cloud fraction increases are widespread over the central Arctic Ocean in spring (MAM) and summer (JJA), while liquid water path increases are primarily in summer (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S2</a>). Cloud fraction and water (both ice and liquid) changes are negligible during winter (DJF) despite the largest changes in temperature and ice concentration occurring in this season (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0003">3</a>). This winter temperature decrease is a 
  <span class="italic">delayed cooling</span> that stems from a sharp decrease in radiative flux in summer (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S7</a>a) which lowers SST over open water in fall (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S7</a>b) and enhances ice growth in winter (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S7</a>c). More relatively warm ocean area covered by sea ice causes a marked temperature decrease throughout the Arctic basin in the experiment runs compared to the LENS control (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S7</a>b). A snapshot in 2099 shows close spatial correspondence between surface temperature and ice fraction (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S8</a>). Winter sea ice growth also insulates water beneath the ice, decreasing turbulent heat release to the atmosphere (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S7</a>a), thus increasing winter SST (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S7</a>b). This delayed cooling is the reverse of the 
  <span class="italic">delayed warming</span> associated with Arctic amplification as described by Screen and Simmonds (
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0049">2010</a>), by which an energy surplus in summer elevates SST in fall, enhancing warming throughout the Arctic basin in winter.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surface and atmosphere radiation fluxes and cloud radiative effects reveal the pathways through which shipping‐induced cooling occurs. Rather than clouds cooling the surface directly, surface cooling occurs via sensible heat transfer from the surface to the outgoing longwave‐cooled lower atmosphere. Increased downwelling longwave radiation from clouds approximately balances reduced surface insolation due to cloud albedo, causing the annual mean net cloud radiative effect at the surface to be small and insignificant (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S3</a>; Table 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S1</a>). These surface cloud radiative effects are strongly seasonal, with peak warming in May, when higher surface albedo from remaining sea ice in spring reduces cloud shading effects so cloud longwave heating dominates, followed by cooling in July, when cloud shading of the surface outweighs cloud longwave heating (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S4</a>). Instead, clouds cool the lower atmosphere through enhanced longwave outgoing radiation. Simulated trans‐Arctic shipping increases cloud fraction (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0004">4</a>a) and liquid water content (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0004">4</a>b) mainly in the lower atmosphere below 850 hPa in response to low‐altitude CCN enhancement by ship emissions. Outside the tropics, clouds typically cool the atmosphere in the longwave because cloud top emission exceeds cloud base warming, while shortwave cloud absorption always warms the atmosphere (Wallace &amp; Hobbs, 
  <a rid="grl58008-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0065">2006</a>). Relative to the control, our experiment exhibits both longwave cooling (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0004">4</a>c) and shortwave warming (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0004">4</a>d) of the lower atmosphere, with net radiative loss (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0004">4</a>e) and temperature decrease (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0004">4</a>f) indicating greater longwave than shortwave effects. This cooling in the lower atmosphere is more likely caused by liquid cloud enhancement than water vapor or ice clouds because the atmospheric column is drier in the experiment owing to temperature reduction (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0004">4</a>g) and the ice water path is low (&lt;10 g/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and changes much less than the liquid water path in the experiment. This energy loss in the lower atmosphere is then mediated by sensible heat transfer from the surface (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S5</a>). The sensible heat transfer promotes further surface cooling through two positive feedbacks: (1) the ice‐albedo effect further reducing absorbed shortwave radiation; (2) lower water vapor content reducing downwelling longwave radiation to the surface. While lower water vapor enables more shortwave radiation to reach the lower atmosphere (Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#grl58008-fig-0004">4</a>d), its greater impact is to reduce the atmospheric absorption of outgoing longwave radiation, allowing net cooling. The net radiative loss from clouds and the attendant ice‐albedo and water vapor feedbacks at the surface in the experiment runs is illustrated in Figure 
  <a rid="grl58008-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#grl58008-supitem-0001">S6</a>. The longwave radiation trend is positive, driven by downwelling from clouds and mediated by reduced water vapor at the surface, while shortwave radiation is more strongly negative, driven by liquid‐enhanced cloud reflectance and increased surface albedo. The overall effect is the significant surface cooling in the latter half of the 21st century.
