  </a>) is based on data assimilation, a method that optimally fuses proxy information with the dynamical constraints of climate models; this method simultaneously estimates both hydroclimate fields and corresponding atmosphere-ocean states (
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>). PHYDA is based on information from a network of 2978 annually resolved proxy-data time series (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>) together with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Last Millennium Ensemble of climate model simulations (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>); as a data assimilation product, PHYDA therefore represents an optimal amalgamation of both model and proxy information [see (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>) for more details about PHYDA]. The PHYDA reconstructions were performed from the years 1 to 2000 CE targeting three different temporal windows: April to the next calendar year March annual means (indicated as A2M in figure legends), the boreal growing season of JJA, and the austral growing season of DJF. In addition to seasonal and annual variables, PHYDA also includes monthly ENSO indices that are used herein. For computing the probability density functions shown in 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>, we reran the PHYDA reconstruction code (see “Data and materials availability”) to save the full 998-member ensemble for the specific NINO3.4 and AMO index variables.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PHYDA has been extensively validated against observational data in addition to related paleoclimate reconstructions (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). Here, we also performed comparisons with the North American Drought Atlas for the specific region of interest (fig. S1). In addition, there may be concerns that the dynamics and temporal variability of PHYDA merely reflect those of the data assimilation prior, namely, the CESM climate model; to explore this possibility, we analyzed the power spectra of the North American Southwest PDSI (NASW PDSI) along with the NINO3.4 and AMO indices and found PHYDA to be much more similar to observations than to the CESM simulation used as the basis of PHYDA (fig. S7). We also found PHYDA to be more similar to observations and less similar to CESM in the cross-correlation of the NASW PDSI with the NINO3.4 and AMO indices (fig. S8). Because the analysis presented here relies on realistic ENSO-hydroclimate teleconnections in PHYDA, we also showed the point correlations between the A2M annual NINO3.4 index and the variables of 2-m surface temperature and PDSI in fig. S9.
