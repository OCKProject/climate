 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the NASW, we used the average PDSI over land in the regional box bounded by 125°W to 105°W and 31°N to 42°N (fig. S1), which wholly includes the U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, a southern portion of Wyoming, and both Colorado and New Mexico west of the Rocky Mountains. This box also includes some of the northernmost portions of Mexico where the border deviates from a straight line at 31°N. For nearly all of this region, the majority of the precipitation falls during the winter and spring seasons.</p>
