   </a>, 
   <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">

   <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
    <span class="italic">34</span>
   </a>). PHYDA is based on information from a network of 2978 annually resolved proxy-data time series (
   <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
    <span class="italic">35</span>
   </a>) together with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Last Millennium Ensemble of climate model simulations (
   <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
    <span class="italic">36</span>
   </a>); as a data assimilation product, PHYDA therefore represents an optimal amalgamation of both model and proxy information [see (
   <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
    <span class="italic">27</span>
   </a>) for more details about PHYDA]. The PHYDA reconstructions were performed from the years 1 to 2000 CE targeting three different temporal windows: April to the next calendar year March annual means (indicated as A2M in figure legends), the boreal growing season of JJA, and the austral growing season of DJF. In addition to seasonal and annual variables, PHYDA also includes monthly ENSO indices that are used herein. For computing the probability density functions shown in 
   <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>, we reran the PHYDA reconstruction code (see “Data and materials availability”) to save the full 998-member ensemble for the specific NINO3.4 and AMO index variables.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PHYDA has been extensively validated against observational data in addition to related paleoclimate reconstructions (
   <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
    <span class="italic">27</span>
   </a>). Here, we also performed comparisons with the North American Drought Atlas for the specific region of interest (fig. S1). In addition, there may be concerns that the dynamics and temporal variability of PHYDA merely reflect those of the data assimilation prior, namely, the CESM climate model; to explore this possibility, we analyzed the power spectra of the North American Southwest PDSI (NASW PDSI) along with the NINO3.4 and AMO indices and found PHYDA to be much more similar to observations than to the CESM simulation used as the basis of PHYDA (fig. S7). We also found PHYDA to be more similar to observations and less similar to CESM in the cross-correlation of the NASW PDSI with the NINO3.4 and AMO indices (fig. S8). Because the analysis presented here relies on realistic ENSO-hydroclimate teleconnections in PHYDA, we also showed the point correlations between the A2M annual NINO3.4 index and the variables of 2-m surface temperature and PDSI in fig. S9.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The specific megadrought periods were determined probabilistically using a 100-member ensemble of NASW PDSI time series based on PHYDA; the PHYDA reconstruction code (see “Data and materials availability”) was reran to output a 100-member ensemble of global PDSI fields (for this analysis, the 100-member ensemble sufficiently characterizes the full ensemble, which is much larger and more cumbersome to analyze), from which the averaged NASW PDSI for each ensemble member was derived. Drought periods in each of these time series were identified as the persistently negative PDSI values relative to an 11-year moving average (
   <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
    <span class="italic">29</span>
   </a>). We then found the ensemble agreement about the existence of a drought for each year of the analysis period 800–1925 (fig. S1A). The 14 specific megadroughts were then identified as those periods that had at least 90% ensemble agreement and that were at least 10 years long (fig. S1A). The general results presented here are robust to the particular choice of threshold (for agreement values greater than 50%) or if the megadroughts are determined nonprobabilistically using the ensemble mean NASW PDSI from PHYDA. The results are also robust to the choice of drought definition [(

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used this model to generate an ensemble of probable forced temperature histories over the Common era. The process of finding realistic model parameter combinations first began by randomly drawing 10,000 sets of parameters (γ,

   <span class="italic">c</span>
   <sub>d</sub>, and ε), sampling with uniform likelihood from the range of parameter fits found in (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this model is not spatially resolved, we used it here for two reasons: (i) There are no local, Southwest forcing estimates available before the Instrumental era. All Common era forcing estimates are available on the hemispheric or global scale (with any reconstructed spatial pattern of volcanic forcing based primarily on ice core records in only Greenland and Antarctica). A global-scale model is therefore a conservative use of the available forcing information. (ii) The use of a low-order model, as opposed to a global climate model, allows us to use an updated volcanic forcing estimate (
   <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
    <span class="italic">47</span>
   </a>) and to include uncertainties associated with the volcanic forcing. Including uncertainties (here within a Monte Carlo framework) is particularly important, given that volcanoes are the dominant forcing over the Common era and that their magnitude and spatial extent can be quite uncertain.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the global nature of the energy balance model, it can still be representative of regional information. For example, the decadal mean correlation between the energy balance model global mean temperature and the mean temperature of the Southwest from PHYDA is 0.4 over the analysis interval of 800–2000.</p>
