  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>) for a review]. The southwestern region of the United States (hereinafter referred to as the Southwest) represents one of the main foci of megadrought activity, the occurrence of which profoundly affected organized societies of the time as well as the landscape and vegetation across the area (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). The absence of any megadroughts after the 16th century in the Southwest raises critical questions surrounding their causes, their predominant clustering during the Medieval period, and whether there is a substantial risk of these droughts returning in the near future as a consequence of either natural or anthropogenic causes (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system and its modulation of storm track variability have been the primary driver of seasonal droughts in much of North America over the Instrumental era (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>). Therefore, the most prominent Southwest megadrought hypotheses invoke ENSO as the probable cause but in different fashions: Either ENSO was radiatively forced into a persistent La Niña–like mean state [through the dynamical thermostat mechanism (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>)] or internal climate variability simply produced multidecadal periods of increased La Niña events (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). Recent work nevertheless provides little evidence for a persistent La Niña–like mean state during the Medieval period (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>), and although stochastic ENSO variability can explain isolated megadroughts, their clustering before 1600 CE is extremely difficult to explain with the ENSO variability that is characteristic of the Instrumental era (

  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>). Additionally, a warm North Atlantic may suppress summer precipitation in the Great Plains and the Southwest [e.g., (

   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>)], but the support for this mechanism causing or increasing the likelihood of megadroughts is relatively tentative (
