 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The specific megadrought periods were determined probabilistically using a 100-member ensemble of NASW PDSI time series based on PHYDA; the PHYDA reconstruction code (see “Data and materials availability”) was reran to output a 100-member ensemble of global PDSI fields (for this analysis, the 100-member ensemble sufficiently characterizes the full ensemble, which is much larger and more cumbersome to analyze), from which the averaged NASW PDSI for each ensemble member was derived. Drought periods in each of these time series were identified as the persistently negative PDSI values relative to an 11-year moving average (

  </a>). We then found the ensemble agreement about the existence of a drought for each year of the analysis period 800–1925 (fig. S1A). The 14 specific megadroughts were then identified as those periods that had at least 90% ensemble agreement and that were at least 10 years long (fig. S1A). The general results presented here are robust to the particular choice of threshold (for agreement values greater than 50%) or if the megadroughts are determined nonprobabilistically using the ensemble mean NASW PDSI from PHYDA. The results are also robust to the choice of drought definition [(
