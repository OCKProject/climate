 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we use a newly available reconstruction product in tandem with a global forcing estimate to directly test the association between Southwest megadroughts and the larger oceanic and radiative forcing conditions. The Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product (PHYDA) is a physically and internally consistent reconstruction product that provides gridded hydroclimate and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) globally over the Common era in addition to hydroclimatically relevant dynamical indices. PHYDA is a probabilistic estimate of the time-varying state of the climate over the past 2000 years based on a fusion of both a global climate model and a global collection of proxy time series [see Materials and Methods and (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>) for more information about the construction of PHYDA]. Using the probabilistic, ensemble reconstructions of the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) from PHYDA, we identify 14 decadal-scale droughts, called megadroughts herein, in the Southwest during the period 800–1925 (see Materials and Methods); all highly probable megadroughts occur before the year 1600 [&gt;99% ensemble agreement (fig. S1A) and in agreement with (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>)]. Therefore, we generally split our analyses into pre- and post-1600 periods.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that megadroughts are associated with unusually cold values of the NINO3.4 index, with megadrought periods shifted to colder temperatures (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1D</a>) especially for the lower percentiles of the NINO3.4 probability density functions (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1G</a>), although there is no discernible shift in the mean state of NINO3.4. The North Atlantic was consistently warmer during megadroughts (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, E and H</a>), indicative of a large-scale state shift during the period 800–1600 relative to a reference period of 1601–1925 (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, E and H</a>, and fig. S2); this state shift is consistent with the well-known global cooling trend over the preindustrial Common era (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). These SST results in 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a> are insensitive to the choice of drought definition [(
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>) versus (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>)] and the choice of annual or seasonal climate indices [annual versus JJA (June, July, and August) Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) index and monthly versus DJF (December, January, and February) versus annual NINO3.4 index]. Such a lack of seasonal dependence is likely because the AMO index from 800 to 1600 is elevated across all seasons and the extremes in the NINO3.4 index are dominated by the DJF months, the peak season of ENSO. We also find that the forced climate response (derived from an energy balance model and historical forcing estimates; see Materials and Methods) consists of fluctuations of warmer global mean temperatures during megadroughts relative to the 1601–1925 reference period (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, F and I</a>); these warmer temperatures are a result of periods of quiescent volcanoes and elevated solar forcing, filtered by the long-term memory of the deep ocean (fig. S3B).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the relative importance of these climate drivers in explaining hydroclimate in the Southwest, we performed a decadal-scale linear regression analysis over the period 800–1925 using detrended indices (see Materials and Methods). On a decadal time scale, the NINO3.4 index explains the most variance of Southwest PDSI (up to 30%), while the AMO and radiative forcing each explain, on average, less than half the variance explained by the NINO3.4 index (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>). When multiple predictors are included, there is a small improvement in explained variance, but the dominant factor is the decadal NINO3.4 index (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2A</a>). Note that our analysis here focuses on large-scale climate phenomena that act on the annual to multiyear time scales. Other shorter-scale climate phenomena, such as stochastic synoptic variability, likely contribute to drought and megadrought in the Southwest (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>), but from the perspective of the paleoclimate record, the time history of these phenomena is very likely unrecoverable. Such phenomena likely account for the unexplained variance in these regressions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also tested the influence of radiative forcing on the NINO3.4 index in the decadal regression framework as a measure of the potential influence of a dynamical thermostat mechanism (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>); within this framework, we find no influence of radiative forcing on the NINO3.4 index (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>). In contrast, however, we do find that a small, similar amount of variance in both the AMO and local Southwest temperature can be explained by radiative forcing (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2B</a>). For the Southwest, we interpret the locally forced response as a straightforward mechanism: A global-scale positive radiative forcing leads to an increase in local temperatures, which, in turn, lead to an increase in aridity. In the temperature units of the global forcing estimate, the median local temperature response is 0.12°C; on a decadal time scale, this would represent a decrease in Southwest PDSI of about 0.17 (using the linear relationship between decadal, detrended temperature, and PDSI over the Southwest from 800 to 1925; 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>). This forced PDSI response is only a fraction of the PDSI excursions seen in PHYDA megadroughts of approximately −1 PDSI (fig. S1D); yet, a forced PDSI value of 0.17 is about half the value required for a proposed mean state shift in Southwest PDSI seen in the North American Drought Atlas during the Medieval megadrought period (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After exploring the drivers of decadal hydroclimate in the American Southwest generally, we now turn to the causes of megadroughts specifically. For this, we use a logistic regression framework, given that we are treating megadroughts as binary events. We find that megadroughts are most robustly associated with cold NINO3.4 conditions and warm AMO conditions, with the influence of NINO3.4 being again more than twice as important (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>; here, the predictors have been standardized, thus allowing for a direct comparison of regression parameter values). The role of a positive radiative forcing is less certain: Approximately three-fifths of the bootstrap regression parameter estimates are positive when four outlier large volcanic eruption data points are removed (β
  <sub>1</sub> distribution for “Forc-NLV” in 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a>; see Materials and Methods). Large volcanic eruptions (negative forcing) appear to have no consistent temporal relationship to megadroughts, with, for example, volcanic eruptions bookending a megadrought in the mid-1200s or occurring in the middle of a megadrought in the late 1400s (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1C</a>). However, 9 of 14 megadroughts are associated with a positive shift in radiative forcing (
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, F and I</a>), caused in the energy balance model by elevated solar forcing and volcanic quiescence (fig. S3B). Additionally, a positive radiative forcing on drought is supported by the linear regression analysis in 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2C</a>. To test whether the positive forcing response in the regression model could be consistent with a null variable, we reran the logistic regressions including a Gaussian random predictor; we found that the β
  <sub>1</sub> distribution for Forc-NLV in 
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2D</a> was statistically distinct from that of the random predictor (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 999 and α = 0.01). Given all this evidence and the simplicity of a positive forcing mechanism, we argue that a positive radiative forcing influence on megadroughts is more likely than a negative radiative forcing or no forcing influence at all.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering the joint influence of NINO3.4, AMO, and radiative forcing in causing megadroughts, we find that the logistic regression model that has the highest probability of being the most explanatory is the one that includes all three of these climate drivers (
  <a rid="F2" ref-type="fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2E</a>); this is indicated by two different information criteria, both of which include a penalty for adding predictors. These logistic regression results are also consistent with the SST and forcing excursions shown in 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1, D to I</a>. We therefore argue that Southwest megadroughts were primarily driven by anomalously frequent and cold, unforced La Niña conditions, with contributions from a partially forced warm Atlantic and a forced local temperature increase.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis shown in 
  <a rid="F1" ref-type="fig" href="#F1">Figs. 1 and 2</a> assumes from the outset that the specific NINO3.4 and AMO indices are suitable for uncovering the mechanisms of megadroughts. While the choices of these indices are not without warrant based on past work, we nevertheless seek to confirm our results without assuming the form of the variables driving megadroughts. Climate pattern frequency analysis using self-organizing maps (SOMs) (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>) (see Materials and Methods) reveals spatial SST patterns that are consistent with the Pacific and Atlantic forcing conditions shown previously. The SOM analysis specifically demonstrates a robust increased incidence of cold central and eastern Pacific SSTs during megadroughts relative to the 1601–1925 reference period, with the responses for the stronger nodes 1 and 2 being the most distinct compared to the reference range [
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3, A and B</a> (nodes 1, 2, and 4), and figs. S4, A and B (node 2), and S5, A and B (nodes 1 to 3)]; these specific patterns are concomitant with dry conditions across the western United States, with the strongest SST patterns generally having the most consistently dry PDSI values. Note that these SOM patterns are emergent properties of the underlying dataset, are not imposed a priori, and have no explicit dependence or knowledge of Southwest megadrought conditions. The greatest pattern increases are associated with cold Pacific SSTs co-occurring with areas of warm Atlantic SSTs, although there is some sensitivity to the precise pattern of warm Atlantic SSTs (cf. 
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>, node 2, and fig. S5A, nodes 2 and 3). We note, however, that because of required data preprocessing and detrending (see Materials and Methods), the warming shift in the Atlantic associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly is partially removed in this SOM analysis. During megadroughts, there was also a robust reduction of some warm Pacific SST patterns (
  <a rid="F3" ref-type="fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3, A and B</a>, nodes 5 and 8), which are concomitant with wetting across the western United States. These results, of an increased frequency in cold Pacific SSTs coupled with warming in the Atlantic and dry conditions in the Southwest, are robust to the choice of the number of SOM nodes (figs. S4 and S5) and drought definition [(
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>) versus (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>)]. These results are also consistent with a basic compositing analysis across the megadroughts (fig. S6). The SOM analysis also confirms that the dominant climate driver of megadroughts is unusual periods of La Niña conditions.
