 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) The monthly NINO3.4 index from PHYDA (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>) in black, with dashed gray lines showing the 5th and 95th percentiles of the PHYDA reconstruction ensemble and the yellow line showing a 20-year locally weighted linear regression smoothing of the NINO3.4 time series. (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Annual AMO [or North Atlantic SST (NASST)] index from PHYDA in black, with dashed gray lines and yellow line as in (A). (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) The mean NINO3.4 and AMO [corresponding to black lines in (A) and (B)] along with a global mean forcing estimate (see Materials and Methods) and highlighted megadrought periods. (
  <span class="bold">D</span> to 
  <span class="bold">F</span>) Probability density functions (PDFs) of temperature for the NINO3.4, AMO, and forcing estimate during the reference years of 1601–1925 (teal), all the states during each of the megadroughts (orange), and the remaining nondrought segments from 800 to 1600 (black). NINO3.4 and AMO PDFs are for the full reconstruction ensemble from PHYDA, while the forcing PDF is for the full ensemble forcing estimate (see Materials and Methods). (
  <span class="bold">G</span> to 
  <span class="bold">I</span>) Change in percentiles of the PDFs shown in (D) to (F) relative to the corresponding 1601–1925 reference PDF. Percentile changes show which parts of the megadrought and nondrought distributions change relative to the reference distribution.
