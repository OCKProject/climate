 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During LICE conditions ERA-Interim reanalysis data shows enhanced upward wave propagation from the troposphere into the stratosphere that causes a disturbance of the stratospheric polar vortex, which leads to downward propagating signals in the dynamical atmospheric variables. This process influences tropospheric circulation patterns like the NAO, impacting the daily weather patterns of the midlatitudes. This mechanism can not be fully reproduced by the AGCM ECHAM6, which does not respond with a negative phase shift of the NAO during LICE conditions. Coupling ECHAM6 to the fast but accurate interactive ozone chemistry scheme SWIFT improves the interaction between stratospheric chemistry and dynamics due to a more realistic representation of stratospheric processes. These improvements in the stratosphere also lead to a change in tropospheric teleconnection patterns resulting in a negative NAO response that is comparable to changes seen in reanalysis data.</p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results imply that interactive stratospheric ozone chemistry in winter and spring is important to understand changes in tropospheric teleconnection patterns caused by decreasing Arctic sea ice via the stratospheric pathway. Being computationally feasible, we also suggest the implementation of the fast ozone chemistry scheme SWIFT into other AGCMs enabling very large ensemble sizes compared to classic Chemistry Climate Models.</p>
