 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis of the multi-model mean by design emphasizes the externally forced response and leads us to propose the following indirect attribution argument for Sahelian climate change, past and future. In the second half of the twentieth century, as global dimming (Stanhill and Cohen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2001</a>; Liepert 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2002</a>) opposed global warming in the northern hemisphere, a unique combination of anthropogenic emissions contributed to the late twentieth century drying of the Sahel through their effect on sea surface temperatures: aerosols by cooling the North Atlantic and greenhouse gases by warming the tropical oceans, especially the Indian Ocean. Warming of the global tropical oceans “upped the ante” for deep convection (Chou and Neelin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2004</a>; Held et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2005</a>), while the absence of warming in the North Atlantic reduced the moisture supply to the monsoon and thus its  potential to meet the “upped ante” and to trigger vertical instability (Giannini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2008</a>). Our argument is distinct from others previously proposed, which attributed late twentieth century Sahel drought solely to aerosols, whether through cooling of the North Atlantic or of the entire northern hemisphere (Rotstayn and Lohmann 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2002</a>; Kawase et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2010</a>; Ackerley et al.

  <span class="italic">;</span> Park et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2015</a>; Wang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2016</a>), in three ways. First of all, we argue for an 
  <span class="italic">indirect effect</span> of anthropogenic emissions, i.e., mediated by sea surface temperatures. Linking emissions to Sahel rainfall through SSTs has the added advantage that it allows the synthesis in a single physical explanation of 
  <span class="italic">natural</span> variability and 
  <span class="italic">anthropogenic</span> change. Secondly, our argument is not about the role of interhemispheric gradients in SST shifting the latitudinal location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and by extension rainfall in the Sahel. Rather, it is about 
  <span class="italic">quasi-equilibrium in convection</span> as the world warms. The observed late twentieth century drying of the Sahel was more profound—longer lasting and of greater amplitude—than, e.g., the early twentieth century drought around 1910, despite the North Atlantic being cooler during the early period. This observation justifies the search for additional factors in drought, which we identify in greenhouse gas-induced tropical warming, which in the twentieth century occurred simultaneously with North Atlantic cooling. Therefore, thirdly, we argue for the 
  <span class="italic">combined drying effect</span> of the two contrasting anthropogenic influences in twentieth century: drought was not caused by aerosols alone or by the cooling of the North Atlantic alone. Neither could it have been caused by greenhouse gases alone, as is made evident in simulations which include only the latter forcing (Biasutti 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2013</a>; Dong and Sutton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2015</a>; Gaetani et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2017</a>; Hill et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2017</a>). Rather, drought resulted from the combination of aerosols and greenhouse gases. One influence cooled and reduced the moisture supply, while the other, warming, raised the threshold for convection—a double jeopardy. In the twenty-first century, external influence is dominated by GHG-induced warming, of both the North Atlantic and global tropical oceans. NARI, their difference, tends to zero, leaving all response to external forcing to be explained by their sum.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SVD rotation of the original predictors to their weighted sum and difference and the relative sizes of their regression coefficients (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>) expose the near-orthogonality of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in the response of SSTs and rainfall to external forcing. The oceans’ translation of external forcing of predominantly anthropogenic nature leads to contrasting but not inconsistent outcomes in the past and the future. Late twentieth century drying and twenty-first century projections of wetting are consistent with different balances in the influences of aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions on regional energy and moisture budgets, underlined by one coherent physical explanation rooted in the dynamics of quasi-equilibrium in convection. The fact that emissions need to be considered holistically, not additively, explains how it is possible that while anthropogenic warming had a role in past drought, continued warming in the twenty-first century gives rise to a strengthening of the monsoon. As aerosol emissions have abated, especially around the North Atlantic, it is the combination of warmings of both North Atlantic and global tropical oceans that explains the strengthening of the monsoon: the upped ante can now be met. This situation is consistent with understanding of monsoon response to warming on paleoclimate time scales: when the ocean warms enough to contribute to an “upped ante” with increased moisture supply but not enough to shift the favored locus of convection from land to ocean (Chou et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2001</a>), it reinforces the monsoon, as is the case for West Africa (Braconnot et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2012</a>). With the usual caveats related to uncertainty in multi-model mean projections, that further warming may result in wetting of the Sahel is a conclusion worth reinforcing, in equal parts because it has gained in coherence between CMIP3 and CMIP5 (Biasutti 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2013</a>), and because the recovery of the rains is being experienced on the ground, in a fashion that is remarkably consistent with expectation from anthropogenic warming (West et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2008</a>; Lodoun et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2013</a>).
