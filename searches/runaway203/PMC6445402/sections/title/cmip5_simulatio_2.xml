 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The multi-model ensemble produced by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project in support of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), referred to as CMIP5 (Taylor et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2012</a>), reproduces the observed twentieth century evolution of Sahel rainfall and projects wetter end of twenty-first century conditions more coherently than its CMIP3 predecessor (e.g., compare Biasutti and Giannini (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2006</a>) with Biasutti (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2013</a>)).
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We restrict our analysis to 29 models participating in CMIP5, because only these have all the thermodynamic and dynamical variables necessary to evaluate their moisture budget (the subject of a parallel study). The models used are named in the tables in Supplementary Material. We focus on ensemble means, because we are interested in attribution of observed twentieth century Sahel rainfall variability, i.e., in describing its externally forced component, whether the external forcing is natural (i.e., due to variations in incoming top of the atmosphere insolation and spikes in aerosol concentration from volcanic eruptions) or anthropogenic (most notably, emissions of aerosols and GHGs from fossil fuel burning). Single-model ensemble sizes range between 1 and 10 in the historical simulations of the twentieth century and in the RCP8.5 scenario simulations of the twenty-first century. (In the case of the pre-Industrial control, typically, one simulation is run per model, albeit of varying length.) For each model and type of simulation, when more than one is available, we average realizations in the model’s ensemble mean. We then compute the multi-model mean as the average of the single models’ ensemble mean, a procedure which further suppresses the manifestation of internal variability.</p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The top panels in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> display standardized Sahel rainfall (the precipitation average for land points in 10°N−20°N, 20°W−40°E, in each model’s original resolution, over July–September (Nicholson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">1983</a>; Giannini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2003</a>)): twentieth century (1900–1999) time series are depicted on the left-hand side and twenty-first century (2006–2099) time series on the right-hand side. To facilitate comparison, we standardize all the time series: each model’s ensemble mean, in the thin green lines, is standardized by its own mean and standard deviation. The multi-model mean, in the thick yellow line, is first computed as the average of the original (non-standardized) single-model ensemble mean precipitation time series and then standardized. The reason for proceeding in this order is that we wish to characterize the externally forced component of Sahel rainfall. Since the models’ ability to capture the relevant physical processes varies, if we computed the multi-model mean on the standardized single-model ensemble means, we would give all models, “good” and “bad,” equal weight. Conversely, if the multi-model mean is taken on rainfall anomalies, the internal variability that dominates models that do not respond to external forcing is weighted out, because by definition it does not have a preferred temporal sequencing. This allows the temporally coherent response to external forcing to emerge. For a comparison to non-standardized time series, i.e., Sahel rainfall anomalies in units of mm/day, the reader is referred to Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> in Biasutti (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2013</a>): there it can be seen that (i) the amplitude of variations in the multi-model mean is smaller than that in observations, as expected, given that the single real-world realization expresses the combination of internal variability and externally forced change. However, (ii) the observed evolution falls within the envelope defined by individual ensemble member simulations. The thick red line in the left panel of our Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> represents observed Sahel precipitation (Becker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2013</a>). Its correlation with the multi-model mean is 0.37 and is corroborated by a visible qualitative match: the first half of the century is characterized by variations around the mean, and is followed by a precipitous decline that lasts until the mid-1980s, and a partial recovery since. Standardization, because it normalizes the amplitude of variation, makes it possible to clearly discern the minimum in the multi-model mean, which occurs in 1982 and coincides with the first of three driest consecutive years in observations, 1982–1984, and with the eruption of El Chichón (Robock and Liu 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1994</a>). In contrast, the twenty-first century multi-model mean (top, right panel of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) shows an upward trend, albeit with periods characterized by interannual-to-decadal variations that mask the trend, most notably at the end of the century.
