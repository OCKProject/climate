 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Sahel witnessed an outstanding climatic shift with the abrupt onset of drought in the late 1960s. The magnitude and spatial extent of the downward trend in precipitation over the twentieth century (Greene et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2009</a>) and the persistence of years of deficient rainfall through the 1970s and 1980s (Lamb 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">1982</a>; Nicholson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">1983</a>; Dai et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2004</a>; Ali and Lebel 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2009</a>) led scientists to hypothesize that Sahelian drought may be a sign of anthropogenic change. Some pointed to the local pressure of rapid population growth on vegetation cover and the consequent impact of an increase in albedo on the atmospheric energy budget (Charney 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">1975</a>). Others linked drought to the nascent preoccupation with the impact of global anthropogenic emissions, of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and other pollutants, on the general circulation of the atmosphere (Bryson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">1973</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We reconcile the just-mentioned arguments about the role of anthropogenic emissions in Sahel drought, and more recent arguments attributing global precipitation changes to aerosols, natural and anthropogenic (Robock and Liu 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1994</a>; Gillett et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2004</a>; Liepert et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2004</a>; Lambert et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2004</a>; Zhang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2007</a>; Haywood et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2013</a>) with demonstration that the dominant cause of Sahel drought lies in changes in the surface temperatures of the global oceans (Folland et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">1986</a>; Giannini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2003</a>). We do so by linking the unique post-World War II combination of aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions to the patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) known to affect Sahel rainfall.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On interannual to millennial time scales, Sahel rainfall variations have been ascribed to interhemispheric differences in SST, whether global, restricted to the Atlantic, or to the tropical Atlantic Ocean (Lough 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">1986</a>; Shanahan et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2009</a>; Park et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2015</a>; Lindzen and Nigam 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">1987</a>; Kang et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2008</a>; Schneider et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2014</a>). Recent work attempting to explain the disagreement in the sign of projected twenty-first century rainfall change (Biasutti and Giannini 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2006</a>) with differences in projected SST change added the explicit consideration of oceanic warming, resulting in a linear regression model that describes Sahel rainfall as a function of two regional SST indices: the difference of tropical North and tropical South Atlantic SST averages and the average of tropical Indo-Pacific sector SSTs (Biasutti et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2008</a>)
  <span class="italic">.</span> This regression model was further distilled into a single predictor, the North Atlantic Relative Index (NARI; Giannini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2013</a>), computed as the difference between SST averages over the sub-tropical North Atlantic (10°N–40°N, 75°W–15°W) and the global tropical oceans (20°S–20°N). Here, we denote these as NA and GT, respectively, so that NARI = NA − GT. In this difference, the tropical SST average (GT) captures global vertical stability (Chou and Neelin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2004</a>): the stabilization effect of warming SSTs is communicated vertically through deep convection and is spread laterally by upper-atmosphere wave dynamics, given the weak temperature gradient constraint (Chiang and Sobel 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2002</a>). The sub-tropical North Atlantic SST average (NA) counters stabilization through moisture supply (Giannini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2008</a>; Seth et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2013</a>). To the extent that Sahel rainfall variations on different time scales are the result of the underlying oceanic forcing’s preferred time scales of variation, our physical interpretation of NARI follows the paradigm that convection is in quasi-equilibrium with its environment (Emanuel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">1994</a>). This assumption eliminates the need to consider time scales of variation separately, as long as these are longer than the time scales of convective adjustment (including the adjustment in the coupled ocean-atmosphere system described in Chiang and Sobel (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2002</a>)). In addition, it should be noted that a “relative index” effectively detrends variations (Vecchi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2008</a>), in the sense that insofar as both SST time series express GHG-induced warming, taking their difference largely removes it. In observations, NARI explains ~ 50% of the variance in twentieth century Sahel rainfall variability, all time scales included (Giannini et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2013</a>).

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the “
  <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">CMIP5 simulation of Sahel rainfall</a>” section, we show that the CMIP5 multi-model mean reproduces the twentieth century evolution of Sahel rainfall, rendering discussion of its attribution to external forcing possible. In the “
  <a rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec3">Climate change in the Sahel through the lens of oceanic influence</a>” section, we propose an explanation that reconciles studies of variability, which typically seek to relate oceanic forcing and regional rainfall response, with studies of change, which typically seek to attribute regional response to external forcing, natural or anthropogenic, by developing an argument for indirect attribution of Sahel rainfall, through the influence of anthropogenic emissions on sea surface temperatures. In the “
  <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">Transformation of predictors</a>” sub-section, we exploit Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to describe the linearly independent linear combinations of the two SST predictors defined above, i.e., the averages of sub-tropical North Atlantic and global tropical SSTs. In the “
  <a rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec5">Linear regressions of Sahel rainfall</a>” sub-section, we use the resulting singular vectors in bivariate linear regressions that describe their influence on Sahel rainfall. We present explicit formulas for these SVD-based predictors in the bivariate case; although, as noted by Preisendorfer (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">1988</a>), such formulas had been available since a publication by Pearson (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1901</a>), their presentation in terms of non-dimensional parameters, introduced here, helps to visualize the underlying relationships and facilitates the interpretation of results. In particular, we show that when the ratio of standard deviations of the original predictors is close to one, the bivariate SVD rotation results in the sum and difference of these original predictor time series. In our case, this means that NARI, the difference of NA and GT, which we defined above based on a physical argument, is nearly proportional to one of the SVD predictors and is exhaustively complemented by the other, which is nearly proportional to the sum of the same SST indices, and represents global warming. The derivation of all necessary formulas is relegated to the Appendix. In the “Conclusions: Past is not prologue” section, we conclude with a synthesis that finds coherence in attributing past Sahel drought to anthropogenic emissions, while lending credence to projections of a wetter future.
