      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If insolation were directly forcing Great Basin paleoclimate via local temperature,
         we would expect to see nearly synchronous speleothem climate variations in response
         to changing NHSI. The millennial-scale δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> lag behind NHSI suggests that the Great Basin climate response is instead indirect
         and mediated through one or more fast-response (relative to precessional-scale insolation
         forcing) components of the climate system. We investigate several pathways by which
         insolation forcing is linked to Great Basin climate: global ice volume
         <span><a>13</a></span>, northern hemisphere temperature
         <span><a>16</a></span>, regional sea surface temperature (SST) in the California Current system off WNA
         <span><a>17</a></span>, Arctic sea-ice variations
         <span><a>18</a></span>, radiative forcing from greenhouse gases
         <span><a>19</a>,
            <a>20</a></span>, and high latitude temperatures from Greenland
         <span><a>21</a></span> and Antarctic ice core data

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Leviathan chronology shares strong similarities with the global benthic foraminifera
         δ
         <span>18</span>O stack
         <span><a>13</a></span>, a proxy for global ice volume, salinity, and deep water temperature (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). Much of the saw-tooth structure of Great Basin paleoclimate variations may thus
         have arisen from temperature and atmospheric circulation changes associated with the
         growth and decay of the northern hemisphere ice sheets, which are expected to exert
         a particularly strong influence on regional temperature and atmospheric circulation
         <span><a>23</a></span>. Both Leviathan and global ice volume show cooling trends between 175,000 and ~137,000 yr
         B2K as ice sheets expanded, with subsequent minimum interglacial ice volume lagging
         Leviathan by 3300 years. The onset of the last interglacial and duration of ISS 5.5
         (MIS 5e) also followed NHSI, demonstrating that precessional-scale insolation forced
         deglaciation in WNA over TII. The peak cold conditions during the ISS 5.4 δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> minimum align closely with increased global ice volume (a benthic δ
         <span>18</span>O maximum). We also observe a strong similarity between the Leviathan chronology and
         an estimate of northern hemisphere temperature (40–80°N) derived from an ice sheet
         model and the LR04 stack
         <span><a>16</a></span>. In contrast, we observe several major discrepancies with California Current alkenone
         SST (core ODP-1012). We conclude that the Leviathan chronology’s δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> variations are strongly linked to global climate evolution on glacial/interglacial
         timescales, but are disconnected from regional ocean temperatures off WNA, at least
         on the orbital scale.

         <span>18</span>O ice core record (GICC05 extended chronology)
         <span><a>21</a></span>. Peak cold conditions in ISS 5.4 were synchronous in both locations, and both records
         show a small warming ‘shoulder’ at ~114,600 yr B2k (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). The transition from ISS 5.3 into 5.2 following Greenland interstadial (hereafter
         GIS) 23 shows a similar gradual cooling trend, compared to the more rapid rate of
