 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If insolation were directly forcing Great Basin paleoclimate via local temperature, we would expect to see nearly synchronous speleothem climate variations in response to changing NHSI. The millennial-scale δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> lag behind NHSI suggests that the Great Basin climate response is instead indirect and mediated through one or more fast-response (relative to precessional-scale insolation forcing) components of the climate system. We investigate several pathways by which insolation forcing is linked to Great Basin climate: global ice volume

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Leviathan chronology shares strong similarities with the global benthic foraminifera δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O stack
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, a proxy for global ice volume, salinity, and deep water temperature (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Much of the saw-tooth structure of Great Basin paleoclimate variations may thus have arisen from temperature and atmospheric circulation changes associated with the growth and decay of the northern hemisphere ice sheets, which are expected to exert a particularly strong influence on regional temperature and atmospheric circulation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Both Leviathan and global ice volume show cooling trends between 175,000 and ~137,000 yr B2K as ice sheets expanded, with subsequent minimum interglacial ice volume lagging Leviathan by 3300 years. The onset of the last interglacial and duration of ISS 5.5 (MIS 5e) also followed NHSI, demonstrating that precessional-scale insolation forced deglaciation in WNA over TII. The peak cold conditions during the ISS 5.4 δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> minimum align closely with increased global ice volume (a benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O maximum). We also observe a strong similarity between the Leviathan chronology and an estimate of northern hemisphere temperature (40–80°N) derived from an ice sheet model and the LR04 stack
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. In contrast, we observe several major discrepancies with California Current alkenone SST (core ODP-1012). We conclude that the Leviathan chronology’s δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> variations are strongly linked to global climate evolution on glacial/interglacial timescales, but are disconnected from regional ocean temperatures off WNA, at least on the orbital scale.

  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The transition from ISS 5.3 into 5.2 following Greenland interstadial (hereafter GIS) 23 shows a similar gradual cooling trend, compared to the more rapid rate of cooling associated with the ISS 5.1 to 5.0 transition following GIS 21. Similarity of MIS 5 δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O time series between Greenland and the Great Basin suggest commonalities of paleoclimatic change when global ice volume was low. In contrast, the Leviathan chronology does not preserve evidence of a one-to-one pairing of NGRIP δ
