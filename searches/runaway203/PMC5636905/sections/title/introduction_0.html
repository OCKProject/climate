      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The orbital theory of climate change first elaborated in the 19
         <span>th</span> century
         <span><a>1</a></span> was subsequently confirmed to exert a strong control on global climate, as evident
         from pioneering paleoceanographic studies showing regular orbital obliquity (41,000 yr
         cycles) and precession (19,000–23,000 yr cycles) in benthic foraminifera δ
         <span>18</span>O associated with changing ice volume on the continents
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>3</a></span>. The orbital paradigm suggests that Northern Hemisphere Summer Insolation on June
         21 at 65°N latitude (hereafter NHSI) controls global climate via variations in ice
         sheet extent, which in turn exert responses in temperature and atmospheric and oceanic
         circulation. However, in many continental regions the role of orbital variations in
         paleoclimate remains poorly known due to the difficulty of obtaining long absolutely
         dated paleoclimate records. For example, controls on Great Basin paleoclimate have
         been debated since the classic 19
         <span>th</span> century monographs on Pluvial Lakes Lahontan and Bonneville
         <span><a>4</a>–
            <a>7</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). Despite this work, a lack of highly resolved records spanning orbital timescales
         makes it difficult to attribute the past controls on Western North America (WNA) paleoclimate
         and to facilitate future projections.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An exception is the well-dated 175,000 yr-long
         <span><a>8</a></span> speleothem oxygen isotope record from caves in Nevada, based on records from Leviathan,
         Pinnacle, and Lehman Caves
         <span><a>8</a>,
            <a>9</a></span>. Several features of the Leviathan chronology suggest that it is a reliable proxy
         for Great Basin climate variations: it is securely dated with 65 high-precision U-series
         ages; the stalagmites grew in near-surface vadose zone caves &lt;100 m from the land
         surface in areas of rapid infiltration of winter precipitation, ensuring a short response
         time to atmospheric climate changes, the predominant source of aquifer recharge; and
         modern stalagmite calcite forms in isotopic equilibrium with cave drip waters
         <span><a>8</a></span>. Further, the δ
         <span>18</span>O time series showed a strong NHSI control on continental paleoclimate, with climate
         lagging insolation by a few thousand years. However, the origin and quantification
         of this lag has not been completed, hampering our ability to identify plausible forcing
         mechanisms. Here, we investigate the orbital-scale phasing relationships between Nevada
         paleoclimate and insolation forcing over the past 175,000 years, and highlight several
         key features of the δ
         <span>18</span>O time series that support a fast climate response to precessional-scale forcing in
         the Great Basin of western North America.
