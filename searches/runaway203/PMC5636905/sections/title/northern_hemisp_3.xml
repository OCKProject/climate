 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although our phasing analysis indicates a high sensitivity of the Great Basin to high-latitude ice sheet forcing, two prominent periods are not easily explained by this relationship: the pronounced δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> minimum at ISS 5.4 (MIS 5d), and decreasing Holocene δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub>. How could climate be so apparently cold in the Great Basin in ISS 5.4 when global ice volume was small and northern hemisphere temperatures were warm? Rising greenhouse gas concentrations and reduced North American ice sheet extent (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) would be expected to lead to warm ISS 5.4 temperatures, in contrast to low and cold δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> values. To test the idea that the forcing may reside in the fast-response variation of northern hemisphere sea ice, we compared the Leviathan δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> to the Arctic Paleoclimate Index (API
  <sub>o</sub>), which characterizes ostracod density in Arctic ocean sediments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>, which in turn were forced by sea-ice mediated productivity changes. The API
  <sub>o</sub> shows high productivity during high NHSI, and vice versa for low NHSI. A major productivity decrease during ISS 5.4 suggests a glacial-like sea-ice expansion despite intermediate global temperatures and ice volume, and is supported by cold climate conditions in the Siberian Arctic

  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> in Leviathan could be interpreted as forced by an increase in Arctic sea ice extent and high-latitude snow fields driven by the period’s lowest temperatures and summer insolation. Such a contention is supported by the strong influence between NHSI and Arctic summer sea ice extent (and weak influence from greenhouse gas forcing) in modeling studies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Stadial conditions during ISS 4.0 and 2.0 were associated with a cessation of growth in stalagmite LC-1 from possible periglacial conditions overlying the high-altitude (2400 m) Leviathan Cave
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>, and both hiatuses also coincided with pronounced Arctic productivity minima and high sea-ice extent (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also observe a prominent (2.9‰) decrease in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> from ca. 8400 ka to 2400 yr B2k, indicative of increasingly colder winters, despite the lack of North American ice sheet growth. Likewise, stable or rising northern hemisphere temperatures and increasing carbon dioxide and methane concentrations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) cannot easily explain cooling in the Great Basin. Because NHSI decreased in tandem with δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub>, we suspect that cryosphere changes in the Arctic may be responsible. Two indicators of Arctic warmth are the presence of melt layers in the Agassiz ice cap on Ellesmere Island, Canada
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>

 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because Great Basin climates lagged insolation even during periods of low global ice volume (e.g., during ISS 5.5–5.1), it is difficult to attribute forcing solely to ice sheet effects on northern hemisphere paleoclimate. Changes in both high latitude sea ice and snow cover are likely to influence the mid latitudes via atmospheric teleconnections
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Modern observations suggest that the impact of increasing snow cover may have resulted in decreased atmospheric pressure and increases in storm track intensity and cyclogenesis in the eastern North Pacific Ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. Such forcings would result in stronger storms that deliver greater winter precipitation to the Great Basin. In contrast, a reduction in modelled sea ice extent resulted in pronounced winter precipitation deficits, by up to 50%, in the Great Basin and Western U.S.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. The reduced sea ice extent increased the 500-mb geopotential height, diverting storms away from the southwest to higher latitudes, resulting in a northward shift of the mid latitude storm track
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. During winters following sea ice lows from the previous summer, the atmosphere may ‘remember’ the summer sea ice extent because of a lowered mid- to high-latitude temperature gradient, which weakens the Aleutian Low
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span> and results in fewer and less intense storms reaching the Great Basin. A strengthening of the subtropical highs arising from decreased sea ice and snow cover extents
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span> also results in fewer storms impacting the southwestern United States. This atmospheric configuration typically produces high pressure over the Great Basin and inhibits delivery of Pacific moisture to the Great Basin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span> today, and we suggest that similar climate dynamics applied in the past. Similarly, increased snow cover extent results in cooling via the snow-albedo feedback
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>, and advection of cold high-latitude moisture to the Great Basin during periods of greater sea-ice and snow-field extent is a plausible explanation for the ISS 5.4 and Holocene cooling in the absence of significant ice sheet extent.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On long orbital timescales, similar relationships may also be operative: changes in atmospheric circulation as a result of insolation changes are largely mediated through sea ice and positive feedbacks in the Arctic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> driven by changes in the meridional temperature gradient. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that, on orbital time scales, reduction in sea-ice extent is associated with higher temperature and less precipitation over the Great Basin. Arctic sea ice extent likely exerts control on mid-latitude atmospheric circulation via a weakening of the jet stream associated with a decreased latitudinal temperature gradient.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large and variable phase lag (−900 to 6600 yr) appears to be a robust feature of our data, as the lags are considerably larger than the age model uncertainties (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). A possible explanation is that other seasonal insolation variations (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) may exert a control on Great Basin paleoclimate. For example, during ISS 3.1 (when high Leviathan δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> at 38,500 yr B2k leads June 21 insolation by 900 years), it lags peaks in April 21 and May 21 insolation which arrive at 39,000 to 40,000 yr B2k, respectively. July 21 and August 21 insolation would reduce the lags at other time intervals. Clearly, reducing the complex Earth climate system to a single month of insolation is an oversimplification, a fact noted by previous workers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. In addition to variable seasonal sensitivity, the variable phase lag may also arise from multiple feedback processes in the climate system, each of which may have different time-variable response times to insolation forcing that depends on changing boundary conditions, e.g., ice-sheet size, the carbon cycle, Arctic Ocean temperatures, and the state of the biosphere. To test for this possibility, we find a weak but apparent negative correlation (r
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.3 for a linear and 0.53 for second order polynomial fits) between Leviathan δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> lags and the correlative NHSI value (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>): the lags appear to be largest during glacial stages of ISS 2.0 (the LGM) and 6.0 (the PGM), and interglacial stages ISS 5.2 and 5.4, suggesting that the lags may arise in part from ice sheet influences on atmospheric circulation. We do not see similar correlations to CH
  <sub>4</sub>, CO
  <sub>2</sub>, or benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O, suggesting that insolation – likely mediated through sea ice and snow cover – is the driver of Great Basin paleoclimate. We also do not see any systematic influence of Great Basin background hydrologic state (e.g., pluvials and interpluvials) in the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> lag times. We would expect to see shorter lag times during pluvial climates if effective moisture variations in the Great Basin were driving faster infiltration rates into the cave systems, or if the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> values were influenced by local pluvial lakes. That we do not see such effects is likely due to the rapid response time of drips into the shallow vadose zone caves and a lack of any significant local control on precipitation δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values. Lag times in phreatic zone caves, such as Devils Hole, however, may have been influenced by such local hydroclimatic variations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our observations also have implications for broader Great Basin paleoclimate and the interpretation of the phreatic zone Devils Hole calcite record
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. First, maximum expansion of mountain glaciers during the LGM was reached around 20,000 yr BP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>, some four thousand years after minimum NHSI at 24,000 yr BP. Second, the formation of the iconic Great Basin pluvial lakes typically reached highest levels around 17,000 to 18,000 yr B2k associated with Heinrich stadial 1
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>, and which also lagged insolation. Both observations suggest that lake and glacier hydroclimatic indicators lagged insolation to similar degrees as Leviathan δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> record, but the lake and glacier records were also associated with abrupt millennial-scale forcing associated with Heinrich stadials and the Bolling/Allerod interstadial

 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our vadose-zone cave climate record constrains atmospheric circulation changes that are later recorded in phreatic zone calcite at Devils Hole. The amplitude of the ice-volume corrected δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> record (see Methods) in Devils Hole is significantly smaller (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>) than Leviathan, suggesting that dispersion of the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O signal in aquifer water reduced the amplitude of climatically driven δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values. Such dispersion and delay of waters through the regional aquifer may also explain the lag of correlative interglacial δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> peaks behind Leviathan. For example, peak ISS 5.5 δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> at Devils Hole arrived 2400 years after Leviathan, (and 3400 years after peak insolation), and the Holocene δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> peaks at ca. 5000 yr B2K, compared to 7600 yr B2K in the filtered Leviathan δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> and 11,100 yr B2K for insolation. Further support for dispersion of the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O signal in the aquifer is that the last interglacial optimum (MIS 5e) duration is half again as long (17,500 yr) in Devils Hole as in surface climate. The timing of lags in Devils Hole may also be related to changes in hydroclimate via effective recharge rates in the phreatic aquifer, a possibility that merits further investigation. We conclude that Devils Hole δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O represents a delayed and dampened response to surface climate variations; ages and durations of isotopic anomalies are thus minima and maxima, respectively.
