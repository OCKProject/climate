      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although our phasing analysis indicates a high sensitivity of the Great Basin to high-latitude
         ice sheet forcing, two prominent periods are not easily explained by this relationship:
         the pronounced δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> minimum at ISS 5.4 (MIS 5d), and decreasing Holocene δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub>. How could climate be so apparently cold in the Great Basin in ISS 5.4 when global
         ice volume was small and northern hemisphere temperatures were warm? Rising greenhouse
         gas concentrations and reduced North American ice sheet extent (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>) would be expected to lead to warm ISS 5.4 temperatures, in contrast to low and cold
         δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> values. To test the idea that the forcing may reside in the fast-response variation
         of northern hemisphere sea ice, we compared the Leviathan δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> to the Arctic Paleoclimate Index (API
         <sub>o</sub>), which characterizes ostracod density in Arctic ocean sediments
         <span><a>18</a></span>, which in turn were forced by sea-ice mediated productivity changes. The API
         <sub>o</sub> shows high productivity during high NHSI, and vice versa for low NHSI. A major productivity
         decrease during ISS 5.4 suggests a glacial-like sea-ice expansion despite intermediate
         global temperatures and ice volume, and is supported by cold climate conditions in
         the Siberian Arctic
         <span><a>26</a></span> at this time when permafrost ice wedge growth was vigorous. A decrease in high latitude
         temperature
         <span><a>27</a></span> and expanded snow fields
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>28</a></span> coincident with the ISS 5.4 insolation minimum may have driven sea ice expansion
         and amplified Arctic cooling, and both cryosphere indicators exhibit a fast response
         to orbital forcing. The low ISS 5.4 δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> in Leviathan could be interpreted as forced by an increase in Arctic sea ice extent
         and high-latitude snow fields driven by the period’s lowest temperatures and summer
         insolation. Such a contention is supported by the strong influence between NHSI and
         Arctic summer sea ice extent (and weak influence from greenhouse gas forcing) in modeling
         studies
         <span><a>29</a></span>. Stadial conditions during ISS 4.0 and 2.0 were associated with a cessation of growth
         in stalagmite LC-1 from possible periglacial conditions overlying the high-altitude
         (2400 m) Leviathan Cave
         <span><a>8</a></span>, and both hiatuses also coincided with pronounced Arctic productivity minima and
         high sea-ice extent (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also observe a prominent (2.9‰) decrease in δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> from ca. 8400 ka to 2400 yr B2k, indicative of increasingly colder winters, despite
         the lack of North American ice sheet growth. Likewise, stable or rising northern hemisphere
         temperatures and increasing carbon dioxide and methane concentrations (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>) cannot easily explain cooling in the Great Basin. Because NHSI decreased in tandem
         with δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub>, we suspect that cryosphere changes in the Arctic may be responsible. Two indicators
         of Arctic warmth are the presence of melt layers in the Agassiz ice cap on Ellesmere
         Island, Canada
         <span><a>30</a></span>, which were most abundant in the early Holocene (ca. 9.1 ka) and pollen evidence
         for decreasing Holocene summer temperatures in the Western Canadian Arctic
         <span><a>31</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). An increase in fossil trees near the Russian Arctic treeline
         <span><a>32</a></span> also indicate early Holocene warmth and subsequent decline that synchronously tracks
         Leviathan cooling. All records transition to cooler conditions during the late Holocene
         coincident with falling NHSI. The Holocene trends are substantiated by proxy evidence
         for an extended Arctic sea ice minimum from ca. 8550 and 6000 years ago

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because Great Basin climates lagged insolation even during periods of low global ice
         volume (e.g., during ISS 5.5–5.1), it is difficult to attribute forcing solely to
         ice sheet effects on northern hemisphere paleoclimate. Changes in both high latitude
         sea ice and snow cover are likely to influence the mid latitudes via atmospheric teleconnections
         <span><a>41</a></span>. Modern observations suggest that the impact of increasing snow cover may have resulted
         in decreased atmospheric pressure and increases in storm track intensity and cyclogenesis
         in the eastern North Pacific Ocean
         <span><a>42</a></span>. Such forcings would result in stronger storms that deliver greater winter precipitation
         to the Great Basin. In contrast, a reduction in modelled sea ice extent resulted in
         pronounced winter precipitation deficits, by up to 50%, in the Great Basin and Western
         U.S.
         <span><a>41</a></span>. The reduced sea ice extent increased the 500-mb geopotential height, diverting storms
         away from the southwest to higher latitudes, resulting in a northward shift of the
         mid latitude storm track
         <span><a>43</a></span>. During winters following sea ice lows from the previous summer, the atmosphere may
         ‘remember’ the summer sea ice extent because of a lowered mid- to high-latitude temperature
         gradient, which weakens the Aleutian Low
         <span><a>44</a></span> and results in fewer and less intense storms reaching the Great Basin. A strengthening
         of the subtropical highs arising from decreased sea ice and snow cover extents
         <span><a>43</a></span> also results in fewer storms impacting the southwestern United States. This atmospheric
         configuration typically produces high pressure over the Great Basin and inhibits delivery
         of Pacific moisture to the Great Basin
         <span><a>45</a></span> today, and we suggest that similar climate dynamics applied in the past. Similarly,
         increased snow cover extent results in cooling via the snow-albedo feedback
         <span><a>28</a>,
            <a>46</a></span>, and advection of cold high-latitude moisture to the Great Basin during periods of
         greater sea-ice and snow-field extent is a plausible explanation for the ISS 5.4 and
         Holocene cooling in the absence of significant ice sheet extent.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On long orbital timescales, similar relationships may also be operative: changes in
         atmospheric circulation as a result of insolation changes are largely mediated through
         sea ice and positive feedbacks in the Arctic
         <span><a>27</a></span> driven by changes in the meridional temperature gradient. Our data strongly support
         the hypothesis that, on orbital time scales, reduction in sea-ice extent is associated
         with higher temperature and less precipitation over the Great Basin. Arctic sea ice
         extent likely exerts control on mid-latitude atmospheric circulation via a weakening
         of the jet stream associated with a decreased latitudinal temperature gradient.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large and variable phase lag (−900 to 6600 yr) appears to be a robust feature
         of our data, as the lags are considerably larger than the age model uncertainties
         (Table 
         <a>1</a>). A possible explanation is that other seasonal insolation variations (Figure 
         <a>S1</a>) may exert a control on Great Basin paleoclimate. For example, during ISS 3.1 (when
         high Leviathan δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> at 38,500 yr B2k leads June 21 insolation by 900 years), it lags peaks in April 21
         and May 21 insolation which arrive at 39,000 to 40,000 yr B2k, respectively. July
         21 and August 21 insolation would reduce the lags at other time intervals. Clearly,
         reducing the complex Earth climate system to a single month of insolation is an oversimplification,
         a fact noted by previous workers
         <span><a>10</a></span>. In addition to variable seasonal sensitivity, the variable phase lag may also arise
         from multiple feedback processes in the climate system, each of which may have different
         time-variable response times to insolation forcing that depends on changing boundary
         conditions, e.g., ice-sheet size, the carbon cycle, Arctic Ocean temperatures, and
         the state of the biosphere. To test for this possibility, we find a weak but apparent
         negative correlation (r
         <span>2</span> = 0.3 for a linear and 0.53 for second order polynomial fits) between Leviathan δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> lags and the correlative NHSI value (Figure 
         <a>S5</a>): the lags appear to be largest during glacial stages of ISS 2.0 (the LGM) and 6.0
         (the PGM), and interglacial stages ISS 5.2 and 5.4, suggesting that the lags may arise
         in part from ice sheet influences on atmospheric circulation. We do not see similar
         correlations to CH
         <sub>4</sub>, CO
         <sub>2</sub>, or benthic δ
         <span>18</span>O, suggesting that insolation – likely mediated through sea ice and snow cover – is
         the driver of Great Basin paleoclimate. We also do not see any systematic influence
         of Great Basin background hydrologic state (e.g., pluvials and interpluvials) in the
         δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> lag times. We would expect to see shorter lag times during pluvial climates if effective
         moisture variations in the Great Basin were driving faster infiltration rates into
         the cave systems, or if the δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> values were influenced by local pluvial lakes. That we do not see such effects is
         likely due to the rapid response time of drips into the shallow vadose zone caves
         and a lack of any significant local control on precipitation δ
         <span>18</span>O values. Lag times in phreatic zone caves, such as Devils Hole, however, may have
         been influenced by such local hydroclimatic variations.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our observations also have implications for broader Great Basin paleoclimate and the
         interpretation of the phreatic zone Devils Hole calcite record
         <span><a>47</a></span>. First, maximum expansion of mountain glaciers during the LGM was reached around
         20,000 yr BP
         <span><a>48</a></span>, some four thousand years after minimum NHSI at 24,000 yr BP. Second, the formation
         of the iconic Great Basin pluvial lakes typically reached highest levels around 17,000
         to 18,000 yr B2k associated with Heinrich stadial 1
         <span><a>49</a>,
            <a>50</a></span>, and which also lagged insolation. Both observations suggest that lake and glacier
         hydroclimatic indicators lagged insolation to similar degrees as Leviathan δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> record, but the lake and glacier records were also associated with abrupt millennial-scale
         forcing associated with Heinrich stadials and the Bolling/Allerod interstadial
         <span><a>48</a>,
            <a>49</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our vadose-zone cave climate record constrains atmospheric circulation changes
         that are later recorded in phreatic zone calcite at Devils Hole. The amplitude of
         the ice-volume corrected δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> record (see Methods) in Devils Hole is significantly smaller (Figure 
         <a>S5</a>) than Leviathan, suggesting that dispersion of the δ
         <span>18</span>O signal in aquifer water reduced the amplitude of climatically driven δ
         <span>18</span>O values. Such dispersion and delay of waters through the regional aquifer may also
         explain the lag of correlative interglacial δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> peaks behind Leviathan. For example, peak ISS 5.5 δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> at Devils Hole arrived 2400 years after Leviathan, (and 3400 years after peak insolation),
         and the Holocene δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> peaks at ca. 5000 yr B2K, compared to 7600 yr B2K in the filtered Leviathan δ
         <span>18</span>O
         <sub>ivc</sub> and 11,100 yr B2K for insolation. Further support for dispersion of the δ
         <span>18</span>O signal in the aquifer is that the last interglacial optimum (MIS 5e) duration is
         half again as long (17,500 yr) in Devils Hole as in surface climate. The timing of
         lags in Devils Hole may also be related to changes in hydroclimate via effective recharge
         rates in the phreatic aquifer, a possibility that merits further investigation. We
         conclude that Devils Hole δ
         <span>18</span>O represents a delayed and dampened response to surface climate variations; ages and
         durations of isotopic anomalies are thus minima and maxima, respectively.
