      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our conclusion of high sensitivity of Great Basin paleoclimate to the state of the
         Arctic cryosphere has important implications for future climate projections. The modern
         climate is characterized by rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations, and the
         Arctic is expected to rapidly transition to sea-ice-free summers
         <span><a>51</a></span> in the 21
         <span>st</span> century as it likely did during the mid-Holocene
         <span><a>52</a></span>. Such a sea ice reduction will perturb wintertime atmospheric circulation in the
         Great Basin, leading to dynamic warming and drying of winters similar to that observed
         in the instrumental record
         <span><a>45</a></span>. Additionally, human-caused warming will amplify the warming trend that began 2400
         years ago, with mean annual temperature increases at our study area of 3–4 °C by 2080
         under a moderate (RCP 4.5) warming scenario
         <span><a>53</a></span>. Model results indicate Great Basin winter precipitation decreases of up to 50% as
         a result of a northward migration of the winter jet stream
         <span><a>45</a></span>. Considering that the peak warming interval in the Great Basin of the early to mid-Holocene
         ‘altithermal’
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>54</a></span> was one of intensely hot and arid conditions and the region was only able to sustain
         sparse human populations, the future of Nevada climate looks to be one of increasing
         warmth and drought. Without aggressive action to decrease the rate of greenhouse gas
         concentrations in the atmosphere, the future of the Great Basin is likely to be one
         of heating and drying.
