  <sub>ivc</sub> record presented here includes a correction for the age of nine stable isotope samples (and the derivative interpolated time series) beneath a hiatus at 290.5 mm. This changes the age of the last isotope sample (291 mm) before the hiatus to 73,647 from 69,622 yr B2k. The age correction does not change any interpretations of this or previous work. We estimated age uncertainties for individual stalagmite age models using the COPRA software

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the DH2-D record is significantly dampened relative to the Leviathan signal due to aquifer mixing and dispersion (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>; see text for explanation), we corrected the measured δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O values by changes in δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O of the ocean that were scaled by a ratio of 0.4551, which is the ratio of the standard deviations of the Leviathan and DH2-D records, respectively. This ice volume correction more accurately reflects how a given precipitation isotopic signal is filtered and dampened via transit through the aquifer feedings Devils Hole better than the undampened correction

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. The reason for using filters instead of raw data is to minimize the possible effects of noise on the choice of start and end points to provide more objective and reproducible results, though the latter approach may also be valid. Relative timings of insolation sub-stages were determined by differencing correlative ages. Phasing diagrams show the timing differences between the forcing (insolation) and the climate response in the Leviathan and DH2-D filtered records.
