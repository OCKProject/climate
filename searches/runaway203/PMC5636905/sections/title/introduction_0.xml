  </span>. The orbital paradigm suggests that Northern Hemisphere Summer Insolation on June 21 at 65°N latitude (hereafter NHSI) controls global climate via variations in ice sheet extent, which in turn exert responses in temperature and atmospheric and oceanic circulation. However, in many continental regions the role of orbital variations in paleoclimate remains poorly known due to the difficulty of obtaining long absolutely dated paleoclimate records. For example, controls on Great Basin paleoclimate have been debated since the classic 19
  <span class="sup">th</span> century monographs on Pluvial Lakes Lahontan and Bonneville

  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Despite this work, a lack of highly resolved records spanning orbital timescales makes it difficult to attribute the past controls on Western North America (WNA) paleoclimate and to facilitate future projections.

Several features of the Leviathan chronology suggest that it is a reliable proxy for Great Basin climate variations: it is securely dated with 65 high-precision U-series ages; the stalagmites grew in near-surface vadose zone caves &lt;100 m from the land surface in areas of rapid infiltration of winter precipitation, ensuring a short response time to atmospheric climate changes, the predominant source of aquifer recharge; and modern stalagmite calcite forms in isotopic equilibrium with cave drip waters

  </span>. Further, the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O time series showed a strong NHSI control on continental paleoclimate, with climate lagging insolation by a few thousand years. However, the origin and quantification of this lag has not been completed, hampering our ability to identify plausible forcing mechanisms. Here, we investigate the orbital-scale phasing relationships between Nevada paleoclimate and insolation forcing over the past 175,000 years, and highlight several key features of the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O time series that support a fast climate response to precessional-scale forcing in the Great Basin of western North America.
