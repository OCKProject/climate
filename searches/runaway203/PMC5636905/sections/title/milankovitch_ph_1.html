         <span><a>10</a></span>, we use the classic Milankovitch forcing of the June 21 65°N insolation curve
         <span><a>11</a></span> to quantify phasing relationships between insolation and WNA paleoclimate as registered
         in the low-pass filtered Leviathan chronology ice volume-corrected record (δ

         <sub>ivc</sub>, see methods). We use insolation sub-stage (ISS) nomenclature, which labels peaks
         and troughs in NHSI analogously to extrema in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) numbering
         wherein, for example, the last glacial maximum is ISS 2.0 and the penultimate interglacial
         is ISS 5.5 (Fig.

         ISS 6.0/5.5/5.4. We show for the first time the phasing relationships between climate

         the average phase lag for the 175 ka Leviathan record is 3240 years with a range of

         to sea ice and snow cover changes in the Arctic, which would have responded more rapidly
         to insolation changes than ice sheet extent. We also show for the first time that

         The timing of glacial and stadial periods also fits well with precessional-scale orbital
