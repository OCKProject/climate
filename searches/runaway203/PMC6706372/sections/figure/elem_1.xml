  <p>Surface salinity before and after closure of the Arctic gateway. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Surface salinity in the control run at 38 Ma, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> surface salinity with the Arctic–Atlantic gateway closed. 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Winter mixed layer depth (MLD) in the 38 Ma control run, and 
   <span class="bold">d</span> MLD after closing the Arctic gateway. The Arctic Ocean is very fresh, due to precipitation–evaporation and continental river runoff. Closure of the Arctic–Atlantic gateway leads to a dramatic increase in North Atlantic salinity. This in turn triggers North Atlantic sinking, and the cessation of North Pacific sinking
