  <p>Meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the North Pacific versus North Atlantic basins. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Pacific MOC in the control run, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Pacific MOC with the Arctic–Atlantic gateway closed, 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Atlantic MOC in the control run and 
   <span class="bold">d</span> Atlantic MOC with the Arctic–Atlantic gateway closed. In the control simulation, there is strong overturning in the North Pacific, while the North Atlantic remains stratified. Once the Arctic–Atlantic gateway is closed, North Atlantic overturning is triggered, while North Pacific overturning shuts down. Southern Ocean overturning is present in both simulations
