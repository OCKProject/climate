  <p>Temperature and freshwater flux response to closing the Arctic gateway. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Surface air temperature (SAT) and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> precipitation minus evaporation differences showing the Arctic closed—control experiment in each case. There is substantial cooling (&gt;5 °C) of the North Pacific in response to the shutdown of Pacific sinking, and a corresponding warming of the North Atlantic. No major interhemispheric temperature change is found. Precipitation minus evaporation increases in the North Pacific and decreases in the North Atlantic
