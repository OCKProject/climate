 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The deepening of the GSR at the EOT has been proposed as a trigger for the AMOC, by changing the flow across the ridge from a shallow unidirectional flow to a deeper bi-directional flow
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. According to this hypothesis, the deeper exchange allows salty subtropical water to penetrate further north and thus enable North Atlantic sinking. A recent modelling study using Miocene boundary conditions found that when the GSR was deepened to more than 50 m, an AMOC was triggered
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. We test whether there is a similar effect under late Eocene geography, by comparing our reference topography with a deep GSR (~500 m) to a shallow GSR simulation (25 m). With an open Arctic gateway, we found that the North Atlantic remains too fresh to support sinking and sinking persists in the North Pacific (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). We also test the shallow GSR (25 m) in the Arctic closed configuration. With the shallower GSR, sinking continues to occur in the Labrador Sea, but shifts southwards from the Nordic Seas to just south of the GSR. However, North Atlantic salinity remains high (34–35 psu), since the freshwater source from the Arctic is cut off. Thus, we found that the depth of the GSR, whether 25 or 500 m, does not change the preferred basin of sinking, despite shifting the local sinking region.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A long-hypothesised trigger of the AMOC at the EOT is the opening of Southern Ocean gateways
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. This theory posits that when meridional land barriers are present in the Southern Ocean, midlatitude westerly winds drive a northward Ekman transport that returns southward in upper ocean western boundary currents. The opening and deepening of gateways cut off the upper ocean southward current, forcing a return flow to occur below the deepest remaining barriers in the Southern Ocean, which enables an AMOC sustained by wind-forced upwelling of deep water
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. Modelling studies have shown that opening of the Southern Ocean gateways can trigger a switch from Southern Ocean-only to North Atlantic sinking
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span>. However, this effect was demonstrated using modern geography with selected gateway perturbations, rather than a full palaeogeographic reconstruction.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we test the effect of opening the Southern Ocean gateway upon the deep circulation at the EOT. To achieve this, we widened the Tasman gateway and the Drake Passage to 1300 and 1100 km, respectively, and deepened both gateways to 3000 m depth (grid cells already deeper than 3000 m were left unchanged). This enables an Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) flow of around 150 Sv, comparable to the modern ACC. These gateways are wider and deeper than expected at the EOT, and are designed to provide a large signal to test this hypothesis, rather than a realistic palaeogeography. Although this perturbation enhances Antarctic bottom water formation, it does not affect the preferred basin of sinking in the Northern Hemisphere. Deep water continues to form in the North Pacific, while the North Atlantic surface waters remain dominated by freshwater outflow from the Arctic Ocean (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). Thus, we do not find evidence that Southern Ocean gateway opening triggered the AMOC at the EOT. Furthermore, due to the long timescale and uncertainty associated with opening the Southern Ocean gateways
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>, a step change in circulation is less geologically plausible than a gradual transition over tens of millions of years. By contrast, the closure of a narrow and shallow gateway such as the Arctic–Atlantic can readily be triggered within a few million years due to local uplift and changes in sea level
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>,

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the deepening of Southern Ocean gateways did not trigger an onset of Atlantic sinking in the present simulations, these gradual tectonic events may have influenced the features of a previously established AMOC mode. Specifically, deepening of the gateways is expected to reinforce the AMOC through wind-forced Southern Ocean upwelling
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. Thus, it is possible that the AMOC had strengthened by the time the Arctic–Atlantic connection reopened, estimated to have occurred during the early Miocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>, allowing North Atlantic sinking to persist despite an increased Arctic Ocean freshwater influx. This underlines that the global bathymetry and climate state may be critical for the response of the AMOC to local gateway changes in the northern North Atlantic.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous modelling studies have found that Arctic closure can trigger an AMOC under early Eocene palaeogeography
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>; however, this is substantially different from the late Eocene. The North Atlantic basin widens over the 20 million years from the early to late Eocene, which affects the pathways of heat and salt transport to the possible sinking locations. In particular, a wider Atlantic basin creates a larger basin of wind forcing for the North Atlantic gyres and more prominent western boundary currents. It was therefore not obvious that the Arctic closure would trigger an AMOC using late Eocene palaeogeography, nor that the AMOC would be shut down when the Arctic gateways are open. Furthermore, by testing our results in combination with the Southern Ocean opening and GSR hypotheses, we have demonstrated that the Arctic Ocean gateway closure is more important than other hypothesised triggers of the AMOC at the EOT.
