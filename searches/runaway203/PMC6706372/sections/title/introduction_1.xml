 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT), ~34 Ma ago, marked a major shift in global climate towards colder and drier conditions and the formation of the first Antarctic ice sheets
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. A gradual decrease in CO
  <sub>2</sub> is thought to be the primary driver of the transition
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, causing long-term cooling and increasing seasonality through the Eocene, culminating in the glaciation of Antarctica
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Deep water circulation proxies suggest that the EOT, including the preceding 1 Myr, also marked either the onset or strengthening of an Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. There are two main hypotheses for what triggered the AMOC: deepening of the Southern Ocean gateways led to wind-driven upwelling of deep water in the Southern Ocean, forcing the AMOC
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>; and deepening of the Greenland Scotland Ridge (GSR) led to bi-directional flow over the ridge that allowed deep water to form in the North Atlantic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. These hypotheses have yet to be tested in a climate model that is designed with late Eocene palaeogeography and capable of capturing the ocean circulation at the EOT.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Deep sea sedimentary drift deposits indicate the presence of deep western boundary currents in the North Atlantic from the middle Eocene, suggesting the presence of deep water formation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. This is partly supported by stable isotope analyses of δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O and δ
  <span class="sup">13</span>
  <span class="sc">C</span> that indicate periodic Atlantic sinking from the middle Eocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. However, several Atlantic-wide compilations of stable isotopes suggest that a four-layer structure of water masses in the Atlantic, similar to the modern day, developed in the early Oligocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. These analyses suggest that in the late Eocene, northern component water was confined to shallower depths and northern latitudes, whereas around the EOT, northern component water deepened and expanded across the equator, which is also supported by Neodymium isotope tracers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Recent proxy data from the Labrador Sea shows that North Atlantic bottom waters were increasing in salinity and density in the three millions years prior to the EOT
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. This salinification trend, preceding the EOT, suggests that local forcing may have enabled North Atlantic sinking independently of the Antarctic glaciation. In addition, sea surface temperature (SST) proxies indicate no significant cooling in the North Atlantic around the EOT, in contrast to major cooling in the South Atlantic
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. This asymmetry in temperature evolution between the hemispheres is consistent with the onset or strengthening of an AMOC at the EOT.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Neodymium isotope tracers indicate that the Southern Ocean was a major source of deep water formation during the Eocene and Oligocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. In contrast to today, deep water appears to have formed in the North Pacific throughout the Eocene, in combination with Southern sinking
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. A recent study of neodymium isotopes throughout the Pacific suggests that North Pacific deep water formation gradually shut down from 36 Ma onwards
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Mechanistically, there is a competition between Pacific and Atlantic sinking modes due to salt-advection feedbacks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Once a sinking mode is established, sinking is reinforced by the meridional overturning circulation drawing in higher salinity waters from the subtropics to the high latitudes. Salt advection between the basins then causes a lower surface salinity to develop in the high latitudes of the non-sinking basin, making it difficult to sustain sinking in both basins simultaneously
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Here we show that a shift in sinking from the Pacific to the Atlantic can be triggered by the closure of the Arctic–Atlantic gateway at the EOT.
