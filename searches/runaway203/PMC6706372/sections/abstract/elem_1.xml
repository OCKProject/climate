 <p id="Par2">Proxies of deep circulation suggest that the onset or strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation occurred at the Eocene-Oligocene Transition. The authors show, using a paleoclimate model of the late Eocene, that a shift from Pacific to Atlantic overturning can be triggered at this time by closing the Arcticâ€“Atlantic gateway.</p>
