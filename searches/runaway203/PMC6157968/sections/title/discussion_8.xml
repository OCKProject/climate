 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other sources of error in the calculated direct shortwave CH
  <sub>4</sub> forcing include uncertain line widths and line strengths for the known lines. These uncertainties perturb the forcing in the third significant figure and, hence, do not appreciably affect our estimates of methane radiative forcing (

  <sub>4</sub> forcing based on current tabulations of methane absorption lines are certain to two significant figures. Therefore, shortwave terms recently added to the IPCC forcing formulae (
