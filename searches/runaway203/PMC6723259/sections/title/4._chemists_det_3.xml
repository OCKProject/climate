 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, most snow chemists have continued, rather unsurprisingly, to describe snow chemistry in terms of chemical reactions only. More than a decade after the key findings of Honrath et al. [
  <a rid="B26-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-microorganisms-07-00260">26</a>] and Sumner and Shepson [
  <a rid="B28-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-microorganisms-07-00260">28</a>], a review of chemical processes in snow [
  <a rid="B37-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-microorganisms-07-00260">37</a>] barely mentioned the potential role of microbes in snow chemistry, and the reviewers of that paper, most likely chemists, were not the least bothered by this deficiency. This is a bit troubling, given that an earlier study [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>] had observed emissions of NO
  <sub>x</sub> from the snowpack in Svalbard during the polar night. Since nitrate photolysis had to be ruled out to explain the source of NO
  <sub>x</sub>, the authors had no choice but to invoke the role of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in those emissions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00260-f001" href="#microorganisms-07-00260-f001">Figure 1</a>). It is noteworthy that the initial Amoroso team [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>] was comprised of only snow and atmospheric chemists and physicists, but they recruited biologists after their campaign to refine their interpretation, demonstrating the need for collaboration. The snow studied by Amoroso et al. [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>] was cold, with temperatures always being &lt;-10°C. This is interesting, since, with the exception of the work by Carpenter et al. [
  <a rid="B1-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-microorganisms-07-00260">1</a>], investigations by biologists of metabolic activity in snow were mostly at or near 0 °C where liquid water is present.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That liquid water was not needed for microbes to have a rapid impact on snow and tropospheric chemistry indicates that polar regions may in general be concerned by microbiological processes in snow. The NO
  <sub>x</sub> winter fluxes measured by Amoroso et al. [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>] were of the same order of magnitude as those detected by Honrath et al. [
  <a rid="B26-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-microorganisms-07-00260">26</a>], showing that microbial and chemical activity in snow deserved about equal consideration for understanding the dynamics of snow composition and consequently that of the lower polar troposphere.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Confirming microbiological activity in snow, Antony et al. [
  <a rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-microorganisms-07-00260">9</a>,
  <a rid="B38-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-microorganisms-07-00260">38</a>] performed a detailed chemical analysis of organic compounds in coastal and near-coastal Antarctic snow using ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). They concluded that organic compounds had been extensively transformed by microbial activity, and they detected both degradation and synthesis reactions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Redeker et al. [
  <a rid="B39-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-microorganisms-07-00260">39</a>] investigated the exchanges of methyl iodide between snow and atmosphere in Svalbard and at Signy Island, Antarctica. To determine the possible role of microbes, they worked on snow irradiated with UV-C (for sterilization) and on untreated snow. They noted that irradiated snow was a sink for CH
  <sub>3</sub>I while non-irradiated snow was a very slight source of this compound, from which they deduced that microbes in snow produced CH
  <sub>3</sub>I. It is not certain, however, that the snow studied was not melting, since the air temperature was close to 0 °C, and accurately measuring surface snow temperature in the presence of solar radiation is a delicate process. Incidentally, Redeker et al. [
  <a rid="B39-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-microorganisms-07-00260">39</a>] ignored the previous work of Amoroso et al. [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>] and of Antony et al. [
  <a rid="B38-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-microorganisms-07-00260">38</a>], and they wrongfully claimed that they “present the first evidence of environmental alteration due to in situ microbial metabolism of trace gases … in polar snow.” I report this omission here to illustrate how many snow chemists are little aware of microbial activity in snowpacks.
