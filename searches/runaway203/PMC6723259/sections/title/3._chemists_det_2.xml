 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Snow chemical composition has interested environmental chemists since at least the 1960s, as it allowed for the study of pollutant transport [
  <a rid="B24-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-microorganisms-07-00260">24</a>] and geochemical cycles [
  <a rid="B25-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-microorganisms-07-00260">25</a>]. Yet, for decades, snow was essentially considered an inert reservoir of trace chemical species until snowmelt. Things changed in 1999 when two studies revolutionized the way we viewed snow chemistry. Honrath et al. [
  <a rid="B26-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-microorganisms-07-00260">26</a>] discovered in Greenland that the nitrate ion NO
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">âˆ’</span> contained in snow was photolyzed to produce NO
  <sub>x</sub> (= NO + NO
  <sub>2</sub>), which were released to the atmosphere. Since NO
  <sub>x</sub> are key species in atmospheric chemistry [
  <a rid="B27-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-microorganisms-07-00260">27</a>], chemical reactions in snow were found to considerably affect tropospheric chemistry. For example, NO
  <sub>x</sub> production can lead to the formation of ozone, a pollutant and strong greenhouse gas. The simultaneous work of Sumner and Shepson [
  <a rid="B28-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-microorganisms-07-00260">28</a>] led to a similar conclusion. They observed in the Canadian high Arctic that formaldehyde, HCHO, was produced in snowpacks by the photolysis of organic precursors and released to the atmosphere. Since HCHO is a source of OH, a key atmospheric oxidant, this finding also had an immense impact. Subsequently, other studies in the Arctic [
  <a rid="B29-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-microorganisms-07-00260">29</a>] and Antarctic [
  <a rid="B30-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-microorganisms-07-00260">30</a>] confirmed the photochemical activity of snow. These studies observed the photochemical emission of numerous species such as hydrocarbons, methyl halides and of course, mercury [
  <a rid="B31-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-microorganisms-07-00260">31</a>]. Snow then started to be viewed as a photochemical reactor capable of critically affecting the chemistry of the lower atmosphere [
  <a rid="B7-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-microorganisms-07-00260">7</a>]. This is illustrated in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00260-f001" href="#microorganisms-07-00260-f001">Figure 1</a>. By releasing compounds such as organics that could subsequently be oxidized to less volatiles species capable of forming aerosols, snow photochemistry also has an impact on the climate. Indeed, aerosols both scatter light and act as cloud condensation nuclei, thus changing cloud droplet size and hence albedo [
  <a rid="B32-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-microorganisms-07-00260">32</a>]. Therefore, snow photochemistry studies have widespread applications. However, even though models for snow chemistry have been designed [
  <a rid="B33-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-microorganisms-07-00260">33</a>], all of them by environmental chemists, none of them include microbial activity.
