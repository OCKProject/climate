 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The work of Amoroso et al. [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>] in the high Arctic showed that during the polar night microbial activity could be a source of NO
  <sub>x</sub> to the polar troposphere. This was quite a novel finding because at that time it was considered that microbial emissions of NO
  <sub>x</sub> from non-photochemical sources had to come from soils. Since the ground was frozen, it was implicitly understood that there was no significant local source of NO
  <sub>x</sub> to the polar troposphere. Likewise, the possibility exists that microbes in snow could release hydrocarbons [
  <a rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-microorganisms-07-00260">9</a>], halocarbons [
  <a rid="B39-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-microorganisms-07-00260">39</a>], aldehydes, mercury [
  <a rid="B16-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-microorganisms-07-00260">16</a>], etc., thus modifying both snow and atmospheric composition (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00260-f001" href="#microorganisms-07-00260-f001">Figure 1</a>). Campaigns to study snow and atmospheric chemistry in polar regions usually take place in spring or summer and their focus is on photochemistry. Photochemical processes are probably predominant over microbial ones in most cases under sunlit conditions, as suggested by Møller et al. [
  <a rid="B16-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-microorganisms-07-00260">16</a>] for mercury. However, during the long polar night, tens of millions of km
  <span class="sup">2</span> are snow-covered, both on land and sea ice, and could act as a source of reactive molecules to the atmosphere. Both chemical and microbiological studies are probably required to detect these processes and elucidate their mechanisms. Isotopic tools are very efficient to detect microbial activity: In the end, it is isotopic data that demonstrated the microbial production of N
  <sub>2</sub>O in ice cores [
  <a rid="B20-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-microorganisms-07-00260">20</a>] and of NO
  <sub>x</sub> in polar snow [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>]. Identifying microbes and detecting potentially active genes likely to result in significant modifications of snow and atmospheric chemistry appears as a worthwhile goal. Cold incubations, as done by Carpenter et al. [
  <a rid="B1-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-microorganisms-07-00260">1</a>], may reveal unsuspected processes, especially if they are associated with chemical studies investigating changes in snow and air composition.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study of N metabolism in snow illustrates the potential benefit of collaboration. Amoroso et al. [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>] and Larose et al. [
  <a rid="B19-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-microorganisms-07-00260">19</a>] studied the chemical and microbial aspects of N (bio)chemistry in Svalbard snow. Both studies took place independently, two years apart, at the same site. Amoroso et al. [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>] worked during the polar night, in the total absence of radiation. Using NO
  <sub>2</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span> and NO
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span> isotopes (δ
  <span class="sup">15</span>N and Δ
  <span class="sup">17</span>O), they unambiguously demonstrated that the concentrations of these ions in snow had a strong contribution from nitrifying microbes and that subsequent microbial denitrification or nitrification explained the observed emissions of NO to the atmosphere. For chemists, this was rather revolutionary, since they had always explained the concentrations of NO
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span> in snow exclusively in terms of chemical processes [
  <a rid="B33-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-microorganisms-07-00260">33</a>,
  <a rid="B40-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-microorganisms-07-00260">40</a>]. Of course, Amoroso et al. [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>] did not use metagenomics or metatranscriptomics to identify the microbes and active genes involved, which would have made for a uniquely holistic approach. Larose et al. [
  <a rid="B19-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-microorganisms-07-00260">19</a>] worked in spring (24 h sunlight) and studied the snow metagenome. They found no reads associated with nitrification, in contradiction with the results of Amoroso et al. [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>]. They did find reads associated with denitrification, which then probably resulted in NO and N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions to the atmosphere, but these species were not measured during this essentially microbiological study. Even though Larose et al. [
  <a rid="B19-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-microorganisms-07-00260">19</a>] analyzed nitrogen ions in snow, their chemical studies were not sufficient to reach critical conclusions regarding snow and atmospheric chemistry. For example, NO
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span> isotopes would have been useful to confirm the absence of nitrification. Furthermore, the atmospheric measurements of NO and NO
  <sub>2</sub>, coupled to shading experiments to remove the effect of NO
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span> photochemistry, may have quantified bacterial N oxides emissions. Joint studies may also have explained why nitrification was observed by Amoroso et al. [
  <a rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-microorganisms-07-00260">6</a>] in winter and not by Larose et al. [
  <a rid="B19-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-microorganisms-07-00260">19</a>] in spring. Perhaps the oxidative stress induced by photochemistry played a role [
  <a rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-microorganisms-07-00260">10</a>] in suppressing nitrification, but this is only speculation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">N metabolism is just one example. The metabolism of carbon, mercury and many other elements deserves our attention. Antony et al. appear to have performed pioneering studies of carbon metabolism in snow. They studied the detailed composition of organics in snow [
  <a rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-microorganisms-07-00260">9</a>,
  <a rid="B38-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-microorganisms-07-00260">38</a>] and in a separate study identified microbes and some of their enzymatic activity [
  <a rid="B41-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-microorganisms-07-00260">41</a>]. However, the detailed understanding of the coupling between microbial activity and changes in snow chemical composition still has to be reached. Eventually, multi-omics methods coupled to state of the art chemical analysis such as FTICR-MS may reveal how microbes modify the chemical composition of snow and perhaps how this impacts the composition of the atmosphere and climate. Such complex methods have been successfully applied to other fields such as marine chemistry [
  <a rid="B42-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-microorganisms-07-00260">42</a>,
  <a rid="B43-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-microorganisms-07-00260">43</a>,
  <a rid="B44-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-microorganisms-07-00260">44</a>] with significant success, and they would clearly benefit snow biochemical studies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With climate warming, the presence of liquid water in polar snowpacks may happen more often in winter [
  <a rid="B45-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-microorganisms-07-00260">45</a>]. This could lead to very large microbial population growth [
  <a rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-microorganisms-07-00260">11</a>,
  <a rid="B14-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-microorganisms-07-00260">14</a>] and therefore to a large amplification of microbial activity in polar snowpacks. This, in turn, could induce significant modifications of both snow and atmospheric composition and, therefore, climate. The composition of seasonal snow also may have a large impact on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. For example, Hood et al. [
  <a rid="B46-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-microorganisms-07-00260">46</a>] investigated organic matter (OM) input from melting snow and glaciers into the gulf of Alaska. They found that this OM was preferentially metabolized by aquatic heterotrophs. They concluded that “glacial runoff is a quantitatively important source of labile reduced carbon to marine ecosystems.” Therefore, the way microbes affect OM composition in snow may impact the oceanic and arguably the terrestrial food web. Since this may be modified by climate change, investigating the interactions between snow microbiology and snow and atmospheric chemistry may reveal important snow–biosphere–climate feedbacks mediated by snow microbes.
