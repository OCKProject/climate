 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microbiologists have been quantifying and identifying microbes in cold snow for decades. Carpenter et al. [
  <a rid="B1-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-microorganisms-07-00260">1</a>] quantified bacteria in the snow at South Pole by filtering and dying melted snow. Using DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing, they determined that most of them were related to the 
  <span class="italic">Deinococcus</span> group. Interestingly they performed incubations at sub-freezing temperatures, between −12 and −17 °C using tritiated thymidine and leucine, and they observed “low rates of bacterial DNA and protein synthesis.” However, they did not investigate how this activity impacted snow or atmospheric chemistry. The detection of metabolic activity in cold snow, rather than in melting snow as done in most snow-related studies, is important because most snowpacks on Earth are cold, i.e., do not contain appreciable amounts of liquid water.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Segawa et al. [
  <a rid="B11-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-microorganisms-07-00260">11</a>] investigated bacteria in temperate snow in Japan using methods essentially similar to those of Carpenter et al. [
  <a rid="B1-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-microorganisms-07-00260">1</a>] and stressed the fact that their numbers considerably increased during snow melt, which lasted months in this region which is affected by very heavy snowfalls. As above, the impact of bacteria on snow composition was not studied.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amato et al. [
  <a rid="B14-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-microorganisms-07-00260">14</a>] studied bacteria in Svalbard snow and did mention that bacteria “have the capacity to degrade organic compounds found in Arctic snow (propionate, acetate and formate),” implicitly stating that this would alter snow composition. They did, however, mention that this could be important when snow melts. They were more interested in bacterial growth during melting than in the impact of this growth on environmental chemistry.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mercury in snow has also drawn the attention of microbiologists. This element has a long atmospheric residence time and is transported to polar regions. It episodically reaches peak concentrations in polar snow because of atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) where atmospheric Hg
  <span class="sup">0</span> is massively oxidized to Hg
  <span class="sup">II</span> [
  <a rid="B15-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-microorganisms-07-00260">15</a>] by halogen compounds such as Br atoms. This Hg
  <span class="sup">II</span> attaches to aerosols and is deposited to snow. How microbes react to the extra inputs of this contaminant to snow has been investigated by Møller et al. [
  <a rid="B16-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-microorganisms-07-00260">16</a>]. They performed one of the few studies where the impact of bacterial metabolism on snow chemical reactivity was considered. They focused on mercury-resistant bacteria which included Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The resistance mechanism is by the reduction of Hg
  <span class="sup">II</span> to Hg
  <span class="sup">0</span>, which is volatile and is released to the atmosphere. This is important because the air–snow exchange of mercury is a very active chemical process in the Arctic, and it affects both atmospheric composition and the biosphere [
  <a rid="B17-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-microorganisms-07-00260">17</a>]. By making several assumptions, they estimated from their bacterial counts that, on average, bacterial activity was responsible for 2% of snowpack emissions of Hg
  <span class="sup">0</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ariya et al. [
  <a rid="B18-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-microorganisms-07-00260">18</a>] showed interest in the impact of bacteria on snow composition in organics. They analyzed volatile organics in urban snow but found no correlation with bacterial counts. Pursuing their investigations, they incubated melted snow doped with 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C-labelled malonic acid at 4 °C and used NMR to detect the formation of organic metabolites in snow. However, they did not test bacterial activity in cold snow.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Larose et al. [
  <a rid="B19-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-microorganisms-07-00260">19</a>] studied nitrogen metabolism in Svalbard snow in spring. They monitored snow chemical composition (ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite), as well as bacterial types and genomes. They found genes for all steps of the N cycle except for nitrification (NH
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">+</span> to NO
  <sub>2</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span> to NO
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span>), implying that bacterial metabolism probably affected snow composition. They showed the co-variation of selected bacterial types with relevant chemical species (e.g., NH
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">+</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Nitrobacter</span>; NO
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">−</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Bacillus</span>) but did not quantitatively discuss how bacterial metabolism modified the composition of the snow. They did not mention the snow temperature but reported that the snowpack was ripe (i.e. isothermal at 0 °C so that liquid water was ubiquitous) around the middle of their two-months campaign, suggesting that their results were affected by liquid water.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is worth mentioning that the paucity of studies on the impact of bacterial metabolism on snow chemical composition somewhat contrasts with similar studies on glacial ice. Ice cores are unique environmental archives which have therefore been the subject of intensive chemical analyses. At the turn of the century, Sowers [
  <a rid="B20-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-microorganisms-07-00260">20</a>] analyzed N
  <sub>2</sub>O variations in the Vostok ice core during the penultimate deglaciation, around 130,000 years before present. They found some N
  <sub>2</sub>O concentrations suspiciously higher than present. These were associated with high dust levels and cell counts (determined from the epifluorescence microscopic examination of melted ice core samples) which led him to propose that “One possible explanation for the anomalous N
  <sub>2</sub>O data is in situ N
  <sub>2</sub>O production by nitrifying bacteria.” He performed N
  <sub>2</sub>O isotopic measurements which were consistent with this hypothesis. This seminal work demonstrated the potential impact of microbial metabolism on the chemistry of ice caps even at very cold temperatures. Subsequently, Price and Sowers [
  <a rid="B21-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-microorganisms-07-00260">21</a>] argued that microbes could remain metabolically active in ice at temperatures lower than −40 °C, although the actual detection of metabolic activity in such cold conditions would be problematic, since they predicted just 10 carbon turnovers in one billion years. In following studies, artefacts in concentrations of CO, N
  <sub>2</sub>O, and CH
  <sub>4</sub> in ice cores from Greenland or Antarctica were attributed to microbial activity, see e.g. [
  <a rid="B2-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-microorganisms-07-00260">2</a>,
  <a rid="B22-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-microorganisms-07-00260">22</a>,
  <a rid="B23-microorganisms-07-00260" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-microorganisms-07-00260">23</a>] and references therein. However, though observing chemical effects of microbes over timescales of tens to hundreds of thousands years in ice caps is important for ice core interpretation, it has little impact for current environmental chemistry. On the contrary, observing the microbial production of chemical species in cold snowpacks impacts current environmental chemistry. Snow chemistry has obviously been studied by chemists, who have detected chemical reactions but have, in general, showed little interest for biological activity.
