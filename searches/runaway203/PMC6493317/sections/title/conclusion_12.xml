 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The circumpolar North has experienced previously unprecedented rates of environmental, socio-economic, and cultural change over the past half-century. These changes have been associated with significant challenges to the health of the people, animals and environment of this region. Understanding and managing these developments will require a holistic, integrated approach that recognizes the inseparable and interdependent nature of the One Health triad. Through synergy between Indigenous and Western knowledge systems, and the incorporation of community input throughout the process, the One Health approach may provide the best means of building adaptive, resilient, and effective strategies for mitigating the negative influences associated with these challenges and promoting a sustainable future for northern ecosystems and the people and animals residing within them.</p>
