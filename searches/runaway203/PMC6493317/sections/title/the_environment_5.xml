 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rapid environmental change in the North increases both the advisability and the urgency of taking a One Health approach to health and well-being in this region. The critical lead time afforded by close monitoring of conditions by residents of specific localities, and the coordination of various actors and entities with knowledge and resources, can enhance prevention, response and adaptation [
  <a rid="CIT0002" href="#CIT0002">2</a>]. Recent climate change impacts on the northern environment include melting sea ice, rising sea levels, increasing storm surges, flooding, salination of ground water, ocean acidification, increased precipitation, thawing permafrost, less predictable river ice conditions, shifting vegetation patterns, and more wildfires [
  <a rid="CIT0017" href="#CIT0017">17</a>–
  <a rid="CIT0020" href="#CIT0020">20</a>]. These conditions increase hazards associated with subsistence activities in a region that experiences significantly elevated unintentional injury mortality, with even higher rates among Indigenous individuals [
  <a rid="CIT0018" href="#CIT0018">18</a>]. Uncertainty associated with the unpredictability of weather and environmental conditions, and in turn heightened risks, contribute to increased stress levels in northern communities [
  <a rid="CIT0021" href="#CIT0021">21</a>–
  <a rid="CIT0023" href="#CIT0023">23</a>]. The USGCRP’s Fourth National Climate Assessment observes: “The impacts of climate change will likely affect all aspects of Alaska Native societies, from nutrition, infrastructure, economics, and health consequences to language, education, and the communities themselves” [
  <a rid="CIT0003" href="#CIT0003">3</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological impacts of warming include alterations in terrestrial and marine animal migration and distribution patterns [
  <a rid="CIT0002" href="#CIT0002">2</a>], that undermines subsistence practices. Moreover, scientists anticipate the emergence of infectious diseases and insect vectors not previously seen at high latitudes [
  <a rid="CIT0024" href="#CIT0024">24</a>,
  <a rid="CIT0025" href="#CIT0025">25</a>]. In many areas provision of safe water and sanitation services is increasingly challenging, which raises the risk of infectious diseases [
  <a rid="CIT0021" href="#CIT0021">21</a>,
  <a rid="CIT0026" href="#CIT0026">26</a>–
  <a rid="CIT0028" href="#CIT0028">28</a>]. In some cases, whole villages face the prospect of relocation due to coastal erosion [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the 1970s, contaminants from the industrialized world have entered the Arctic food web, where through the processes of bioaccumulation and biomagnification, they endanger the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples who depend heavily on marine species [
  <a rid="CIT0031" href="#CIT0031">31</a>–
  <a rid="CIT0035" href="#CIT0035">35</a>]. In addition to the direct and indirect impacts of such contamination on the health of individual humans, the knowledge of such threats to human health and to the future of Indigenous peoples and cultures contributes to mental stress [
  <a rid="CIT0023" href="#CIT0023">23</a>]. Some scholars, including the historian John McCannon, have used the term “Arcticide” to describe the cumulative effects of these threats to the Arctic environment [
  <a rid="CIT0036" href="#CIT0036">36</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Together these developments imperil the physical, mental and social well-being of residents of the entire circumpolar North, along with traditional lifeways and community life, by disrupting the intimate relationships among people, animals and the environment. Indigenous peoples throughout the circumpolar North, except in Fenno-Scandinavia, have lower life expectancies than their respective national averages [
  <a rid="CIT0018" href="#CIT0018">18</a>]. These disparities are thought to reflect harsh Arctic environments, dangers associated with subsistence lifestyles, and residual impacts of colonial histories on physical and mental health and well-being. The One Health approach to researching and managing these issues provides a pathway to mitigate health disparities, especially in remote communities with limited infrastructure where dependence on the intricate balance of multiple systems correlates closely with health [
