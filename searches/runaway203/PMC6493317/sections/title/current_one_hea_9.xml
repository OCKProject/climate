 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Sustainable Development Working Group of the Arctic Council recently provided an overview of some One Health activities in the North [
  <a rid="CIT0016" href="#CIT0016">16</a>]. That document lists several international efforts to advance a One Health agenda in the North. Recent activities include the ﻿Joint Arctic Council Health Expert Groups Meeting in Oulu, Finland in 2015; the AHHEG One Health Session in Anchorage, Alaska, USA, in 2016; the Circumpolar Arctic Fulbright Conference in Hanover, New Hampshire, USA, in 2016; the Arctic Science Summit Week in Fairbanks, Alaska, USA, in 2016; the ﻿Alaska Forum on the Environment in Anchorage, Alaska, USA, in 2017; and a survey on One Health among stakeholders in healthcare-related fields [
  <a rid="CIT0016" href="#CIT0016">16</a>]. In addition to these activities, a One Health working group holds bimonthly meetings to allow interested parties to exchange ideas and news on One Health with a circumpolar focus [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In May 2017, in conjunction with the Arctic Council ministerial meeting in Fairbanks Alaska, the UAF Department of Veterinary Medicine sponsored a workshop entitled “One Health Concerns in a Changing Arctic.” Organizers sought to engage participants in developing demonstration projects grounded in research objectives and collaborations established at the workshop and to form working groups to develop local, regional, and circumpolar networks to address key One Health concerns in the Arctic [
  <a rid="CIT0081" href="#CIT0081">81</a>]. Community members, One Health professionals and researchers, and government officials from all eight Arctic nations attended. Participants identified five overarching research objectives, including:

    <p>Development of veterinary care capacity in rural communities</p>

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Development of youth educational programs under the One Health paradigm</p>

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Development of pathways for local community engagement in natural resource management decisions</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This workshop exemplifies how stakeholders from the local to international level can be engaged to identify and address significant concerns by developing roadmaps towards building collaborative research and management plans.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Hub Outreach Program (HOP) in the Yukon–Kuskokwim delta of Alaska is an example of how the outcomes of this workshop have been operationalized. Due to geographic isolation, this area has no access to veterinary care and has a significant dog overpopulation problem, Rabies and echinococcus are endemic there and the incidence of dog bites has been declared a public health concern by the Alaska Native Tribal Health consortium. Historically these problems were addressed by shooting unconfined dogs, Dogs have always been an integral part of Yup’ik culture and this practice has resulted in psychological stress in those shooting the dogs as well as those hearing the shots (Personal communication Mike Williams Sr Yup”ik elder from Akiak July 2017). The HOP program partners veterinarians, local health-care providers, community leaders, university researchers, and private industry to address the physical and mental health disparities arising from the dog overpopulation by providing free spays, neuters, vaccinations, and parasite control administered by a veterinarian living in Bethel and serving the nearly 50 communities of the region. Program leaders are collecting data to determine the cost-benefit ratio of supporting this program versus paying for the consequences of its absence. This data will be presented to local tribal organizations, health-care consortiums and state health agencies to build sustainable support for the program which could be a model for similar communities across Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) plans a follow-up to its 2017 workshop in March 2020. Thus far, globally, One Health initiatives have emphasized climate change impacts on zoonotic diseases and large-scale agriculture, while regionally they have focused on climate-change effects on ecological systems and traditional lifeways. Notably, UAF’s One Health initiative not only focuses on the north/Arctic but also recognizes the effects of ecological change on individual and community health and well-being, especially of Indigenous peoples. The March 2020 workshop will reflect this mission. One Health meetings have also recently been held in Canada (Saskatoon, June 2018) and Finland (February 2019), where scientists presented on One Health issues spanning zoonotic disease, food security, contaminant biomonitoring, and mental and behavioural health.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apart from research and public health efforts, One Health also can fill a vital role in education. The Biomedical Learning and Student Training (BlaST) program takes a One Health approach to engage students from rural and Alaska Native backgrounds in biomedical research [
  <a rid="CIT0082" href="#CIT0082">82</a>,
  <a rid="CIT0083" href="#CIT0083">83</a>]. By making biomedical research relevant to students from remote communities through linking human, environmental and animal health, the program has successfully integrated students from diverse backgrounds in meaningful research experiences that increase science self efficacy and student interest in biomedical careers, including individuals from backgrounds currently under-represented in the biomedical workforce (Cotter et al. submitted for peer review). BlaST illustrates how, in the North especially, One Health’s linkage of human, animal, and environmental health can open pathways to careers in science that students recognize as relevant to themselves and their communities.
