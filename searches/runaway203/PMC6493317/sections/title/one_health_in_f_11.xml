 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A One Health approach to policy development that begins in the community, asking local residents to define the situation to be managed from their perspective and builds out, engaging stakeholders for contributions in their respective areas of expertise is needed to address health problems in the North. This holistic, “bottom-up” model integrates traditional ways of knowing with Western knowledge. In this framework, One Health provides a constructivist, integrative operational approach for studying problems and building resilient and adaptive strategies to manage them. We posit this approach, which gives the communities most affected a primary role in the process, will provide the best opportunity for proactively addressing health concerns facing the circumpolar North, in contrast to the common historical tack of reacting to symptomatic outcomes.</p>
