 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For millennia, Indigenous peoples have subsisted in Arctic settings, surviving in the world’s most challenging environments, based on their intimate knowledge of land and seascapes, and their ability to adapt to change. Responding to the unprecedented pace, scope, and complexity of the current threats to northern communities’ health and well-being, however, requires the integration of local and outside expertise, along with outside financial and technical resources. Key strengths of the One Health approach are its interdisciplinarity and engagement of multiple scales of governance and Indigenous knowledge to identify problems and conceive of solutions; as well as the potential it offers to generate effective localized responses that are informed and supported by state, national and international expertise and resources. The collaboration and exchange of information among experts and stakeholders has synergistic effects, advancing knowledge and fostering resiliency and adaptation [

Not only does the integration of Indigenous knowledge rely on local capacities to adapt to climate change impacts, but it leads to more effective and culturally appropriate responses, and thereby enhance individual and community well-being [
