 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efforts to improve human health have varied, but many focus on individual patients and react to physical disease. While this approach has done much to advance health research and, in turn, health outcomes, a more holistic perspective on health that focuses on living in balance with the natural world has emerged with the potential to improve human health more broadly. The One Health paradigm defines health as more than the absence of disease, recognizing the interrelationships among human, animal and environmental welfare, and striving for the 
  <span class="italic">well-being</span> of all three through the coordinated efforts of multiple sectors, including various scales of governance, medical professionals, scientists, and community members (One Health Initiative; World Health Organization; European Union).

  <a rid="CIT0001" href="#CIT0001">1</a>] of human, animal, and environmental health also impacts other parts of systems involving individuals, including the well-being of communities and their ability to sustain themselves. In the circumpolar North, where subsistence lifeways tie the people closely to one another and to the land, this model lends itself especially well to exploring questions of health outcomes, particularly now as rapid climate change dramatically alters the land and seascapes, endangering traditional lifeways, individual lives, and community sustainability [

  <span class="italic">Fourth National Climate Assessment</span> stresses the impacts of climate change on Indigenous peoples’ health, stating: “Indigenous health is based on interconnected social and ecological systems that are being disrupted by a changing climate. As these changes continue, the health of individuals and communities will be uniquely challenged by climate impacts to lands, waters, foods, and other plant and animal species. These impacts threaten sites, practices, and relationships with cultural, spiritual, or ceremonial importance that are foundational to Indigenous peoples’ cultural heritages, identities, and physical and mental health” [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The burden of health-related climate change impacts is and will continue to be unevenly distributed. Whereas wealthier industrial regions of the world generate the overwhelming majority of greenhouse gases, negative health impacts of warming will fall disproportionately in poor countries and regions [
