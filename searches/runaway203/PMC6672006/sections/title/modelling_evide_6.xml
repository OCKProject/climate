 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although POGA successfully reproduces the lingering tropical Atlantic warming and its influence on the extra-tropics, a possibility remains that the extratropical North Pacific SST anomalies, which are stronger than in observations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>), are the driver of the Eurasian atmospheric circulation. To elucidate the tropical Atlantic role, we simulate atmospheric response to the tropical Atlantic warming in ENSO-decay year using an atmospheric general circulation model (Methods). A control (CTL) experiment consists of a 50-year integration forced by climatological SST and SIC. We have performed a tropical Atlantic (ATL) experiment forced by SST anomalies in the tropical North Atlantic (0°–30°N) in ENSO-decay year superposed on the global climatology. ATL—CTL difference (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>) reproduces the observed Eurasian warming with weakened Siberian high in response to the tropical North Atlantic warming (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>, b). In the upper troposphere, it captures anticyclonic anomalies over Eurasia, but the anomalous Arctic trough is missing (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>).

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further examine impact of the BK sea ice increase on atmospheric circulation by additional two experiments (ICE and ATL + ICE). They are forced by BK SIC anomalies in ENSO-decay year (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>) solely (ICE) and in combination with the tropical North Atlantic SST anomalies as in ATL (ATL + ICE) (see Methods). (ATL + ICE)—CTL difference presents amplified Eurasian warming with Siberian high weakening, producing the observed dipole of Arctic cooling and Eurasian warming (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>) in a comparable magnitude with observations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). The Eurasian warming in ATL + ICE is significantly stronger than in ATL, highlighting an amplifying role by the BK sea ice anomalies. Compared with ATL, the geopotential height response better captures the observed wave train from the tropical Atlantic towards eastern Eurasia via the Arctic (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). By contrast, ICE—CTL difference shows cooling only over the ice-increased BK Seas and cannot produce the Arctic-Eurasian linkage (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4e, f</a>). Besides, the Arctic cooling in ICE is considerably weaker than in ATL + ICE. This indicates an important contribution of the Siberian high weakening to the Arctic cooling, in support of atmospheric driving of Arctic sea-ice variability

  </span>, suggesting dominant role of internal atmospheric variability for Eurasian cooling. Our experiments also demonstrate that BK sea ice anomalies solely cannot induce strong Eurasian climate anomalies (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4e</a>). However, ATL + ICE reproduces the Arctic and Eurasian SAT linkage (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). Despite that we do not artificially inflate prescribed SST or SIC anomalies, the Arctic–Eurasian SAT linkage is comparable in magnitude to observations. We therefore suggest that the Arctic–Eurasian climate linkage is driven by the combination between atmospheric teleconnection originating in the tropical oceans and Arctic sea ice.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite gradual weakening of the warmer tropical Atlantic condition throughout ENSO-decay year (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), SLP and precipitation anomalies undergo secondary peak in October over the warm pool around the Caribbean Sea (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>), where climatological SST and precipitation reach a maximum in autumn
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. The increased precipitation over the warm pool is reproduced by ATL + ICE (and also ATL), resulting from the tropical Atlantic SST warming. To the northwest of the increased precipitation, upper-tropospheric anticyclonic anomalies intensify in both observations and model (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>), consistent with the characteristics of a Rossby wave response to enhanced latent heating. The intensified anticyclonic anomalies act as a Rossby wave forcing, propagating the wave activity northeastward, which lead to the Eurasian wave train in early winter (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>). Although the observed wave train appears to propagate from the extratropical North Atlantic (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2h</a>), the enhanced baroclinic atmospheric response over the tropical Atlantic is evident in SON (e.g., Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). By a composite analysis, the Rossby wave train from the tropical Atlantic towards Eurasia via the Arctic is more pronounced (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). As only tropical Atlantic SST or Arctic sea ice cannot produce the Arctic–Eurasian SAT linkage (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, e</a>), these results suggest that tropical Atlantic SST induces a Rossby wave and Arctic sea ice maintains or amplifies the wave activity. The extratropical North Atlantic SST anomalies may also play a role in amplifying the wave train

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To support our observational findings and modelling results, we turn to Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)-type experiment data (see Methods). Two model ensembles during the past 50 years simulate Arctic cooling and Eurasian warming with weakened SLP reasonably well in early winter of ENSO-decay year (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>), although the response is weaker. We conclude that the coupling between tropical oceans and Arctic sea ice through atmospheric circulation plays a substantial role in Arctic and Eurasian climate linkage.
