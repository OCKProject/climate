 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distinct atmospheric and oceanic variations after ENSO dissipation are also supported by an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis (see Methods). Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the second and third EOF modes (EOF-2 and EOF-3, respectively) of SLP over the Northern Hemisphere in early winter for 1958–2015 (explaining 15.2% and 11.5% of the total variance, respectively). The leading EOF mode represents the Arctic Oscillation, which explains 19.4% (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The principal component (PC) corresponding to EOF-2 has an upward trend before the 1980s but a downward trend afterwards (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), intensifying in a negative phase. The EOF-3 resembles the wave-train pattern seen in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>. Although this wave-train pattern has similar long-term changes to the EOF-2 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>), surface air temperature (SAT), SST and SIC anomalies are quite distinct (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). The EOF-2 pattern is related to a Pacific–North America (PNA)-like teleconnection combined with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, while the EOF-3 pattern captures Arctic cooling, Eurasian warming and the North Atlantic SST variation as in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>. The PC corresponding to EOF-3 is correlated with ENSO(–1), while EOF-2 is correlated with ENSO(0) (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Although significant, the EOF-3 correlation with ENSO(–1) is moderate, consistent with a view that this anomaly pattern is an atmospheric internal mode whose occurrence is modulated by SST and sea ice anomalies

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Considering that the Arctic Oscillation (EOF-1) is mostly an internal atmospheric variability unforced by SST or sea ice
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, these results suggest that ENSO(−1) can be a seasonal predictor of the BK sea ice and Eurasian SAT.

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SAT variations are tied to upper-level atmospheric circulation. The PNA combined with NAO in the EOF-2 pattern can roughly explain ENSO(0) anomalies (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2e, g</a>). The SLP EOF-3 is associated with a Rossby wave train that extends from the tropical North Atlantic towards the Arctic and eastern Eurasia (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2f</a>), resembling the Eurasian teleconnection pattern
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. ENSO(–1) also features a similar wave train from the North Atlantic across Eurasia (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2h</a>). The combination of a trough over the BK Seas and a downstream anticyclone leads to Arctic cooling and Eurasian warming. These results demonstrate that the atmospheric circulation response to ENSO(–1) is completely different from that in ENSO(0), and suggest that the Arctic and Eurasian contrasting SAT anomalies are associated with ENSO(–1) and BK sea ice anomalies through the atmospheric circulation anomalies.
