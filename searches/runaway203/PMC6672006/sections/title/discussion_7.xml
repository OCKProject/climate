  </span>. Our results here demonstrate that without tropical forcing, the linkage between Arctic sea ice change and Eurasian climate would have been much weaker. The combination of tropical Atlantic SST and Arctic sea ice anomalies induces a stronger remote influence and improves the signal to noise ratio. Our result thus poses a novel perspective on the potential remote impact of Arctic sea ice variability and changes.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A composite analysis in recent El Niño- and La Niña-decay years shows that the Arctic and Eurasian climate anomalies are roughly in the opposite polarities at surface (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a–d</a>). This is consistent with our additional experiment driven by the difference between the negative (i.e., La Niña, tropical Atlantic cooling and BK sea ice decrease) and positive phases (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). However, the North Atlantic wave path is different between the two decay years (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5e</a>, f), and the Arctic and Eurasian climate linkage appears to be more pronounced in decay years of La Niña than El Niño, possibly due to the asymmetry in their durations

  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5g, h</a>) are consistent with the phase of La Niña-decay years. This result suggests that the combination of the recent tropical Pacific cooling
