 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important aspect of tackling challenges around health and climate change is establishing mechanisms to monitor health impacts and setting targets to reduce these. Several international policy frameworks and platforms are in place (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>); these stipulate a clear mandate to foster stronger engagement of the health sector with climate change adaptation and mitigation.

According to this declaration, by enhancing national implementation, countries will develop national portfolios of action on environment and health by the end of 2018, as standalone policy documents or parts of others, respecting differences in countries’ circumstances, needs, priorities and capacities. The portfolios should draw on Annex 1 to the Declaration, which is a compendium of possible actions to facilitate its implementation, focusing on the seven priority areas, including climate change and health [
