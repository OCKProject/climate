    <p>Dynamical feedbacks resulting from ozone zonal asymmetries are important for accurately representing Northern Hemisphere circulation patterns during wintertime</p>

    <p>Three simulations using different methods of specifying ozone mixing ratios are compared with a fully coupled CCM simulation in order to examine the pathways by which zonal ozone asymmetries influence modeled dynamics</p>

    <p>Dynamical feedbacks occurring in a coupled CCM can be reproduced, at a greatly reduced computational cost, by appropriately placing a prescribed ozone climatology onto a dynamically evolving coordinate</p>
