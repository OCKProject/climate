 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both Earth's atmosphere and in a CCM, dynamical asymmetries in the polar lower stratosphere produce ZAO, which in turn feeds back onto stratospheric dynamics through both radiative heating (P1 pathway) and through eddy transport (P2 pathway). We have introduced a novel method of generating ZAO interactively within a GCM from a prescribed zonal‐mean ozone climatology, providing a complete representation of the P1 pathway without the computational burden of using ozone from a CCM. When ozone is generated in this manner (our CALC‐AZ simulation) the high‐latitude dynamics in the modeled lower stratosphere closely resemble those of UKCA and do not exhibit most of the strong biases associated with prescribing either zonally symmetric ozone (SPEC‐ZM) or fixed climatological asymmetries (SPEC‐AZ) in these parts of the atmosphere.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Arctic stratosphere, the exclusion of ZAO in the SPEC‐ZM simulation results in a colder, more polar‐centric vortex compared to a CCM; this has a significant impact on the wintertime NAO and therefore affects tropospheric circulation. The inclusion of ZAO increases planetary wave flux into the lower stratosphere, heating the Arctic vortex and reducing the differences in both vortex strength and MSLP. However, prescribing fixed climatological ZAO in SPEC‐AZ shifts the polar vortex toward Scandinavia in the climatological average, where ozone in the prescribed field takes its lowest value. It is only when dynamically consistent ZAO are included in the CALC‐AZ simulation, thereby completing the P1 pathway, that the Arctic vortex is consistent with that modeled in the interactive UKCA simulation in both strength and position, and the MSLP differences are minimized.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Antarctic stratosphere, dynamical asymmetries play a more limited role in generating ZAO, which are largely driven by heterogeneous chemistry in and around the polar vortex. Overall, the net differences between SPEC‐ZM and UKCA are smaller compared to the Arctic, but are similar in that the vortex is colder and more circular during wintertime. Much like the Arctic but to a lesser degree, SPEC‐AZ shows a climatological shift toward west Antarctica where the climatological ozone field is lowest. Nevertheless, the Antarctic vortex is too circular in all simulations compared to UKCA because they all neglect ZAO from heterogeneous chemistry. It is only around the time of final warming that differences from prescribed ZAO start to emerge, in that both SPEC‐AZ and CALC‐AZ force the final warming date to occur about a week earlier than in UKCA (and half a week earlier in SPEC‐ZM). These differences in final warming date are related to the lack of temporal resolution in our ozone specification and its inability to resolve heterogeneous chemistry (and other P2 processes), rather than from dynamical differences (the effects of which cancel each other out quite well in SPEC‐ZM's Antarctic vortex). Despite this earlier final warming, the dynamical ZAO is well represented by CALC‐AZ and shows the smallest differences from UKCA in both vortex shape and in MSLP throughout the season, much like in the Arctic.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most practical uses for GCMs is to predict systematic changes in regional surface conditions, such as temperatures and weather patterns, into the future. If certain regional biases in MSLP can be removed by generating ZAO from a model's internal dynamics, which we have proven possible, then this approach should be prioritized for improving the accuracy of any climate simulation which does not require chemical predictability (or for which future composition is specified). The methodology presented here is a computationally inexpensive way of achieving this and is suitable for further modeling studies. Looking forward we may be able to generate ZAO in this way from a simplified 2‐D chemistry model, rather than a prescribed climatology, which would add chemical predictability as well as a complete representation of the P2 pathway (eliminating the remaining biases to do with heterogeneous chemistry and eddy transport) without the expensive computation of coupling full 3‐D chemistry.</p>
