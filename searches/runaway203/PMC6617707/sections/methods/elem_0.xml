   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The study area supports approximately one-third of the current 
   <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> populations, and so represents a major component of 
   <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> habitats. The area has deep snow in winter, due to the influence of continental polar air from Siberia and moisture from the warm currents of the Sea of Japan. The alpine vegetation, which occurs above the forest limit at approximately 2200 m above sea level, consists of Japanese stone pine (
   <span class="italic">P. pumila</span>) scrub, snowbed grasslands (including 
   <span class="italic">Phyllodoce aleutica</span>,

The dataset is calculated from meteorological temperature observations collected between 1953 and 1982 and precipitation data collected between 1953 and 1976. Four climatic factors considered important for forming alpine vegetation were used as explanatory variables in the species distribution model: (1) the warmth index, which is defined as the annual sum of positive differences between monthly mean temperature and + 5 °C [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>] and provides a measure of effective heat quantity required for plant growth; (2) monthly mean daily minimum temperature in the coldest month (minimum temperature), which is a measure of extreme cold; (3) summer (May–September) precipitation, which provides a measure of water supply during the growing season; and (4) maximum snowwater equivalent (maximum snowwater), which provides a measure of snow accumulation. Maximum snowwater was calculated by aggregating daily changes in snowfall, rainfall, and meltwater (degree-day method) based on the daily climatic dataset supplied from the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System.

   <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the impact of climate change by incorporating the uncertainties related to general circulation models (GCMs), we applied 24 GCMs from the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model dataset [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>] as future climates (Additional file 
    <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">3</a>: Table S1). The climate change scenarios were generated based on scenario A1B of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios, which assumed rapid economic growth, the rapid spread of new and efficient technologies, and a balanced emphasis on all energy sources [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. The A1B scenario is most commonly cited as a high emission scenario in the Fourth Assessment Report of IPCC [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. We selected the A1B scenario as a possible future because we considered that we should assess the worst case first for the purpose of conservation. The A1B scenario is similar to between Representative Concentration Pathways 6.0 and 8.5 in the later climate scenarios CMIP5 in the Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC, which is second and highest emission scenarios [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]. We only used the data for the period 2081–2100 because the fractional uncertainty for natural factors of internal variability (such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which occurs every few years or decades) is larger in shorter-term climate scenarios. Such internal variability is a noise for global warming prediction, which would emphasize or cancel the effects of greenhouse gases [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. The climate of the twentieth century experiment (20c3m) was used as baseline for current climate. We calculated differences in the means and minimum daily temperatures, and ratios of precipitation between 1961 and 1980 of 20c3m and 2081 and 2100 of the A1B scenario. These differences and ratios were spatially interpolated from original spatial scales (approximately 125 km to 444 km in latitude) to 1-km grid cells using a simple linear interpolation method, and then applied to the current climatic data (i.e. climatic data for grid cells) and used as future climatic data. The four climatic variables in each grid cell were calculated using the future climate scenarios in the same manner as the calculations for current climate. When comparing the current climate to the future climate scenarios within the study area, warmth index and minimum temperature increased in all scenarios, summer precipitation increased in all but four scenarios, and maximum snowwater decreased in all scenarios (Additional file
