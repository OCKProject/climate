  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The model was constructed based on the hypotheses that the functional relationships of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> depend highly on the alpine plant communities in terms of quantity and quality, which depend on climate at macro-scales and topography at small scales. The model was constructed in two main parts. The first part of the model aimed to predict potential habitat for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> based on the area fractions of three alpine vegetation communities and distance from the ridge (sub-model A). The second part of the model aimed to predict the area fractions of alpine vegetation communities based on climatic and topographic variables (sub-model B1 and B2). Potential habitats for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> under future climate change scenarios were projected by applying the future area fractions of alpine vegetation communities, which were predicted from sub-model B2, on sub-model A. All of the models (sub-model A, B1 and B2) were developed by using R2.15.2 [

    <p>Model scheme for assessing the impact of climate change on the distribution of

Abbreviations in this scheme are as follows: WI (warmth index), Warmth Index; TMC (minimum temperature), minimum temperature of the coldest month; PRS (summer precipitation), precipitation of the coldest month; MSW (maximum snowwater), maximum snowwater equivalent (see “
