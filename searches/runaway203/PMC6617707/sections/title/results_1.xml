 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted potential habitat for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> was similar to the actual distribution of the territories in the study area of Japan’s northern Alps (36.25–36.5°N, 137.5–137.7°E). Future potential habitat for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> was projected to decrease to 0.4% of the current potential habitat in the median of occurrence probabilities under 24 GCMs, due to a decrease in alpine vegetation communities. Some potential habitats in the central and northwestern part of the study area were predicted to be sustained in the future, depending on the GCMs.
