 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We constructed topographic data based on a 10-m-resolution digital elevation model that was supplied by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan by using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA, URL: 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html</span>). The topographic data were constructed at 100-m resolution, which was assumed appropriate for estimating the fraction of the areas for alpine vegetation. Five topographic factors, which are thought to be important for plant growth, were calculated, namely, inclination, slope direction, curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>], and distance from the ridgeline.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in the cover and height of 
  <span class="italic">P. pumila</span> is closely related to the degree of wind exposure and snow depth in high mountains during winter, together with microtopographic change. The height of 
  <span class="italic">P. pumila</span> decreases gradually as the degree of wind exposure increases [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. The degree of wind exposure is higher closer to the ridgeline on the wind-blown slope side in winter [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. Thus, distance from the ridgeline was measured as the topographic factor that is considered to affect the height of the 
  <span class="italic">P. pumila</span> community.
