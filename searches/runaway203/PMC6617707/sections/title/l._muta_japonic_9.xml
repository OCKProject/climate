 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the study area, the 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> population size was estimated at 352–376 territories and 860–920 birds, based on the results of intermittent surveys from 1971 to 2010 (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>: Appendix S1). By way of comparison, the total number of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> in the 1980s was approximately 3000 birds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. In this analysis, we used the distribution of territories as occurrence data of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span>. In Japan, 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> lives in the alpine zone of the mountains above 2200 m. The mean territory size of cocks (males) during the breeding season ranges from 0.015 to 0.072 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. On the basis of this information, we defined the grid cell size for projection of the potential habitat as 300 m (0.09 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). Grid cells that did not overlap with the territories were defined as absence.
