 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study predicted the potential habitats for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> under current and future climates at the territory scale (i.e. 300 m × 300 m, 0.09 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) by developing a model that considered the structure of the alpine ecosystem through incorporating spatial hierarchy on various environmental factors. Predicted current potential habitat was consistent with the current observed distribution of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> territories, indicating that alpine vegetation communities, such as the 
  <span class="italic">P. pumila</span>, snowbed grassland, and fellfield communities, are essential for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span>. Our findings are quantitatively consistent with previous studies on the ecology of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> in Japan [

 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incorporating both large scale (i.e. climatic) and smaller scale factors, including biological interactions, microtopography, and microclimate, is important for realistic predictions of species distributions, which is essential for practical spatial conservation planning [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. Previous studies that have predicted the potential habitat for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> in Europe were conducted at the macro-scale (100 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and meso-scale (1 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), mainly taking climatic factors into consideration [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. Our study is the first to incorporate the effects of environmental factors at a micro-scale (i.e. the territory scale) to predict the potential habitat of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span>.
