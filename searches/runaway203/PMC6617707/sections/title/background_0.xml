  <span class="italic">Lagopus muta japonica</span> lives in the alpine zones of central Japan, which is the southern limit of the global distribution for this species. This species is highly dependent on alpine habitats, which are considered vulnerable to rapid climate change. This study aimed to assess the impact of climate change on potential 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> habitat based on predicted changes to alpine vegetation, to identify population vulnerability under future climatic conditions for conservation planning. We developed species distribution models, which considered the structure of the alpine ecosystem by incorporating spatial hierarchy on specific environmental factors to assess the potential habitats for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> under current and future climates. We used 24 general circulation models (GCMs) for 2081â€“2100 as future climate conditions.
