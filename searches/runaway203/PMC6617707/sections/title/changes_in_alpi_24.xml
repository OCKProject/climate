 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We predicted changes in the area fractions of alpine plant communities under future climate by incorporating both climatic factors at the macro-scale and topographic factors at a smaller scale. Our study clarified that climatic suitability for alpine vegetation is the most important factor that determines the area fractions of alpine plant communities, whereas the importance of topographic factors differed in each community type.</p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We suggest that alpine plant communities in Japan are vulnerable to climate change; however, the magnitude of decrease differs with respect to the different level of dependence of each community on topographic factors. Alpine plants in snowbed grassland and fellfield communities that depend less on topographic factors are considered to be more vulnerable to climate change.</p>
