  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sub-model A, which predicted the occurrence of 
   <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> from the area fractions of three alpine vegetation communities and distance from the ridgeline, showed reasonably accurate predictability (AUC: 0.97, sensitivity: 0.94, specificity: 0.93, threshold probability for potential habitat: 0.02). The IOV of the explanatory variables ranged from 0.99 to 1.00, which showed that all of the explanatory variables were important to the same extent for the occurrence of 
   <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> (see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM5">5</a>: Table S2). Response curves of the model (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM6">6</a>: Figure S2), which show positive or negative effects on the occurrence probability in the model at plus or minus values of linear predictor, showed that the occurrence probability was higher in areas with high area fractions of the 
   <span class="italic">P. pumila</span> community and close to the ridgeline. The fellfield community was positively affected when its area fraction was higher than 14.6%, but was negatively affected when the fraction was less than this value. The snowbed grassland community was positively affected in most of the area fractions, but was negatively affected when the fraction was less than 0.7%.

  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted potential habitat for 
   <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> was comparatively similar to the actual distribution of the territories in the study area (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). However, empty habitat (i.e. areas with suitable environmental conditions but no current occurrence of the species) was found in some areas (Fig.

  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indicators of model accuracy for sub-model B1 showed that the model was reasonably accurate (AUC: 0.96 ± 0.001, sensitivity: 0.95, specificity: 0.78, threshold probability for potential habitat: 0.08). The IOV of all the explanatory variables was almost 1.00, which showed that all of the climatic variables were important for the occurrence of the alpine vegetation zone (see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM7">7</a>: Table S3). Response curves of the GAM for sub-model B1 showed that higher warmth index strongly and negatively affected the occurrence of the alpine vegetation zone (Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM8">8</a>: Figure S3). Summer precipitation higher than ca. 1500 mm had a positive effect on the alpine vegetation zone, whereas summer precipitation lower than ca. 1500 mm had a negative effect. Maximum snowwater higher than ca. 530 mm had a positive effect on the alpine vegetation zone, whereas maximum snowwater lower than ca. 530 mm had a negative effect.

  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reasonably accurate models were developed to predict the area fractions of alpine vegetation communities by using topographic variables with the occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone from sub-model B1 (Spearman’s rank sum test, 
   <span class="italic">P. pumila</span> community:

   <a rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM9">9</a>: Figure S4). Distance from the ridge was the most important factor for the area fraction of the 
   <span class="italic">P. pumila</span> community, followed by occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone and slope direction. Occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone was the most important factor for the snowbed grassland community, followed by inclination, slope direction, and curvature. The occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone was the most important factor for the fellfield community, followed by TWI, inclination, curvature, and slope direction.

   <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> was projected to decrease to just three grid cells (i.e. 0.4% of current potential habitat) in the median of occurrence probabilities under 24 GCMs, due to a decrease in the area fractions of the alpine vegetation communities (Figs.
