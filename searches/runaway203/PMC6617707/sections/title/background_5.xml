 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent climatic warming has strongly influenced a wide range of species and communities in terrestrial ecosystems, with responses that include consistent poleward and elevational range shifts for flora and fauna [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Engler et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>] predicted that 36–55% of alpine plant species, 31–51% of subalpine plant species, and 19–46% of montane plant species in Europe will lose more than 80% of their suitable habitat by 2070–2100. Sekercioglu et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>] predicted that approximately 30% of land birds will be at worldwide extinction risk by 2100. A study of the northern and southern range limits of British birds showed that the northern range boundaries of 59 species will move 18.9 km northwards on average over a 20-year period [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average global temperature has increased by 0.74 °C over the last century, and it is projected to increase by a further 1.8–4.0 °C by 2090–2099 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. If a significant cut in global greenhouse gas emissions is achieved, temperature rise may stabilize at approximately 2 °C; however, even with this limit, a certain amount of damage is unavoidable [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. It is thus necessary to assess the impact of climate change on species distributions to determine the extent of potential ecological risk, and to design appropriate conservation strategies for adaptive management.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reducing the vulnerability of species and ecosystems to climate change is an increasingly important conservation objective [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. Identifying areas likely to become important for vulnerable populations is necessary to assist their adaptation to climate change. Artificial climate change experiments, such as those involving rainfall and CO
  <sub>2</sub> manipulation, have been widely used to elucidate how species will respond to future climate change, particularly for plant species and communities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. Several ecological phenomena, including phenological change and advancement of spring events, which are considered to be related to rising temperature, have been detected in recent years [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. However, for animal species, it is difficult to detect signs of climate change impacts using artificial climate change experiments because of their higher mobility. Therefore, quantitative assessments that identify current and future areas of particular conservation concern for populations are required to facilitate adaptive management practices. Species distribution models (SDMs) have been recognized as a useful tool for assessing the impact of environmental change on the distribution of organisms, and for selecting natural ecosystems important for preservation and management [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Although several advantages of using SDMs projections in conservation planning have been acknowledged [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>], the projections include uncertainties caused by such as variation of climate models (i.e. GCMs) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. The inclusion and reduction of uncertainties in conservation planning is, therefore, important to increase the reliability of spatial conservation planning [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Montane and alpine species are expected to be considerably influenced by global warming (e.g., the American pika [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>], the White-tailed Ptarmigan [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>], the Black Grouse [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]). In particular, alpine plants and animals in Japan are considered to be vulnerable to climate change, because they already inhabit mountain tops, and consequently cannot shift to higher elevation refuges in response to global warming. The Rock Ptarmigan 
  <span class="italic">Lagopus muta</span>, which has low fecundity, high survival, a long generation time, and slow population recovery [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>], is adapted to arctic and alpine environments, with some southern populations being isolated in alpine habitats as relicts of the glacial epoch [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. In the Swiss Alps, Revermann et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] predicted that up to two-thirds of potential 
  <span class="italic">L. muta helvetica</span> habitat will be lost by 2070 and showed that potential habitat would shift toward mountaintops by using several statistical modeling approaches, including species distribution models. Consistent with this prediction, in some regions of the Swiss Alps, volunteer observers have increasingly recorded Ptarmigans at higher elevations over the last three decades [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. In Europe, 
  <span class="italic">L. muta</span> populations are likely to decline under warming scenarios, with a projected 54% decline in suitable climate space from the present to the 2080s [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the IUCN Red List, the worldwide status of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta</span> is of least concern [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. However, in Japan, populations of the subspecies (
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span>) have already become extinct in some mountain areas [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. In the 1980s, the population of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> was estimated at 3000 birds. In the northern part of Japan’s Southern Alps, the number of breeding pairs declined by ~ 50% from 1981 to 2004 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. In addition, there is concern that the grazing impacts of increasing Sika deer 
  <span class="italic">Cervus nippon</span> populations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>], along with an increase in montane terrestrial predators, will negatively affect the flora and fauna of the alpine zone. As a consequence, the ranking of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> was raised from vulnerable to endangered in the Japanese Red List revised in August 2012 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. On the basis of the law for the conservation of endangered wild fauna and flora species, the Ministry of the Environment introduced a program for the conservation of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> in October 2012. In central Japan, the subspecies 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> inhabits the mountain alpine zone, which represents the southernmost limit of the global distribution of this species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> uses the Japanese stone pine (
  <span class="italic">Pinus pumila</span>), which is a dominant alpine zone shrub species, as nesting sites and shelters from predators. 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> mainly feeds in alpine fellfields and snowbed grasslands [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Consequently, this species is highly dependent on alpine habitats, which are considered vulnerable to rapid climate change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. Therefore, 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> is hypothesized to be influenced by changes to alpine vegetation due to global warming. Of particular concern in this regard is the prediction by Nakamura that most of the available habitat for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> would disappear if the annual mean temperature rises by 3 °C [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, to assess the vulnerability of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> populations and identify sites for conservation planning under future climate change, changes in the potential habitat for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> were predicted using an SDM, which describes how the alpine ecosystems interact with 24 future climate simulations. The results are expected to identify sustainable and vulnerable habitats of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> in the study area, which could be integrated into the conservation planning for the species under future climate change.
