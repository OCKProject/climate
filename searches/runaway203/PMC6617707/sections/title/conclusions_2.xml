 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model results predicted that the potential habitats for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> in Japan’s northern Alps, which provides core habitat for this subspecies, would be vulnerable by 2081–2100. Small sustainable habitats may serve as refugia, facilitating the survival of 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> populations under future climatic conditions. Impact assessment studies of the effect of climate change on 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> habitats at a nationwide scale are urgently required to establish effective conservation planning for this species, which includes identifying candidate areas for assisted migration as an adaptive strategy.
