 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic data for grid cells, with a resolution of 30″N × 45″E (i.e. ~ 1 km resolution, ca. 1 km

The dataset is calculated from meteorological temperature observations collected between 1953 and 1982 and precipitation data collected between 1953 and 1976. Four climatic factors considered important for forming alpine vegetation were used as explanatory variables in the species distribution model: (1) the warmth index, which is defined as the annual sum of positive differences between monthly mean temperature and + 5 °C [

Maximum snowwater was calculated by aggregating daily changes in snowfall, rainfall, and meltwater (degree-day method) based on the daily climatic dataset supplied from the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System. Snow disappearance dates were derived from 10-day composites of Satellite data and climatic data for grid cells [
