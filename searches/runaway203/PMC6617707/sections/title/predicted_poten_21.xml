 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We obtained reasonably accuracy in predicting the potential habitat for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> by applying sub-model A to the estimated area fractions of the alpine vegetation communities from sub-model B2 (AUC: 0.92 ± 0.004, sensitivity: 0.95, specificity: 0.88).

 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential habitat for the alpine vegetation zone was predicted to decrease from current (ca. 2464 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) to future (ca. 18 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, representing 0.7% of current in the median of 24 GCMs) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Area fractions of all the three alpine vegetation communities were predicted to decrease under future climates (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Future potential habitat for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> was projected to decrease to just three grid cells (i.e. 0.4% of current potential habitat) in the median of occurrence probabilities under 24 GCMs, due to a decrease in the area fractions of the alpine vegetation communities (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>a). Most potential habitat for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> was predicted to be non-habitat under any future climate scenario, whereas some potential habitat in the central and north-western part of the study area was predicted to be sustained, depending on the GCM (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>b). Environments containing sustainable habitat for 
  <span class="italic">L. muta japonica</span> included a climate with cooler temperatures, higher snowfall, and lower summer precipitation, and were located closer to ridges on the leeward (i.e. eastern) side and had a gentler slope in topography.
