 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indicators of model accuracy for sub-model B1 showed that the model was reasonably accurate (AUC: 0.96 ± 0.001, sensitivity: 0.95, specificity: 0.78, threshold probability for potential habitat: 0.08). The IOV of all the explanatory variables was almost 1.00, which showed that all of the climatic variables were important for the occurrence of the alpine vegetation zone (see Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM7">7</a>: Table S3). Response curves of the GAM for sub-model B1 showed that higher warmth index strongly and negatively affected the occurrence of the alpine vegetation zone (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM8">8</a>: Figure S3). Summer precipitation higher than ca. 1500 mm had a positive effect on the alpine vegetation zone, whereas summer precipitation lower than ca. 1500 mm had a negative effect. Maximum snowwater higher than ca. 530 mm had a positive effect on the alpine vegetation zone, whereas maximum snowwater lower than ca. 530 mm had a negative effect.

 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reasonably accurate models were developed to predict the area fractions of alpine vegetation communities by using topographic variables with the occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone from sub-model B1 (Spearman’s rank sum test, 
  <span class="italic">P. pumila</span> community: 
  <span class="italic">rho </span>= 0.90, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001, snowbed grassland community: 
  <span class="italic">rho</span> = 0.44, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001, fellfield community: 
  <span class="italic">rho </span>= 0.63, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001).

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increased MSE (see “
  <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">Methods</a>” for the definition) showed the importance of the variables for the three alpine vegetation communities (Additional file 
  <a rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM9">9</a>: Figure S4). Distance from the ridge was the most important factor for the area fraction of the 
  <span class="italic">P. pumila</span> community, followed by occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone and slope direction. Occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone was the most important factor for the snowbed grassland community, followed by inclination, slope direction, and curvature. The occurrence probability of the alpine vegetation zone was the most important factor for the fellfield community, followed by TWI, inclination, curvature, and slope direction.
