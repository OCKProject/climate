  <sub>2</sub> gas to a plant-available form of nitrogen (N), can provide much of the N needed to drive forest growth

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. N-fixing trees thus mitigate climate change by sequestering CO
  <sub>2</sub>, either directly via their own growth or indirectly via the turnover of their N-rich tissues whose decomposition increases surrounding soil N and plant growth. However, in addition to driving CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration, elevated soil N driven by the decomposition of N-rich plant litter can also drive soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N
  <sub>2</sub>O)

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. What is the current balance of the CO
  <sub>2</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O effects of N-fixing trees, i.e. the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect, and to what degree will it be modified by global change?
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies on another major N input to forests, atmospheric N deposition, offer insight into the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of N enrichment. N deposition rates are increasing globally due to fossil fuel and fertilizer use
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Although intensifying N deposition is expected to stimulate CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, it is also expected to stimulate soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> that will offset 18–90% of the negative radiative forcing of this CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. These studies demonstrate the potential for elevated soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions to substantially offset CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration driven by N enrichment. However, the balance of the CO
  <sub>2</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O effects of biological N fixation, which has fundamentally different dynamics than those of N deposition, is unresolved.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike N deposition, biological N fixation has the capacity to self-regulate, feeding back to ecosystem-scale soil N levels
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. A deficiency of N can stimulate N fixation, which can promote plant growth and CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration. An excess of N can inhibit N fixation, which is physiologically costly, reducing ecosystem-scale soil N excess and its associated soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions. However, the strength of this feedback varies across N-fixing species. Some N-fixing species exhibit a facultative N fixation strategy and feedback to soil N levels

  <span class="sup">−1</span> at the ecosystem scale
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. However, other N-fixing species do not regulate their N fixation rate in response to soil N levels, exhibiting an obligate N fixation strategy
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. In this case, N fixation at the ecosystem scale is only downregulated when these species are competitively excluded. However, before competitive exclusion occurs, obligate N-fixing trees can drive substantial soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. The strong connection between N fixation, soil N enrichment, and soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions calls for the explicit consideration of N fixation strategies when estimating the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of forests.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we use a theoretical modeling approach to ask two main questions: how do N-fixing trees influence the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of forests, i.e. do N-fixing trees mitigate or exacerbate climate change? How will their influence change under elevated N deposition rates? We use the terms mitigate and exacerbate to highlight that the influence of N-fixing trees is relative to ongoing greenhouse gas effects. In forests, the cooling effect of CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration is partially offset by the warming effect of soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>, resulting in a net cooling CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect. We are not suggesting that N-fixing trees can or will change the direction of the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of forests from cooling to warming. The question we address is how N-fixing trees modify CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration in comparison to how they modify soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions relative to non-fixing trees.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use a differential equation ecosystem model that captures the fluxes and pools of carbon (C) and N in an ecosystem, and includes competition between N-fixing and non-fixing trees. We validated the model against literature estimates of the relevant fluxes and pools of C and N in tropical, temperate, and boreal forests. The model predicts CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration (CO
  <sub>2</sub> effect) and soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions (N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect) of an ecosystem with a given dominant N fixation strategy. We compute the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of the ecosystem with two complementary methods. The first method compares accumulated CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration to accumulated soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions after 100 years of ecosystem succession using the global warming potential of N
  <sub>2</sub>O. The second method computes the net radiative forcing from continuous CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration and soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions over 100 years of ecosystem succession. To evaluate the CO
  <sub>2</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O effects of N-fixing trees, we compare model ecosystems of non-fixing trees to model ecosystems that contain both N-fixing trees and non-fixing trees. Model ecosystems with N-fixing trees contain one of three empirically supported N fixation strategies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>: obligate (fix N at a constant rate per unit biomass), perfectly facultative (downregulate N fixation to perfectly meet their N demand after taking up soil N; hereafter facultative), and incomplete regulator (downregulate N fixation similarly to the facultative strategy but sustain N fixation at a constant minimum rate). The difference in the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect between a model ecosystem of non-fixing trees and a model ecosystem with N-fixing trees is the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect attributed to the N-fixing trees and is inherently relative to the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of non-fixing trees. To estimate the magnitude of the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees at the global scale, we parameterized the model for tropical, temperate, and boreal forests, and simulated the model under past (low; pre-Anthropocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>), recent (intermediate; 2001
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> and 2006
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>), and future N deposition rates (high; 2030 for the SRES A2 scenario
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>). The model suggests that N-fixing trees can either mitigate or exacerbate climate change relative to non-fixing trees, contingent on their N fixation strategy and on N deposition. As N deposition intensifies, N-fixing trees stimulate substantial soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions but promote minimal CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration, exacerbating climate change relative to non-fixing trees. The goal of this study is not to generate a quantitatively accurate prediction of the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees. Rather, the objectives are to estimate its potential magnitude, and to generate and explore hypotheses of how N-fixing trees could mitigate or exacerbate climate change. Ultimately, these hypotheses should be analyzed empirically and with Earth System Models.
