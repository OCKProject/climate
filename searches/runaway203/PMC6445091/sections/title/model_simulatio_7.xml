 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulations of the model were conducted in R using the package deSolve. We parameterized our model for tropical, temperate, and boreal forests (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>), and conducted the following simulations for each parameterization. We simulated four versions of the model (ecosystems containing only non-fixers, ecosystems containing non-fixers and obligate N-fixers, ecosystems containing non-fixers and facultative N-fixers, and ecosystems containing non-fixers and incomplete regulator N-fixers) for 100 years. We simulated each of the four versions of the model under three N deposition rates: past (low; pre-Anthropocene; from Galloway et al.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>), recent (intermediate; 2001 and 2006; from Vet et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span> and Dentener et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> respectively), and future N deposition rates (high; 2030 for the SRES A2 scenario
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>; from Dentener et al.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>) (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). N deposition rates for tropical, temperate, and boreal forests were estimated using weighted averages with tropical, temperate, and boreal forest areas (from the 2015 Global Forest Resources Assessment

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>). The range of N deposition rates can also be representative of varying degrees of N enrichment from other sources (rock weathering N input, turnover, mineralization, etc.). Additionally, we simulated each of the four versions of the model under low, intermediate, and high initial soil N pool sizes (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>).
