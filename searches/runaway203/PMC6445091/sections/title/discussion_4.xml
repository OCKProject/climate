  <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees at both the ecosystem and global scales (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). In particular, under elevated N deposition rates, our model suggests that N fixation strategy is the key determinant of the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of forests: obligate N-fixing trees exacerbate climate change relative to non-fixing trees, whereas facultative N-fixing trees influence climate change in the same manner as non-fixing trees. The net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees at the global scale under future N deposition rates—up to 0.77 Pg C yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> according to our model—is highly uncertain, given the numerous caveats associated with scaling a simple model up to the globe. However, the magnitude of this estimate suggests that N-fixing trees could have a critical influence on the extent to which forests will mitigate climate change. Below, we discuss our current understanding of N fixation strategies and the CO
  <sub>2</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O effects of N-fixing trees, how other global change factors could influence the net CO
  <sub>2</sub>–N
  <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees, and extensions of our results to forest management and Earth System Models.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to our model, N fixation strategies are a key determinant of how N-fixing trees will influence climate change, but the global distribution of N fixation strategies is not well established. There is observational evidence that actinorhizal N-fixing trees in temperate forests are obligate

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Theoretical evidence suggests that a transition from facultative N fixation strategies at lower latitudes to obligate N fixation strategies at higher latitudes could explain the order of magnitude drop in N-fixing tree abundance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> and the differences in successional patterns of N-fixing tree abundance between tropical and temperate forests

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Theory also suggests why an obligate N fixation strategy could be more adaptive at higher latitudes: low decomposition rates at low temperatures could lead to sustained N limitation, favoring obligate N fixation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support these theories because N fixation strategies are difficult to establish experimentally
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Our study emphasizes the need for a more accurate and extensive description of the distributions of different N fixation strategies given their significant influence on predictions of the net CO

  </span> found that in a 300-year forest chronosequence in Panama, N-fixing trees provided over 50% of the N demand of early successional forest growth. However, another study from the same region of Panama showed a negligible influence of N-fixing trees on forest growth

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>

  </span> and Costa Rica
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span> have shown that N-fixing trees can even inhibit the growth of surrounding trees and thus inhibit forest growth. These results could be due to non-N limitation and strong competitive effects of N-fixing trees on surrounding trees, although these mechanisms remain speculative. Further research is necessary to determine the predominance and controls of non-facilitative effects of N-fixing trees on forest growth. Additional studies on how N-fixing trees drive soil N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions are also necessary. It is well established that soil N drives soil N

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>). The magnitude of our estimate of the net CO

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis focused on a single global change factor—intensifying N deposition—due to its clear link to N supply. However, global change factors beyond N deposition such as increasing temperature, changing precipitation, and CO

Our analysis suggests that a single functional group, N-fixing trees, could decrease the magnitude of this negative radiative forcing of forests by up to 32% as N deposition intensifies.

We do not claim to have made accurate predictions for the net CO

  <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees and improve its representation in Earth System Models, allowing the development of an accurate estimate of the extent to which N-fixing trees and global forests will mitigate or exacerbate climate change.
