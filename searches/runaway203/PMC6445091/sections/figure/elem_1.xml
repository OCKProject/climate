  <p>Mechanisms that drive the CO
   <sub>2</sub> and N
   <sub>2</sub>O effects of nitrogen-fixing trees. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> N fixation rate as a function of available soil N for the three N fixation strategies examined in the model (the horizontal gray line represents a zero N fixation rate for non-fixing trees). 
   <span class="bold">b</span> CO
   <sub>2</sub> effect. CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration increases with increasing N fixation rate when N is limiting. When N supply to the ecosystem is sufficient to alleviate N limitation, CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration plateaus with increasing N fixation rate. This plateau occurs at a lower N fixation rate under high N deposition than under low N deposition. 
   <span class="bold">c</span> N
   <sub>2</sub>O effect (displayed in units of CO
   <sub>2</sub> radiative equivalents). Increasing N fixation rate does not stimulate soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions when N is limiting. When N supply to the ecosystem is sufficient to alleviate N limitation, soil N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions increase with increasing N fixation rate. This increase occurs at a higher N fixation rate under low N deposition than under high N deposition. The black curves in 
   <span class="bold">b</span> and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> represent the CO
   <sub>2</sub> and N
   <sub>2</sub>O effects respectively of an ecosystem with a tropical forest parameterization, a single biomass C pool, and a prescribed constant N fixation rate per unit biomass C. The vertical purple, orange, and green lines in 
   <span class="bold">b</span> and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> represent average N fixation rates over 100 years for the three N fixation strategies examined in the model (the vertical gray line represents a zero N fixation rate over 100 years for non-fixing trees). The corresponding brackets indicate the range of N fixation rates over 100 years for the three N fixation strategies examined in the model. The low N deposition rate is from Galloway et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span> and the high N deposition rate is derived from Dentener et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
   </span>. Overall, 
   <span class="bold">a</span>–
   <span class="bold">c</span> show that N fixation drives cooling when N is limiting (low N fixation and/or N deposition) and warming when N is not limiting (high N fixation and/or N deposition)
