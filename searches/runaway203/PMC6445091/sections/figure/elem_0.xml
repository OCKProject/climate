   <sub>2</sub> radiative equivalents, which balance the greenhouse effects of CO
   <sub>2</sub> and N
   <sub>2</sub>O using the global warming potential of N
   <sub>2</sub>O. A positive net CO
   <sub>2</sub>–N
   <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees relative to non-fixing trees indicates that N-fixing trees have a warming effect relative to non-fixing trees (i.e. N-fixing trees warm more than non-fixing trees but do not necessarily warm overall). A negative net CO
   <sub>2</sub>–N
   <sub>2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees relative to non-fixing trees indicates that N-fixing trees have a cooling effect relative to non-fixing trees (i.e. N-fixing trees cool more than non-fixing trees but do not necessarily cool overall). The model is parameterized for a tropical forest
