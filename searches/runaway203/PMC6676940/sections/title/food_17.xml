 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the survey results, several families in the Sonorejo and Jiwo Wetan villages have the same characteristics in terms of food components. If the level of vulnerability in the Sonorejo Village is 0.426, then in Jiwo Wetan Village it is not significantly different at 0.445. This is because of changes in rainfall patterns and high rainfall as a result of climate change that causes flooding or inundation in the paddy fields of Sonorejo and Jiwo Wetan villages, resulting in crop failure and a decrease in rice productivity. As a result, farm households that get the main food source from their own crops become vulnerable to climate change. Based on the food sub-component index, households whose main source of food comes from their own crops do not store it for use when unpredictable conditions are the most vulnerable to climate change.</p>
