 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Livelihood vulnerability index consists of seven main components, namely, SDP, LS, H, F, W, SN and ND and climate variability, and each consists of several indicators or sub-components. Each sub-component is measured by different scales that should be standardised to convert it into an index and combine it as a whole with the composite index.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The result of the standardisation of each sub-component, which is obtained by a survey of 61 families in the Sonorejo Village and 72 respondents in the Jiwo Wetan Village, is presented in

  </div>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the level of vulnerability classification conducted by Hahn et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">2009</a>), it is known that the scale of the LVI value is set between 0 and 0.2 (not vulnerable), 0.21 and 0.40 (vulnerable or moderate) and 0.41 and 0.5 (very vulnerable). The results of the calculations in 
  <a rid="T0004" ref-type="table" href="#T0004">Table 4</a> can be interpreted as measured variables including the following.
 </p>
 <sec id="s30015" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Socio-demographic profile</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The socio-demographic index of the Sonorejo Village is 0.235 and the Jiwo Wetan Village is 0.145. The proportion of the population of non-productive age, education pursued by the head of the family and the limitations of family members are still at a moderate level. The percentation of women as family heads is 0.115, while in the Jiwo Wetan Village it is higher at 0.368. This index shows that families led by a woman will be more vulnerable than households led by a man.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="s30016" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Livelihood strategy</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The livelihood strategy index from the Sonorejo Village is 0.392, while in the Jiwo Wetan Village it is 0.499. The index of household sub-components that are based on the agricultural sector in Sonorejo sub-district is 0.607, while in the Jiwo Wetan Village it is 0.645. This shows that family dependence on the agricultural sector is more susceptible to climate change than families who do not only rely on the agricultural sector. Besides farming they also work outside the city and other economic sectors.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="s30017" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison of the health index numbers shown by the Sonorejo Village is 0.263, while in the Jiwo Wetan Village it is 0.245. In the health sub-component, the distance between health facilities and the number of families who have members with chronic diseases shows a moderate number. Based on the health degree vulnerability index, it can be concluded that the residents in the Sonorejo and Jiwo Wetan villages are not very vulnerable to climate change. Geographically, the Sonorejo and Jiwo Wetan villages are not isolated from health service centres.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="s30018" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the survey results, several families in the Sonorejo and Jiwo Wetan villages have the same characteristics in terms of food components. If the level of vulnerability in the Sonorejo Village is 0.426, then in Jiwo Wetan Village it is not significantly different at 0.445. This is because of changes in rainfall patterns and high rainfall as a result of climate change that causes flooding or inundation in the paddy fields of Sonorejo and Jiwo Wetan villages, resulting in crop failure and a decrease in rice productivity. As a result, farm households that get the main food source from their own crops become vulnerable to climate change. Based on the food sub-component index, households whose main source of food comes from their own crops do not store it for use when unpredictable conditions are the most vulnerable to climate change.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="s30019" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Households in the Sonorejo Village in the water component showed a relatively moderate level of vulnerability with an index number of 0.274. As many as 78.7% of families in the Sonorejo Village use natural water sources to meet their daily water needs with consistent water availability (always available), while 8.19% or five families are recorded as not having a consistent water source. This is because their water sources sometimes have a salty or cloudy taste, so they have to find other water sources to meet their family’s water needs. The level of vulnerability in water resources in the Sonorejo Village is higher than in the Jiwo Wetan Village. Water problems in the Jiwo Wetan Village will appear during the dry season, but not significantly.</p>

 <sec id="s30020" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social networks</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Social Network Indicator in the Sonorejo Village shows that most of the people in the Sonorejo Village did not request assistance from the local or local government during the past year (as many as 65.57% or 40 households). While in the Jiwo Wetan Village, the majority of the population also did not ask for government assistance except because of the agricultural insurance premium subsidy programme. Based on the results of the survey conducted, in Sonorejo Village the agricultural insurance programmes are still at the socialisation stage, while in the village area Jiwo Wetan has implemented the programme. The agricultural insurance programme in the Jiwo Wetan Village has given claims to farmers who have experienced crop failure.</p>

 <sec id="s30021" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural disasters and climate variability</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The index number of ND and climate variability in the Sonorejo Village is 0.495; this figure shows that farmers in Sonorejo sub-district are very vulnerable to floods because of their location adjacent to Langsur River and lower terrain than other regions in Sonorejo sub-district. Based on the average number of floods reported in the past 6 years, as many as 85% of families did not get a warning or notification that there would be heavy rain or flooding. However, for the Jiwo Wetan region 0.445 is lower than in Sonorejo. This information is important considering the population of Jiwo Wetan when the rainy season almost always suffers from flooding because it is topographically bordered by the Dengkeng River and Pegunungan Seribu.</p>
