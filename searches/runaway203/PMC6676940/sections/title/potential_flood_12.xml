 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" href="#F0001">Figure 1</a>, the areas marked with dark red are the area mostly prone to flooding in the Sonorejo Village. Based on the results of the mapping using GIS with the consideration of a variable number of flood events, local curvature of the river, slope and land use, it can be seen that Langsur and Ngiser in the Sonorejo Village are two areas prone to catastrophic flooding in lowland rice fields compared with other areas.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" href="#F0002">Figure 2</a>, the results of the mapping using GIS with the consideration of a variable number of flood events, local curvature of the river, slope and land use, it can be seen that most areas in Jiwo Wetan are marked dark red. The Jiwo Wetan Village is passed by a river which can overflow at any time if the intensity of the rain increases. Based on reports from the Local Disaster Board (Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah [BPBD]), standing water can reach 1 m.
