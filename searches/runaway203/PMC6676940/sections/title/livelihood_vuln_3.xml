 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vulnerability is one of the factors that determines whether people have risks to their livelihoods or not. According to IPPC (
  <a rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0005">2007</a>), the vulnerability assessment measures the ability of the community to respond to hazard and or secure their livelihood. Therefore, the index is used for comparison among the communities. Vulnerability Index or LVI was developed by Hahn, Riederer and Foster (
  <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">2009</a>), Madhuri, Thewari, and Bhowmick (
  <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">2014</a>), Simane, Zaitchik and Foltz (
  <a rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0013">2016</a>) and Richardson et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0009">2018</a>). This study wants to measure the vulnerability of households living in areas classified as flood-prone in Sukoharjo Regency and Klaten Regency. Most of the LVI studies were conducted to see differences in the level of vulnerability in different regional characteristics. Some examples of studies, Hahn et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">2009</a>) use LVI for coastal and inland populations, Simane et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0013">2016</a>) see differences in the characteristics of highland and lowland ecosystems and Richardson et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0009">2018</a>) further see LVI as a basis for predicting food security in a region. Nevertheless, the LVI calculations by Hahn et al. (
  <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">2009</a>) is applied in this study, which consists of the following seven main components:

  <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">2009</a>), LVI component consists of several sub-components or indicators. These sub-components are developed based on a literature study of each major component.
