 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the mapping result using GIS, rice field in the Sonorejo Village, especially in Langsur and Ngiser, has high level of vulnerability to flood because of its lower altitude than other areas.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of the research show that farmers in the Sonorejo Village is vulnerable to climate change by 0.363 and 0.044 index calculated by using the LVI and LVI-IPCC approach, respectively. In Jiwo Wetan, LVI is lower than in Sonorejo Village (0.275) and LVI-IPCC is also lower than in Sonorejo Village (âˆ’0.032).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The LVI index measurement results show that two regions that have the same characteristics also have different levels of vulnerability. Strengthening population capacity can be done by expanding the agricultural insurance network. Although agricultural insurance still depends on government subsidies, this policy eases the burden on farmers who experience crop failure.</p>
