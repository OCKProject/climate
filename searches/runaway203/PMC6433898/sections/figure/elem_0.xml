  <p>Predicted impacts of climate change on the distribution of species in study under the MIROC5 model, considering the minimum (RCP 2.6) and maximum (RCP 8.5) scenario of greenhouse gases emissions. Maps show: (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) expansions and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) contractions of ranges, (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) variation in the direction of the geographic displacement and (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) elevational shifts represented in the phylogeny of species, where the external ring shows oviparous (blue) and viviparous (red) species. The maps were created using ArcGIS 10.4.1 (Esri, Redlands, CA).
