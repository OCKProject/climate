 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine effects of climate change on parity mode, we performed an independent-sample 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test using the variables: (i) range extents of current and future ENMs, (ii) magnitude and direction of distributions based on range centroids, and (iii) average elevation of current and future ranges. Analyses were corrected for phylogenetic non-independence to test whether the predicted impacts of climate change (i.e., as geographic range, centroid or elevational shifts) were statistically significant between species with different parity mode (i.e., oviparous and viviparous), as well as among ‘parity-by-taxonomy’ groups (i.e., 
  <span class="italic">Stenocercus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Liolaemus</span>-oviparous, 
  <span class="italic">Liolaemus</span>-viviparous and 
  <span class="italic">Phymaturus</span>) using the fully-sampled phylogeny of Squamates recently published by Tonini, 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

  <span class="italic">t</span>-test and ANOVA) implemented in the R-package “phytools”

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>
  </span>. Additionally, to calculate the differences between each independent pair of groups we applied ANOVA test with “holm” post-hoc pairwise method, owing to it is one of the most powerful multitests when the sample sizes of the groups are different, to perform this analysis, we used the R-package “DescTools”. These analyses were performed for the two models of climate change (GISS-ER and MIROC5) and for each scenario of greenhouse gases emissions indicated above (RCP 2.6 and 8.5). Finally, we performed a spatial autocorrelation analysis (Global Moran’s I) using the Spatial Statistics toolbox in ArcGIS to evaluate whether geographic rage shifts were clustered, dispersed, or randomly distributed.
