 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The accelerated rates of climate change recorded over the last half century are known to be driving global-scale alterations and declines of biodiversity at unprecedented magnitudes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. As a result, accumulating evidence suggests that the planet is entering one of the greatest environmental crises since the origin of life
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. A prevailing ‘biodiversity syndrome’ emerging from these climatic changes is the rapid alterations of the geographic ranges observed across a broad range of species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. Such geographic shifts are the result of species displacements tracking their rapidly moving historical niches as warming advances across space
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. However, patterns, rates, and drivers of geographic range shifts differ across regions and lineages
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Climate change has consistently been observed to be spatially heterogeneous, tending to be more severe towards higher latitudes and elevations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Therefore, species restricted to mountaintops and continental margins are more likely to experience progressive losses of suitable areas as warming advances, hence, forcing either rapid adaptations to the new climatic conditions, or extinctions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. The steepness of mountain slopes also increases the severity of climatic and ecological gradients in a more reduced geographic space (relative to flat regions), further aggravating the increases of extinction risks in species from high elevations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. In addition to pressures emerging from the environment, the magnitude of species’ responses to climate change importantly depends on their ecological tolerance as a function of intrinsic factors such as genetic variation, population size, and generation time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. In recent years, research efforts have focused on identifying mechanisms behind such spatial asymmetries in responses to contemporary climate change, leading to reinforce the focus on a range of phenological, ecological, and physiological factors as primary factors underlying extinction risks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly, the influence that life-history adaptations exert on species responses to climate change has only occasionally been addressed. In fact, although parity-mode transitions (from live-bearing to egg-laying) have been suggested to play a key role in accelerating extinction risks under rapid climate warming
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>, only a handful of studies have investigated the ecological basis of this phenomenon
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Given that life-history traits underlie reproductive success (“fitness”), and that climate change operates as rapid natural selection on fitness via its impact on environmentally-sensitive traits, the conceptual disjoint between both dimensions creates a major gap in our understanding of biodiversity declines via anthropogenic effects. In fact, selection arising from climatic pressures have been shown to generate predictable patterns of evolution and distribution of reproductive traits (e.g., parity mode
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, transient fecundity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>), which therefore creates macroecological patterns of species interactions with the climate via life-history adaptations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An emerging idea, the ‘cul-de-sac’ hypothesis, predicts that the evolution of viviparity – a key life-history adaptation believed to have facilitated the radiation of reptiles into cold climates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span> – is driving reptiles to extinctions due to climate change, relative to oviparous reproducers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Thanks in part to evolving viviparity, reptiles have successfully proliferated across extreme high elevations and latitudes, where low temperatures create strong natural selection against multiple components of fitness via thermal demands on ecological (e.g., embryo survival and development
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span> and life-history (e.g., limitations on reproductive output for viviparous species) functions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. In contrast, these pressures are relaxed in warm climates, where oviparous reptiles dominate. In viviparous squamates, embryo retention in the maternal body acts similar to an incubator to counteract the lethal effects that low and fluctuating environmental temperatures impose on egg development
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. However, cold-climate reptiles may be approaching an evolutionary dead-end in the face of climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Given that most cold-climate reptiles are viviparous

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>, that the oviparity-to-viviparity transitions are largely irreversible (thus, fundamentally unidirectional)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>, and that live-bearing parity (relative to oviparity) entails high fitness costs (e.g., reduced reproductive frequency, increased pregnancy-burden, prolonged basking time)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>, the cul-de-sac hypothesis suggests that, as climate warming advances towards higher elevations and latitudes, viviparous reptiles will remain trapped in rapidly retracting cold environments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, while oviparous species are expected to colonize previously cold sites
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. As viviparous species progressively run out of suitable environments as they approach mountaintops and continental edges, populations are expected to experience demographic collapse that will lead to extinctions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. So far, evidence consistent with this hypothesis remains limited to a few studies that have approached the question in a preliminary fashion
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. However, a replicated, large-scale macroecological test assessing the responses of species to climate change as a function of life-history adaptations proposed by this hypothesis remains lacking.
