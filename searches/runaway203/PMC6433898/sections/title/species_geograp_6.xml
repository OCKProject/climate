 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We gathered a large-scale dataset encompassing three lizard radiations differing in their patterns of geographic distribution and in parity modes, which spans large species-samples of 
  <span class="italic">Liolaemus</span> (40 oviparous and 52 viviparous species), 
  <span class="italic">Phymaturus</span> (11 species, exclusively viviparous – although our dataset contained data for most species within this genus, we excluded most of them given their extremely limited geographic range sizes, which makes it inviable to perform the analyses employed to address our core predictions), and 
  <span class="italic">Stenocercus</span> (40 species, exclusively oviparous) (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). The distributional and life-history data comprise 4,532 geographic occurrence records (after all duplicated points collected from different individuals at same localities were removed). This includes all known records of presence of these lizards following 20+ years of field and museum work, and museum-validated published occurrences

  <span class="italic">Liolaemus</span> + 
  <span class="italic">Phymaturus</span> and Omar Torres-Carvajal: 
  <span class="italic">Stenocercus</span>, to assure accuracy).
