 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study investigates the long-term variability of global non-anthropogenic groundwater storage and its environmental controls. Due to the scarcity of 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> groundwater observations, we analyzed simulated groundwater storage from the Catchment land surface model (CLSM), WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB water resource models. The outputs from these three models may be considered independent given that the model parameterizations are quite distinct and each model was driven by a different atmospheric forcing dataset. Modeled groundwater storage and terrestrial water storage (TWS) were evaluated using 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> data in the eight U.S. regions and GRACE derived TWS at the globe scale. The three output datasets compared reasonably well with the observations based on correlations greater than 0.5 in most regions, demonstrating skill in reproducing interannual variability of water storage. Output from the models was somewhat consistent, especially between CLSM and WaterGAP, owing to the more consistent precipitation data used by those two models.

 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Neglecting anthropogenic impacts, global total groundwater storage decreased during the past 50–70 years, at a rate of 0.25 mm year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> based on the ensemble average. It is possible that the long-term decline is a symptom of climate change, but considering that low-frequency variability in the global groundwater storage time series and in regional groundwater of deeper aquifers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>, the 50 to 67 years of simulation periods may not be long enough to identify a secular trend with confidence. This low frequency variability together with the sensitivity of trends to anomaly amplitudes that vary among models may have also contributed to the discrepancies among trends estimated by the three models. Therefore, better characterizing that low frequency variability would be valuable for improving the models and interpreting the apparent groundwater storage trends.
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOF analysis revealed that ENSO influenced the variability of global groundwater through its control of precipitation patterns. Because ENSO also exhibits low frequency variability, it is plausible that multidecadal scale variability in global total groundwater can be partly attributed to ENSO, though more research would be needed to describe those relationships.</p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis shows that simulated regional and global groundwater anomalies are sensitive to trends in precipitation. Therefore, the linear trend in global groundwater reported here must be interpreted in the context of the reliability and temporal consistency of the forcing datasets, which currently remain incompletely established. For the Princeton dataset, the effectiveness of bias-correction depends on regional availability of 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> data, and may rely more on the fidelity of the NCEP/NCAR re-analysis (used as a baseline) when and where 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> data are scarce. Meteorological data tend to be scarce in the deep tropics, at high latitudes and during earlier years of the 1948–2014 period, especially for fields such as pressure and wind speed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>
  </span>. The GPCC and CRU precipitation data are based on gauge observations and their spatial and temporal variability and consistency may be adversely affected by changes in the numbers and locations of gauges. On the other hand, simulated ET did not exhibit a significant trend and thus was not a factor in the simulated global groundwater depletion trend.
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis shows that representing groundwater abstraction for supporting irrigated agriculture increased the magnitude of the decreasing trends in global groundwater storage simulated by WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB. In addition, groundwater depletions became the leading mode of variability in global groundwater, surpassing ENSO. However, the resulting trends in global groundwater storage, 46.15 to 0.35 mm year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB, respectively, are directly impacted by non-anthropogenic trends and the low frequency variability in global WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB non-anthropogenic groundwater (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>) are embedded in their corresponding global anthropogenic groundwater time series (Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S15</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S16</a>). This emphasizes the importance of evaluating natural groundwater variability when assessing human impacts on groundwater resources. This is particularly true for models like PCR-GLOBWB which rely on the underlying hydrological model to estimate consumptive irrigation water use.
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we caution that our evaluation using 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> groundwater data was limited to regions of the U.S. that do not represent the climates of Africa, east-central Asia, and Northern Eurasia, where some of the significant groundwater storage changes were simulated. Uncertainty in simulated groundwater time series may be higher in drier climates where aquifers tend to be deeper and therefore have longer-scale variability and disconnection from the atmosphere which are difficult to model. Evaluation using GRACE data is limited to less than 15 years when GRACE was active and provides no insight on a model’s ability to separate groundwater from other TWS changes.
