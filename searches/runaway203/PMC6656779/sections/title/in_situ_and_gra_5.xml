  <span class="italic">In situ</span> groundwater observations were obtained for the four Mississippi sub-basins and four northeastern U.S. regions (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) from the USGS web site. These 181 wells were selected because they are located in unconfined or semi-confined aquifers, are not directly affected by groundwater withdrawals or injections and have been continuously monitored for 10–30 years. These data have been used in previous studies for validating GRACE TWS

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GRACE satellites mapped Earth’s gravity field on a monthly basis from 2002 to 2017. The resulting time variable gravity observations were used to derive TWS anomalies which reflect changes in soil moisture, groundwater, snowpack, and surface water storage (lakes and rivers). GRACE also detected water storage changes associated with anthropogenic effects such as groundwater abstractions which, along with surface water, are not simulated by CLSM. The GRACE data used in this study were provided approximately monthly during the mission period on a 0.5° global grid. They were developed using a regularization method that eliminates the need for post-processing and thus better preserves TWS amplitudes and trends

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For comparison with 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> data, modeled groundwater storage at the grid cell nearest each well was selected. Because this study focuses on large-scale interannual variability, monthly precipitation, ET, groundwater storage and TWS were averaged to 1° spatial resolution and monthly anomalies were calculated by removing the long-term mean of each calendar month. Anomalies were further standardized (thus unitless) so that they had zero mean and standard deviation of one. Annual anomalies are averages of the standardized monthly anomalies in each year. Unless otherwise noted, anomalies discussed in following sections refer to standardized anomalies.
