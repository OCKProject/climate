 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CLSM and WaterGAP groundwater trends resemble their corresponding precipitation trends in most land areas, particularly in much of Africa, eastern Asia and Northern Russia, where groundwater decreased significantly due to below normal precipitation. In the Hudson Bay and the Great Lake regions, the two models produced different trends in groundwater. This may be attributed to the fact that CLSM does not simulate surface water and its related recharge. Decreasing CLSM groundwater in much of northern Europe appears to result from increasing ET (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S11</a>), and from a combination of ET increases and precipitation decreases in east-central Asia. Northern Eurasia experienced decreased surface air pressure and, in some areas, increased wind speed (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S12</a>), both of which favor increased ET and thus decreased groundwater storage. Changes in surface air pressure in the high latitudes were noted in IPCC AR5
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Several re-analysis products also show increased storminess in northern, western, and central Europe towards the end of the 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century, more so in the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
  </span>. More frequent cyclones (associated with a low pressure center) in the lower arctic Canada in 1953–2002 were also reported
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>. Since WaterGAP estimates potential ET using the Priestly-Taylor equation, which does not require wind and air pressure data, its estimated ET likely would not reflect these changes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As in other analyses of this study, PCR-GLOBWB groundwater trends exhibit spatial patterns different from those of CLSM and WaterGAP (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). PCR-GLOBWB groundwater increased significantly in high altitude regions of northern South America and Iran, despite no associated increases in CRU-ERA precipitation. The model uses lapse rates derived from a high-resolution temperature climatology data to downscale CRU temperature data in order to better simulate snow dynamics. It is possible this downscaling scheme led to earlier and increased snowmelt, and hence increased groundwater recharge in those areas.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows that globally, CLSM and WaterGAP groundwater storage (ignoring anthropogenic effects) decreased during their respective simulation periods, consistent with the trends in their corresponding global precipitation datasets. Both time series also exhibit low frequency variability, namely a change in the mid-1980s from generally positive to generally negative anomalies, resulting in negative trends. Apparently, ET did not contribute to the negative trend in CLSM groundwater because global averaged ET was relatively stable over the simulation period with an insignificant decreasing trend (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S13</a>). Changes in other atmospheric forcing fields such as increased humidity and air pressure and decreased wind speed (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S14</a>) may suppress the effect of rising temperature on ET. The global standardized CLSM groundwater time series has larger amplitude variation than that of WaterGAP (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>), owing to larger amplitude variations in global Princeton precipitation than in global GPCC precipitation, and hence a larger (and significant) decreasing trend. In contrast, Global PCR-GLOBWB groundwater exhibits an increasing trend, consistent with the trend in global CRU-ERA precipitation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>).

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Groundwater responds to surface wet and dry conditions asymmetrically
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>, e.g., an intense rainfall event in which the water runs off rapidly may do less to replenish an aquifer than a slow, soaking rain. Moreover, groundwater levels reflect the cumulative effects of atmospheric conditions, so that one rainy month or year may not be enough to return groundwater levels to normal after a drought, for example. Differences in model physics such as those controlling partitioning of precipitation into surface runoff and infiltration may further amplify these asymmetrical responses and discrepancies among the models. This is why the three global groundwater storage time series exhibit weaker cross-correlations than the global precipitation time series (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). In the case of this study, global PCR-GLOBWB groundwater was consistently the least well correlated among groundwater output of the three models (Table

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The standardized anomalies discussed above enable examination of modes of variability and comparison of trends across different regions. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> also shows the trends of global, non-standardized annual groundwater storage anomalies (in mm year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) from three models which range from −0.01 to −2.18 mm year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Note that the trend in global non-standardized PCR-GLOBWB groundwater is negative, in contrast to the positive trend in the standardized time series. This is because groundwater storage anomalies in dry climate may exhibit significant trend but their contributions to the global total non-standardized groundwater storage anomalies (mm) are diminished due to their small amplitude variations (mm).
 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For comparison, global total groundwater by WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB, including anthropogenic processes, decreased significantly (Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S15</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S16</a>). Global standardized PCR-GLOBWB groundwater exhibits much smaller decreasing (0.001 vs 0.002 from WaterGAP) trend, owing to the increasing trend in global PCR_GLOBWB non-anthropogenic groundwater. EOF 1 in the global anthropogenic groundwater is a trend (see Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S17</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S18</a>) mainly associated with decreases in known regions of intensive groundwater abstractions such as the Arabian Peninsula, Northern India, the North China Plain and the Great Plains

  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Once again, WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB produced drastically different rates of decline in global non-standardized anthropogenic groundwater, 46.15 and 0.35 mm year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively (see Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S15</a> and
