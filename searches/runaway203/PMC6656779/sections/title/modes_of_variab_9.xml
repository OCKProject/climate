  </span>. By construction, EOF analysis yields modes of variability, consisting of a spatial pattern and a temporal component (or principal component), with their explained variance over the total variance in decreasing order
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. Natural variability of groundwater is mainly governed by precipitation and ET

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. Thus, we first examine modes of variability of global precipitation and ET. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows that the principal component (PC) of the leading mode of variability in Princeton precipitation, PC1, is significantly (significance levels are provided at figure captions) correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). PC1 contains a ‘trough’-shaped low-frequency variability, i.e., decreasing from 1948 to mid-1980 and increasing afterwards which is also observed in SOI. The spatial pattern of EOF 1 shows the low-frequency variability is mainly associated with changes in the Sahel, which experienced a multi-decadal drought starting from 1960
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. EOF 2 identified the low latitude regions where ENSO is known to have stronger impacts on precipitation, namely, Australia, Southern Africa and Northern South America
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. Indeed, PC2 of Princeton precipitation exhibits higher correlation (0.64) with SOI. These areas, including the Sahel, were also identified in a previous study
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>
  </span> which showed stronger correlation (0.82) between PC1 of global precipitation and ENSO, likely due to the longer period (1900–1982) of that study.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The leading modes of variability in global GPCC precipitation (used as input to WaterGAP) exhibit spatial and temporal patterns (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) similar to those of Princeton precipitation, including the low frequency variability in PC1. In contrast, EOF 1 of CRU-ERA precipitation (used as input to PCR-GLOBWB) is an apparent trend (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), mainly associated with changes in the Sahara Desert, Alaska, the high-mountains of Asia and the southern Arabian Peninsula. Its EOF 2 and 3 exhibit spatial patterns similar to EOF 1 and EOF 2 of Princeton and GPCC precipitation. EOF analysis of CRU precipitation produced similar results (not shown) as those of Princeton and GPCC precipitation, suggesting that the trend in EOF1 of CRU-ERA precipitation was caused by replacing CRU precipitation with ERA estimates at locations with few CRU gauges.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ET can have a significant impact on shallow groundwater and a warm climate would tend to favor increased ET. Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S8</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S9</a> show that the leading modes of variability in Princeton longwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure and wind are apparent trends, presumably reflecting climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>
  </span>. In contrast, EOF 1 of global CLSM ET is similar to that of Princeton precipitation (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S10</a>). Both display the trough-shaped variability in PC1, suggesting strong control of precipitation on ET. EOF 2 of global CLSM ET is an apparent trend associated with increasing ET in northern Eurasia, the northeastern U.S. and Central Australia, and decreasing ET in northern South America and the Sahel. This trend only accounts for 7.3% of the total variance while most of the leading modes in the atmospheric forcing fields account for more than 20% of the total variance (see Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S8</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S9</a>). PCR-GLOBWB and WaterGAP ET output was not analyzed because the methods and high-resolution data used by those models to downscale potential and reference ET may also impact modes of variability in actual ET estimates, making it difficult to interpret the results.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The leading modes of variability in CLSM and WaterGAP groundwater show spatial and temporal patterns similar to those of their corresponding precipitation inputs (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The PCs of CLSM groundwater contain less high-frequency variability than those of Princeton precipitation, reflecting the low-pass filtering effect of groundwater recharge
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
  </span>. PC1 of CLSM groundwater exhibits the largest change in 1960s and 1970s, when PC2 of ET and PC1 of precipitation also exhibit their largest changes. These are mainly attributed to significant decrease in precipitation in the Sahel and increases in ET in northern Europe, the northeastern US and central Australia during that period. PCs of groundwater from both CLSM and WaterGAP show lower correlation with SOI than that between precipitation and SOI, reflecting the influence of other processes and fluxes on groundwater such as ET.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, the leading modes of variability in PCR-GLOBWB groundwater bear less resemblance to those of CRU-ERA precipitation. Its EOF 1 is still a trend, but its spatial pattern differs from that of EOF 1 of CRU-ERA precipitation, suggesting other factors may have had significant impacts on simulated groundwater. Similarly, its EOF 2 does not resemble that of CRU-ERA precipitation while its EOF 3 shows spatial and temporal patterns similar to EOF 3 of CRU-ERA precipitation.</p>
