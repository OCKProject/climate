 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Groundwater is crucial for meeting agricultural, industrial and municipal water needs, especially in arid, semi-arid and drought impacted regions where other types of fresh water are scarce
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Groundwater also sustains streams and rivers during dry periods through its contributions to baseflow
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, groundwater variations and their relationship to climate change are poorly understood at the global-scale due to the unavailability of observational data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. A few studies based on 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> observations have revealed the influence of large-scale climate signals such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on aquifers in the U.S.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span> and Canadian Prairies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Outside of North America similar studies are lacking because groundwater measurements typically are inaccessible because their distribution is restricted
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Further complicating matters, 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> observations are often unsuitable for climate studies because of short and discontinuous records, because they are made in confined aquifers where groundwater heads are controlled by factors other than climate or are affected by groundwater pumping
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. The lack of knowledge about groundwater response to climate change has been noted in the 5
  <span class="sup">th</span> assessment report (AR5) of Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> (IPCC).
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been suggested that groundwater responses to future climate scenarios, at the global scale, will vary spatially, mainly depending on recharge rates, with arid and semi-arid areas more vulnerable than wetter areas such as the northern high latitudes, where recharge may increase
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Regional-scale studies support these predictions. A study found that projected changes in precipitation and temperature did not have significant impacts on groundwater recharge in the Grand Forks aquifer of British Columbia, Canada
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Another study showed that groundwater recharge in the drier and warmer part of the High Plains Aquifer exhibited higher sensitivity to rainfall changes than in the cool and wetter part of the aquifer and that the rate of changes in groundwater recharge amplified that of changes in precipitation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. Similarly, it was predicted that climate change would reduce recharge in the southern and mountainous parts of the western U.S., while recharge would be largely unchanged in the northwestern U.S
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. These studies suggest that land evapotranspiration (ET), in addition to precipitation, may be an important factor controlling groundwater responses to climate change. Nevertheless, they are mainly focused on precipitation and temperature as the drivers of groundwater change, without considering other factors such as wind and air pressure for which changes are difficult to generalize due to internal variability and regional variation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. As a slower component of the hydrological cycle, groundwater may reflect small but persistent changes in the climate system
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. To better predict the future, we need to improve our understanding on how groundwater has responded to changes that have occurred in the climate system over the past several decades. Such studies are noticeably lacking and limited to small spatial
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> or short temporal scales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,

  </span>.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we investigate variations in global groundwater storage simulated by three global-scale hydrological models, the Catchment land surface model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span> (CLSM), the WaterGAP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> and PCRaster Global Water Balance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> (PCR-GLOBWB) water resource models. CLSM is a physics based model that was developed for coupled land and atmospheric modeling including seasonal weather forecasting at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center with an emphasis on land-atmosphere fluxes, which are constrained by both energy and water balances. WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB are two leading models developed for assessing the spatial distribution and temporal variability of water resources around the world. They rely on empirical relations to compute all water budget components including surface water and human water use which are neglected by most land surface models including CLSM.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forced with multiple decades of meteorological data that reflect changes in the climate system, these models are able to generate spatially and temporally continuous groundwater estimates suitable for studying climate change impacts on groundwater at regional to global scales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. Multi-model analysis also helps to reduce uncertainties associated with model physics and meteorological forcing fields, as trends in terrestrial water storage simulated by different models have been shown to vary considerably
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Modeled groundwater storage was evaluated using long-records of 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> data in the U.S. and modeled terrestrial water storage (TWS) was evaluated using TWS derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because CLSM does not simulate human impacts such as groundwater abstraction, this study focuses on the temporal variability of natural (excluding anthropogenic impacts) groundwater storage changes associated with atmospheric effects (precipitation and ET). However, groundwater output from WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB with human water use is also analyzed in order to assess the uncertainty associated with evaluation using 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> and satellite data which may be affected by groundwater abstractions and to provide insight on the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic groundwater variability to the total groundwater variability as groundwater depletion caused by abstraction has gained wide attention
