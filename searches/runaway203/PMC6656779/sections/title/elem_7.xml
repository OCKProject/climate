  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Groundwater is a significant source of fresh water in some of these regions and thus it is possible that certain wells were directly affected by groundwater withdrawals, despite our effort to exclude such wells. Supplementary Figs 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a> and

These results suggest that the chosen observation wells outside of Long Island and Red-LM are generally unaffected by pumping and that simulation of withdrawals does not guarantee improved correlation even where withdrawals are significant. Simulating groundwater abstractions are challenged by lack of information on irrigation water demand, efficiency, timing and duration of irrigation

In drier climates where the latency between atmospheric phenomena and groundwater responses is large, discrepancies in model physics and precipitation data may enhance the differences in simulated groundwater. In regions where snowmelt is a major source of groundwater recharge, differences in simulated snow pack among models
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span> translate to lower correlation among simulated groundwater time series. CLSM does not represent surface water and its associated recharge, resulting in lower correlation with models that do (WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB) in humid tropical and boreal river basins in which surface water is a significant part of TWS
   <span class="sup">

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To help overcome the lack of spatial coverage of well data, modeled TWS was compared with GRACE TWS. Figure

In northern Africa and northwestern China, the correlations are low, possibly due to the scarcity of 
   <span class="italic">in situ</span> observations for bias correcting and calibrating forcing data. Correlation is also reduced in regions with significant groundwater depletion such as Northern India

Despite their representation of surface water, WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB do not always show better correlation with GRACE TWS than CLSM in large river basins such as the Amazon and the Nile (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), underscoring the challenge of simulating TWS and its components. As noted previously, despite the 0.5° resolution of the GRACE TWS product we used, the effective resolution of GRACE is still around 150,000 km

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S10</a>). Both display the trough-shaped variability in PC1, suggesting strong control of precipitation on ET. EOF 2 of global CLSM ET is an apparent trend associated with increasing ET in northern Eurasia, the northeastern U.S. and Central Australia, and decreasing ET in northern South America and the Sahel. This trend only accounts for 7.3% of the total variance while most of the leading modes in the atmospheric forcing fields account for more than 20% of the total variance (see Supplementary Figs 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S8</a> and

   </span>. PC1 of CLSM groundwater exhibits the largest change in 1960s and 1970s, when PC2 of ET and PC1 of precipitation also exhibit their largest changes. These are mainly attributed to significant decrease in precipitation in the Sahel and increases in ET in northern Europe, the northeastern US and central Australia during that period. PCs of groundwater from both CLSM and WaterGAP show lower correlation with SOI than that between precipitation and SOI, reflecting the influence of other processes and fluxes on groundwater such as ET.

  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CLSM and WaterGAP groundwater trends resemble their corresponding precipitation trends in most land areas, particularly in much of Africa, eastern Asia and Northern Russia, where groundwater decreased significantly due to below normal precipitation. In the Hudson Bay and the Great Lake regions, the two models produced different trends in groundwater. This may be attributed to the fact that CLSM does not simulate surface water and its related recharge. Decreasing CLSM groundwater in much of northern Europe appears to result from increasing ET (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S11</a>), and from a combination of ET increases and precipitation decreases in east-central Asia. Northern Eurasia experienced decreased surface air pressure and, in some areas, increased wind speed (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S12</a>), both of which favor increased ET and thus decreased groundwater storage. Changes in surface air pressure in the high latitudes were noted in IPCC AR5

  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As in other analyses of this study, PCR-GLOBWB groundwater trends exhibit spatial patterns different from those of CLSM and WaterGAP (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). PCR-GLOBWB groundwater increased significantly in high altitude regions of northern South America and Iran, despite no associated increases in CRU-ERA precipitation. The model uses lapse rates derived from a high-resolution temperature climatology data to downscale CRU temperature data in order to better simulate snow dynamics. It is possible this downscaling scheme led to earlier and increased snowmelt, and hence increased groundwater recharge in those areas.

  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows that globally, CLSM and WaterGAP groundwater storage (ignoring anthropogenic effects) decreased during their respective simulation periods, consistent with the trends in their corresponding global precipitation datasets. Both time series also exhibit low frequency variability, namely a change in the mid-1980s from generally positive to generally negative anomalies, resulting in negative trends. Apparently, ET did not contribute to the negative trend in CLSM groundwater because global averaged ET was relatively stable over the simulation period with an insignificant decreasing trend (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S13</a>). Changes in other atmospheric forcing fields such as increased humidity and air pressure and decreased wind speed (see Supplementary Fig.

   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> also shows the trends of global, non-standardized annual groundwater storage anomalies (in mm year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) from three models which range from −0.01 to −2.18 mm year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>. Note that the trend in global non-standardized PCR-GLOBWB groundwater is negative, in contrast to the positive trend in the standardized time series. This is because groundwater storage anomalies in dry climate may exhibit significant trend but their contributions to the global total non-standardized groundwater storage anomalies (mm) are diminished due to their small amplitude variations (mm).

  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For comparison, global total groundwater by WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB, including anthropogenic processes, decreased significantly (Figs 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S15</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S16</a>). Global standardized PCR-GLOBWB groundwater exhibits much smaller decreasing (0.001 vs 0.002 from WaterGAP) trend, owing to the increasing trend in global PCR_GLOBWB non-anthropogenic groundwater. EOF 1 in the global anthropogenic groundwater is a trend (see Supplementary Figs 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S17</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S18</a>) mainly associated with decreases in known regions of intensive groundwater abstractions such as the Arabian Peninsula, Northern India, the North China Plain and the Great Plains

   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Once again, WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB produced drastically different rates of decline in global non-standardized anthropogenic groundwater, 46.15 and 0.35 mm year
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively (see Supplementary Figs
