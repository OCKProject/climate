  </span>; as a result, groundwater response to atmospheric effects is considerably lagged and may not be well represented by the simplified groundwater schemes in these models. PCR-GLOBWB groundwater lags and shows considerably lower correlation with

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Groundwater is a significant source of fresh water in some of these regions and thus it is possible that certain wells were directly affected by groundwater withdrawals, despite our effort to exclude such wells. Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a> show that simulating withdrawals had more persistent impacts on groundwater in Long Island where groundwater is heavily abstracted for municipal water supplies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span> and Red-LM where groundwater is abstracted to support irrigated agriculture
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, but it did not always improve the correlation with 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> observations in these two and other regions. These results suggest that the chosen observation wells outside of Long Island and Red-LM are generally unaffected by pumping and that simulation of withdrawals does not guarantee improved correlation even where withdrawals are significant. Simulating groundwater abstractions are challenged by lack of information on irrigation water demand, efficiency, timing and duration of irrigation

  </span>.

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Across the models, the correlation between WaterGAP and CLMS natural groundwater output exceeds 0.5 in most land areas except the Arabian Peninsula, the Amazon, high-mountain Asia and high latitudes of North America (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>). In drier climates where the latency between atmospheric phenomena and groundwater responses is large, discrepancies in model physics and precipitation data may enhance the differences in simulated groundwater. In regions where snowmelt is a major source of groundwater recharge, differences in simulated snow pack among models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> translate to lower correlation among simulated groundwater time series. CLSM does not represent surface water and its associated recharge, resulting in lower correlation with models that do (WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB) in humid tropical and boreal river basins in which surface water is a significant part of TWS
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. CLSM groundwater correlation with PCR-GLOBWB resemble that with WaterGAP (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>) including those areas of low correlations. WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB do not simulate natural groundwater storage changes in the Sahara Desert, hence the zero correlation between their groundwater and that of CLSM in that area.

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To help overcome the lack of spatial coverage of well data, modeled TWS was compared with GRACE TWS. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows that modeled monthly non-anthropogenic TWS anomalies generally correlate well with the observations, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.5 in large areas of North America, South America, Northern Eurasia, Southern Asia and Australia (for CLSM and PCR-GLOBWB only). In northern Africa and northwestern China, the correlations are low, possibly due to the scarcity of 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> observations for bias correcting and calibrating forcing data. Correlation is also reduced in regions with significant groundwater depletion such as Northern India
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>, which was detected by GRACE but not represented in these simulated non-anthropogenic TWS. Similarly, rapid glacier and ice cap melt in the Gulf of Alaska
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span> and the Canadian archipelago
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
  </span> are also not simulated, causing poor correlations in those areas. Negative correlation in the Congo basin may be attributed to lack of surface water in CLSM. Despite their representation of surface water, WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB do not always show better correlation with GRACE TWS than CLSM in large river basins such as the Amazon and the Nile (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), underscoring the challenge of simulating TWS and its components. As noted previously, despite the 0.5° resolution of the GRACE TWS product we used, the effective resolution of GRACE is still around 150,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> and thus small scale TWS variability not resolved by GRACE may contribute to diminished correlation with the models. Indeed, CLSM TWS exhibits much higher correlation (&gt;0.6) with GRACE TWS when averaged over large basins

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulating human water use in WaterGAP and PCR-GLOBWB led to improved correlation with GRACE TWS (see Supplementary Figs 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>) in most regions where excessive groundwater withdrawals have led to groundwater depletion such as Northern India, the Middle East and the North China Plain. In the Great Plains, recharge from ephemeral playas may lead to overestimation of irrigation water requirement in these models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> and hence degraded correlation with GRACE TWS. Overall, simulating withdrawals and water management changed the correlation of simulated TWS and with GRACE TWS by more than 0.02 in about 10% of the 1° grid cells over the global land area (excluding Antarctic and the Greenland,). This highlights the importance of evaluating non-anthropogenic TWS using GRACE data as in Fig.
