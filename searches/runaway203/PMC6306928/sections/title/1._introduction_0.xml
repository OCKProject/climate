 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Schistosomiasis, caused by trematode parasites with a predilection for intestinal and urogenital venous circulation in the human definitive host, is one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) selected for increased attention by the World Health Organization (WHO) [
  <a rid="B1-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-tropicalmed-03-00117">1</a>]. Six different species of 
  <span class="italic">Schistosoma</span> are capable of infecting humans, each depending on a certain snail species as an intermediate host. Humans infect snails by depositing parasite eggs (excreted in feces or urine) in waterlogged areas and humans are infected or reinfected when in contact with water containing schistosome cercariae released from infected snails. The disease is generally chronic, although schistosomiasis is often a contributing factor to premature death, direct mortality is comparatively low. Transmission of schistosomiasis has been reported in 78 countries and more than 800 million people in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia live in areas endemic to schistosomiasis [
  <a rid="B2-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-tropicalmed-03-00117">2</a>], with up to 250 million actually infected [
  <a rid="B3-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-tropicalmed-03-00117">3</a>]. Chemotherapy in amounts sufficient for more than 100 million school age children per year has been pledged by the private sector and development partners, but there is still a large discrepancy between the number of people requiring preventive treatment and those actually receiving it [
  <a rid="B4-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-tropicalmed-03-00117">4</a>]. In addition, the number of people suffering from this infection continues to rise as a reflection of ongoing population growth, which is particularly high in endemic areas. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Schistosomiasis is not as neglected as many other tropical diseases since it has a large research focus and still remains one of the most prevalent infections in the world, estimated to correspond to 4.5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by the WHO Expert Committee in 2002 [
  <a rid="B5-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-tropicalmed-03-00117">5</a>]. However, this estimate was based on a wider range of pathologies than that used in the global burden of disease (GBD) study of 1990 [
  <a rid="B6-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-tropicalmed-03-00117">6</a>]. It was also higher than the updated GBD in 2010 [
  <a rid="B7-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-tropicalmed-03-00117">7</a>] that put the burden of schistosomiasis at 3.3 million DALYs. Importantly, however, the GBD figure of 2010 was high enough to put this disease as no. 3 after malaria and tuberculosis on the NTD list [
  <a rid="B3-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-tropicalmed-03-00117">3</a>]. This increase was due to the inclusion of diarrhea, dysuria and anemia in the DALY score which was not counted before. While later updates [
  <a rid="B8-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-tropicalmed-03-00117">8</a>] show a sharply lower DALY score for schistosomiasis, other authors [
  <a rid="B9-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-tropicalmed-03-00117">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-tropicalmed-03-00117">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-tropicalmed-03-00117">11</a>] hold that the true impact of this disease is several-fold higher because of the low weight given by the GBD estimates to subtle symptoms and pathology in individuals with infections too light to be revealed by diagnostics based on parasite egg-detection. Indeed, high-definition circulating antigen tests, such as the point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) assay indicates that the current number of infections may be at least 10 times higher than that shown by egg-detection [
  <a rid="B12-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-tropicalmed-03-00117">12</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The epidemiology of schistosomiasis (and that of all other organisms) must be seen in the light of the perceived ongoing climate change. The latest half century has seen signs of global warming, mainly thought to be due to the burning of coal and oil at an increasingly large scale. From 1990, reports relevant for our understanding of climate change, including options for its mitigation, are regularly produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [
  <a rid="B13-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-tropicalmed-03-00117">13</a>] for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). IPCC bases its assessments on the published, scientific literature and opinions of invited independent researchers. An important part of its work is to do with global circulation models (GCMs), which are currently used to predict the climate for the next 80 years based on complex mathematical representations of the Earth’s energy balance between atmosphere, total land mass, sea and ice cover. These components interact as a coupled system, whose status emerges from equations based on the dynamic values of various climate variables, e.g., temperature, winds, etc., at each point on the globe. Climate modelling uses current and historic data to attempt the prediction of future climate scenarios from the present time to the end of the 21st century. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projections of the GCMs disagree due to various forms of natural variability included in the models. Fortuitously, this variability can be reduced by averaging an ensemble of simulations, resulting in universal agreement. Generally, such averaged model ensembles produce simulations of current and past large-scale climates that agree with observation. Further confidence comes from the fact that converging GCMs also produce an accurate ‘hindcast’ of previous climate change that took place in the 1900s. Evidence is already available in the form of a rising average global temperature and amplified warming of air and oceans, particularly in the Arctic, leading to rising sea levels, dry places becoming dryer and wet places wetter. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact, temperature changes impact snail distributions in general as well as the maturation of the intermediate stages of the parasite inside this intermediate host, makes a discussion of future changes in the distribution of schistosomiasis complex. However, it is useful to know that water temperature below freezing puts an absolute limit to snail survival. Indeed, the climate-dependent, long-term (as opposed to seasonal) movements of the ‘frost line’ at northern latitudes indicates a diffuse zone north of which schistosomiasis transmission cannot occur. Immediately south of this zone, transmission is governed by the prevailing temperature and the time it stays above a certain limit, a fact rooted in the relationship between the development of plants and the ambient temperature first mentioned in the 1700s by Réaumur who coined the ‘degree-day unit’ and used it as a measure of crop maturation [
  <a rid="B14-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-tropicalmed-03-00117">14</a>]. This unit, now called the growing degree-day (GDD), is defined as the amount of heat an organism needs to accumulate to achieve full development. Although its main application remains in agriculture, the GDD concept has also been used for predicting the development of parasites [
  <a rid="B15-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-tropicalmed-03-00117">15</a>], monitoring snail replication as well as the maturation of the schistosome sporocyst stages inside the snail [
  <a rid="B16-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-tropicalmed-03-00117">16</a>,
  <a rid="B17-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-tropicalmed-03-00117">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of temperature alterations with regard to the potential distribution of schistosomiasis has been addressed in China [
  <a rid="B17-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-tropicalmed-03-00117">17</a>,
  <a rid="B18-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-tropicalmed-03-00117">18</a>,
  <a rid="B19-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-tropicalmed-03-00117">19</a>] and Africa [
  <a rid="B20-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-tropicalmed-03-00117">20</a>,
  <a rid="B21-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-tropicalmed-03-00117">21</a>], but a global picture of potential long-term transmission alterations ascribed to climate change is still missing. To address this question, we felt that it was warranted to theorize about the intermediate- and long-term global distribution possibilities of this disease considering possible future dispersion of the intermediate snail host into non-endemic areas. The IPCC focuses a lot on temperature predictions and this variable has a strong influence on snail survival. Importantly, even minor temperature increases play a role if they cover a sufficiently long period of the annual cycle. For these reasons, we used GDD as the key parameter to evaluate the potential, future transmission risk of schistosomiasis.
