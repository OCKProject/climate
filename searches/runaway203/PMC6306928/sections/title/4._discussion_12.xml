 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three schistosome species pose the main infection risk for humans. 
  <span class="italic">S. japonicum</span> is the single schistosome species in China, the Philippines and three closely situated small foci in Celebes, Indonesia. It is transmitted by 
  <span class="italic">Oncomelania</span> snails, whose latitudinal movements over land during most of the last million years may have been prevented by the development of the Himalaya plateau serving as a barrier. The endemic areas for 
  <span class="italic">S. mansoni</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. haematobium</span> overlap to a great extent on the African continent and in the Middle East, but not everywhere. The former, the most abundant of the schistosome species, has also found an exclusive niche in the Northeast part of South America and on some of the Caribbean islands but are now disappearing from the latter, however this is not due to climate change [
  <a rid="B29-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-tropicalmed-03-00117">29</a>]. Its distribution is supported by the broad geographic range of 
  <span class="italic">Biomphalaria</span> spp. snails that serve as obligatory hosts for its larval stages. Recently, however, 
  <span class="italic">Bi. straminea</span> has been identified in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Shenzhen City in the Guangdong Province of China and has remained there since the 1970s [
  <a rid="B30-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-tropicalmed-03-00117">30</a>], a fact that could eventually result in transmission of 
  <span class="italic">S. mansoni</span> in parallel with 
  <span class="italic">S. japonicum</span> in China. 
  <span class="italic">S. haematobium</span> is confined to Africa and the Middle East due to its reliance on 
  <span class="italic">Bulinus</span> spp. intermediate snail hosts [
  <a rid="B31-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-tropicalmed-03-00117">31</a>]. Although this schistosome species must also have been brought from Africa to Latin America during the slave trade of the 16th and 17th century, only 
  <span class="italic">S. mansoni</span> became established there because of the absence of 
  <span class="italic">Bulinus</span> snails. Although this information indicates that schistosome species and their specific snails can spread into various new areas, this is not of a magnitude that requires it to be considered when discussing the risk for schistosomiasis due to temperature augmentation. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the potential impact of climate change on the transmission of schistosomiasis in the world we developed a biological model using available data from the literature. Compared to 
  <span class="italic">S. japonicum</span>, both 
  <span class="italic">S. mansoni</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. haematobium</span> required less total heat energy to complete one generation [
  <a rid="B17-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-tropicalmed-03-00117">17</a>,
  <a rid="B25-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-tropicalmed-03-00117">25</a>,
  <a rid="B26-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-tropicalmed-03-00117">26</a>]. Therefore, the transmission intensity of the two latter species is generally somewhat stronger than that of 
  <span class="italic">S. japonicum</span>. However, the three different intermediate snail hosts had different temperature thresholds for survival that came into play in certain geographical areas. For example, the distribution of the 
  <span class="italic">Oncomelania</span> snail, utilized by 
  <span class="italic">S. japonicum</span>, was constrained by the temperature in January (when below 0 °C), which effectively limited its progress northwards, while 
  <span class="italic">Biomphalaria</span> (
  <span class="italic">S. mansoni</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">Bulinus</span> (
  <span class="italic">S. haematobium</span>) had thermal requirements that included an annual

  <a rid="B27-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-tropicalmed-03-00117">27</a>], which is one of the factors (so far) keeping these snails from entering Europe and other northern territories. Interestingly, 
  <span class="italic">S. haematobium</span> appears to have a better chance of a foothold in Europe than 
  <span class="italic">S. mansoni</span>, at least in the middle part of the century (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-03-00117-f003" href="#tropicalmed-03-00117-f003">Figure 3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With respect to snail survival, the GDD approach in 2008 predicted an extension of 662,373 and 783,883 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> potentially endemic areas for schistosomiasis japonica in China in 2030 and 2050, respectively [
  <a rid="B17-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-tropicalmed-03-00117">17</a>]. Yang et al. noted that the 0–1 °C January isotherm of 1971–2000 had already shifted from 33°15′ N to 33°41′ N compared to the 1961–1990 baseline, expanding the area by 41,335 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, resulting in an additional 20.7 million people at risk of schistosomiasis in China [
  <a rid="B32-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-tropicalmed-03-00117">32</a>]. For 
  <span class="italic">S. japonicum</span>, the predicted temperature increases based on our biological model and the average ensemble of the five GCM models would result in transmission starting to extend northward by 2050 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-03-00117-f002" href="#tropicalmed-03-00117-f002">Figure 2</a>a) adding a considerably larger margin by 2100 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-03-00117-f002" href="#tropicalmed-03-00117-f002">Figure 2</a>b). It is also conceivable that the transmission intensity will increase in areas already endemic for schistosomiasis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important for the existence or absence of the parasite and vital for prediction model validation that more information is made available also for 
  <span class="italic">S. mansoni</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. haematobium</span>. However, the change in the geographic transmission region for these two species due to climate change is more complex than in China. With temperatures increasing above

  </div>, the historic transmission areas surrounding the Sahara region would retreat from the equator reducing the transmission regions of both species. However, the current risk areas would extend further into the northern or southern current marginal transmission areas, including the Mediterranean countries. Indeed, schistosomiasis hematobia has recently been identified in Corsica, France [
  <a rid="B33-tropicalmed-03-00117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-tropicalmed-03-00117">33</a>]. Although it is questionable whether this extension into Europe is due to climate change, rather large areas of southern Europe will become habitable for the snail hosts in the future (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-03-00117-f003" href="#tropicalmed-03-00117-f003">Figure 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-03-00117-f004" href="#tropicalmed-03-00117-f004">Figure 4</a>). Overall, however, the total transmission areas should be reduced. The changing transmission patterns in terms of region and intensity are heterogeneous and new populations at risk will probably appear. Further research is warranted to work out the geographical probabilities. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A limitation of our current modelling approach is that it emphasizes the role of temperature but does not take into account the role of rainfall and the potential interaction between temperature and rainfall. It is difficult to say whether our model is conservative or whether these additional effects might further amplify the extent of changes predicted on the basis of temperature alone. Thus, recent improvements in modelling global trends in precipitation and water availability should become an integral part of present and future predictions of climate change and variability on infectious disease dynamics, including schistosomiasis. Recent years have seen widespread massive flooding, which can lead to snail dispersal and an epidemic outbreak of schistosomiasis if occurring in or close to endemic areas. In addition, the issue of altitude, that has been neglected so far, might under-evaluate changing transmission patterns in mountainous regions, which would have major implications for parts of China and many African countries. Additionally, most climate studies, including the current one, discuss large geographical scales, i.e., national, regional and global levels. To capture localized climate changes, regional climate models are needed that can assign meteorological parameters at relatively small scales also. Such climate models can provide information with useful local detail including realistic extreme events and generate detailed projections of the future climate. Any discussion of the future distribution of schistosomiasis, presumed to be induced by climate change would be futile without exact information of the prevailing distribution of the infection, both in humans and in the intermediate snail host. It is therefore critical that the diagnostic techniques applied are sensitive enough to find even the lightest infection. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This work is based on the best possible models available today on the future climate for the rest of the century. Without a doubt, however, future increased computing power will permit more comprehensive simulations, better represented parameterized processes and more accurate projections at all levels, which might well result in slightly different projections. In addition, natural phenomena, such as cataclysmic volcanic eruptions like that which occurred in Krakatoa in 1883, major meteoric hits, etc., that would completely upend any prediction of the kind discussed here cannot be completely ruled out. Even without such events, we still expect further changes in the forthcoming 6th assessment report (AR6) scheduled for release in 2022.</p>
