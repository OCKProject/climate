 <p id="p0200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reporting GHG emissions footprints as only the total GWP
  <sub>100</sub> CO
  <sub>2</sub>e loses important information on their composition of different GHGs, which greatly limits our ability to make meaningful comparisons or investigate the climate impacts of different products or production systems.
 </p>
 <p id="p0205" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The resulting lack of clear climate inference can be illustrated by considering beef GHG footprints in relation to crude oil combustion (as a reference activity that primarily emits CO
  <sub>2</sub>). Taking just a single footprint of 1.59 kg CO
  <sub>2</sub>, 0.43 kg CH
  <sub>4</sub> and 0.012 kg N
  <sub>2</sub>O, the average emissions across all systems this review, the GWP
  <sub>100</sub> footprint of 16.81 kg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e would suggest that producing 1 kg of cattle liveweight is equivalent to the combustion of approximately 6 l of crude oil
  <a rid="fn0005" ref-type="fn" href="#fn0005">1</a>. These same emissions could also be considered equivalent to the CO
  <sub>2</sub> emitted from burning from 2 to 15 l of crude oil using either the GTP
  <sub>100</sub> or GWP
  <sub>20</sub> CO
  <sub>2</sub>e footprints, respectively, or anywhere between under alternative time-horizons. All of these values are a technically accurate description of the climate response to these emissions, representing different concepts of ‘carbon dioxide equivalence’ for their given timescales. The most meaningful or useful approach will depend on the specific questions posed or climate policy ambitions. No single metric that treats short- and long-lived GHGs in the same way can fully capture their different climate dynamics. Nor can we work backwards to infer these effects from a single aggregated CO
  <sub>2</sub>e footprint.
 </p>
 <p id="p0210" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many have questioned the utility of GWP
  <sub>100</sub> CO
  <sub>2</sub>e footprints as a climate metric (see introduction), and as GWP
  <sub>100</sub> is not necessarily related to either climate impacts or policy goals, relying on this metric may result in misleading or incomplete conclusions (
  <a rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0015">Allen et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0050">Cherubini et al., 2016</a>). Including alternative metrics and/or comparing multiple time-horizons has been recommended as a means for LCA studies to consider the implications of different choices and provide greater transparency (
  <a rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0050">Cherubini et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0165">Levasseur et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0150">Jolliet et al., 2018</a>). Despite this, it was only possible to derive separate emissions data from a relatively small proportion (29%) of published cradle-to-grave beef footprints, and only one study in this review, 
  <a rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0235">Picasso et al. (2014)</a>, considered an alternative metric (GTP
  <sub>100</sub>) in addition to GWP
  <sub>100</sub>.
 </p>
 <p id="p0215" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 20- and 100-year variants of GWP and GTP demonstrated here illustrate part of a wider debate around GHG metric choice and the most appropriate means of describing the climate impacts of different gases (or activities that emit them). It has been argued that using a 100-year time-horizon to indicate ‘long-term’ warming results in significant undervaluation of the impacts of CO
  <sub>2</sub> relative to other gases, as its atmospheric lifespan extends well beyond 100 years (
  <a rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0240">Pierrehumbert, 2014</a>). Conversely, if metrics are based on too distant a time-horizon we may minimise long-term impacts but overshoot near-term climate goals. An alternative dynamic use of GTP, where the time horizon is determined by a specified target year (
  <a rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0280">Shine et al., 2007</a>), as demonstrated for beef footprints in 
  <a rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0230">Persson et al. (2015)</a>, shows one potential means of better linking metrics to policy goals. A modified use of GWP, GWP*, that relates a change in rate of emissions of short-lived gases (i.e. CH
  <sub>4</sub>) to cumulative total emissions of long-lived gases (N
  <sub>2</sub>O and CO
  <sub>2</sub>) has been suggested as a more useful means of equating their climate impacts (
  <a rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0015">Allen et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0020">Allen et al., 2018</a>). Carbon dioxide equivalence metrics can also be dispensed with altogether, using individual GHG emissions from agricultural production in climate models (
  <a rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0245">Pierrehumbert and Eshel, 2015</a>). Comparing a greater range of metrics or climate modelling were beyond the scope of this review, but highlight the same fundamental principle, as disaggregated emissions would be required to explore any of these alternatives.
 </p>
 <p id="p0220" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As well as significantly changing the apparent emissions intensity of beef production in relation to other climate polluting activities, the relative emissions efficiency of different types of cattle system is also influenced by metric choice. It has been demonstrated that for New Zealand dairy production, metrics such as GTP
  <sub>100</sub> that value CH
  <sub>4</sub> relatively less highly favour low-input systems, as the increased animal CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions that can result from lower-intensity production are more than offset by lower emissions of longer-lived gases (
  <a rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0260">Reisinger and Ledgard, 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0265">Reisinger et al., 2017</a>). This trend was demonstrated in some instances here, but there were few clear trends between different gases overall. While 
  <a rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0265">Reisinger et al. (2017)</a> found reasonable homogeneity and broadly consistent ranking among their sample of Waikato dairy farms, the geographic and system type variation in this review meant that few overarching patterns were observed. Although some dynamics are universal and can be assumed (e.g. longer time horizons will always give lower CO
  <sub>2</sub>e values for CH
  <sub>4</sub>), the highly system specific emissions of individual GHGs (and relationships between them) suggest we cannot reliably infer climate impacts without disaggregated data. In the context of the simple comparison of grass and non-grass fed systems presented here, there were indications that the apparently optimum form of production is dependent on metric, but the nature of current emissions reporting leaves us ill-equipped to fully interrogate the topic, despite significant public interest and a number of studies exploring the issue.
 </p>
 <p id="p0225" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if limiting assessment to differences in GWP
  <sub>100</sub> CO
  <sub>2</sub>e footprints (or any other single metric), without the emissions of individual gases it becomes impossible to standardise footprints published at different times as the CO
  <sub>2</sub>e conversion factors are revised. 
  <a rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0175">McAuliffe et al. (2018)</a> provides a rare acknowledgement of this, demonstrating in a recent beef cattle production study that using the newer conversion factors significantly increased the apparent emissions intensity in some systems due to the greater GWP
  <sub>100</sub> value for CH
  <sub>4</sub>, as observed for the harmonised AR5 footprints in this review. Metric values are updated between different assessment reports as atmospheric conditions change and further climate research is incorporated. Recent research has indicated an upwards revision of the radiative efficiency of methane, which would result in increased CO
  <sub>2</sub>e conversion factors (
  <a rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0095">Etminan et al., 2016</a>). Hence it is likely that current footprinting studies will again become irreversibly outdated following the next IPCC assessment report unless their emissions are available in disaggregated form. In addition, it has been argued that climate‑carbon feedbacks should potentially be included in standard CO
  <sub>2</sub>e metrics (
  <a rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0120">Gasser et al., 2017</a>), and incorporated in climate change indicators in environmental impact assessments (
  <a rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0150">Jolliet et al., 2018</a>). Updating past studies to include these feedbacks would also require disaggregated emissions data.
