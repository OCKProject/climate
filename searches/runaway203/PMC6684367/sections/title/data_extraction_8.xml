 <p id="p0100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevant data were collated into a database for those studies that met the inclusion criteria. Paper details (lead author, year of publication and manuscript title) and a short description of the beef production system were included for each footprint. Where sufficient dietary information was available, systems were classified by predominant post-weaning diet, defined as either grass fed or non-grass fed depending on whether at least 50% (by dry matter) of their diet was grass-based (including grazing, silage, or hay); as opposed to typical non-grass feeds of grains, maize silage and soy. This diet categorisation is an extension of the concentrate or roughage classification used by 
  <a rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0075">de Vries et al. (2015)</a>, with ‘grass-fed’ distinct from ‘roughage’ due to the exclusion of maize silage.
 </p>
 <p id="p0105" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The continent and country of each system was recorded, defined by endpoint if production spanned multiple countries. Due to the small number of data-points for many regions and sub-groups, these data were not used in analyses. The sample size (no. farms) of each footprint was also recorded, with 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 0 denoting that the study was based on a simulated and/or representative system. Where papers included multiple footprints over time, either the most recent or only those based on farm management data (c.f. more speculative scenarios) were recorded.
 </p>
 <p id="p0110" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emission details were then recorded. A preliminary assessment identified finished cattle liveweight as the most common output measure, so this was adopted as the standard output unit. Conversions were undertaken for studies that reported carcass weights. If the paper reported its own dressing percentage this was used to convert back to liveweight, otherwise region-specific standards from 
  <a rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0220">Opio et al. (2013, Table B20)</a> were used.
 </p>
 <p id="p0115" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the emissions themselves, the CO
  <sub>2</sub>e conversion factors used in the paper were first recorded, either based on the IPCC Assessment Report quoted or the paper's reporting of individual CH
  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O GWPs. Where different gases were expressed only as CO
  <sub>2</sub>e or a proportion of a total CO
  <sub>2</sub>e footprint they were converted back to quantities of individual gases. Harmonised CO
  <sub>2</sub>e footprints were generated using the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) 20- and 100-year GWP and GTP conversion factors (
  <a rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0200">Myhre et al., 2013</a>). Where studies explicitly included land-use change emissions or sequestrations these were also recorded, however as they were not presented for most footprints and were not possible to standardise, these data were not included in analyses.
