 <p id="p0230" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A growing body of research attempts to describe the impacts of current and projected diets (e.g 
  <a rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0305">Tilman and Clark, 2014</a>), and suggest what changes might be necessary to keep the required agricultural production within sustainable limits (e.g. 
  <a rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0290">Springmann et al., 2018</a>). Extending the dynamics described above, moving beyond GWP
  <sub>100</sub> would provide a more detailed and meaningful appraisal of the climate impacts of agriculture and more clearly relate emissions to given time-frames and goals. Considerations around GHG metrics are also especially prominent in light of the Paris Agreement, given its focus on temperature targets and (currently) unspecified choice of metric (

 <p id="p0235" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reviews such as this must consider the limitations of averaging or comparing individual footprints across multiple studies, given the very large ranges in results, differences in LCA methodologies, and difficulties in confirming the representativeness of a given study. While these difficulties are acknowledged, the exploratory nature of this study, strict inclusion criteria and harmonisation are suggested as justifying the approaches presented here, which are also in keeping with the wider literature (e.g. reviews of food product GHG footprints such as 
  <a rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0060">Clune et al., 2017</a>, and food system sustainability studies as above). This highlights the somewhat contradictory positions of agricultural environmental impact assessment and food system sustainability research where, for example, reviews of only beef footprints can be deemed too broad to combine individual results (
  <a rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0075">de Vries et al., 2015</a>), but large-scale global dietary models aggregate and compare results from hugely disparate food product footprints (
  <a rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0305">Tilman and Clark, 2014</a>). Agricultural product footprinting studies need to be adequately standardised so that we can reliably compare ‘apples to kangaroos’ (
  <a rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0130">Hawkins et al., 2016</a>), yet the difficulty in standardising even across a single product illustrates the challenges in achieving this. In addition to the primary message to report disaggregated GHG emissions, this paper reiterates calls for wider improvements and standardisation in agricultural LCAs, including the need for more transparent and location-specific databases and emission factors, and consistent methods and system boundaries (
  <a rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0205">Notarnicola et al., 2017</a>; 
  <a rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0005">Adewale et al., 2018</a>). As demonstrated here, for example, even in otherwise complete cradle to farm gate beef LCAs, it was not possible to standardise the treatment of land-use emissions and/or sequestrations, highlighting a particular difficulty in the context of ruminant livestock environmental impact assessments.
