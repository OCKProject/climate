 <p id="p0185" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate some of the implications of these dynamics for the apparent emissions efficiency of different systems, GWP
  <sub>100</sub> and GTP
  <sub>100</sub> footprints were compared for a number of studies containing multiple footprints, and hence guaranteed methodological standardisation (
  <a rid="f0035" ref-type="fig" href="#f0035">Fig. 7</a>). As would be expected, GTP
  <sub>100</sub> resulted in universally lower footprints than GWP
  <sub>100</sub>. In many cases the relative rankings of each system were the same under both metrics, but the proportional improvement between systems could still show significant differences; for example in the study of 
  <a rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0035">Buratti et al. (2017)</a>, using GTP
  <sub>100</sub> the non-grass fed system appears to be marginally more emissions efficient, but its apparent increase in efficiency is much more pronounced under GWP
  <sub>100</sub>. In some cases metric choice determined the relative ranking of different systems. For example in 
  <a rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0310">Tsutsumi et al. (2018)</a> the ‘conventional’ system had the lowest GWP
  <sub>100</sub>, footprint, as the cattle were fed a large proportion of concentrates, resulting in lower CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions. These concentrates, however, were associated with significant CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions from their growth in and transport from the USA. The two alternative systems feeding farm-grown roughage had much lower CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions at the expense of more CH
  <sub>4</sub>. As GTP
  <sub>100</sub> values CH
  <sub>4</sub> much less strongly than GWP
  <sub>100</sub>, the apparently superior emissions efficiency of the conventional over grass-fed systems was reversed.
