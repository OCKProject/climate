 <p id="p0090" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Systematic review design and reporting were undertaken following the PRISMA checklist (
  <a rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0190">Moher et al., 2009</a>). The search string ‘(beef OR cow OR cattle) AND (emissions OR greenhouse OR GHG) AND (LCA OR “life cycle”)’ was searched for in the Sciencedirect, Pubmed and Web of Science online indexing and database services in March 2018. All studies found through these databases were screened for relevance based on title. Relevant titles were then screened by abstract, and the full text was then reviewed.

 <p id="p0095" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the full paper inspection stage, a number of criteria had to be met to standardise systems included. Beef LCAs that were linked with dairy production (either from culled dairy cows or calves transferred to beef cattle systems) were excluded in order to standardise system types and avoid different dairy-beef co-product allocations (
  <a rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0270">Rice et al., 2017</a>). Only bottom-up studies of either real farms or detailed representative systems based on regional/national averages were included; footprints based on proposed/emerging mitigations or top-down approaches, including input-output LCA and global modelling, were excluded. System boundaries had to cover complete cradle to farm gate emissions. Emissions had to be expressed (or expressible) per unit of finished beef. Finally, to fulfil the main objective of this paper, individual emissions of CH
  <sub>4</sub>, N
  <sub>2</sub>O and CO
  <sub>2</sub> needed to be retrievable, either reported in quantities of individual gases, or relative proportions of a final CO
  <sub>2</sub>e footprint. If a study was excluded only due to insufficient GHG disaggregation, the corresponding author was emailed to request this extra GHG breakdown, with two months to receive responses before final analyses were undertaken.
