 <p id="p0145" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The systematic review resulted in a total of 76 individual beef GHG footprints from 22 peer-reviewed papers (
  <a rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" href="#f0005">Fig. 1</a>). Of most importance to this review, a large number (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 55) of studies were excluded as GHG emissions were not reported with sufficient disaggregation, and so the necessary data could not be obtained from the CO
  <sub>2</sub>e footprint(s) as published.

 <p id="p0150" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Papers generally used an attributional LCA approach (although this was rarely explicitly stated). In two included studies (

  <a rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0225">Parajuli et al., 2018</a>), a system expansion approach was used to remove manure emissions where they displaced fertiliser application, but these emissions were re-included in footprints to standardise with other papers in this review.
