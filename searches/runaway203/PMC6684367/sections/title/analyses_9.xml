 <p id="p0120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simple summary statistics were used to demonstrate the range in emissions for individual gases and aggregated total CO
  <sub>2</sub>e emissions derived using 20- and 100-year variants of GWP and GTP.
 </p>
 <p id="p0125" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relationships between individual gas emissions were explored using the Kendall rank correlation coefficient. Tied rankings were adjusted for using Kendall's tau-b. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied.</p>
 <p id="p0130" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of harmonising footprints to AR5 GWP
  <sub>100</sub> was investigated by comparing harmonised CO
  <sub>2</sub>e values with those reported in the original papers using a paired Wilcoxon signed rank test. Kendall's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess relationships between all individual footprints, comparing correlations between GWP
  <sub>100</sub> against GTP
  <sub>100</sub>, and GTP
  <sub>20</sub> against GTP
  <sub>100</sub>. Mann-Whitney 
  <span class="italic">U</span> tests were used to compare the two dietary groups, comparing all three individual gases and total GWP
  <sub>100</sub> and GTP
  <sub>100</sub> footprints.

 <p id="p0135" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses were performed using R (
  <a rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0250">R Core Team, 2018</a>) and the ‘Kendall’ package (

 <p id="p0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No weightings were applied in averaging or comparing across studies, as there was no adequate means of assigning universal weighting factors. This risks pseudo-replication, particularly where multiple footprints from individual studies rely on some shared data, but was deemed necessary to cover a sufficient range of systems and not omit useful comparisons. As a result of this limitation, and further concerns over the aggregation of independent LCA studies (discussed below), the results presented here should be considered an illustration of the types of issues arising from the lack of disaggregated GHG data, rather than a reliable demonstration of what having these data can resolve.</p>
