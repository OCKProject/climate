  <p id="p0090" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Systematic review design and reporting were undertaken following the PRISMA checklist (
   <a rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0190">Moher et al., 2009</a>). The search string ‘(beef OR cow OR cattle) AND (emissions OR greenhouse OR GHG) AND (LCA OR “life cycle”)’ was searched for in the Sciencedirect, Pubmed and Web of Science online indexing and database services in March 2018. All studies found through these databases were screened for relevance based on title. Relevant titles were then screened by abstract, and the full text was then reviewed.

  <p id="p0095" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the full paper inspection stage, a number of criteria had to be met to standardise systems included. Beef LCAs that were linked with dairy production (either from culled dairy cows or calves transferred to beef cattle systems) were excluded in order to standardise system types and avoid different dairy-beef co-product allocations (
   <a rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0270">Rice et al., 2017</a>). Only bottom-up studies of either real farms or detailed representative systems based on regional/national averages were included; footprints based on proposed/emerging mitigations or top-down approaches, including input-output LCA and global modelling, were excluded. System boundaries had to cover complete cradle to farm gate emissions. Emissions had to be expressed (or expressible) per unit of finished beef. Finally, to fulfil the main objective of this paper, individual emissions of CH
   <sub>4</sub>, N
   <sub>2</sub>O and CO
   <sub>2</sub> needed to be retrievable, either reported in quantities of individual gases, or relative proportions of a final CO
   <sub>2</sub>e footprint. If a study was excluded only due to insufficient GHG disaggregation, the corresponding author was emailed to request this extra GHG breakdown, with two months to receive responses before final analyses were undertaken.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data extraction</div>
  <p id="p0100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relevant data were collated into a database for those studies that met the inclusion criteria. Paper details (lead author, year of publication and manuscript title) and a short description of the beef production system were included for each footprint. Where sufficient dietary information was available, systems were classified by predominant post-weaning diet, defined as either grass fed or non-grass fed depending on whether at least 50% (by dry matter) of their diet was grass-based (including grazing, silage, or hay); as opposed to typical non-grass feeds of grains, maize silage and soy. This diet categorisation is an extension of the concentrate or roughage classification used by 
   <a rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0075">de Vries et al. (2015)</a>, with ‘grass-fed’ distinct from ‘roughage’ due to the exclusion of maize silage.
  </p>
  <p id="p0105" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The continent and country of each system was recorded, defined by endpoint if production spanned multiple countries. Due to the small number of data-points for many regions and sub-groups, these data were not used in analyses. The sample size (no. farms) of each footprint was also recorded, with 
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 0 denoting that the study was based on a simulated and/or representative system. Where papers included multiple footprints over time, either the most recent or only those based on farm management data (c.f. more speculative scenarios) were recorded.
  </p>
  <p id="p0110" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emission details were then recorded. A preliminary assessment identified finished cattle liveweight as the most common output measure, so this was adopted as the standard output unit. Conversions were undertaken for studies that reported carcass weights. If the paper reported its own dressing percentage this was used to convert back to liveweight, otherwise region-specific standards from 
   <a rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0220">Opio et al. (2013, Table B20)</a> were used.
  </p>
  <p id="p0115" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the emissions themselves, the CO
   <sub>2</sub>e conversion factors used in the paper were first recorded, either based on the IPCC Assessment Report quoted or the paper's reporting of individual CH
   <sub>4</sub> and N
   <sub>2</sub>O GWPs. Where different gases were expressed only as CO
   <sub>2</sub>e or a proportion of a total CO
   <sub>2</sub>e footprint they were converted back to quantities of individual gases. Harmonised CO
   <sub>2</sub>e footprints were generated using the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) 20- and 100-year GWP and GTP conversion factors (
   <a rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0200">Myhre et al., 2013</a>). Where studies explicitly included land-use change emissions or sequestrations these were also recorded, however as they were not presented for most footprints and were not possible to standardise, these data were not included in analyses.

  <p id="p0120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simple summary statistics were used to demonstrate the range in emissions for individual gases and aggregated total CO
   <sub>2</sub>e emissions derived using 20- and 100-year variants of GWP and GTP.
  </p>
  <p id="p0125" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relationships between individual gas emissions were explored using the Kendall rank correlation coefficient. Tied rankings were adjusted for using Kendall's tau-b. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied.</p>
  <p id="p0130" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of harmonising footprints to AR5 GWP
   <sub>100</sub> was investigated by comparing harmonised CO
   <sub>2</sub>e values with those reported in the original papers using a paired Wilcoxon signed rank test. Kendall's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess relationships between all individual footprints, comparing correlations between GWP
   <sub>100</sub> against GTP
   <sub>100</sub>, and GTP
   <sub>20</sub> against GTP
   <sub>100</sub>. Mann-Whitney 
   <span class="italic">U</span> tests were used to compare the two dietary groups, comparing all three individual gases and total GWP
   <sub>100</sub> and GTP
   <sub>100</sub> footprints.
  </p>
  <p id="p0135" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses were performed using R (
   <a rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0250">R Core Team, 2018</a>) and the ‘Kendall’ package (
   <a rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr" href="#bb0185">McLeod, 2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="p0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No weightings were applied in averaging or comparing across studies, as there was no adequate means of assigning universal weighting factors. This risks pseudo-replication, particularly where multiple footprints from individual studies rely on some shared data, but was deemed necessary to cover a sufficient range of systems and not omit useful comparisons. As a result of this limitation, and further concerns over the aggregation of independent LCA studies (discussed below), the results presented here should be considered an illustration of the types of issues arising from the lack of disaggregated GHG data, rather than a reliable demonstration of what having these data can resolve.</p>
