   <sub>100</sub> footprints were compared for a number of studies containing multiple footprints, and hence guaranteed methodological standardisation (

   <sub>100</sub> resulted in universally lower footprints than GWP

   <sub>100</sub> the non-grass fed system appears to be marginally more emissions efficient, but its apparent increase in efficiency is much more pronounced under GWP

   <sub>2</sub> emissions from their growth in and transport from the USA. The two alternative systems feeding farm-grown roughage had much lower CO

   <sub>2</sub>e footprints for grass fed and non-grass fed systems were compared to establish whether, across all-studies, feed-type altered the balance of different GHG emissions such that relative performance changed according to metric choice (
   <a rid="f0045" ref-type="fig" href="#f0045">Fig. 9</a>). The most emissions efficient grass-fed systems were optimal under either metric, but there was an overall trend for grass-fed systems to have larger CO
   <sub>2</sub>e footprints under GWP
   <sub>100</sub>, while they tended to have lower footprints than non-grass fed systems under GTP
   <sub>100</sub>. However, the differences in CO
   <sub>2</sub>e footprint between feed types were not significant under either metric (GWP100:
