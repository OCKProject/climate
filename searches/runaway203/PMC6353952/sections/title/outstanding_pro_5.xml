 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The previous section highlights a number of advances that are required to further our understanding of the long-term evolution of the AIS and the role of changing topography. These include the development of more sophisticated numerical models that consider feedbacks between ice dynamics, glacial erosion, isostasy, and global sea-level change. Such processes will also play a role in controlling contemporary and future ice dynamics but, as highlighted above, quantifying present change is exacerbated by the need to interpret geodetic observations in terms of the response to both past and present ice-sheet change. In this section we discuss several areas that should be prioritised as we seek to better quantify the GIA signal across Antarctica and hence understand the processes responsible for contemporary ice-sheet change.</p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Characterisation of absolute mantle viscosity is preliminary. Beneath West Antarctica low viscosity mantle approaches isostatic equilibrium more quickly compared with global-average timescales. The consequence of this is that the present-day rate of adjustment will depend heavily on recent, and relatively localised, surface loading changes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>
  </span>. Characteristic relaxation times of a Maxwell fluid may be approximated by dividing the viscosity by the shear modulus (~7 × 10
  <span class="sup">10</span> Pa for the upper mantle). The relaxation time of mantle material with a viscosity of 10
  <span class="sup">19</span> Pa s is therefore only ~5 years, or 1–2 orders of magnitude faster than global averages. Actual relaxation times will be somewhat larger due to the presence of higher-viscosity layers within the rheological profile, but this calculation illustrates that, for regions underlain by low viscosity mantle, detailed knowledge of glacial load changes over the past decades to centuries is needed to quantify the GIA signal in regions of low viscosity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113" href="#CR113">113</a>
  </span>. For viscosities of 10
  <span class="sup">18</span> Pa s or lower the viscous relaxation almost occurs contemporaneously with the surface load change and, by implication, the elastic deformation, with the viscous component being around an order of magnitude greater than the elastic component
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. Such a rapid response is at odds with the traditional idea that the present-day GIA signal is related to post-LGM ice loss, although, given the much longer relaxation time of the lower mantle, some component of the present-day GIA signal is likely still associated with large-scale, post-LGM ice-sheet change.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Across East Antarctica, spatial variations in Earth rheology are currently poorly constrained, as they are across all offshore regions, due to significant uncertainty in Earth structure resulting from the absence of seismic stations. Across all Antarctica, uncertainties also exist in relation to the rheological law that should be used to describe mantle deformation. Although traditional GIA models do not parameterise viscosity to be directly related to the physical properties of the mantle, physically-based approximations to mantle creep processes are being implemented in new models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>, and these require quantification of mantle temperature, grain size, and water content, which have varying measurement uncertainties. Mantle temperatures, and hence viscosities, may be inferred from seismic velocity perturbations, but different approaches yield different results. When using a power-law rheology, the stress in the mantle prior to the change in surface load also plays a role in defining the viscosity, but this is often taken as zero
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" href="#CR114">114</a>
  </span>. Such stresses are expected to be largely a function of long-term mantle convection processes but could be more complex in the shallow mantle and asthenosphere due to ongoing isostatic relaxation or earthquake-related deformation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Constraints on ice loading history are extremely sparse across all time periods and locations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). However, this problem is particularly acute for late Holocene loading changes across West Antarctica and post-LGM changes in East Antarctica. Very few data record changes to the AIS from the late Holocene up until the commencement of the satellite record
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" href="#CR115">115</a>
  </span>, although there is evidence of a dynamic West Antarctic Ice Sheet
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" href="#CR116">116</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119" href="#CR119">119</a>
  </span> and large changes in net accumulation during this period
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" href="#CR120">120</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" href="#CR121">121</a>
  </span>. Progress can be made by studying the internal structure of the ice sheet to determine past flow patterns
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" href="#CR122">122</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" href="#CR123">123</a>
  </span>, but at present, global and Antarctic-focused GIA models generally assume no ice-load change over the last 1–2 ka (see refs. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" href="#CR124">124</a>
  </span> for some recent regional exceptions). Combined with low mantle viscosities in much of West Antarctica, this means that the predicted upper-mantle component of present-day deformation is likely erroneous. For vast sections of East Antarctica almost no data exist on past ice extent and retreat history

  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). Furthermore, there are few data to constrain the spatial extent and history of the post-LGM margin due to very limited bathymetric sampling. These limitations provide the motivation for new fieldwork and the reanalysis of historic and high resolution palaeo datasets

 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data with which to validate or constrain the GIA signal across Antarctica are also sparse (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). Less than 20 records of past sea-level change exist across the continent (e.g., through dating raised beach terraces), and these are presently limited to the last 12–15 ka (ref. 
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132" href="#CR132">132</a>
  </span>. A methodology is not yet available to precisely measure bedrock displacement under the present ice sheet or offshore, and this precludes model validation for these regions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important supplement to GNSS measurements of deformation at discrete bedrock outcrops is provided by inverse estimates of the spatially continuous deformation field
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>; such estimates are useful in separating competing conventional ‘forward model’ predictions of the GIA signal
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" href="#CR124">124</a>
  </span>. While possessing their own inter-solution variation due largely to differences in altimeter snow-densification corrections, inverse estimates tend to differ more from the spatial patterns of deformation predicted by current forward models (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). In regions where mantle viscosities are thought to be ~10
  <span class="sup">18</span> Pa s or lower, viscoelastic deformation in response to contemporary surface load change will perturb the deformation and gravity fields due to the short response time of the mantle, but the effect of this signal on inverse solutions is yet to be addressed.
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantification of model prediction uncertainty is immature with most attempts limited to sampling a generally small set of Earth models. Ice history uncertainty is rarely taken into account, in part due to the sparse information available from which to sample probabilistically
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" href="#CR133">133</a>
  </span> or lack of rigorous measurement uncertainties to propagate formally
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" href="#CR134">134</a>
  </span>. This prevents the robust propagation of GIA uncertainties into other quantities that make use of GIA model predictions, for example GRACE-derived ice mass balance estimates.
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A practical problem for those wishing to employ viscoelastic models is the absence of open source software that includes state-of-the-art model physics. While open source software are available and widely used for purely elastic

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139" href="#CR139">139</a>
  </span>, which requires consideration of gravitationally self-consistent meltwater redistribution on a rotating, spherical Earth with polar-motion feedbacks and migrating coastlines, and they do not have the capacity to account for 3-D Earth structure, compressibility and a selection of rheologies (e.g., transient, linear and power-law). Given that there is just one real Earth, a standardised viscoelastic software framework that allows the consistent treatment of GIA and post-seismic viscoelastic deformation would have distinct advantages; it would pave the way for new insights into Earth’s rheology, provide a framework to advance Earth’s viscoelastic predictability, and help resolve ongoing debates regarding model robustness
