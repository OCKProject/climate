 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forward model predictions of GIA-related solid Earth deformation, gravity-field change, and polar motion rely on: a reconstruction of the spatial and temporal pattern of past ice loading, a viscoelastic Earth model that describes the time-dependent response of the solid Earth to surface loading changes, and the iterative consideration of physical feedbacks associated with polar motion and coastline position as they are altered by the deformation of the solid Earth and the gravity field

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is important to note that some of the differences in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> reflect the timescale of ice-sheet change considered to contribute to the deformation signal; traditional forward models of GIA do not consider ice-sheet change during the last millennium (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a-f</a>), but this is accounted for in solutions derived via coupled modelling (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2g, h</a>) or data inversion (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2i-l</a>). Altogether, four approaches to determining the present-day GIA signal are represented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, reflecting a number of recent methodological advances.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of GIA on geodetic and gravimetric measurements, and the resulting impact on estimates of ice-mass change, has driven much of the recent interest in Antarctic GIA. Contemporary ice-sheet change can be determined from analysis of Earth’s time-varying gravity field, as measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites between 2002 and 2017
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span> and GRACE Follow-On (from May 2018). However, the time-varying gravity field also contains a gravity-change signal associated with past ice-sheet change; GIA modelling is used to determine the ‘GIA correction’ that should be applied to remove the signal associated with past change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Uncertainties associated with this process remain the dominant source of error in gravimetry-based estimates of the Antarctic contribution to contemporary sea-level rise
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. However, newer GIA model predictions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> yield improved inter-model agreement, as do inverse GIA solutions derived by combining ice elevation and GRACE data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Recent estimates for the magnitude of the net Antarctic GIA signal vary over the range ~40–80 Gt/yr
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>, but basin-level differences remain substantial and in some cases different studies do not even agree on the sign of the mass change in each basin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>, which hampers the advance of glaciological insights into the processes governing present change.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in estimates of the present-day GIA signal are particularly acute in the region of the Amundsen Sea embayment, where forward models have substantially less GIA signal than inverse solutions. This may be due to the fact that the GIA signal in this low mantle viscosity region predominantly reflects significant decadal-to-centennial ice load change that is not accounted for in most forward models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. For the same reasons, forward models underestimate the signal in the northern Antarctic Peninsula, but then so do inverse solutions because the GIA signal in this region has a shorter spatial wavelength than inverse solutions can resolve (~300 km). Comparison of the new generation of GIA models with GPS-derived uplift rates—which must be corrected for elastic deformation associated with contemporaneous ice-mass change

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
