  <p>Summary of interactions between the solid Earth and the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Local isostatic uplift occurs in response to ice-sheet thinning or retreat, isostatic subsidence occurs in response to ice-sheet thickening or advance. Subglacial volcanism and basal heat flux alter thermal conditions at the base of the ice sheet. Erosion and deposition also trigger an isostatic response (not shown). Increasing time indicated by finer dashed lines</p>
