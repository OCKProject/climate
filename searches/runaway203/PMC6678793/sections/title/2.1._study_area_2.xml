  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f001" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f001">Figure 1</a>). A total of 7 countries, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka make up South Asia. The climate of these places varies from tropical monsoon in the south, to temperate in the north, a range which is influenced by altitude, proximity to the ocean, and the characteristics of the monsoon season. There are 11 countries in the region defined as Southeast Asia, namely, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The climate is hot all year and rainfall is generally caused by the seasonal monsoon. Exceptions to this are found in Northern Vietnam and the Himalayan region, where higher elevations produce a cooler, subtropical climate (
