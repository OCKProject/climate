 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key results obtained in this study are noteworthy. This study was undertaken on the basis of a carbon balance, which considered the initial condition (benchmark) of the early 1990s to be NEP = 0, enabling subsequent changes in the NEP and the corresponding RF variations to be effectively evaluated. The results reveal that, although total NEP in South and Southeast Asia remained positive during 1992–2015, CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration by various land cover categories declined substantially, and the cooling effect of NEP in the region declined over the study period. This situation emerged directly from the corresponding LCCs. The Southeast Asian tropical rainforest is the second largest tropical rainforest on earth, with data revealing that the area under this land cover category has continued to decline during the period in question [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-02460">39</a>]. Coupled with urban expansion and increased farmland conversion, NEP has been reduced with concomitant climate implications, as indicated.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to previous studies that used simulated data and numerical models, our analysis of the effect of NEP on RF employed actual annual land cover data during 1992–2015. The simplified parameterization scheme used in this study not only facilitated the use of actual land cover data, but also avoided the constraints of numerical models based on the explicit correspondence between land cover and RF in the aspect of biogeochemistry. It was confirmed that the results of the single general circulation model (GCM) often have very large discrepancies and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are thus used by IPCC to analyze the RF and climate effects of greenhouse gases [

  <a rid="B34-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-16-02460">34</a>]. In fact, based on the multi-mode simulations, simplified climate response models are generally parameterized to reflect the main characteristics of GCMs and these methods have been used extensively by IPCC. The analysis here enables the direct interpretation of RF changes corresponding to CO
  <sub>2</sub>. In addition, many studies commonly assess the climate effects of CO
  <sub>2</sub> on the basis of a comparison with a pre-industrial revolution atmosphere and, in the process, integrate their analyses over a period of 100 years or more [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02460">36</a>,
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-16-02460">46</a>]. The global atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration was 278.00 ppm in 1750 compared to more than 350 ppm in the 1990s. The assessment results based on 1990s actually indicated a contribution since 1990 for future temperature. Furthermore, in the process of data analysis, annual CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions are important for calculating the RF since it can consider the real-time situation. However under the condition whereby the total amount of emitted CO
  <sub>2</sub> is fixed, a different emission time or emission scenario will also affect its CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration at a certain year, and then affect the subsequent RF [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, given that the simplified carbon-climate parameterization scheme cannot consider biomass burning, black carbon, and other factors associated with LCC, a full evaluation of the radiative forcing in South Asia/Southeast Asia remains elusive, although the climate effect of CO
  <sub>2</sub> can be analyzed. In this study, NEP, the actual, and potential RF (ARF and PRF) were used to construct a bookkeeping framework for a preliminary assessment of the climate effect of LCC. In order to improve the assessment approach, two aspects should at least be considered in future to more finely resolve the climate effects of LCC. One issue is the temporal scale. Limited by the formula and analysis period, the later in the sequence that the LCC occurs, the lower its effect because the remaining amount of CO
  <sub>2</sub> decay is not computed after 2015. This study was strictly stuck in the study period. A second issue concerns the framework itself. Although CO
  <sub>2</sub> is the main greenhouse gas and the focus of this study, other greenhouse gases, including CH
  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O, are affected by LCC [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02460">24</a>,
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02460">36</a>]. The climate effect of LCC also involves biogeophysical processes. Changes emanating from variations in land cover are well correlated with spatial patterns in surface biogeophysical parameters, such as albedo, evapotranspiration, surface roughness, etc. [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-02460">13</a>,
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-16-02460">47</a>,
  <a rid="B48-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-16-02460">48</a>]. LCC represent an even stronger driver of climate change when taking into account biogeophysical mechanisms and biogeochemistry aspects at the local or regional scale [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-02460">8</a>]. Therefore, considering the basic assessment framework utilized in this study, other related work on the climate effect of LCC should be conducted in the future.
