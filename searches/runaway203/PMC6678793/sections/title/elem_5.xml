  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Land Cover and Land Cover Category Change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, croplands and tropical evergreen forests are the two most abundant land cover categories in the region, each representing almost 20% of the study area (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f002">Figure 2</a>). Croplands are most commonly found across India, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, while tropical evergreen forests are most prominently distributed in Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian countries. Land covered by cropland, either irrigated or naturally flooded, is distributed mainly in the northern part of India, accounting for 13% of the study area. The areas covered by mosaic cropland/natural vegetation in both tropical and temperate regions account for more than 5% of the total, with most of this land cover type existing in Southeast Asia.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 1992 and 2015, the land cover category changed across 553.2 × 10
   <span class="sup">3</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span> of the region, and the most common conversions were urban expansion, land reclamation, and deforestation. The single largest proportion change in land cover was associated with urban expansion. The total amount of land classified as urban area in South and Southeast Asia increased by 41.5 × 10
   <span class="sup">3</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span>, representing a 1.72 fold increase from 1992 to 2015. Land cover categories, such as tropical mosaic cropland/natural vegetation, urban areas, and temperate scrub/woodland, expanded rapidly by increasing more than 25 × 10
   <span class="sup">3</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span> for each type during the period in question. Tropical deciduous forest, tropical mosaic cropland/natural vegetation, and temperate scrub/woodland increased by more than 10%. Differently, shrubland, tropical peat forest, tropical evergreen forest, and tropical broadleaved, deciduous forest experienced the most significant decline, reducing in area by more than 18 × 10
   <span class="sup">3</span> km
   <span class="sup">2</span> for each type. Tropical peat forest and shrubland were both reduced by more than 20% over the time period.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Annual Variations in NEP</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For South and Southeast Asia as a whole, for the period 1992 to 2015, the values of ICS and mean annual NEP were 2.164 Pg and 2.146 Pg, respectively. The overall trend of NEP revealed a clear net decrease of 2.44 Tg yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span> over the period (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f003">Figure 3</a>a). In order to compare the ICS and NEP during 1992–2015 more effectively, we normalized the ICS and the multi-annual mean NEP for each country by converting the units to NEP per unit area. The normalized ICS and NEP for Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Laos all exceeded 0.5 × 10
   <span class="sup">−3</span> Tg km
   <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f003">Figure 3</a>b). The normalized multi-annual mean NEP values were greater than normalized ICS in 11 of the countries. In fact, the dynamics of the NEP also reflect this. With the exception of Nepal and Maldives, all 16 countries in South and Southeast Asia act as carbon sinks (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f003">Figure 3</a>c). Most countries actually exhibited increased NEP relative to the benchmark between 1992–2015. However, because of substantial reductions in several of the larger countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, the overall NEP values declined from 2.16 Pg in the early 1990s to 2.11 Pg in 2015 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f003">Figure 3</a>c). Indonesia had the largest NEP values, accounting for nearly half of the total region area as a whole and exhibited ICS and multi-annual averages of 1031.1 and 1010.1 Tg, respectively. Myanmar, Malaysia, Laos, India, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam all exceeded 100 Tg NEP annually. Among these, Myanmar, India, and Philippines all exhibited a trend of increase, while Cambodia, Malaysia, and Indonesia showed clear reductions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to further evaluate the impact of LCC on NEP, we compared the AD of the annual recent NEP with the benchmark NEP values of the early 1990s (ICS). The results showed that the total AD of NEP was characterized by accelerated decreases (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f004" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f004">Figure 4</a>a). When annual NEP is compared with ICS, AD during 1992–2002 remained around −2.0 Tg, with a range of −9.54 to 2.02 Tg. Thereafter, the AD increased and, by 2015, reached 50.41 Tg, indicating that the overall ability of the land cover of the region to sequester CO
   <sub>2</sub> was declining year by year.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the study period, the quantum of cumulative carbon sequestration decreased by 414.95 Tg compared with the early 1990s. Among the 18 countries, the largest contributors to this change were Indonesia (503.5 Tg), Vietnam (139.3 Tg), Cambodia (118.8 Tg), and Malaysia (94.2 Tg). In fact, the amount of NEP in some countries, such as Myanmar, India, Nepal, and Laos increased over a year (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f004" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f004">Figure 4</a>b). However, the total increased amount of NEP was too far to offset the substantial decreasing amount of NEP in several major countries. The result was also mutually confirmed with the point we obtained above.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.3. RF of Land Cover and Land Cover Category Change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land cover change intensifies radiative forcing. From the perspective of global temperature change, ±RF represents the warming or cooling effect due to the annual change of NEP or AD. The results show that, while NEP remained positive in the region, the AD was negative in almost all 18 countries. This indicates that the climate effect of terrestrial ecosystems of South and Southeast Asian countries from 1992 to 2015 was cooling overall however the magnitude of this effect is declining with time due to LCC. Analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics of annual actual radiative forcing (ARF) during 1992 to 2015 and potential radiative forcing (PRF) in 2015 is shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f005">Figure 5</a>. Annual ARF changes are similar to trends in NEP in that, during 1992 to 2015, values declined by a total of −0.366 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>. However, the annual negative ARF had a shapely increase trend, especially since 2002, meaning that the capacity of carbon sequestration by terrestrial land cover categories in the study area decreased over time (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f005">Figure 5</a>a). Unlike ARF, PRF continued to rise because it considers the cumulative RF across the whole study period (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f005">Figure 5</a>a). Compared to the ICS, the PRF in 2015 reached 2.331 × 10
   <span class="sup">−3</span> W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>. In essence, this means that the NEP reduction caused by LCC during 1992 to 2015 yielded a warming effect of 2.331 × 10
   <span class="sup">−3</span> W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> to 2015. In particular, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f005">Figure 5</a>a clearly shows that both ARF and PRF exhibited a very significant linear increase since 2001.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, less negative values of ARF induce pronounced cooling effects, correspondingly, larger positive PRF values induce stronger warming effects due to LCC, which may be intensified or attenuated by other anthropogenic and/or natural factors. ARF values for all countries in the region were negative (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f005">Figure 5</a>b), indicating that all the countries made a general contribution to the cooling effect, especially Indonesia, Myanmar, and Malaysia, which have mean ARF values below −0.3 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, such that these countries play a role in global temperature attenuation. In terms of PRF, six countries exhibited positive values, namely Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, showing that LCC in these countries markedly impacted climate through an accentuated warming effect. In addition, in terms of the climate effect of various land cover types, urban area expansion and deforestation in particular, the area shrinking of tropical peat forest and tropical needle leaved evergreen forest contributed the most in the whole study area with 90.26% shares on the total RF increment during the study period.
