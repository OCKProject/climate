 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impacts of land cover change (LCC) on CO
  <sub>2</sub> must be accounted for when considering its mitigation effects in order to meet the Paris climate target [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-16-02460">1</a>]. LCC influences the amount of CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestered by terrestrial ecosystems through biogeochemical cycles and has been recognized as playing a significant role in global radiative forcing (RF) [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-16-02460">2</a>,
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-16-02460">3</a>]. Numerous studies have demonstrated the profound effect of historical land cover on current and future climate [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-16-02460">4</a>,
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-16-02460">5</a>]. Large-scale increase in global croplands (pastures) and a corresponding decrease in forest cover resulted in substantial CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions before 2000 and, indeed, CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions from LCC still account for approximately 10% of the total CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions in recent decades [

  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-02460">8</a>]. Importantly, changing land cover in a particular region can not only impact the climate over the world, but also impact the animal and plant habitats [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-16-02460">9</a>,
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-16-02460">10</a>]. Moreover, climate change, especially temperature fluctuation, would increase the risks of public health.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CO
  <sub>2</sub> is an important driver of climate change and will continue to be so in the future [
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-16-02460">11</a>]. Extensive studies have been undertaken on changes in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration and their relationship to climate change across different timescales [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-16-02460">12</a>]. Nowadays, the effects of LCC on climate due to the change in CO
  <sub>2</sub> has been analyzed in many studies [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-02460">13</a>,
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-16-02460">14</a>,
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-16-02460">15</a>]. However, although some of the above studies have taken into account the attenuation of CO
  <sub>2</sub>, the changing temporal patterns of total CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions have been neglected, as has the corresponding RF response affected by different integration years. In addition, most analyses have used simulated data in developing the scenarios with little research using actual land cover data in the corresponding period [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-02460">8</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">South and Southeast Asia is comprised of the countries that lie between the tropics to the south of China (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f001" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f001">Figure 1</a>), occupying a total area of 8.87 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. Since the 1990s, many countries such as India and Indonesia in South and Southeast Asia, have experienced a number of dramatic LCCs, including urban expansion, agricultural development, deforestation, and afforestation [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-16-02460">17</a>,
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-16-02460">18</a>]. Previous studies have focused on the impact of LCC on the carbon cycle and evaluated its effects on carbon flux through various means, including ecosystem modelling, remote sensing, covariance observation, or using CO
  <sub>2</sub> assimilation data [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-02460">19</a>,
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-02460">20</a>]. However, such studies are usually limited to the analysis of one specific type of land cover conversion on the specific region [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-16-02460">19</a>,
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-16-02460">21</a>]. Results thus far lack uniformity and there are discrepancies even when the eddy covariance type of measurement is used [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-16-02460">20</a>]. In addition, compared to the relatively complete CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux network in China, North America, and Europe, there are only limited monitoring sites in South and Southeast Asia (AsiaFlux: 
  <span xlink:href="http://asiaflux.net/?page_id=22" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://asiaflux.net/?page_id=22</span>) and these are too remote to analyze the CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux of land cover categories in the region.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is clear, therefore, that a detailed understanding of the influence of LCC on CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux and RF in South and Southeast Asia is needed. The aim of this study is to develop a suitable framework to assess the RF response to the change of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) resulting from LCC between 1992 and 2015. Specifically, the objectives of this paper are as follows: (i) To obtain land cover categories and associated NEP values for each year between 1992 and 2015, (ii) to establish the benchmark NEP value, and (iii) to calculate the RF values of these years.
