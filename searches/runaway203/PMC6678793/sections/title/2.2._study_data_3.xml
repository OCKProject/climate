 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data of 3 categories were collected for this study, specifically the annual land cover, terrestrial ecoregions, and NEP values for a suitable range of land cover categories. Annual land cover data at 300 m resolution for the period 1992 to 2015 are based on the Land Cover Map (v2.0.7; 
  <span xlink:href="http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be</span>). The annual land cover data is also the only one that has been released to the public currently. The terrestrial ecoregions data were obtained from the map of terrestrial ecoregions of the world [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, with the annual land cover and terrestrial ecoregions data, the final land cover categories were defined based on plant functional categories (

  <a rid="B23-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-16-02460">23</a>]. Based on previously published studies that considered the parameter of ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in different terrestrial ecoregions, we determined NEP values for the various land cover categories and corresponding annual CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux as shown in
