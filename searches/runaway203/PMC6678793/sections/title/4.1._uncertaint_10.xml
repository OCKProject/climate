 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are inherent problems in assessing the accuracy of estimating terrestrial productivity [
  <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-02460">38</a>,
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-02460">39</a>]. While accurate assessment of the net CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions arising from LCC is a fundamental research goal, unfortunately there remains considerable uncertainty in such estimates. A meta-analysis of 250 studies of carbon responses to land cover change revealed conflicting results for several land cover transitions, with some resulting in net carbon uptake (for example agriculture to forest) while others involved carbon release (mature forest to agriculture) [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-16-02460">40</a>]. In the present study, because the land cover classification used is based mainly on the functional characteristics of terrestrial vegetation, the land cover categories identified may not necessarily correspond to each other in regard to CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux. Additionally, the situation of widely distributed cropland and forest ecosystem is complex. Photosynthesis and subsequent harvesting, biomass burning, deforestation, degradation, and other greenhouse gases like N
  <sub>2</sub>O have not been considered [
  <a rid="B41-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-16-02460">41</a>]. This means that the study does not account for the effects of all greenhouse gases from these land cover categories and simplifies the NEP changes within the same land cover category. This also implies that CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions due to deforestation and CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake due to regrowth may be underestimated in this study. However, our results showed that the NEP during the 1990s was 589.1 TgC yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, which is similar to the result (546.6 TgC yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) obtained by Cervarich et al. (2016). As for the flux, results differ widely between studies [

  <a rid="B42-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-16-02460">42</a>]. Other studies reveal NEP values that are much higher than our results, implying that considering only the land cover category change may underestimate the climate regulation effect of LCC to some extent. To further explore the specific results of this study, we can compare several basic ratios with global results for reference. The study area accounts for 8.87/149 = 5.95% of the global continental land mass. For the NEP and RF, for reference, the annual values of NEP during 2006–2015 and RF during 2003–2012 were calculated to compare the global results with Global Carbon Project and other studies. The ratios of NEP and RF reached 9.28 (103/1110) and 6.98%, respectively [
  <a rid="B43-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-16-02460">43</a>,
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-16-02460">44</a>]. The fact that these ratios are greater than their respective areas indicates the importance of regional factors in regulating climate change.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux between vegetation and soil is not synchronized. For example, the annual carbon release from soil varies until the soil is “set” to another type of land cover completely. For this issue, some studies introduced a bookkeeping approach to address which calculations were based on stocks of carbon in vegetation and soils but not the CO
  <sub>2</sub> fluxes for ecosystems [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-02460">13</a>,
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02460">24</a>,
  <a rid="B45-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-16-02460">45</a>]. Although carbon stocks are relatively fixed and using CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux during 1992–2015 can sensitively capture the resultant RF, carbon stocks can be used to calculate a long-term result, which can completely consider the full decomposition of various biomasses or ecosystems. Overall, although the accuracy of the study data and methods themselves may be constrained, the calculated result and framework are suitable for assessing the relative changes in the nature and distribution of changes in RF.
