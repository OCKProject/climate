 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For South and Southeast Asia as a whole, for the period 1992 to 2015, the values of ICS and mean annual NEP were 2.164 Pg and 2.146 Pg, respectively. The overall trend of NEP revealed a clear net decrease of 2.44 Tg yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> over the period (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f003">Figure 3</a>a). In order to compare the ICS and NEP during 1992–2015 more effectively, we normalized the ICS and the multi-annual mean NEP for each country by converting the units to NEP per unit area. The normalized ICS and NEP for Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Laos all exceeded 0.5 × 10
  <span class="sup">−3</span> Tg km
  <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f003">Figure 3</a>b). The normalized multi-annual mean NEP values were greater than normalized ICS in 11 of the countries. In fact, the dynamics of the NEP also reflect this. With the exception of Nepal and Maldives, all 16 countries in South and Southeast Asia act as carbon sinks (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f003">Figure 3</a>c). Most countries actually exhibited increased NEP relative to the benchmark between 1992–2015. However, because of substantial reductions in several of the larger countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, the overall NEP values declined from 2.16 Pg in the early 1990s to 2.11 Pg in 2015 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f003">Figure 3</a>c). Indonesia had the largest NEP values, accounting for nearly half of the total region area as a whole and exhibited ICS and multi-annual averages of 1031.1 and 1010.1 Tg, respectively. Myanmar, Malaysia, Laos, India, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam all exceeded 100 Tg NEP annually. Among these, Myanmar, India, and Philippines all exhibited a trend of increase, while Cambodia, Malaysia, and Indonesia showed clear reductions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to further evaluate the impact of LCC on NEP, we compared the AD of the annual recent NEP with the benchmark NEP values of the early 1990s (ICS). The results showed that the total AD of NEP was characterized by accelerated decreases (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f004" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f004">Figure 4</a>a). When annual NEP is compared with ICS, AD during 1992–2002 remained around −2.0 Tg, with a range of −9.54 to 2.02 Tg. Thereafter, the AD increased and, by 2015, reached 50.41 Tg, indicating that the overall ability of the land cover of the region to sequester CO
  <sub>2</sub> was declining year by year.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the study period, the quantum of cumulative carbon sequestration decreased by 414.95 Tg compared with the early 1990s. Among the 18 countries, the largest contributors to this change were Indonesia (503.5 Tg), Vietnam (139.3 Tg), Cambodia (118.8 Tg), and Malaysia (94.2 Tg). In fact, the amount of NEP in some countries, such as Myanmar, India, Nepal, and Laos increased over a year (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f004" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f004">Figure 4</a>b). However, the total increased amount of NEP was too far to offset the substantial decreasing amount of NEP in several major countries. The result was also mutually confirmed with the point we obtained above.
