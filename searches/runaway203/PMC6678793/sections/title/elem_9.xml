  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are inherent problems in assessing the accuracy of estimating terrestrial productivity [
   <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-02460">38</a>,
   <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-02460">39</a>]. While accurate assessment of the net CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions arising from LCC is a fundamental research goal, unfortunately there remains considerable uncertainty in such estimates. A meta-analysis of 250 studies of carbon responses to land cover change revealed conflicting results for several land cover transitions, with some resulting in net carbon uptake (for example agriculture to forest) while others involved carbon release (mature forest to agriculture) [
   <a rid="B40-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-16-02460">40</a>]. In the present study, because the land cover classification used is based mainly on the functional characteristics of terrestrial vegetation, the land cover categories identified may not necessarily correspond to each other in regard to CO
   <sub>2</sub> flux. Additionally, the situation of widely distributed cropland and forest ecosystem is complex. Photosynthesis and subsequent harvesting, biomass burning, deforestation, degradation, and other greenhouse gases like N
   <sub>2</sub>O have not been considered [
   <a rid="B41-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-16-02460">41</a>]. This means that the study does not account for the effects of all greenhouse gases from these land cover categories and simplifies the NEP changes within the same land cover category. This also implies that CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions due to deforestation and CO
   <sub>2</sub> uptake due to regrowth may be underestimated in this study. However, our results showed that the NEP during the 1990s was 589.1 TgC yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, which is similar to the result (546.6 TgC yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) obtained by Cervarich et al. (2016). As for the flux, results differ widely between studies [
   <a rid="B38-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-16-02460">38</a>,
   <a rid="B42-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-16-02460">42</a>]. Other studies reveal NEP values that are much higher than our results, implying that considering only the land cover category change may underestimate the climate regulation effect of LCC to some extent. To further explore the specific results of this study, we can compare several basic ratios with global results for reference. The study area accounts for 8.87/149 = 5.95% of the global continental land mass. For the NEP and RF, for reference, the annual values of NEP during 2006–2015 and RF during 2003–2012 were calculated to compare the global results with Global Carbon Project and other studies. The ratios of NEP and RF reached 9.28 (103/1110) and 6.98%, respectively [
   <a rid="B43-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-16-02460">43</a>,
   <a rid="B44-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-16-02460">44</a>]. The fact that these ratios are greater than their respective areas indicates the importance of regional factors in regulating climate change.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CO
   <sub>2</sub> flux between vegetation and soil is not synchronized. For example, the annual carbon release from soil varies until the soil is “set” to another type of land cover completely. For this issue, some studies introduced a bookkeeping approach to address which calculations were based on stocks of carbon in vegetation and soils but not the CO
   <sub>2</sub> fluxes for ecosystems [
   <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-02460">13</a>,
   <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02460">24</a>,
   <a rid="B45-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-16-02460">45</a>]. Although carbon stocks are relatively fixed and using CO
   <sub>2</sub> flux during 1992–2015 can sensitively capture the resultant RF, carbon stocks can be used to calculate a long-term result, which can completely consider the full decomposition of various biomasses or ecosystems. Overall, although the accuracy of the study data and methods themselves may be constrained, the calculated result and framework are suitable for assessing the relative changes in the nature and distribution of changes in RF.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4.2. Problem and Prospects</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key results obtained in this study are noteworthy. This study was undertaken on the basis of a carbon balance, which considered the initial condition (benchmark) of the early 1990s to be NEP = 0, enabling subsequent changes in the NEP and the corresponding RF variations to be effectively evaluated. The results reveal that, although total NEP in South and Southeast Asia remained positive during 1992–2015, CO
   <sub>2</sub> sequestration by various land cover categories declined substantially, and the cooling effect of NEP in the region declined over the study period. This situation emerged directly from the corresponding LCCs. The Southeast Asian tropical rainforest is the second largest tropical rainforest on earth, with data revealing that the area under this land cover category has continued to decline during the period in question [
   <a rid="B39-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-16-02460">39</a>]. Coupled with urban expansion and increased farmland conversion, NEP has been reduced with concomitant climate implications, as indicated.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to previous studies that used simulated data and numerical models, our analysis of the effect of NEP on RF employed actual annual land cover data during 1992–2015. The simplified parameterization scheme used in this study not only facilitated the use of actual land cover data, but also avoided the constraints of numerical models based on the explicit correspondence between land cover and RF in the aspect of biogeochemistry. It was confirmed that the results of the single general circulation model (GCM) often have very large discrepancies and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are thus used by IPCC to analyze the RF and climate effects of greenhouse gases [
   <a rid="B16-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-16-02460">16</a>,
   <a rid="B34-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-16-02460">34</a>]. In fact, based on the multi-mode simulations, simplified climate response models are generally parameterized to reflect the main characteristics of GCMs and these methods have been used extensively by IPCC. The analysis here enables the direct interpretation of RF changes corresponding to CO
   <sub>2</sub>. In addition, many studies commonly assess the climate effects of CO
   <sub>2</sub> on the basis of a comparison with a pre-industrial revolution atmosphere and, in the process, integrate their analyses over a period of 100 years or more [
   <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02460">36</a>,
   <a rid="B46-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-16-02460">46</a>]. The global atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration was 278.00 ppm in 1750 compared to more than 350 ppm in the 1990s. The assessment results based on 1990s actually indicated a contribution since 1990 for future temperature. Furthermore, in the process of data analysis, annual CO
   <sub>2</sub> emissions are important for calculating the RF since it can consider the real-time situation. However under the condition whereby the total amount of emitted CO
   <sub>2</sub> is fixed, a different emission time or emission scenario will also affect its CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration at a certain year, and then affect the subsequent RF [
   <a rid="B16-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-16-02460">16</a>,
   <a rid="B37-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-16-02460">37</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, given that the simplified carbon-climate parameterization scheme cannot consider biomass burning, black carbon, and other factors associated with LCC, a full evaluation of the radiative forcing in South Asia/Southeast Asia remains elusive, although the climate effect of CO
   <sub>2</sub> can be analyzed. In this study, NEP, the actual, and potential RF (ARF and PRF) were used to construct a bookkeeping framework for a preliminary assessment of the climate effect of LCC. In order to improve the assessment approach, two aspects should at least be considered in future to more finely resolve the climate effects of LCC. One issue is the temporal scale. Limited by the formula and analysis period, the later in the sequence that the LCC occurs, the lower its effect because the remaining amount of CO
   <sub>2</sub> decay is not computed after 2015. This study was strictly stuck in the study period. A second issue concerns the framework itself. Although CO
   <sub>2</sub> is the main greenhouse gas and the focus of this study, other greenhouse gases, including CH
   <sub>4</sub> and N
   <sub>2</sub>O, are affected by LCC [
   <a rid="B24-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-16-02460">24</a>,
   <a rid="B36-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-16-02460">36</a>]. The climate effect of LCC also involves biogeophysical processes. Changes emanating from variations in land cover are well correlated with spatial patterns in surface biogeophysical parameters, such as albedo, evapotranspiration, surface roughness, etc. [
   <a rid="B13-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-16-02460">13</a>,
   <a rid="B47-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-16-02460">47</a>,
   <a rid="B48-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-16-02460">48</a>]. LCC represent an even stronger driver of climate change when taking into account biogeophysical mechanisms and biogeochemistry aspects at the local or regional scale [
   <a rid="B8-ijerph-16-02460" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-16-02460">8</a>]. Therefore, considering the basic assessment framework utilized in this study, other related work on the climate effect of LCC should be conducted in the future.
