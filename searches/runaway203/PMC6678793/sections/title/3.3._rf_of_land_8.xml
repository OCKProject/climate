 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land cover change intensifies radiative forcing. From the perspective of global temperature change, ±RF represents the warming or cooling effect due to the annual change of NEP or AD. The results show that, while NEP remained positive in the region, the AD was negative in almost all 18 countries. This indicates that the climate effect of terrestrial ecosystems of South and Southeast Asian countries from 1992 to 2015 was cooling overall however the magnitude of this effect is declining with time due to LCC. Analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics of annual actual radiative forcing (ARF) during 1992 to 2015 and potential radiative forcing (PRF) in 2015 is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f005">Figure 5</a>. Annual ARF changes are similar to trends in NEP in that, during 1992 to 2015, values declined by a total of −0.366 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. However, the annual negative ARF had a shapely increase trend, especially since 2002, meaning that the capacity of carbon sequestration by terrestrial land cover categories in the study area decreased over time (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f005">Figure 5</a>a). Unlike ARF, PRF continued to rise because it considers the cumulative RF across the whole study period (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f005">Figure 5</a>a). Compared to the ICS, the PRF in 2015 reached 2.331 × 10
  <span class="sup">−3</span> W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. In essence, this means that the NEP reduction caused by LCC during 1992 to 2015 yielded a warming effect of 2.331 × 10
  <span class="sup">−3</span> W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> to 2015. In particular, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f005">Figure 5</a>a clearly shows that both ARF and PRF exhibited a very significant linear increase since 2001.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, less negative values of ARF induce pronounced cooling effects, correspondingly, larger positive PRF values induce stronger warming effects due to LCC, which may be intensified or attenuated by other anthropogenic and/or natural factors. ARF values for all countries in the region were negative (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02460-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02460-f005">Figure 5</a>b), indicating that all the countries made a general contribution to the cooling effect, especially Indonesia, Myanmar, and Malaysia, which have mean ARF values below −0.3 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, such that these countries play a role in global temperature attenuation. In terms of PRF, six countries exhibited positive values, namely Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, showing that LCC in these countries markedly impacted climate through an accentuated warming effect. In addition, in terms of the climate effect of various land cover types, urban area expansion and deforestation in particular, the area shrinking of tropical peat forest and tropical needle leaved evergreen forest contributed the most in the whole study area with 90.26% shares on the total RF increment during the study period.
