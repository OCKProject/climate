 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study used actual land cover data in South and Southeast Asia from 1992 to 2015 to assess actual and potential radiative forcing of CO
  <sub>2</sub> due to land cover category change in South and Southeast Asia from 1992 to 2015. Although the bookkeeping approach adopted does not account for other complex biogeochemical and biogeophysical effects, our framework enables a rapid assessment on the climate effects of LCC. Results of this preliminary assessment indicate that the ability to sequestrate CO
  <sub>2</sub> was weakened due to LCC during 1992 to 2015, resulting in a net warming effect of 2.33 × 10
  <span class="sup">−3</span> W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> to 2015. In particular, both ARF and PRF exhibited a very significant linear increase since 2001. Overall, the presented results could contribute to other sciences in the broader perspectives, especially climate change and its effects on the living world.
