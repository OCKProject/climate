 <p>Land cover change (LCC) and its impact on CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration and radiative forcing (RF) could dramatically affect climate change, but there has been little effort to address this issue in South and Southeast Asia over a long period of time using actual land cover information. In this study, annual land cover data from 1992 to 2015 were used to assess the CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux and corresponding RF due to LCC in South and Southeast Asia. The results showed that 553.2 × 10
  <span class="sup">3</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of the region experienced LCC during this period, mostly due to land reclamation, urban expansion, and deforestation. These LCC caused a marked net decrease in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) as a composite of the various land cover categories during the whole study period, especially since 2001. The CO
  <sub>2</sub> sequestration was 2160 TgCO
  <sub>2</sub> during the early 1990s however cumulative sequestration decreased by 414.95 TgCO
  <sub>2</sub> by 2015. Correspondingly, the cooling effect of NEP, i.e. the total actual RF, was −0.366 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> in South and Southeast Asia between 1992 and 2015. However, the potential RF of the cumulatively reduced NEP due to LCC relative to the 1990s resulted in a warming effect of 2.33 × 10
  <span class="sup">−3</span> W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> in 2015. Our study provides an applicable framework to accurately assess the potential effect of large-scale LCC on climate.
