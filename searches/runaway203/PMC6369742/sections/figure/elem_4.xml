 <div class="caption">
  <p>(
   <span class="italic">A</span>) The seasonally adjusted mean mass acceleration field for the time period 2003.12–2013.46, in millimeters per square year of water equivalent. (
   <span class="italic">B</span>) The spatial structure of the “2013–2014 mass anomaly” defined as the mass residual field at epoch 2014.45. Note the negative correlation of 
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. (
   <span class="italic">C</span>) The temporal trend in SMB estimated using MAR during the years 2004–2012. The units, millimeters per square year, match those of subplot 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. (
   <span class="italic">D</span>) Surface elevation of the GrIS. The 1,750-m above sea level (ASL) contour (black curve) was added to emphasize lateral variability of the mean topographic slope near the ice margin, and changes in the margin-perpendicular width of the zones in which the ice surface lies below some reference height such as 500, 1,000, or 1,750 m ASL. (
   <span class="italic">E</span>) Precipitation, runoff, and SMB for Greenland as a whole, from MAR. (
   <span class="italic">F</span>) Greenland’s cumulative (CUM) SMB anomaly relative to 1980–2002. (
   <span class="italic">G</span>) Cumulative runoff in southwest Greenland from MAR.
