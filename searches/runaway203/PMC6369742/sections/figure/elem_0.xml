  <p>(
   <span class="italic">A</span>) The GRACE mass change solution integrated over Greenland (blue circles) and the mass trajectory model (MTM) fit to these data during the reference period, 2003.0–2013.4, and extrapolated to the end of the time series (solid red curve). The dashed red curve is the quadratic trend component of the MTM. The cyclical component of the MTM (shown in 
   <span class="italic">C</span>) was removed from the data and the model in 
   <span class="italic">A</span> to produce the blue dots and the red curve in 
   <span class="italic">B</span>. The extrapolated portion of this curve is dashed. The residuals (data, MTM) in 
   <span class="italic">D</span> constitute mass anomalies. That portion of 
   <span class="italic">B</span> comprising the 2013–2014 Pause is shown in more detail in 
   <span class="italic">E</span>. (
   <span class="italic">F</span>) Interannual variations in summertime SMB (JJAS) from the climate models MAR and RACMO2 compared with the summertime NAO index (JJAS). (
   <span class="italic">G</span>) The distribution of all interannual changes in NAO JJAS between 1950 and 2015. NF, # frequencies; NP=2, quadratic trend; MAX, maximum; MIN, minimum; SLTM, standard linear trajectory model.
