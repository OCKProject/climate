 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We address the spatial structure of the mass accelerations discussed above, by applying the same annual cycle plus quadratic trend model to each cell or “pixel” in our time series of GRACE mass grids. Having fit the composite mass trajectory model to each grid cell in Greenland, we can remove the mean annual cycle, just as we did in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>, so as to isolate the decycled or seasonally adjusted cumulative mass changes from 2003.12 to 2006.45, 2009.79, or 2013.46 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4 
   <span class="italic">A</span>–
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). The first two subplots (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4 
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>) are similar to those of Khan et al. (

  <span class="italic">A</span> and 
  <span class="italic">B</span>), depicting the spread of ice loss from southeast to northwest Greenland between 2003 and 2009. We also estimated the decycled mass rate as a function of time (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4 
   <span class="italic">D</span>–
   <span class="italic">F</span>
  </a>), by taking the first temporal derivative of the quadratic mass trend curve. Note the change in sign of mass rate in southwest Greenland between 2003 and 2013.5. In all six subplots of 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>, there is little signal in the central portion of north Greenland, and there is a large segment of the eastern GrIS margin where mass loss and mass rate are much weaker than to the north or south.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>) is found by taking the second temporal derivative of the mass trend model. In the event that the mass time series in any given location does not actually have a constant acceleration, then our estimate can be interpreted as the mean acceleration in the time period of interest. The spatial pattern of the GRACE acceleration field is nearly consistent with GNET’s acceleration field (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We can visualize the mass anomaly associated with the Pause by examining the difference between the projected mass trajectory model and the GRACE solution at epoch 2014.45 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>). Alternatively, we can average the mass anomalies in the interval 2013.79–2014.45 just as we did in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>, but now as a function of position (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1806562116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S10
  </span>). The two approaches yield similar results. It is instructive to compare the mass anomaly field (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>), which characterizes the expected mass loss that did not occur (due to the Pause), with the mass acceleration field (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>) that characterizes mass changes during the previous decade. Apart from a change of sign, the spatial patterns are broadly similar. This strongly suggests that the shifting phase of the NAO (in summer) drove most of the sustained mass acceleration and its abrupt demise. We argue below that the spatial footprint of the sustained acceleration field also reveals the sensitivity of the ice sheet to atmospheric warming, not just the spatial pattern of warming itself.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even given the unavoidable spatial smoothing of any acceleration field inferred from GRACE, we can conclude that the most negative mass accelerations in Greenland (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>) occurred in the central west and southwest margins of the GrIS. Shifts in dynamic mass balance (DMB), that is, mass changes driven by changing rates of glacial discharge, at Jakobshavn Isbrae (JI), certainly contributed to the observed mass acceleration in the central west margin before 2006 (ref. 
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>; 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1806562116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, section 7
  </span>). However, further south, there are almost no major marine-terminating glaciers, so the acceleration field in the southwest margin was dominated by SMB, not DMB. This conclusion is supported by model results computed by the regional climate models MAR (
  <a rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" href="#r15">15</a>, 
  <a rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" href="#r16">16</a>) and RACMO2 (
  <a rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" href="#r5">5</a>). The temporal correlation between summertime SMB and the phase of the NAO is seen in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">Fig. 1
   <span class="italic">F</span>
  </a>. We estimated the best linear trend in SMB predicted by MAR for the years 2004–2012 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). SMB expressed in water equivalent has units of millimeters per year, so SMB trend has units of millimeters per square year, that is, mass acceleration. The SMB trend field is broadly consistent with the mass acceleration field before 2013, given that the MAR output has much higher resolution (∼10 km) than GRACE (∼334 km). GRACE’s inevitable blurring of the SMB trend field both broadens the zone of negative mass acceleration in southwest Greenland, and lowers its amplitude. The MAR SMB trend in the northeast GrIS is more pronounced than in adjacent areas, but this local feature is a little less pronounced, and slightly displaced, relative to GRACE’s secondary peak in mass acceleration (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>, “ne”) suggesting that in this area changes in ice dynamics also played a role, as discussed later on. Note that both GRACE and MAR agree on near-zero or slightly positive mass accelerations in the east and southeast margins (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>, “e” and “se”), respectively. MAR’s result for the southeast is associated with positive snowfall anomalies. GNET reveals a slightly more complex situation in which accelerations in uplift rates change sign from one major outlet glacier to the next (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">Fig. 2
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a> and

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S2
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </span>). GRACE tends to smooth out these alternating accelerations in dynamic mass change and blends the result with the more subdued SMB trend due to increased snowfall accumulation.
