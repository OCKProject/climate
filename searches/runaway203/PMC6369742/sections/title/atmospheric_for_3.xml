 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accelerations in total ice mass change are driven by changes in SMB and DMB. (Note that DMB = −D, where D is discharge, so total ice mass balance = SMB + DMB = SMB − D.) DMB changes are commonly driven by (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) changes in ocean circulation and temperature, and (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) changes in the floating portion of the ice sheet and the mélange of icebergs and sea ice, which modulates their buttressing effect. Both changes affect calving rates and the velocity of outlet glaciers, and cause inland changes in ice thickness.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The secondary negative mass acceleration peak in northeast Greenland (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5

  </a>, “ne”) has already been associated with dynamic thinning in and near the outlet glaciers of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>), but this does not rule out a role for atmospheric forcing. The observation that the mass anomaly field (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>) associated with the Pause has its third largest center of mass gain in northeast Greenland, close to a center of accelerating mass loss in the previous decade, does suggest that this area was also affected by the shifting phase of the NAO (
  <a rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" href="#r21">21</a>). All three GNET stations close to the GrIS margin in northeast Greenland recorded accelerating uplift from their date of installation through 2012 (
  <a rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" href="#r12">12</a>), and they all recorded negative uplift anomalies after mid-2013 (

  </span>). This reversal occurred rather later than 2013.4–2013.5, presumably because summer arrives later in this region than it does in southern or central Greenland, and therefore the nondevelopment of a previously typical negative SMB season would not be evident until later in the year. The fact that a sustained acceleration followed by an abrupt deceleration is evident for northeast Greenland in both the GRACE and GNET time series suggests a connection to the NAO-driven changes identified in southwest Greenland. The MAR SMB trend field (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>) does indicate greater mass loss acceleration in the northeast sector than in either adjacent sector of the ice margin, but this is not quite as pronounced as one might expect based on the GRACE results (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We suggest that sustained summertime warming before 2013 drove a shift in DMB, as well as SMB, in northeast Greenland. There are at least two possible mechanisms: (
  <span class="italic">i</span>) regional warming drove a reduction in the extent of the floating ice sheet before the summer of 2013, which diminished its buttressing effect on the outlet glaciers, prompting increased rates of discharge which thinned the ice, as observed in the Antarctic Peninsula (
  <a rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" href="#r22">22</a>, 
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>), and (
  <span class="italic">ii</span>) increases in meltwater production can modulate dynamical changes in ice mass. The northeast margin of the GrIS has a much greater area of low elevation surface than the margin sectors on either side (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>), which would expand the area of enhanced meltwater production. Increased surface melting lowers the viscosity of the ice sheet via the advection of latent heat to its interior (
  <a rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" href="#r24">24</a>), and this mechanism will be volumetrically concentrated in thinner portions of ice sheet associated with low surface elevations. Meltwater can also accelerate ice flow by modifying the mechanical conditions at the base of the ice sheet (
  <a rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" href="#r25">25</a>
  <a href="#r26">*</a>–
  <a rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" href="#r27">27</a>). In extreme cases, the development of subglacial lakes can lift portions of an ice sheet or an ice cap from its bed (
  <a rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" href="#r28">28</a>, 
  <a rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" href="#r29">29</a>). The hypothesis that atmospheric warming can promote increases in discharge, dynamic thinning, and glacial retreat has recently been invoked in Prudhoe Land in northwest Greenland (
  <a rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" href="#r30">30</a>).
