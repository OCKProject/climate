 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The negative phase of the NAO in summertime enhances melting over much of Greenland, but especially in west Greenland (
  <a rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" href="#r13">13</a>, 
  <a rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" href="#r14">14</a>). The progressive, pre-2013 warming of west Greenland summers was not as spatially focused as the strongest negative mass accelerations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5 
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). The spatial distribution of ablation is largely controlled by the spatial distribution of air temperature and solar radiation. The ice sheet’s sensitivity to surface warming is strongly influenced by surface elevation. If the surface warms from −1 to 3 °C, for example, then the impact of 4 °C warming is vastly greater than if the surface warms from −5 °C to −1 °C. This is why simple models of melting are often expressed in terms of seasonal sums of positive degree-day (
  <a rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" href="#r17">17</a>, 
  <a rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" href="#r18">18</a>). The amount of melting induced by a temperature increase is strongly dependent on initial surface temperature, and thus on latitude and elevation (

  </span>), as well as time of year. The influence that surface elevation has on melting and runoff is enhanced by a powerful positive feedback. The ice exposed in the ablation zone has lower albedo than snow surfaces, leading to greater absorption of solar radiation. Indeed, the largest source of melt energy in the ablation zone is absorbed solar energy, not the transfer of sensible heat from the air (
  <a rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" href="#r19">19</a>). Nevertheless, the primary control on the geometry of the ablation zone is air temperature, and, at a given time of year, near-surface temperature is largely controlled by latitude and elevation. In a given latitude zone, lower topographic gradients near the margins of the ice sheet lead to a wider ablation zone, thus acting as primary controls on the spatial extent of the albedo feedback.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if the southeast and southwest margins of the GrIS were exposed to similar positive temperature trends, the mass loss trend would be more pronounced at the southwest margin because it has a far greater area of low elevation ice surface per unit length of margin than does the southeast margin (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>). Similarly, the low elevation and surface slopes prevailing at the northeast margin ensure that it incorporates a far greater area of low elevation ice surface than does a similarly sized segment of the northernmost margin of the ice sheet, or a similarly sized segment of the east margin (region “e” in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>) where surface elevations &gt;2 km loom over the nearby edges of the ice sheet. This helps us explain the localized center of sustained negative mass acceleration in the northeast (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>, ne). The locally enhanced sensitivity of the northeast margin to atmospheric forcing, relative to immediately adjacent areas, was also apparent in the correlated 2010 melting day and uplift anomalies reported by Bevis et al. (
  <a rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" href="#r8">8</a>) (see their figure 5).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transient regional warming has less impact on higher portions of the GrIS surface than on lower portions. The high mountains that dam the ice sheet in central east Greenland ensure that there is very little low surface ice per unit distance along the general trend of this ice margin, in comparison with the adjacent margins to the north and south (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>). This largely explains the near zero mean mass acceleration rates we inferred for east Greenland (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>, area “e”).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we suggest that both the geographical distribution of the progressive summertime warming before 2013, which was mostly focused in the west of Greenland, and the spatial structure of ice sheet sensitivity to atmospheric forcing, which is dominated by ice sheet topography near its margins, jointly explain most of the spatial pattern of SMB trend (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>) and the mass acceleration field (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>) sensed by GRACE before 2013. This interpretation is supported by the recent history of runoff within the Taseriaq basin of southwest Greenland (
