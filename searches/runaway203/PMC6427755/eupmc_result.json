    "Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas and its concentration in atmosphere has been increasing rapidly due to the increase of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions. Quantifying anthropogenic CO₂ emissions is essential to evaluate the measures for mitigating climate change. Satellite-based measurements of greenhouse gases greatly advance the way of monitoring atmospheric CO₂ concentration. In this study, we propose an approach for estimating anthropogenic CO₂ emissions by an artificial neural network using column-average dry air mole fraction of CO₂ (XCO₂) derived from observations of Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) in China. First, we use annual XCO₂ anomalies (dXCO₂) derived from XCO₂ and anthropogenic emission data during 2010⁻2014 as the training dataset to build a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model. Second, applying the built model to annual dXCO₂ in 2015, we estimate the corresponding emission and verify them using ODIAC emission. As a results, the estimated emissions significantly demonstrate positive correlation with that of ODIAC CO₂ emissions especially in the areas with high anthropogenic CO₂ emissions. Our results indicate that XCO₂ data from satellite observations can be applied in estimating anthropogenic CO₂ emissions at regional scale by the machine learning. This developed method can estimate carbon emission inventory in a data-driven way. In particular, it is expected that the estimation accuracy can be further improved when combined with other data sources, related CO₂ uptake and emissions, from satellite observations."
