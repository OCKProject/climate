 <p>Carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>) is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas and its concentration in atmosphere has been increasing rapidly due to the increase of anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. Quantifying anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions is essential to evaluate the measures for mitigating climate change. Satellite-based measurements of greenhouse gases greatly advance the way of monitoring atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration. In this study, we propose an approach for estimating anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions by an artificial neural network using column-average dry air mole fraction of CO
  <sub>2</sub> (XCO
  <sub>2</sub>) derived from observations of Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) in China. First, we use annual XCO
  <sub>2</sub> anomalies (dXCO
  <sub>2</sub>) derived from XCO
  <sub>2</sub> and anthropogenic emission data during 2010â€“2014 as the training dataset to build a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model. Second, applying the built model to annual dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> in 2015, we estimate the corresponding emission and verify them using ODIAC emission. As a results, the estimated emissions significantly demonstrate positive correlation with that of ODIAC CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions especially in the areas with high anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. Our results indicate that XCO
  <sub>2</sub> data from satellite observations can be applied in estimating anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions at regional scale by the machine learning. This developed method can estimate carbon emission inventory in a data-driven way. In particular, it is expected that the estimation accuracy can be further improved when combined with other data sources, related CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake and emissions, from satellite observations.
