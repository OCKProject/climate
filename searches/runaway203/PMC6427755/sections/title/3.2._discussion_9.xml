  <sub>CO2</sub> and Anthropogenic Emissons
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been indicated that the cluster of XCO
  <sub>2</sub> changes derived from GOSAT observations shows a correlating coefficient of 0.5 with anthropogenic emission. This correlation is more significant than a single grid of XCO
  <sub>2</sub> as the atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> measurement is an instantaneous snapshot of the realistic atmosphere [
  <a rid="B33-sensors-19-01118" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-sensors-19-01118">33</a>]. Its clustering analysis is derived from original XCO
  <sub>2</sub> data.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We segment the ODIAC emissions which are binned according to every 0.3 t/yr of lgE (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01118-f007" href="#sensors-19-01118-f007">Figure 7</a>a) using mean emission calculated from annual emission during 2010â€“2015, and then make correlation analysis between the mean of emission and mean of dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> within binned regions. It is found that the segmental mean of dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> demonstrate a significant and positive correlation with ODIAC emissions in which the determined coefficient (R
  <span class="sup">2</span>) for all data is up to 0.82 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01118-f007" href="#sensors-19-01118-f007">Figure 7</a>b) and the dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> demonstrate strong positive linear correlation with emission starting from 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> t/yr where R
  <span class="sup">2</span> is up to 0.95 (red line in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01118-f007" href="#sensors-19-01118-f007">Figure 7</a>b). The dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> is almost unchanged in the region with emission lower than 10
  <span class="sup">4</span> t/yr. These results imply that satellite observations of atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> could be used to estimate regional anthropogenic emissions for those regions with larger magnitude of anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. Additionally, we overlay the CARMA power plants dataset on the mean dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> from the annual dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> during 2010 to 2015 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01118-f008" href="#sensors-19-01118-f008">Figure 8</a>a). It can be seen that the high dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> are corresponding to high-density power plants, especially in northeast China. We accumulate the magnitude of emissions of power plants within one grid of mapping XCO
  <sub>2</sub> dataset, then we segment emissions of power plants which are binned according to every 0.3 t of lgE, and take correlation analysis between the mean of power plants emission and the mean of dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> within binned regions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01118-f008" href="#sensors-19-01118-f008">Figure 8</a>a). dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> demonstrate strong positive linear correlation with power plants emission starting from 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> t (blue dots). The grids they represent are distributed consistently with high dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> area. The result demonstrates a R
  <span class="sup">2</span> of 0.59 which is less than regional statistics. Power plants emission lower than 10
  <span class="sup">5.5</span> t demonstrate weak linear correlation with dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> because the influence of CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake of biosphere.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01118-f008" href="#sensors-19-01118-f008">Figure 8</a>a, it can be found that the dXCO
  <sub>2</sub> in western area, the desert area of Xinjiang, shows high values even if there are much less anthropogenic emission over this area as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-01118-f004" href="#sensors-19-01118-f004">Figure 4</a>b. This is likely resulted in the uncertainty of ACOS XCO
  <sub>2</sub> retrievals in desert which has been indicated by Bie et al. [
