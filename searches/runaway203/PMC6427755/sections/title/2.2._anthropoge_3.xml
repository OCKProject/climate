 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected two datasets of the bottom-up anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions. One is the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide (ODIAC) for same years as the used XCO
  <sub>2</sub> dataset in this study. The other is the CARbon Monitoring for Action (CARMA) power plant database in 2009. The specifications of these data are described in 
  <a rid="sensors-19-01118-t001" ref-type="table" href="#sensors-19-01118-t001">Table 1</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ODIAC emissions data product is a global 1° × 1° gridded monthly fossil fuel CO
  <sub>2</sub> emission inventory, developed based on country level fossil fuel CO
  <sub>2</sub> emission estimates, fuel consumption statistics, satellite-observed nightlight data, and point source information (geographical locations and emission intensities) from the CARbon Monitoring for Action (CARMA) power plant database (ODIAC2015a, available at 
  <span xlink:href="http://db.cger.nies.go.jp/dataset/ODIAC/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://db.cger.nies.go.jp/dataset/ODIAC/</span>). The global nightlight data were used as a geo-referenced, spatial proxy to determine the spatial extent of anthropogenic emissions from line and diffused (area) sources (e.g., road traffic, residential or commercial fuel consumption) [
  <a rid="B25-sensors-19-01118" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-sensors-19-01118">25</a>]. The ODIAC gridded emissions fields defined on a global rectangular (latitude ×longitude) coordinate are remapped to meet the grids resolutions for each simulation domain.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, the CO2 emissions from power plant, which is one of the dominant CO
  <sub>2</sub> emitting sources, are collected in the study area from the database of Carbon Monitoring for Action (CARMA, available at 
  <span xlink:href="http://carma.org/plant" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://carma.org/plant</span>). At the same time, we unify the units of the two sets of emission data to ton, and take the logarithm of two emission data base on 10 (refer to as lgE) to facilitate the calculation.
