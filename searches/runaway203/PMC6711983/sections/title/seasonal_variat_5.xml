 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to such small variations during January–October, a marked increase in [SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span>]
  <sub>nmb</sub> up to 93–127 ng m
  <span class="sup">−3</span> was observed in November at Dome C. Such an anomalous event was obscured by the increasing trends of mb-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> towards summer. The sum of nmb-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> during November accounts for ca. 50% of monthly nss-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> and ca. 10% of annual nss-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> at Dome C (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). Furthermore, the slight increase in [SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span>]
  <sub>nmb</sub> (38–52 ng m
  <span class="sup">−3</span>) was observed at DDU in exactly the same time period as that at Dome C, in the second week of November. Given the same timing at both sites and its higher amplitude at the inland site than at the coastal site, we first explored the possibility that this [SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span>]
  <sub>nmb</sub> increase is caused by nmb-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> emission located in inland Antarctica. However, this possibility is unlikely given that there has not been observed specific increases in volcanic activity of Mt. Erebus (77°53′S, 167°17′E), an active volcano on the Antarctic continent, during November 2011 based on satellite imagery data

  <sub>2</sub> emissions from anthropogenic activities over Antarctica related to scientific activities are unlikely since they are generally highest during January–February
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span> and not in November. One attributable process is long-range transport of nmb-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> from other continents, which is supported by the significant correlation between our estimated [SO

  <span class="sup">210</span>Pb

  <span class="sup">2−</span>]
  <sub>nmb</sub> increase remained uncertain (detailed in Supplementary Information). Although this nmb-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> corresponds to only 10% of annual nss-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> in the present Antarctic atmosphere, future work to clarify its source is necessary for interpretation of the deep ice core record since it is suggested that the dominant sulfur source shifted to nmb-SO
