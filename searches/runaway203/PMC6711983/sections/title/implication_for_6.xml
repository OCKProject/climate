  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span> imply that marine biologically produced SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> is decreased during the glacial period. This conclusion is more consistent with the marine sediment core records that show a decrease in biological carbon export production during glacial times around the vicinity of Antarctica at latitudes higher than 50°S
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. As a consequence, our result tends to reconciliate conclusions drawn from ice core records and the marine sediment core records, with both suggesting a decrease in marine productivity around Antarctica during cold climates. At the same time, the estimated result shows that nmb-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> increased during the glacial period relative to the interglacial. Given that the mineral dust fluxes to Antarctica are controlled by changes in transport efficiency associated with the hydrological cycle
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>, it is likely that the increased nmb-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> during the glacial period was also sourced from other continents, although its sulfur source remains uncertain. The recent work based on the SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> and Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> ion concentrations over eight glacial cycles
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> estimated that the proportional contributions of biogenic sulfur during cold periods could decrease to 24% or 52% in total nss-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span>, which depends on either assuming nss-Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> originated only from primary terrestrial CaSO
  <sub>4</sub> or from partial contribution of secondarily produced CaSO
  <sub>4</sub> via the reaction between dust-sourced CaCO
  <sub>3</sub> and marine biogenic sulfur. The latter case is in good agreement with our estimate of 48 ± 10% in the last glacial period (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), suggesting the nss-SO
  <sub>4</sub> during glacial periods may include both primary and secondary products.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our estimate that the relative importance of nmb-SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span> had increased during the glacial period advances the understanding of the radiative cooling through the past climate change. Assuming that the micron-sized CaSO
  <sub>4</sub> salt in Antarctic deep ice cores was secondarily produced during their transport from South America, Iizuka 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> concluded that the radiative cooling by marine biogenic sulfur had increased during the glacial periods, which is against the CLAW hypothesis proposed by Charlson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. By contrast, our result suggests the sulfur source during glacial periods is not entirely marine biogenic but rather includes continental SO
  <sub>4</sub>
  <span class="sup">2−</span>. If CaSO
  <sub>4</sub> during glacial period contained continental sulfur, those particles would have brought the radiative cooling to broad areas including a part of the continents in the mid-latitude of the Southern Hemisphere, while there would not have been influenced when assuming marine biogenic sulfur only. Therefore, the radiative cooling by sulfate may have been stronger than the previous estimate that had assumed a marine biogenic sulfur source alone
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Quantitatively, it is worth noting that 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>nmb</sub> during inter-glacial and glacial periods were 41 ± 11% and 52 ± 10%, respectively, based on δ
  <span class="sup">34</span>S
  <sub>nss</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>), and this difference is smaller than the relative increase in CaSO
  <sub>4</sub> from 7 ± 4% during inter-glacial period to 56 ± 14% during glacial period
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Therefore, although it is true that the increased CaSO
  <sub>4</sub> in the glacial period includes both primary and secondarily products, the changes in sulfur source should be taken into account since it would consequently affect the radiative forcing.
