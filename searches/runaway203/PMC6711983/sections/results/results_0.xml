  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a> and Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). During January–March, the δ

  <sub>nss</sub> values then increase during August–December, with a considerable decrease in November at Dome C, in contrast to the gradual change observed at DDU. This specific November trend at Dome C is discussed below. Consequently, the seasonal δ

  <sub>nss</sub> cycles and their amplitudes are quite consistent between the two sites.
