  <p>Intrinsic variability in MCDW thickness and cross-shelf exchange. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Intrinsic variability in ocean properties are shown at the ice front (A; 116.7° E, 66.7° S) and near the shelf break (B; 120° E, 66.0° S). 
   <span class="bold">b</span> Potential temperature at the ice front, location marked as A, with the smoothed −1.5 °C temperature anomaly contour, representing the thickness of the bottom MCDW layer, shown in white. 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Area-averaged melt rate for the TIS shown raw (grey line) and smoothed (blue line), and correlates well with MCDW thickness. 
   <span class="bold">d</span> Meridional volume flux integrated over depth, with raw monthly averages (grey line) and smoothed (orange line) values. Negative values represent southward integrated transport, and hence transport onto the continental shelf
