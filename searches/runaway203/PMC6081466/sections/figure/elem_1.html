         <p>Intrinsic variability in MCDW thickness and cross-shelf exchange. 
            <span>a</span> Intrinsic variability in ocean properties are shown at the ice front (A; 116.7° E,
            66.7° S) and near the shelf break (B; 120° E, 66.0° S). 
            <span>b</span> Potential temperature at the ice front, location marked as A, with the smoothed −1.5 °C
            temperature anomaly contour, representing the thickness of the bottom MCDW layer,
            shown in white. 
            <span>c</span> Area-averaged melt rate for the TIS shown raw (grey line) and smoothed (blue line),
            and correlates well with MCDW thickness. 
            <span>d</span> Meridional volume flux integrated over depth, with raw monthly averages (grey line)
            and smoothed (orange line) values. Negative values represent southward integrated
            transport, and hence transport onto the continental shelf
