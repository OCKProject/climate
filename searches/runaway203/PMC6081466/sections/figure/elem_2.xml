  <p>Intrinsic variability in basal melting. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Average melt rate (5.0 m yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span> with standard deviation of 0.5 m yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) and 
   <span class="bold">b</span> area-averaged melt rate for the Totten Ice Shelf. The first 30 years is considered model spin-up and is excluded from analysis. 
   <span class="bold">c</span> Spectral variance (power spectrum times frequency) for the melt rate anomaly, constructed by removing the climatology. 
   <span class="bold">d</span> Melt rate EOF mode 1 and 
   <span class="bold">e</span> PC 1. 
   <span class="bold">f</span> Spectral variance for melt EOF mode 1. 
   <span class="bold">g</span> Melt EOF mode 2 and 
   <span class="bold">h</span> PC 2. 
   <span class="bold">i</span> Spectral variance for melt EOF mode 2. 
   <span class="bold">j</span>–
   <span class="bold">m</span> SSA in-band % explained variance in melt rate, with band duration (years) and min–max variance shown. Inset in 
   <span class="bold">a</span> shows location. Orange line in 
   <span class="bold">b</span>, 
   <span class="bold">e</span>, 
   <span class="bold">h</span> is smoothed with a 1.5-yr filter, while grey line is raw data. Colour bars in 
   <span class="bold">j</span>–
   <span class="bold">m</span> are scaled to the min/max variance range, as given as percentages on the left side of each panel
