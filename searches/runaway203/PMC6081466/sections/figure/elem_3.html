         <p>Intrinsic variability in bottom temperature. 
            <span>a</span> Bottom temperature anomaly EOF mode 1 and 
            <span>b</span> PC 1. 
            <span>c</span> Spectral variance (power spectrum times frequency) for bottom temperature PC 1. 
            <span>d</span> EOF mode 2 and 
            <span>e</span> PC 2. 
            <span>f</span> Spectral variance for bottom temperature PC 2. SSA in-band variance is shown for
            time bands 
            <span>g</span> 0–1 years, 
            <span>h</span> 1–5 years, 
            <span>i</span> 5–10 years and 
            <span>j</span> 10–30 years, with min–max explained variance shown. Thin contours show bathymetry
            of 500, 1500, 2000, 2500 m. Orange line in 
            <span>b</span> and 
            <span>e</span> is smoothed with a 1.5-yr filter, while grey line is raw data. Colour bars in 
            <span>g</span>–
            <span>j</span> are scaled to the min/max variance range, as given as percentages in the lower left
