      <p>Low frequency intrinsic ocean variability has an unknown impact on Antarctic ice shelves,
         yet can arise even in the absence of varying climate forcing. Here, the authors show
         that this variability significantly affects modelled basal melting under the Totten
         Ice Shelf, with implications for the attribution of change.
