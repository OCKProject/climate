 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean conditions at the ice shelf cavity entrance drive melt rate changes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>, location A). Depth-time plots of the temperature (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) profile show winter water (WW), the product of the seasonal sea ice formation cycle, overlaying modified circumpolar deep water (MCDW). There is also occasional formation of Antarctic surface water (not shown). These water mass properties are very similar to previous observations in this region

  </span>. The thickness of the MCDW layer, here shown by fluctuations in the −1.5 °C contour (white line in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>), displays low-frequency variability. The interannual variability in melt rate (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>) correlates very well with MCDW thickness (
  <span class="italic">r</span>-value = 0.87, with lag = 0 months) and responds linearly. This MCDW thickness variability is an intrinsic ocean response to normal-year surface forcing (wind and fluxes) and directly drives interannual variability in melt rate. Near to the continental shelf break (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>, location B), the flow characteristics show interannual variability. This location, chosen to coincide with high variability in bottom temperature anomaly from an Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis (see Results section ‘Bottom temperature interannual variability’), shows significant interannual variability in southward depth-integrated volume flux across the grid cell, with an approximately 5–7-year period. This shows the intrinsic ocean variability associated with exchange onto the continental shelf, but the low correlation with melt rate (
  <span class="italic">r</span>-value = 0.02) suggests that local processes have the biggest impact on melting.
