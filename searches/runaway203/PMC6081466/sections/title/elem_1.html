         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the COREv1 run is not forced with any interannual climate modes, any resulting
            low-frequency variability must be internally generated by the model or enters as intrinsic
            variability through the ocean boundaries. In contrast, the COREv2 run represents the
            response of the ice shelf to externally forced interannual variability. The COREv1
            and COREv2 simulations produce a mean basal melting of 5.0 ± 0.5 m yr
            <span>−1</span> (for years 30–150) and 5.2±0.5 m yr
            <span>−1</span> (for years 1949–2007), respectively (Fig. 
            <a>1b</a>). This is half the glaciological inferred value
            <span><a>23</a></span>, however the mean spatial distributions (see Results section ‘Intrinsic variability
            in melt rate’) are similar to previous studies
            <span><a>4</a>,
               <a>24</a>,
               <a>25</a></span>. The mean lower melt rate results mainly from the cooler CORE ocean boundary conditions
            that introduce a constant cold bias as compared to previous modelling studies which
            utilised different forcing conditions (see Methods).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the intrinsic ocean variability model (COREv1 run) and the interannual variability
            model (COREv2 run) exhibit basal melting variability on a range of timescales. As
            the COREv1 run is forced with a repeated normal-year atmosphere and the intrinsically
            varying ocean resulting from the application of that atmosphere forcing, it represents
            the intrinsic melt rate response. In contrast, the COREv2 run contains the ice shelf
            response to the interannually varying ocean and atmosphere over the period 1949–2007.
            The ratio of COREv2 (with all natural, intrinsic, internal and anthropogenic forcings)
            to COREv1 (intrinsic-only) melt rate anomaly variances is 1.7. This is equivalent
            to a signal-to-noise ratio, where the ‘signal is the combined deterministic and intrinsic
            response from COREv2 and the ‘noise is the intrinsic response from COREv1 (see Methods).
            This highlights the potential for intrinsic processes to drive significant low-frequency
            variability in mean melt rates.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying changes in basal melting of TIS due to anthropogenic climate change and
            known climate modes (e.g. ENSO), requires a knowledge of the response due to intrinsic
            ocean dynamics. This study hereafter focusses on the low-frequency response of basal
            melting to intrinsic ocean variability. Here we are only concerned with this type
            of variability, noting that additional questions about the thermodynamic response
            of the ice shelf to the longer term climate (COREv2) are the subject of follow-up
            studies.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean conditions at the ice shelf cavity entrance drive melt rate changes (Fig. 
            <a>2a</a>, location A). Depth-time plots of the temperature (Fig. 
            <a>2b</a>) profile show winter water (WW), the product of the seasonal sea ice formation cycle,
            overlaying modified circumpolar deep water (MCDW). There is also occasional formation
            of Antarctic surface water (not shown). These water mass properties are very similar
            to previous observations in this region
            <span><a>26</a>–
               <a>29</a></span>. The thickness of the MCDW layer, here shown by fluctuations in the −1.5 °C contour
            (white line in Fig. 
            <a>2b</a>), displays low-frequency variability. The interannual variability in melt rate (Fig. 
            <a>2c</a>) correlates very well with MCDW thickness (
            <span>r</span>-value = 0.87, with lag = 0 months) and responds linearly. This MCDW thickness variability
            is an intrinsic ocean response to normal-year surface forcing (wind and fluxes) and
            directly drives interannual variability in melt rate. Near to the continental shelf
            break (Fig. 
            <a>2a</a>, location B), the flow characteristics show interannual variability. This location,
            chosen to coincide with high variability in bottom temperature anomaly from an Empirical
            Orthogonal Function analysis (see Results section ‘Bottom temperature interannual
            variability’), shows significant interannual variability in southward depth-integrated
            volume flux across the grid cell, with an approximately 5–7-year period. This shows
            the intrinsic ocean variability associated with exchange onto the continental shelf,
            but the low correlation with melt rate (
            <span>r</span>-value = 0.02) suggests that local processes have the biggest impact on melting.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify and characterise modes of variation, we applied two different methodologies
            commonly used for analysing climate data (see Methods). Empirical orthogonal function
            (EOF) analysis identifies spatially invariant patterns in the data and accompanying
            time series that maximise variance. This was used to reduce the dimensionality and
            to decompose spatial and temporal variation into the EOF spatial modes, temporal principal
            components (PCs) and the variance explained by each mode. We restrict our analysis
            to modes explaining &gt;5% of the variance (see Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>1</a> for first 6 modes). The data has been linearly detrended and the climatological mean
            removed prior to analysis.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOF analysis of melt rate anomaly suggests that most variability (57% of variance)
            is explained by mode 1 (EOF1; Fig. 
            <a>3d</a>) which shows wide-scale coherent fluctuations in basal melting, similar to the time-mean
            spatial pattern in Fig. 
            <a>3a</a>. EOF mode 2 (EOF2; 8% of variance) captures enhanced shallow or deep melting, and
            results from water flowing either along the ice shelf front or below the ice shelf
            (Fig. 
            <a>3g</a>). Interannual fluctuations in average melt rate are represented strongly in the first
            PC of the EOF analysis (compare Fig. 
            <a>3e</a> to Fig. 
            <a>3b</a>), which contains ~3-, 5-, ~7-year and multidecadal modes (Fig. 
            <a>3f</a>). The second PC (Fig. 
            <a>3h</a>) contains mostly intra-annual variability (Fig. 
            <a>3i</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the EOF analysis captures spatial patterns of covariability it does not necessarily
            separate physical modes over different timescales. To achieve this, we apply singular
            spectrum analysis (SSA)
            <span><a>12</a>,
               <a>30</a></span>, which identifies spatially coherent regions of variance for a chosen time band,
            to analyse the leading PCs of melt rate and extract secular behaviour present at intra-annual
            (&lt;1 year), interannual (1–5 and 5–10 years) and multidecadal (10–30 year) time bands
            (see Methods).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The in-band SSA variance shows the percentage of total variance at each location within
            defined time bands (Fig. 
            <a>3j–m</a>). Intra-annual modes explain ~40–50% of total variance, and closer to 90% of total
            variance near to the ice front (Fig. 
            <a>3j</a>). These intra-annual modes result from the seasonal cycle in sea ice production and
            winds. As this study focusses on interannual variability, these &lt;1-year modes will
            not be further discussed. Modes with a period of 1–5 years explain on average ~23%
            (maximum of 44% in certain locations) of the total variance in basal melting (Fig. 
            <a>3k</a>), while ~7% (maximum of 21%) of the total variance is explained by modes that occur
            over 5–10 years (Fig. 
            <a>3l</a>). Multidecadal modes in basal melting are present but explain on average ~6% (maximum
            of 24%) of the total variance (Fig. 
            <a>3m</a>). Histograms of in-band SSA variance for the chosen time bands are shown in Supplementary

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low-frequency variation in melt rate is being driven by intrinsic ocean variability.
            EOF analysis of bottom temperature anomaly shows that 32% of variability is explained
            in the shallower, coastal region (Fig. 
            <a>4a, b</a>), and has a multimodal spectrum with power in the interannual time band (Fig. 
            <a>4c</a>). Shelf break exchange (Fig. 
            <a>4d, e</a>) explains 15% of variability and temperature anomaly EOF1 has multimodal power in
            the interannual band (Fig. 
            <a>4f</a>). The intra-annual in-band variance in bottom temperature anomaly peaks along the
            ice front, explaining up to 71% of total variability (Fig. 
            <a>4g</a>), while 1–5 year modes (Fig. 
            <a>4h</a>) produce 40–60% of total variability over the continental shelf. The 5–10 year mode
            (Fig. 
            <a>4i</a>) explains 20–30% of total variability on the continental shelf, while the multidecadal
            mode (Fig. 
            <a>4j</a>) explains 20% of total variance deeper than ~500 m. Bottom temperature variability
            is generally aligned along bathymetric features, indicating that ocean–bathymetry
            interactions are a significant source of variability.
