      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low-frequency variation in melt rate is being driven by intrinsic ocean variability.
         EOF analysis of bottom temperature anomaly shows that 32% of variability is explained
         in the shallower, coastal region (Fig. 
         <a>4a, b</a>), and has a multimodal spectrum with power in the interannual time band (Fig. 
         <a>4c</a>). Shelf break exchange (Fig. 
         <a>4d, e</a>) explains 15% of variability and temperature anomaly EOF1 has multimodal power in
         the interannual band (Fig. 
         <a>4f</a>). The intra-annual in-band variance in bottom temperature anomaly peaks along the
         ice front, explaining up to 71% of total variability (Fig. 
         <a>4g</a>), while 1–5 year modes (Fig. 
         <a>4h</a>) produce 40–60% of total variability over the continental shelf. The 5–10 year mode
         (Fig. 
         <a>4i</a>) explains 20–30% of total variability on the continental shelf, while the multidecadal
         mode (Fig. 
         <a>4j</a>) explains 20% of total variance deeper than ~500 m. Bottom temperature variability
         is generally aligned along bathymetric features, indicating that ocean–bathymetry
         interactions are a significant source of variability.
