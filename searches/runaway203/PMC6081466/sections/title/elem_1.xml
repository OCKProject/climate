  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the COREv1 run is not forced with any interannual climate modes, any resulting low-frequency variability must be internally generated by the model or enters as intrinsic variability through the ocean boundaries. In contrast, the COREv2 run represents the response of the ice shelf to externally forced interannual variability. The COREv1 and COREv2 simulations produce a mean basal melting of 5.0 ± 0.5 m yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (for years 30–150) and 5.2±0.5 m yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (for years 1949–2007), respectively (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). This is half the glaciological inferred value
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span>, however the mean spatial distributions (see Results section ‘Intrinsic variability in melt rate’) are similar to previous studies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span>. The mean lower melt rate results mainly from the cooler CORE ocean boundary conditions that introduce a constant cold bias as compared to previous modelling studies which utilised different forcing conditions (see Methods).
  </p>
  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the intrinsic ocean variability model (COREv1 run) and the interannual variability model (COREv2 run) exhibit basal melting variability on a range of timescales. As the COREv1 run is forced with a repeated normal-year atmosphere and the intrinsically varying ocean resulting from the application of that atmosphere forcing, it represents the intrinsic melt rate response. In contrast, the COREv2 run contains the ice shelf response to the interannually varying ocean and atmosphere over the period 1949–2007. The ratio of COREv2 (with all natural, intrinsic, internal and anthropogenic forcings) to COREv1 (intrinsic-only) melt rate anomaly variances is 1.7. This is equivalent to a signal-to-noise ratio, where the ‘signal is the combined deterministic and intrinsic response from COREv2 and the ‘noise is the intrinsic response from COREv1 (see Methods). This highlights the potential for intrinsic processes to drive significant low-frequency variability in mean melt rates.</p>
  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying changes in basal melting of TIS due to anthropogenic climate change and known climate modes (e.g. ENSO), requires a knowledge of the response due to intrinsic ocean dynamics. This study hereafter focusses on the low-frequency response of basal melting to intrinsic ocean variability. Here we are only concerned with this type of variability, noting that additional questions about the thermodynamic response of the ice shelf to the longer term climate (COREv2) are the subject of follow-up studies.</p>

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>, location A). Depth-time plots of the temperature (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) profile show winter water (WW), the product of the seasonal sea ice formation cycle, overlaying modified circumpolar deep water (MCDW). There is also occasional formation of Antarctic surface water (not shown). These water mass properties are very similar to previous observations in this region

   </span>. The thickness of the MCDW layer, here shown by fluctuations in the −1.5 °C contour (white line in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>), displays low-frequency variability. The interannual variability in melt rate (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>) correlates very well with MCDW thickness (
   <span class="italic">r</span>-value = 0.87, with lag = 0 months) and responds linearly. This MCDW thickness variability is an intrinsic ocean response to normal-year surface forcing (wind and fluxes) and directly drives interannual variability in melt rate. Near to the continental shelf break (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>, location B), the flow characteristics show interannual variability. This location, chosen to coincide with high variability in bottom temperature anomaly from an Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis (see Results section ‘Bottom temperature interannual variability’), shows significant interannual variability in southward depth-integrated volume flux across the grid cell, with an approximately 5–7-year period. This shows the intrinsic ocean variability associated with exchange onto the continental shelf, but the low correlation with melt rate (
   <span class="italic">r</span>-value = 0.02) suggests that local processes have the biggest impact on melting.

  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify and characterise modes of variation, we applied two different methodologies commonly used for analysing climate data (see Methods). Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis identifies spatially invariant patterns in the data and accompanying time series that maximise variance. This was used to reduce the dimensionality and to decompose spatial and temporal variation into the EOF spatial modes, temporal principal components (PCs) and the variance explained by each mode. We restrict our analysis to modes explaining &gt;5% of the variance (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> for first 6 modes). The data has been linearly detrended and the climatological mean removed prior to analysis.
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOF analysis of melt rate anomaly suggests that most variability (57% of variance) is explained by mode 1 (EOF1; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>) which shows wide-scale coherent fluctuations in basal melting, similar to the time-mean spatial pattern in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>. EOF mode 2 (EOF2; 8% of variance) captures enhanced shallow or deep melting, and results from water flowing either along the ice shelf front or below the ice shelf (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3g</a>). Interannual fluctuations in average melt rate are represented strongly in the first PC of the EOF analysis (compare Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a> to Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>), which contains ~3-, 5-, ~7-year and multidecadal modes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3f</a>). The second PC (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3h</a>) contains mostly intra-annual variability (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3i</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the EOF analysis captures spatial patterns of covariability it does not necessarily separate physical modes over different timescales. To achieve this, we apply singular spectrum analysis (SSA)
   <span class="sup">

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>, which identifies spatially coherent regions of variance for a chosen time band, to analyse the leading PCs of melt rate and extract secular behaviour present at intra-annual (&lt;1 year), interannual (1–5 and 5–10 years) and multidecadal (10–30 year) time bands (see Methods).
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The in-band SSA variance shows the percentage of total variance at each location within defined time bands (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3j–m</a>). Intra-annual modes explain ~40–50% of total variance, and closer to 90% of total variance near to the ice front (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3j</a>). These intra-annual modes result from the seasonal cycle in sea ice production and winds. As this study focusses on interannual variability, these &lt;1-year modes will not be further discussed. Modes with a period of 1–5 years explain on average ~23% (maximum of 44% in certain locations) of the total variance in basal melting (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3k</a>), while ~7% (maximum of 21%) of the total variance is explained by modes that occur over 5–10 years (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3l</a>). Multidecadal modes in basal melting are present but explain on average ~6% (maximum of 24%) of the total variance (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3m</a>). Histograms of in-band SSA variance for the chosen time bands are shown in Supplementary Fig.

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low-frequency variation in melt rate is being driven by intrinsic ocean variability. EOF analysis of bottom temperature anomaly shows that 32% of variability is explained in the shallower, coastal region (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a, b</a>), and has a multimodal spectrum with power in the interannual time band (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). Shelf break exchange (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d, e</a>) explains 15% of variability and temperature anomaly EOF1 has multimodal power in the interannual band (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4f</a>). The intra-annual in-band variance in bottom temperature anomaly peaks along the ice front, explaining up to 71% of total variability (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4g</a>), while 1–5 year modes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4h</a>) produce 40–60% of total variability over the continental shelf. The 5–10 year mode (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4i</a>) explains 20–30% of total variability on the continental shelf, while the multidecadal mode (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4j</a>) explains 20% of total variance deeper than ~500 m. Bottom temperature variability is generally aligned along bathymetric features, indicating that ocean–bathymetry interactions are a significant source of variability.
