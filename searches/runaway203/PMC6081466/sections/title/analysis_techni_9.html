      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cross correlations of MCDW depth and volume flux with melt rate were calculated and
         a lag of 0 months is found to be optimal. As analysis is computed on monthly averages,
         a short lag or lead of less than 1 month is possible.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is used to decompose a time series into
         orthogonal spatial patterns (EOFs) along with the associated time series or principal
         components (PCs) and the variance explained by each mode
         <span><a>43</a></span>. While EOF analysis can provide useful decomposition of data, it has limitations
         such as domain dependence. While the leading mode(s) may often be physical, successively
         higher order modes, which explain less of the remaining variance, are unphysical as
         a consequence of the mode orthonormalisation.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consequently, we employ singular spectral analysis (SSA) to express the original time
         series as a linear combination of components derived from singular value decomposition
         of the (time) lagged covariance matrix with maximum lag 
         <span>M</span>. The resulting modes together sum to the original time series, while the slowest
         varying mode represents the non-linear trend with (time) variability of the order
         of the chosen embedding dimension 
         <span>M</span> or longer. The decomposition is data driven (based on smaller, lagged portions of
         the original time series) and does not require projection on predefined basis functions,
         as required for example with Fourier transform methods. SSA readily provides non-linear
         smoothing of the original time series with the degree of smoothing controlled by 
         <span>M</span><span><a>12</a>,
            <a>30</a></span>. The SSA in-band variance shows the percentage of total variance present in the chosen
         time band bounded by predefined embedding dimension values, i.e. 0–1, 1–5, 5–10 and
         10–30 years as in Figs.
