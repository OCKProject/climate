      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean conditions at the ice shelf cavity entrance drive melt rate changes (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>, location A). Depth-time plots of the temperature (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>) profile show winter water (WW), the product of the seasonal sea ice formation cycle,
         overlaying modified circumpolar deep water (MCDW). There is also occasional formation
         of Antarctic surface water (not shown). These water mass properties are very similar
         to previous observations in this region
         <span><a>26</a>–
            <a>29</a></span>. The thickness of the MCDW layer, here shown by fluctuations in the −1.5 °C contour
         (white line in Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>), displays low-frequency variability. The interannual variability in melt rate (Fig. 
         <a>2c</a>) correlates very well with MCDW thickness (
         <span>r</span>-value = 0.87, with lag = 0 months) and responds linearly. This MCDW thickness variability
         is an intrinsic ocean response to normal-year surface forcing (wind and fluxes) and
         directly drives interannual variability in melt rate. Near to the continental shelf
         break (Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>, location B), the flow characteristics show interannual variability. This location,
         chosen to coincide with high variability in bottom temperature anomaly from an Empirical
         Orthogonal Function analysis (see Results section ‘Bottom temperature interannual
         variability’), shows significant interannual variability in southward depth-integrated
         volume flux across the grid cell, with an approximately 5–7-year period. This shows
         the intrinsic ocean variability associated with exchange onto the continental shelf,
         but the low correlation with melt rate (
         <span>r</span>-value = 0.02) suggests that local processes have the biggest impact on melting.

               <p>Intrinsic variability in MCDW thickness and cross-shelf exchange. 
                  <span>a</span> Intrinsic variability in ocean properties are shown at the ice front (A; 116.7° E,
                  66.7° S) and near the shelf break (B; 120° E, 66.0° S). 
                  <span>b</span> Potential temperature at the ice front, location marked as A, with the smoothed −1.5 °C
                  temperature anomaly contour, representing the thickness of the bottom MCDW layer,
                  shown in white. 
                  <span>c</span> Area-averaged melt rate for the TIS shown raw (grey line) and smoothed (blue line),
                  and correlates well with MCDW thickness. 
                  <span>d</span> Meridional volume flux integrated over depth, with raw monthly averages (grey line)
                  and smoothed (orange line) values. Negative values represent southward integrated
                  transport, and hence transport onto the continental shelf
