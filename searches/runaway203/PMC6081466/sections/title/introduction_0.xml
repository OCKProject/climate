 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the rate of change of ice shelf thinning and the processes governing change is critical for understanding mass balance and hence the Antarctic ice sheet contribution to sea level rise. Over the period 2003–2008 (~5 years), the Totten Glacier Ice Shelf (TIS) was observed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span> to be lowering at ~0.41 m yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. However, extending the observational satellite record to encompass the period 1994–2012 (~18 years)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span> showed that the thickness of the TIS was subject to large periodic 3–4 year fluctuations of approximately ±40 m with almost no net thickness change (within the error bars) over the 18 year period. Further, interannual variation has been detected in surface velocity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> and the grounding line location is showing change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. It is not clear how much of the observed temporal change in TIS is as a result of internal glacier-ice shelf dynamics or is in response to variability in ocean-driven basal melting. We have chosen to characterise the part of melt rate variability that arises in response to variability intrinsic to the ocean. This study serves as a necessary basis for understanding and quantifying what fraction of the observed variations in melt rate are independent of natural fluctuations in the climate modes and trends arising from anthropogenic forcing.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Basal melting thermodynamically couples the ocean to the ice shelf system. As a result, ice shelf thickness responds to variability in the nearby ocean system. This variability could be externally forced, for example, by climate change, interannual and multidecadal climate modes, the annual cycle, or tides. In addition, variability could also be generated by the non-linear intrinsic ocean response to forcing, as opposed to the deterministic response from interannual atmospheric forcing. Low-frequency intrinsic ocean variability results from non-linear interactions within the ocean and in response to stochastic-to-seasonal timescale changes in atmospheric forcing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, in line with the paradigm of Stochastic Climate Models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. As a result, the ice sheet will exhibit a combined response to both intrinsic and externally forced climate variability.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observations of basal melting and ice shelf change generally consist of short records which limit the ability to distinguish intrinsic from forced variability. Advances have been made in identifying the ice shelf response to observed low-frequency internal variations in the Southern Hemisphere climate. For example, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been suggested to drive stronger cross-shelf transport of oceanic heat leading to a lowering of Amundsen Sea ice shelves
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. Conversely, atmospheric hindcast models for 1979–2015 have suggested that ENSO has a statistically non-significant impact on the westerly winds which drive stronger cross-shelf transport
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. This highlights the complex impact that low-frequency climate variations have on ice shelf mass loss. It also emphasises the importance of ensuring that correlations and trends are statistically significant, particularly given the short satellite record relative to the timescale of climate variations like ENSO.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean models can be used to simulate and quantify variability beneath ice shelves. Idealised coupled ice sheet-ocean models subject to periodic variability in oceanic heat content have indicated the ice sheet response is dependent on the forcing periodicity in relation to the ice shelf residence time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. However, the origin of this periodic forcing and the response of a realistic ice shelf is uncertain.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, we present simulations of the response of basal melting beneath TIS to intrinsic ocean variability (model domain shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). We use lateral boundary conditions that contain only intrinsic ocean variability and repeated normal-year atmospheric forcing (Coordinated Ocean ice Reference Experiment version 1; COREv1)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span> to quantify the interannual intrinsic variability that impacts basal melting. Non-linear ocean processes and the response to rapid wind changes produces a significant degree of intrinsic variability in water properties on the continental shelf and thus basal melting beneath TIS. Further simulations compare the basal melt response from only intrinsic variability to the full climate response from 1949 to 2007 (Coordinated Ocean ice Reference Experiment version 2; COREv2)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> and show that intrinsic ocean variability can produce a similar magnitude response to the interannual climate forcing. These results demonstrate the need to account for the contribution of intrinsic ocean processes in order to correctly detect and attribute ice shelf change.
