 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We show melting responds rapidly and linearly to the thickness of the relatively warm MCDW layer (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>) present at the ice front. Cross-shelf exchange displays intrinsic variability but low correlation with melting, suggesting that intrinsic variability in melting results from local processes like wind-driven changes to the MCDW layer thermocline depth, rather than cross-shelf exchange. Comparison of the COREv1 (intrinsic ocean variability) run to a sensitivity study where the interannual intrinsic ocean variability is removed from the lateral boundary conditions, shows that indeed the variability that impacts the supply of ocean heat to the ice shelf cavity is generated within our model (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). We can speculate that the non-linear ocean processes that generate such intrinsic ocean variability could include long-period baroclinic instabilities, which when subject to essentially stochastic winds, give rise to variability in ocean properties across a wide band of frequencies. This includes low-frequency modulation of the thickness of the MCDW layer on the continental shelf.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chosen surface and lateral boundary conditions mean that any model variability with a period of greater than one year must be intrinsic ocean variability that is generated within the model, or imported through the Northern, Eastern and Western lateral boundaries (see Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>). Intrinsic variability in melting occurs underneath the entire ice shelf with a maximum range of ~1 m yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>). The period of variation is multimodal but has dominant periods of ~3 and ~7 years (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3f, i</a>). The presence of intrinsic variability is weakest at the shallow ice front, which is most susceptible to seasonal sea ice and wind processes, and is stronger at depth (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3k–m</a>). Up to 44% of 1–5 year variability and up to 21% of 5–10 year variability in melt rate results from intrinsic processes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The in-phase response and high degree of variability that is explained by melt EOF1 suggests that cavity waters rapidly adjust to ocean heat entering this relatively small volume (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). Furthermore, the coherent response suggests that a reasonably representative assessment of basal melting can be obtained with few observations. The in-phase response also makes basal melting beneath TIS a good candidate for data assimilation and for parameterisation into an ice sheet model.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high degree of variability in basal melting that results from intrinsic modes present in the 1–5 year time band (up to 44%) could contribute to the ~3–4 year period variations observed in TIS thickness

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, we find that variability in bottom temperature occurs mainly on the shallower regions of the continental shelf (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>), likely resulting from changes in thermocline depth in response to surface wind forcing with a peak 5–10 year periodicity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>). The second EOF (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>) captures cross-shelf exchange and associated warm water pathways. Both MCDW layer thickness and cross-shelf exchange are shown to contain large low-frequency variations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>, 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">c</a>). The similar periodicity to EOF mode 1 results from a common mechanism as upwelling responds to wind forcing. The relationship between basal melting and wind stress is elsewhere demonstrated to be caused by Ekman pumping and upwelling of oceanic heat, which in turn correlates well with observed TIS surface velocity anomalies

  </span>. However, it is difficult to extract the impact of intrinsic interannual variability in melt rate from these broad-scale products due to the disparate temporal and spatial scales, and relatively short observation periods. Nevertheless, the presence of interannual variability in multiple sources, with similar modes, suggests that some degree of the observed variability results from intrinsic processes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has implications for observing and understanding ice shelf-ocean interaction. Basal melting can vary periodically with low-frequency variability, even in the absence of interannual atmospheric forcing. This implies that at least part of the variability associated with ice shelf thickness and consequently mass balance could arise purely through intrinsic ocean processes. This intrinsic variability is subsequently modified by external climate drivers to produce the observed record. However, to fully understand the temporal and spatial impact on ice shelf flow and thickness dynamics, a coupled ocean-ice sheet model is required.</p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have highlighted the emergence of low-frequency intrinsic variability in cross-shelf flow and MCDW layer thickness, which arises through non-linear ocean processes and in response to daily-to-seasonal changes in wind stress. Basal melting beneath TIS responds linearly to MCDW thickness, but has a low correlation with cross-shelf flow, suggesting locally generated intrinsic variability influences the heat available to drive melting. This complex variability in basal melting limits the ability of short-term observational missions to draw conclusions about the long-term response to anthropogenic factors. In this sense, short oceanographic voyages and mooring deployments should be employed together with modelling studies to explore longer term trends. In regions which display significant interannual intrinsic ocean variability, long-term observational time series are critically important. Furthermore, many other ice shelves around Antarctica display some form of interannual variability (e.g. Filchner-Ronne, Amery, Shackleton and Ross
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>). The contribution of intrinsic ocean processes to the observed interannual variability ice shelves around Antarctica is yet unknown. Understanding and distinguishing this component of the signal through modelling studies is important for predicting and detecting climate change, planning observational missions that target regions of low intrinsic variability, and interpreting satellite and in situ observations.
