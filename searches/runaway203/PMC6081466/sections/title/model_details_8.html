      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the response of basal melting to intrinsic ocean variability, we ran
         numerical ocean model simulations of the TIS over a period of 150 years. The ocean
         model is based on the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS)
         <span><a>35</a></span> framework, with modifications to allow thermodynamic interaction between the ocean
         and a steady-state ice shelf
         <span><a>36</a>,
            <a>37</a></span>. The model domain extends 25.5° in longitude (104.5° E–130° E) and 8° in latitude
         (60° S–68° S), with a longitudinal resolution 1/15° and latitudinal resolution of
         1/30° (Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>). Ice/ocean thermodynamics are parameterised using the three-equation formulation
         <span><a>38</a></span>. More details of the model setup are given in Gwyther et al.
         <span><a>25</a></span> The model bathymetry is based on RTopo
         <span><a>39</a></span>, which provides the deep ocean and continental shelf bathymetry. RTopo does not included
         realistic bathymetry for TIS so we blended it with a TIS cavity bathymetry inverted
         from airborne gravity measurements that also includes a hypothesised trough connecting
         the continental shelf to an eastward extension of the TIS cavity
         <span><a>40</a></span>. This modelling study includes direct ocean access to the eastern extension of the
         TIS cavity, which satellite altimetry missions indicate hosts a surface lowering signal
         distinct from the deeper TIS grounding zone
         <span><a>41</a></span>. Ice draft was determined with airborne radar sounding measurements acquired by the
         ICECAP (International Collaborative Exploration of the Cryosphere through Aerogeophysical
         Profiling) consortium.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first simulation has surface wind forcing from COREv1 which corresponds to repeating
         normal-year (1995) momentum fluxes
         <span><a>21</a></span>. Surface heat and salt fluxes are taken from the 1995 record of sea ice formation
         from Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) satellite observations
         <span><a>42</a></span>. This year is chosen as it represents a normal climate year, and unlike CORE forcing,
         SSM/I observations better capture the timing, magnitude and spatial extent of sea
         ice and polynya formation
         <span><a>42</a></span>. Lateral forcing consisted of downscaled results from a general circulation model
         <span><a>10</a></span>, which itself was forced with repeated normal-year COREv1
         <span><a>21</a></span> forcing. The lateral boundary conditions are applied interannually, so as to capture
         intrinsic oceanic variability in Southern Ocean properties (Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>4</a> and 
         <a>5</a>), in particular, the 20-year South Pacific Intrinsic Mode
         <span><a>10</a></span>, but no other modes of variability (e.g. coupled land–ice–ocean-atmosphere processes
         such as climate modes). If a repeated normal-year forcing were applied to the lateral
         boundary conditions, then slow oceanic modes would not be excited and in effect, the
         ocean variability spectrum would be truncated. Here we are concerned with variability
         in melt rate rather than the mean value, and so the choice of lateral boundary conditions
         is valid, despite the reduced mean melt rates. The mean value is low due to cooler
         conditions in the Southern Ocean, a common model bias in ocean GCMs forced with COREv1
         conditions.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second run (COREv2) of 120 years was forced with two periods of 1949–2007 interannual
         climate forcing. Surface wind forcing is from the COREv2 1949–2007 air–sea flux data
         set
         <span><a>22</a></span>, while surface heat and salt fluxes are composed of the climatology of surface heat
         and salt fluxes from SSM/I observations for 1995
         <span><a>42</a></span> but scaled by the E − P (evaporation minus precipitation) fields for 1949–2007 from
         COREv2. These data sets are combined in this way to provide long-term estimates of
         polynya activity and sea ice formation, which are not obtainable from a data set of
         comparable length. The lateral boundary forcing is analogous to that in the first
         simulation, but now the global ocean circulation model
         <span><a>10</a></span> is itself forced with the COREv2 1949–2007 interannually varying air–sea fluxes
         <span><a>22</a></span>. As a result, the lateral boundary forcing is representative of the oceanic response
         to the large-scale atmospheric climate variability including the complete forcing
         spectrum with all natural, intrinsic, internal (e.g. climate modes) and anthropogenic
         forcing components. The first period of 60 years is considered spin-up.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A sensitivity study investigating whether intrinsic variability in melt rate originates
         locally or is imported through the boundary conditions was conducted (see Supplementary
         Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). In this run, we force with the same normal-year atmospheric conditions as previously.
         However, we have changed the lateral boundary conditions to remove the interannual
         intrinsic variability, replacing them with a repeated seasonal cycle calculated as
         the climatology of the previously-used interannual COREv1 intrinsic variability forcing
         <span><a>10</a></span>. These new boundary conditions, where we removed any interannual variability, enable
         an estimate of the variability intrinsic to the ROMS domain.
