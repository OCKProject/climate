      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify and characterise modes of variation, we applied two different methodologies
         commonly used for analysing climate data (see Methods). Empirical orthogonal function
         (EOF) analysis identifies spatially invariant patterns in the data and accompanying
         time series that maximise variance. This was used to reduce the dimensionality and
         to decompose spatial and temporal variation into the EOF spatial modes, temporal principal
         components (PCs) and the variance explained by each mode. We restrict our analysis
         to modes explaining &gt;5% of the variance (see Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a> for first 6 modes). The data has been linearly detrended and the climatological mean
         removed prior to analysis.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EOF analysis of melt rate anomaly suggests that most variability (57% of variance)
         is explained by mode 1 (EOF1; Fig. 
         <a>3d</a>) which shows wide-scale coherent fluctuations in basal melting, similar to the time-mean
         spatial pattern in Fig. 
         <a>3a</a>. EOF mode 2 (EOF2; 8% of variance) captures enhanced shallow or deep melting, and
         results from water flowing either along the ice shelf front or below the ice shelf
         (Fig. 
         <a>3g</a>). Interannual fluctuations in average melt rate are represented strongly in the first
         PC of the EOF analysis (compare Fig. 
         <a>3e</a> to Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>), which contains ~3-, 5-, ~7-year and multidecadal modes (Fig. 
         <a>3f</a>). The second PC (Fig. 
         <a>3h</a>) contains mostly intra-annual variability (Fig. 
         <a>3i</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the EOF analysis captures spatial patterns of covariability it does not necessarily
         separate physical modes over different timescales. To achieve this, we apply singular
         spectrum analysis (SSA)
         <span><a>12</a>,
            <a>30</a></span>, which identifies spatially coherent regions of variance for a chosen time band,
         to analyse the leading PCs of melt rate and extract secular behaviour present at intra-annual
         (&lt;1 year), interannual (1–5 and 5–10 years) and multidecadal (10–30 year) time bands
         (see Methods).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The in-band SSA variance shows the percentage of total variance at each location within
         defined time bands (Fig. 
         <a>3j–m</a>). Intra-annual modes explain ~40–50% of total variance, and closer to 90% of total
         variance near to the ice front (Fig. 
         <a>3j</a>). These intra-annual modes result from the seasonal cycle in sea ice production and
         winds. As this study focusses on interannual variability, these &lt;1-year modes will
         not be further discussed. Modes with a period of 1–5 years explain on average ~23%
         (maximum of 44% in certain locations) of the total variance in basal melting (Fig. 
         <a>3k</a>), while ~7% (maximum of 21%) of the total variance is explained by modes that occur
         over 5–10 years (Fig. 
         <a>3l</a>). Multidecadal modes in basal melting are present but explain on average ~6% (maximum
         of 24%) of the total variance (Fig. 
         <a>3m</a>). Histograms of in-band SSA variance for the chosen time bands are shown in Supplementary
         Fig. 
         <a>2</a>.
