      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the rate of change of ice shelf thinning and the processes governing
         change is critical for understanding mass balance and hence the Antarctic ice sheet
         contribution to sea level rise. Over the period 2003–2008 (~5 years), the Totten Glacier
         Ice Shelf (TIS) was observed
         <span><a>1</a></span> to be lowering at ~0.41 m yr
         <span>−1</span>. However, extending the observational satellite record to encompass the period 1994–2012
         (~18 years)
         <span><a>2</a></span> showed that the thickness of the TIS was subject to large periodic 3–4 year fluctuations
         of approximately ±40 m with almost no net thickness change (within the error bars)
         over the 18 year period. Further, interannual variation has been detected in surface
         velocity
         <span><a>3</a>–
            <a>5</a></span> and the grounding line location is showing change
         <span><a>6</a></span>. It is not clear how much of the observed temporal change in TIS is as a result of
         internal glacier-ice shelf dynamics or is in response to variability in ocean-driven
         basal melting. We have chosen to characterise the part of melt rate variability that
         arises in response to variability intrinsic to the ocean. This study serves as a necessary
         basis for understanding and quantifying what fraction of the observed variations in
         melt rate are independent of natural fluctuations in the climate modes and trends
         arising from anthropogenic forcing.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Basal melting thermodynamically couples the ocean to the ice shelf system. As a result,
         ice shelf thickness responds to variability in the nearby ocean system. This variability
         could be externally forced, for example, by climate change, interannual and multidecadal
         climate modes, the annual cycle, or tides. In addition, variability could also be
         generated by the non-linear intrinsic ocean response to forcing, as opposed to the
         deterministic response from interannual atmospheric forcing. Low-frequency intrinsic
         ocean variability results from non-linear interactions within the ocean and in response
         to stochastic-to-seasonal timescale changes in atmospheric forcing
         <span><a>7</a>–
            <a>15</a></span>, in line with the paradigm of Stochastic Climate Models
         <span><a>16</a>,
            <a>17</a></span>. As a result, the ice sheet will exhibit a combined response to both intrinsic and
         externally forced climate variability.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observations of basal melting and ice shelf change generally consist of short records
         which limit the ability to distinguish intrinsic from forced variability. Advances
         have been made in identifying the ice shelf response to observed low-frequency internal
         variations in the Southern Hemisphere climate. For example, El Niño-Southern Oscillation
         (ENSO) has been suggested to drive stronger cross-shelf transport of oceanic heat
         leading to a lowering of Amundsen Sea ice shelves
         <span><a>18</a></span>. Conversely, atmospheric hindcast models for 1979–2015 have suggested that ENSO has
         a statistically non-significant impact on the westerly winds which drive stronger
         cross-shelf transport
         <span><a>19</a></span>. This highlights the complex impact that low-frequency climate variations have on
         ice shelf mass loss. It also emphasises the importance of ensuring that correlations
         and trends are statistically significant, particularly given the short satellite record
         relative to the timescale of climate variations like ENSO.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean models can be used to simulate and quantify variability beneath ice shelves.
         Idealised coupled ice sheet-ocean models subject to periodic variability in oceanic
         heat content have indicated the ice sheet response is dependent on the forcing periodicity
         in relation to the ice shelf residence time
         <span><a>20</a></span>. However, the origin of this periodic forcing and the response of a realistic ice
         shelf is uncertain.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, we present simulations of the response of basal melting beneath TIS
         to intrinsic ocean variability (model domain shown in Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>). We use lateral boundary conditions that contain only intrinsic ocean variability
         and repeated normal-year atmospheric forcing (Coordinated Ocean ice Reference Experiment
         version 1; COREv1)
         <span><a>21</a></span> to quantify the interannual intrinsic variability that impacts basal melting. Non-linear
         ocean processes and the response to rapid wind changes produces a significant degree
         of intrinsic variability in water properties on the continental shelf and thus basal
         melting beneath TIS. Further simulations compare the basal melt response from only
         intrinsic variability to the full climate response from 1949 to 2007 (Coordinated
         Ocean ice Reference Experiment version 2; COREv2)
         <span><a>22</a></span> and show that intrinsic ocean variability can produce a similar magnitude response
         to the interannual climate forcing. These results demonstrate the need to account
         for the contribution of intrinsic ocean processes in order to correctly detect and
         attribute ice shelf change.
