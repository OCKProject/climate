 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the COREv1 run is not forced with any interannual climate modes, any resulting low-frequency variability must be internally generated by the model or enters as intrinsic variability through the ocean boundaries. In contrast, the COREv2 run represents the response of the ice shelf to externally forced interannual variability. The COREv1 and COREv2 simulations produce a mean basal melting of 5.0 ± 0.5 m yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (for years 30–150) and 5.2±0.5 m yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (for years 1949–2007), respectively (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). This is half the glaciological inferred value
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>, however the mean spatial distributions (see Results section ‘Intrinsic variability in melt rate’) are similar to previous studies

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. The mean lower melt rate results mainly from the cooler CORE ocean boundary conditions that introduce a constant cold bias as compared to previous modelling studies which utilised different forcing conditions (see Methods).

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the intrinsic ocean variability model (COREv1 run) and the interannual variability model (COREv2 run) exhibit basal melting variability on a range of timescales. As the COREv1 run is forced with a repeated normal-year atmosphere and the intrinsically varying ocean resulting from the application of that atmosphere forcing, it represents the intrinsic melt rate response. In contrast, the COREv2 run contains the ice shelf response to the interannually varying ocean and atmosphere over the period 1949–2007. The ratio of COREv2 (with all natural, intrinsic, internal and anthropogenic forcings) to COREv1 (intrinsic-only) melt rate anomaly variances is 1.7. This is equivalent to a signal-to-noise ratio, where the ‘signal is the combined deterministic and intrinsic response from COREv2 and the ‘noise is the intrinsic response from COREv1 (see Methods). This highlights the potential for intrinsic processes to drive significant low-frequency variability in mean melt rates.</p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantifying changes in basal melting of TIS due to anthropogenic climate change and known climate modes (e.g. ENSO), requires a knowledge of the response due to intrinsic ocean dynamics. This study hereafter focusses on the low-frequency response of basal melting to intrinsic ocean variability. Here we are only concerned with this type of variability, noting that additional questions about the thermodynamic response of the ice shelf to the longer term climate (COREv2) are the subject of follow-up studies.</p>
