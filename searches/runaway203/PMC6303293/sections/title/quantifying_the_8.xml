 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results shown above give a qualitative impression of the range of patterns and amplitudes of the historical SAT trends over the HSTC zone because of external radiative forcing and internal variability. Here we provide a quantitative assessment using a simple signal-to-noise (SNR) analysis (Equation 
  <a rid="Equ3" ref-type="" href="#Equ3">3</a>). As mentioned before, the Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> estimated the forced SAT trends in the CESM1, by averaging over all the ensemble members, under the historical scenario. On the other hand, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> shows the standard deviation of the SAT trends (e.g., internal variability) across the ensemble members, during the analysis period. From the standard deviation plot, it is clear that the uncertainty due to natural or internal variability is very strong over the HSTC zone. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the forced SAT trend and the internal variability is shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>, under the historical scenario. These standard metrics convey useful information about the magnitudes of the forced and internally generated components of late 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century climate change; although they do not convey anything about the spatial coherence of the internal contribution.

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If we look into the spatial pattern of SNR in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>, the value of SNR is less than 1, throughout the HSTC region. It indicates the relative dominance of the internal climatic variability over the forced response in driving the long term trends in SAT. Therefore, the natural or internal variability appears to masked the warming trend over the HSTC region, to a greater extent.
