 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Humid Subtropical Climatic Zone (HSTC) in India, which primarily comprises the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region of Central India are highly vulnerable to the climatic extremities. Moreover, this region is coming under the direct influence of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). The HSTC region is the home for ~40% of total population and yields ~50% of total agricultural production of India. Geographically, the HSTC zone is stretching from Punjab in the North to the West Bengal in the East and the probability of drought is higher in this region

  </span>. The IGP is one of the world’s largest plains, which was formed by the rivers like Indus, Ganga, Yamuna, Ghaghara, Gandak and Kosi, in the eastern part of the Indian sub-continent, and they are originated from the Himalayas.

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is known that the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is initiated by unequal surface solar heating of the Indian subcontinent and the Indian Ocean in the pre-monsoon and monsoon season. Therefore, the strength of monsoonal precipitation correlated closely with the land-ocean temperature gradient

  </span> observed a moderate cooling trend in pre monsoon SAT over the Indian subcontinent during 1950–2002. While since 2002, the pre-monsoon season has reversed in tandem with the monsoonal precipitation revival. This revival of ISM precipitation is driven by a strong warming signature over the Indian subcontinent and slower rates of warming over the Indian Ocean. The continental Indian warming is attributed to a reduction of low cloud due to decreased ocean evaporation in the Arabian Sea, and thus decreased moisture transport to India
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Here we observed a strong cooling trend over the HSTC region, however, the factors i.e. the external forcings and internal climatic variability contributing to the trend during the monsoon months (June–August) in the last half of 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century are not yet explored and need to be analyze in details.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trajectory of the Earth’s climate is determined by the combined influences of internal climatic variability and anthropogenic climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Here the term internal climatic variability attributes the unforced natural variability of the climate system that occurs in absence of external forcing, and includes processes intrinsic to the atmosphere, the ocean, and the coupled ocean-atmosphere system

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. In the tropics, due to smaller magnitude of natural variability, the signal of anthropogenic warming appears to emerge significantly, prior to the mid and high latitudes

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports indicate that, the impacts of anthropogenic forcing factors e.g. greenhouse gas (GHG), aerosol (AS), black carbon (BC), land use (LU), and ozone (OZ) contribute maximum to the warming of atmosphere and ocean. On the other hand, the cooling trend in internal variability masked the warming trend significantly. Therefore, understanding the externally forced climate change and the internal variability is a pressing challenge as evidenced by the considerable range of model sensitivities to the identical set of radiative forcings
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. However, for isolating the relative contribution of anthropogenic climate change and the internally generated climatic variability, it requires a specific climate model with ensembles of simulations and each member is subjected to the identical external forcing.

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the recent decades, the atmospheric carbonaceous aerosols have potential impact on the regional climate, hydrological cycle etc. oversouth Asia
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. Among the major anthropogenic sources, biomass burning, industrial and vehicular emissions have contributed significantly to the total aerosol content of the atmosphere and in particular to the carbonaceous species over northern India and the IGP region

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>

  </span>. Moreover, using high-resolution regional climate model (RegCM4) simulations and prescribed land cover of years 1950 and 2005, it is demonstrated that part of the changes in moderate rainfall events and temperature have been caused by LULCC

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span> reported that the opposite phases of AMO and IPO together modulates the total/moderate rainfall over west central and northeast regions in an asymmetric manner; whereas their warm phase stimulates the heavy rainfall over west central region, while their opposite phases together influences the precipitation extremes over the northeastern region.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, both the anthropogenic forcings and the internal variability appear to have significant impact on the climatic variability over the HSTC region, under warming scenario. In the present analysis, we investigate the relative contribution of the two factors (external and internal) in driving the cooling trend over HSTC region during the last half of 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century. It is essential to understand the antecedent conditions that may driving the rapid warming trend after 2000 and revival of ISM over the Indian landmass. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the models and experimental design, as well as the observational datasets used to supplement the model simulated trend. Section 3 provides results on the range of climate trends for a historical period of 40 years from each model ensemble, showing the relative contributions from internal variability and external forcing in terms of spatial maps, signal-to-noise ratios, and the likelihood that the trend will have a particular sign (e.g., warming). Section 4 describes the results from CCSM4 single forcing simulations and highlights the relative contribution of the individual forcings. Finally, section 5 concludes, summarizes the main findings and a discussion of the results.
