 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From these large ensembles, one can quantify the chances that temperature increases (or decreases) and will projected to increase (or decrease) during the historical decades. It can be done by counting the number of runs with a positive trend divided by the total number of runs for each model (Equation 
  <a rid="Equ4" ref-type="" href="#Equ4">4</a>). It can be reiterated that in these model ensembles, the reason why individual runs may show opposite-signed trends at a given location is due to unpredictable, internally generated climatic variability. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows the results for summer SAT decadal trends for the historical (1961–2000) period. It is noteworthy that a low chance of warming (positive trend) implies a high chance of a negative trend i.e. cooling.

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the period, the CESM1 model simulations show a higher than 95% chance that summers cools almost over much of the HSTC region, while warming trend dominates elsewhere in the Asian continent (not shown here). In the HSTC region, the relative contribution of anthropogenic warming is partially counteracted by the cooling trend due to internal climatic variability.</p>
