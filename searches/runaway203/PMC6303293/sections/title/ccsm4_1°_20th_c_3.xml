 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM4) is using the Lin–Rood finite volume core, which has much improved representation of deep convection scheme. The horizontal grid used is latitude/longitude with 288 × 200 points, resulting in a uniform resolution of 1.25° × 0.9° in the 1° version, and half the number of grid points in both directions in the 2° version. CAM4 uses 26 layers in the vertical. A freeze-dry modification was implemented to the low cloud parameterization
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>, which has the effect of reducing the amount of wintertime low cloud in the Arctic region. The Froude number coefficient in the gravity wave parameterization was retuned, which improved the CAM4 simulation in the upper atmosphere

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CCSM4 1850 control runs have the following forcings, which are kept constant during the runs. The incoming solar radiation at the top of atmosphere (TOA) is 1360.9 W m

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>

  <sub>2</sub> level is set to 284.7 ppm. Aerosol concentrations of sulfate, black and organic carbon, dust, and sea salt are specified from a historical run using the CCSM chemistry component with prescribed emissions

  </span>, plus a low background level due to volcanic activity. The model was initialized with fields from the end of a previous short coupled run that had slightly different parameter settings. The 1° 1850 control was run for 1300 years, but some very small corrections were made during the run. The CCSM4 model had used gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). The model estimate for the year 2000 inventory, which represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The region number 26 represents India and it used GFEDv2 inventory seasonality to redistribute total carbon emissions of the region in space and time to improve the carbon emission patterns. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound, for each region and sector, is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate, ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset can capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone, carbon monoxide, aerosol distributions and their interaction with background atmospheric conditions. The aerosol optical depth and additional aerosol diagnostics are in good agreement with previously published estimates and observations.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CCSM4 twentieth-century runs begin in January 1850 and end in December 2005. They are forced by time series of solar output, greenhouse gases, aerosols, and volcanic activity. The solar output anomaly time series is described in Lean

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. The CO
  <sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide) are specified as in the IPCC third assessment report. Atmosphere aerosol burden (sulfate, organic carbon, and sea salt), aerosol deposition (black carbon and dust) onto snow, and nitrogen deposition also vary with time. The burdens and deposition rates were obtained from a twentieth-century run with the CCSM chemistry component active, which is forced with prescribed historical emissions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. These concentrations do contain an annual cycle and are linearly interpolated in time from year to year within each month. This leads to a smoothly varying aerosol forcing compared to concentrations found in a fully interactive aerosol model. However, this probably does not affect the long-term trend and impact of these aerosols. The initial conditions for the five members of the CCSM4 twentieth-century ensemble are taken from years 863, 893, 937, 983, and 1031 of the 18 1850 control run, which were chosen to be after the last model correction and to span the range of variability in the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
