 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have used the CESM-LE data to assess the climate change in presence of internal climate variability during 1961–2000. The summer (JJA) SAT trend during the 1961–2000 period exhibit an amplified cooling (&lt;
  <span class="italic">−</span>3 °C/40 years) in the HSTC region (include IGP). The total trend is partitioned into contributions from the externally forced response and the internal variability. The forced response displays a cooling trend with maximum amplitudes of approximately &lt;=
  <span class="italic">−</span>3 °C/40 years during the analysis period in the HSTC zone. The internal climatic variability, also exhibits a strong cooling trend in majority of the ensembles, however, few displays warming trend in the HSTC region. The internal variability, therefore, introduces a wide range of uncertainty in the model simulations. For the analysis period, the SNR is less than 1, throughout the contiguous HSTC region, indicates that the internal climatic variability dominates over the forced response. It is indicative to the fact that, the relative contribution of the natural or internal variability masked the warming trend due to external factors in the HSTC zone, to a greater extent. Moreover, during the analysis period, the CESM1 model simulations show a higher than 95% chance that summers cools almost over much of the HSTC zone.

The strong warming trend due to the GHG only and Solar only forcings are counteracted by the cooling trend due to the aerosol only, volcano only, land only and ozone only forcings. Additionally, from CESM-LE, the internal climatic variability contribute significantly to the cooling, resulting an overall cooling trend in the HSTC region. Therefore, the strong GHG warming trend is partially counteracted, primarily by the influence of the internal climatic variability (~73%) and partially by certain external forcing factors e.g. aerosol (~10%), volcano, ozone etc. Despite the present study analyzes the historical cooling trend in the HSTC zone, it is essential to study how the near term future trend in SAT will change under strong warming due to anthropogenic forcing factors. Moreover, it is essential to study the variety of natural variabilities and its mechanism which are driving the cooling trend over the region.</p>
