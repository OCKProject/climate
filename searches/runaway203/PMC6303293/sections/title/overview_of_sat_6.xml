 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the beginning, we plotted the summer (JJA) surface air temperature (SAT) trends from the CRU based observation data during 1961–2000 in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. A multidecadal cooling trend is predominant over the HSTC zone, particularly in the IGP region. To compare the results with model based simulations, we performed trend analysis over 1961–2000 periods from each of the CESM1 (35 ensemble members) runs, which are presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>. The observation can be seen as a superposition of contribution from the internal climatic variability and the external forcing factors (Equation 
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>). We compare the temperature trend with NCEP reanalysis data (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) and the cooling trends are consistent with the CRU based observation data.

 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, we show a subset of results to illustrate some key points in the HSTC region. Summer SAT decadal trends over the analysis period (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) display considerable diversity across the CESM1 35-member ensemble, despite each simulation being subject to identical radiative forcing. For example, many of the ensemble members exhibit amplified cooling (&lt;−0.75 °C/dec i.e. −3.0 °C/40 years) over the HSTC zone of India (EM 1, 7, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 29, 31 and 34), some exhibits mild cooling (EM 3, 4, 6, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28 and 32), while few show weak warming (&lt;0.5 °C/dec i.e. 2.0 °C/40 years) over the region (EM 2, 22, 26, 27 and 33). However, most of the ensemble simulations reflect the cooling trend over the HSTC zone; a pattern resembles with the observation results in Fig.
