  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the beginning, we plotted the summer (JJA) surface air temperature (SAT) trends from the CRU based observation data during 1961–2000 in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. A multidecadal cooling trend is predominant over the HSTC zone, particularly in the IGP region. To compare the results with model based simulations, we performed trend analysis over 1961–2000 periods from each of the CESM1 (35 ensemble members) runs, which are presented in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>. The observation can be seen as a superposition of contribution from the internal climatic variability and the external forcing factors (Equation 
   <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>). We compare the temperature trend with NCEP reanalysis data (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>) and the cooling trends are consistent with the CRU based observation data.

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, we show a subset of results to illustrate some key points in the HSTC region. Summer SAT decadal trends over the analysis period (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) display considerable diversity across the CESM1 35-member ensemble, despite each simulation being subject to identical radiative forcing. For example, many of the ensemble members exhibit amplified cooling (&lt;−0.75 °C/dec i.e. −3.0 °C/40 years) over the HSTC zone of India (EM 1, 7, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 29, 31 and 34), some exhibits mild cooling (EM 3, 4, 6, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28 and 32), while few show weak warming (&lt;0.5 °C/dec i.e. 2.0 °C/40 years) over the region (EM 2, 22, 26, 27 and 33). However, most of the ensemble simulations reflect the cooling trend over the HSTC zone; a pattern resembles with the observation results in Fig.

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variety of climate trends in individual model realizations results from the superposition of internal climate variability and the response to external forcing (i.e., GHG increases). To illustrate this point, we partition the total decadal trends into contributions from the externally forced response (obtained by averaging all ensemble members) and the internal variability (obtained by subtracting the forced response from the total trend) (equation 
   <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">2</a>). Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> represents the spatial pattern and the significant (&gt;95%) decadal trend of the externally forced component (include GHGs, aerosols, ozone, land use and natural external forcings), under the historical scenario. It is generated by averaging the trend of the 35 ensemble members based on CESM1. In Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, the decadal cooling trends exhibit a continental-scale pattern with maximum amplitudes of approximately &lt;=−3 °C/40 years, which stretches from west to East over most of the HSTC zone. The amplitude of cooling trend maximizes along the IGP region. Several external forcing factors might have responsible for the cooling trend in the HSTC region. In the recent decades, the atmospheric carbonaceous aerosols have potential impact on the regional climate, hydrological cycle etc. over the south Asia

  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model uncertainties which are referred as internal variability in the CESM ensembles are obtained by subtracting the ensemble mean trend from the total trends. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, displays the decadal trends resulting from internal climatic variability or model uncertainties under the historical scenario. If we look carefully, in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, both the decadal cooling (&lt;=−2 °C/40 years, EM 1, 7, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 29, 31 and 34) and warming (&gt;=2 °C/40 years, EM 2, 5, 9, 22,26, 27, 33 and 35) trends appear to dominate the HSTC zone, in particular over the IGP region. Therefore, the internal climatic variability introduces wide range of uncertainty to the climate model simulations. A recent study by Joshi and Rai
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span> provide a deep insight on low-frequency variability and its extremes over India under the combined influence of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). The large scale changes in monsoonal circulation might have contributed and impart regional coherence to the internal component of surface climate trends over the HSTC region.

  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results shown above give a qualitative impression of the range of patterns and amplitudes of the historical SAT trends over the HSTC zone because of external radiative forcing and internal variability. Here we provide a quantitative assessment using a simple signal-to-noise (SNR) analysis (Equation 
   <a rid="Equ3" ref-type="" href="#Equ3">3</a>). As mentioned before, the Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> estimated the forced SAT trends in the CESM1, by averaging over all the ensemble members, under the historical scenario. On the other hand, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> shows the standard deviation of the SAT trends (e.g., internal variability) across the ensemble members, during the analysis period. From the standard deviation plot, it is clear that the uncertainty due to natural or internal variability is very strong over the HSTC zone. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the forced SAT trend and the internal variability is shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>, under the historical scenario. These standard metrics convey useful information about the magnitudes of the forced and internally generated components of late 20
   <span class="sup">th</span> century climate change; although they do not convey anything about the spatial coherence of the internal contribution.

Therefore, the natural or internal variability appears to masked the warming trend over the HSTC region, to a greater extent.

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From these large ensembles, one can quantify the chances that temperature increases (or decreases) and will projected to increase (or decrease) during the historical decades. It can be done by counting the number of runs with a positive trend divided by the total number of runs for each model (Equation 
   <a rid="Equ4" ref-type="" href="#Equ4">4</a>). It can be reiterated that in these model ensembles, the reason why individual runs may show opposite-signed trends at a given location is due to unpredictable, internally generated climatic variability. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows the results for summer SAT decadal trends for the historical (1961–2000) period. It is noteworthy that a low chance of warming (positive trend) implies a high chance of a negative trend i.e. cooling.
