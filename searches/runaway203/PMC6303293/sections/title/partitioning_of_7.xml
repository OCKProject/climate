 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variety of climate trends in individual model realizations results from the superposition of internal climate variability and the response to external forcing (i.e., GHG increases). To illustrate this point, we partition the total decadal trends into contributions from the externally forced response (obtained by averaging all ensemble members) and the internal variability (obtained by subtracting the forced response from the total trend) (equation 
  <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">2</a>). Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> represents the spatial pattern and the significant (&gt;95%) decadal trend of the externally forced component (include GHGs, aerosols, ozone, land use and natural external forcings), under the historical scenario. It is generated by averaging the trend of the 35 ensemble members based on CESM1. In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, the decadal cooling trends exhibit a continental-scale pattern with maximum amplitudes of approximately &lt;=−3 °C/40 years, which stretches from west to East over most of the HSTC zone. The amplitude of cooling trend maximizes along the IGP region. Several external forcing factors might have responsible for the cooling trend in the HSTC region. In the recent decades, the atmospheric carbonaceous aerosols have potential impact on the regional climate, hydrological cycle etc. over the south Asia

  </span> and a stronger driver of the atmospheric cooling trend. Among the major anthropogenic sources, biomass burning, industrial and vehicular emissions have contributed significantly to the total aerosol content of the atmosphere and in particular to the carbonaceous species over northern India and the IGP region

  </span>. Additionally, natural external factors like volcano only forcing might have contributed to the cooling trend significantly.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model uncertainties which are referred as internal variability in the CESM ensembles are obtained by subtracting the ensemble mean trend from the total trends. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, displays the decadal trends resulting from internal climatic variability or model uncertainties under the historical scenario. If we look carefully, in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, both the decadal cooling (&lt;=−2 °C/40 years, EM 1, 7, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 29, 31 and 34) and warming (&gt;=2 °C/40 years, EM 2, 5, 9, 22,26, 27, 33 and 35) trends appear to dominate the HSTC zone, in particular over the IGP region. Therefore, the internal climatic variability introduces wide range of uncertainty to the climate model simulations. A recent study by Joshi and Rai
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span> provide a deep insight on low-frequency variability and its extremes over India under the combined influence of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). The large scale changes in monsoonal circulation might have contributed and impart regional coherence to the internal component of surface climate trends over the HSTC region.
