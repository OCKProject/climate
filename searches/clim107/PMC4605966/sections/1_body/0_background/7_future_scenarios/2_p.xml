<p class="p">As regards the domestic roundwood production volume, we explored five future scenarios [in ascending order of volume: resource conservation (Con), business as usual (BAU), moderate increase in harvesting (Mod), in accordance with the Basic Plan for Forest and Forestry of Japanese government (Plan), in accordance with the forest owners’ intentions (Int)] created by Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. In the resource conservation scenario, the volume of roundwood production declines in the future, and forest resources are conserved, with only limited harvesting of wood. In the BAU scenario, even if the future composition of forests increases, the harvesting area and the afforestation area remain unchanged at their actual recent-year level, and the forests continue to age. In the moderate harvesting increase scenario, older trees are harvested, and roundwood production volume is at least double its current level by 2050. In the government plan scenario the future production of roundwood is aggressively pursued in line with the Japanese government’s Basic Plan for Forest and Forestry. In the forest owners’ intentions scenario, which relies upon the results of a survey on the intentions of the forest owners affiliated with the forestry cooperatives, 15–30 % of planted trees are harvested in the 20-year period 2011–2030, and 25–30 % during 2031–2050. Roundwood production volume under these scenarios was estimated for each prefecture and the three regions; the national production is presented in Fig.
