<p class="p">Three scenarios were considered for HWP consumption volume, namely business as usual (BAU), moderate promotion of usage (Mod), and aggressive promotion of usage (Agg). Under the BAU scenario, the proportion of wood used in building construction, the proportion of wood used in furniture, and the volume of HWPs consumed in civil engineering projects all remain unchanged at the current level until 2050. Under the moderate usage promotion scenario, the proportion of wood used in building construction and in furniture making increases from 35 to 50 % by 2050 and the volume of HWPs consumed in civil engineering projects increases to 3 Mm
