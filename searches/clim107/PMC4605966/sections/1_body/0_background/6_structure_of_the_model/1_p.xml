<p class="p">The new model for evaluating the HWP carbon balance used in this study is outlined in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. Its basic structure follows that of the previous model. The structure formulates (1) HWP flow, from roundwood production to sawnwood (including glued laminated lumber and laminated veneer lumber), plywood (including wood-based panels such as particle board and fiberboard) and chip production and HWP consumption (building construction, civil engineering, furniture, paper) and to energy use (logging residue, processing residue, waste wood); and (2) HWP stock (building construction, civil engineering, furniture, paper). Moreover, the model evaluates the climate change mitigation effect based on the carbon balance implied by this HWP flow and stock.
