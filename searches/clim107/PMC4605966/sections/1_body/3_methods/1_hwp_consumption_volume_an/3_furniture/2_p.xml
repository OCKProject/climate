In the BAU scenario, it was assumed that there was no change in the current 35 % proportion of wood used in furniture during 2014–2050; in the Mod scenario, a 50 % increase in the proportion following an S-shaped curve was assumed from 2014 to 2050; and in the Agg scenario, an increase to 70 % by 2050 was assumed.
