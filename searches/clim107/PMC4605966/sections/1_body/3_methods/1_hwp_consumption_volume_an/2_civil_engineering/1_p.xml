 <sup class="sup">3</sup> by 2050 was assumed. Since the current and future breakdown of consumption volume between each civil engineering application is unclear, 50 % was assumed for soil liquefaction countermeasure piles and 50 % for cylindrical poles used in wooden road safety guardrails. However, the cylindrical pole yield from roundwood was set at 0.8 [
