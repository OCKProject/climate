   <p class="p" xmlns="">The remaining domestic roundwood production volume was distributed as production volume for sawnwood, plywood and chips used in building construction, furniture, and paper. The relevant proportions were set at sawnwood-use 60 %, plywood-use 15 %, and chip-use 25 %, with reference to past actual values [

   <p class="p" xmlns="">Production volume of sawnwood and plywood derived from domestic roundwood was distributed among production for building construction and for furniture. Relevant proportions of HWP consumption attributable to building construction and to furniture production mentioned in the HWP consumption volume and stock section were used. Moreover, the volume of chip production derived for domestic roundwood was allocated exclusively to paper.</p>

   <p class="p" xmlns="">HWP import volume or roundwood import volume was assumed to be what remains when the volume of sawnwood, plywood, and chip production derived from domestic roundwood is deducted from the HWP consumption volume. However, since this study used the production approach to account for the carbon storage in HWPs, imports were not taken into consideration.</p>
