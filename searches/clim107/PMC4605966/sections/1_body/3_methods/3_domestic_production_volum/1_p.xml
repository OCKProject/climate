 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref> shows the estimation procedure for volume of production from domestic forests within HWP consumption and stock volume as relates to the production approach. Steps (1)–(4) were followed to arrive at estimates for each region and each future scenario. Both domestically produced and imported wood is used in HWP consumption for building construction, furniture, and paper. However, wooden piles and guardrails are generally made from wood produced from domestic forests, so it was assumed that only domestically produced wood was used in civil engineering. Estimates were uniformly converted into roundwood terms, and the roundwood conversion coefficients for each HWP were as follows: for sawnwood, 1.570 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>-roundwood m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>-sawnwood; for plywood, 1.618 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>-roundwood m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>-plywood; and for paper, 3.300 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>-roundwood t
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>-paper [
