Under the Mod scenario, an increase in usage from 2014 was assumed, reaching the current rate of use plus half the unused proportion in 2050 (49 % for logging residue, 24 % for processing residue, and 87 % for waste wood) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. Under the Agg scenario, an increase in usage was assumed, reaching the current rate of energy use plus the whole unused proportion in 2050 (99 % for logging residue, 27 % for processing residue, and 90 % for waste wood) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. The rate of use for each year from 2014 to 2050 was set using linear interpolation.
