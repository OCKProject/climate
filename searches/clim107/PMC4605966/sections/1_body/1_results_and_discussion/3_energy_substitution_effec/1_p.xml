<p class="p">The volume of annual carbon emissions reduction attributable to energy substitution for each region is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> and the nationwide annual reduction is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>. Under the Con &amp; BAU and the BAU &amp; BAU scenarios, the annual carbon emissions reduction remained more or less flat through 2050 with little visible change. However, under the three scenarios of the Mod &amp; Mod, the Plan &amp; Agg and the Int &amp; Agg, an increase in the annual carbon emissions reduction was seen, mainly as a result of a large increase in the volume of energy generation from logging residue. For 2050, a nationwide annual emissions reduction volume of 4.0 MtC year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was obtained under the Plan &amp; Agg scenario, and of 4.3 MtC year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> under the Int &amp; Agg scenario, the latter figure being equivalent to 279 % of that for 2013. The regional breakdown of the actual figure for nationwide annual carbon emissions reduction in 2013 was 17, 61, and 22 % for east, central, and west Japan, respectively. Under the Plan &amp; Agg and the Int &amp; Agg scenarios, the proportion of reduction volume derived from central Japan declined to 43 and 49 %, while the proportions from east and west Japan increased. Under these scenarios, as a result of the aforementioned increase in energy-use volume of logging residue, the annual emissions reduction volume rose in east and west Japan, where there is a high volume of roundwood production, which generates logging residue. Within the carbon emissions reduction volume, the proportion derived from logging residue was high, at 43 % in 2050 under the Plan &amp; Agg scenario, and 46 % under the Int &amp; Agg scenario.
