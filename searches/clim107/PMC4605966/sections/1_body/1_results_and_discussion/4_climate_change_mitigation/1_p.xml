<p class="p">The nationwide total of the carbon storage effect, the material substitution effect, and the energy substitution effect attributable to HWPs derived from domestic forests (the annual change in carbon storage relates to HWPs derived from domestic forests, and the annual carbon emissions reduction attributable to material and energy substitution) is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>. The mitigation effect under the Con &amp; BAU scenario was the smallest at 1.3 MtC year
