<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> shows annual changes in the nationwide carbon storage volume attributable to HWPs derived from domestic forests. Under the Con &amp; BAU and the BAU &amp; BAU scenarios, as a result of a decline in carbon storage volume, the annual change has a negative value up until 2050, and a carbon storage effect cannot be expected. However, under the Mod &amp; Mod, the Plan &amp; Agg, and the Int &amp; Agg scenarios, the annual change has a positive value until 2050, and a carbon storage effect can be anticipated. In particular, under the Int &amp; Agg scenario, 2.9 MtC year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is estimated for 2030, the biggest effect among the scenarios, which is in line with the trend in the volume of domestic roundwood production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). There is significant scope for growth in the HWP stock derived from domestic forests. However, because the volume of domestic roundwood production reduces thereafter, until 2050, the carbon storage effect decreases.
