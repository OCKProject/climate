<p class="p">The volume of annual carbon emissions reduction due to material substitution in each region compared to the BAU scenario is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> and the nationwide annual reduction volume is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>. It was evident that, compared to the BAU scenario, a nationwide material substitution effect of 0.6 MtC year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in 2030 and of 1.3 MtC year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in 2050 could be expected under the Mod scenario, and an effect of 1.4 MtC year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in 2030 and 2.9 MtC year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in 2050 under the Agg scenario. Under all scenarios, the regional breakdown of the volume of annual emissions reduction was 17 % derived from east Japan, 63 % derived from central Japan, and 20 % derived from west Japan. In addition, the breakdown by application was 88 % derived from building construction, 8 % derived from civil engineering, and 4 % derived from furniture making, emphasizing the significance of the reduction effect attributable to the substitution of wooden building construction for non-wooden building construction.
