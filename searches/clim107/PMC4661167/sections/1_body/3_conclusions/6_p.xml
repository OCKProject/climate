<p class="p">For cantons in the highly and very highly vulnerable categories, at least 50 % of the population works in agriculture, hunting or fisheries. With a weaker contribution to the composite indicator, the proportion of agricultural land that is irrigated has the fourteenth largest contribution. To this we add that 64 % of Ecuador’s population (9.3 million individuals) lives in cantons that are considered highly and very highly exposed. Thus, small holder and subsistence farmers will suffer impacts of climate change that will be locally specific and hard to predict. Hence, the variety of crop and livestock species produced by any one household, and their interactions in production and marketing, will increase the complexity both of the impacts and of subsequent adaptations (Morton
