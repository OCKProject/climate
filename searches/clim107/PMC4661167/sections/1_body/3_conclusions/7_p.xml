<p class="p">Some of the largest cantons in Ecuador (Quito, Guayaquil, and Machala) show a very high adaptive capacity, given their development infrastructure, which may spill into surrounding cantons. However, it is not possible to conclude that there is a strong correlation between population size and adaptive capacity because mid-size cantons such as El Empalme and Santa Elena are categorized as highly vulnerable. Furthermore, we cannot generalize that proximity to the largest cantons will guarantee coverage of public services, for example, Salitre and Nobol, which, despite their close proximity to Guayaquil (on average 20 miles), appear as highly vulnerable.</p>
