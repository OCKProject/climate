<p class="p">Earlier work has documented the extensive range of tools to assess climate change vulnerability at local levels. The use of any tool depends on the research questions to be answered. Vulnerability assessments, through the indicators approach, provide an overview of the socioeconomic, climatic, and geophysical determinants for a canton, or any other geographic unit, that are vulnerable to climate change. In this paper we use an approach that enables the relative ordering of the cantons in the continental territory of Ecuador. Our aim is to make full use of the climatic and non-climatic features, and construct additional indicators related to exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to climate change (Pachauri et al.
