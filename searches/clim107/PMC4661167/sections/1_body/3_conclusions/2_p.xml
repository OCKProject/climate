<p class="p">To construct the composite vulnerability indicator we use a large number of variables. Thus, in order to attain a meaningful and theoretically consistent vulnerability indicator, we normalize the variables and calculate the weights based on their relative variability. The weights represent their contribution to the formation of the composite indicator.</p>
