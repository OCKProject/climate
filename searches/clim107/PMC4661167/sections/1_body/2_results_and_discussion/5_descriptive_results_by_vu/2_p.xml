<p class="p">For the adaptive capacity indicators we find that agricultural land tenure (i.e. the proportion of households owning agricultural land with respect to total agricultural land) is not significantly different between the moderately vulnerable to the very highly vulnerable categories. In these groups on average 71 % of farmers own the land where they work. This figure increases to 85 % for the less vulnerable category. There is, however, a significant difference between the less and very highly vulnerable groups. In addition, for the proportion of the population working in agriculture, silviculture or hunting, 25.53 % work in cantons in the less vulnerable category. This figure increases to 52.35 % in the rest of the vulnerability categories.</p>
