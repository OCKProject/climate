For the climatic indicators we find that temperature and, to some extent, precipitation determine higher exposure in the very highly vulnerable category. Though in this category the confidence interval for precipitation overlaps with those in the moderately to highly vulnerable categories; temperature is significantly different compared with the rest of the vulnerability categories.
