 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the results of the EOF analysis. Each panel shows the first principal component (PC) and the share of variance explained. Temperature, wind velocity, and relative humidity show inter-annual variation, which may be interpreted as seasonal variation. Thus, correlating the temporal variation with the corresponding PC, at each location, quantifies the link between these climatic variables and the seasonal variations. Also, it is noticeable that these variables in western Ecuador show a better representation of the seasonal variation because the boundaries of this area include the significant climatic influences from the Pacific Ocean. The PCs of temperature, wind velocity, and relative humidity in eastern Ecuador represent the seasonal variation but with small perturbations as in this region there are significant orographic and vegetation differences that affect the behavior of these variables. Additionally, the PCs do not show a strong representation of extreme events such as El Niño or La Niña.
