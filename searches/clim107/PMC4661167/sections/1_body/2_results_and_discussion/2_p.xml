<p class="p">The EOF analysis of the monthly variation of precipitation resulted in a PC that did not show positive correlations. The monthly variation of precipitation is highly dispersed. For example, Northern Ecuador shows different values from the South because of the greater influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This adds to the existing geophysical differences between the Eastern and Western zones. Hence, for EOF analysis of precipitation we use the yearly variation to obtain the PC at the geographic location of each of the cantons. As it may be observed in the first PC, both in Eastern and Western Ecuador, there is a strong signal at the occurrence period of events such as El Niño and La Niña in 1981 and 1984. The PCs explain 51.4 and 58.9 % of the yearly variation and result in positive correlations with the geographic locations of the cities.</p>
