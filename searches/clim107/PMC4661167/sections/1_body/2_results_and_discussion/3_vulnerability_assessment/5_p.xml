<p class="p">Other smaller cantons, such as Mejia (pop. 81,335) and Marcelino Maridueña (pop. 12,033), are also in the less vulnerable categories. Arguably the proximity of Mejia to Quito and of Marcelino Maridueña to Guayaquil implies that the development facilities and infrastructure of large cities spill over to the adaptive capacity of surrounding smaller cantons. This situation may also explain the low vulnerability of other cantons such as Samborondon and Duran with respect to Guayaquil; Pasaje and Santa Rosa with respect to Machala; and Rumiñahui with respect to Quito. The situation does not, however, apply to cantons such as Salitre and Nobol, which despite their close proximity to Guayaquil (on average 20 miles), appear as highly vulnerable.</p>
