 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the vulnerability categories. The cantons with the highest vulnerabilities are located to the northwest of Ecuador, in the province of Esmeraldas, to the Midwest, in the provinces of Manabi and Los Rios, and to the South, in the provinces of Loja and Morona Santiago. In addition, most of the cantons in the Amazonian region are either in the highly or very highly vulnerable categories. The least and less vulnerable cantons are located to the central region of the country, mainly in the provinces of Pichincha; others are in the South, in the province of El Oro. The least vulnerable cantons are Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, and, Quito, Ecuador’s capital. These are followed by Cuenca, the third largest city in the country, and other mid-size cities such as Riobamba, Esmeraldas, Machala, Ambato, Loja, and Santo Domingo where populations range between 190,000 and 505,000 inhabitants. The correlation between the composite vulnerability indicator and population size is −0.5. This result points to the fact that larger cantons are not significantly less vulnerable.
