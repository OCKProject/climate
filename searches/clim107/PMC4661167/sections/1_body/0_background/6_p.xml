<p class="p">We assume that exposure to climate change affects the sensitivity of cantons where communities respond given their adaptive capacity. Thus, we separate the composite indicator into three components: (1) exposure: the condition of disadvantage due to the position or location of a subject, object or system at risk; (2) sensitivity: the degree of internal ability of a subject, object or system to meet a threat and receive a possible impact due to the occurrence of an adverse event; and (3) adaptive capacity: the ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to cope, absorb, and recover from the effects of an adverse event effectively and in a timely manner, considering the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions (Antwi-Agyei et al.
