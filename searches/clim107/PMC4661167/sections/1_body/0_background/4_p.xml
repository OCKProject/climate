<p class="p">Regardless of the assessment approach, challenges arise when the regions analyzed are communities that suffer from food, health and environmental insecurity, poverty, economic inequalities, weak governance, deficient infrastructure and education, lack of access to appropriate resources, or poor capacity to deal with extreme events (Bele et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2013</xref>). These issues are likely to determine the sensitivity of communities to climate change (Watson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">1998</xref>). For example, poverty and inequality are associated with poor quality housing, which is easily damaged by floods or storms, and with the formation of vulnerable and marginalized groups that lack the financial resources for adaptation, and may be forced to settle in climate-exposed areas (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2004</xref>). Thus, finding good-quality socioeconomic data at local scale and harmonizing them with climatic variables is a significant aspect of vulnerability research.
