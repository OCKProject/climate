<p class="p">Though there is no uniform methodology to assess vulnerability and its components (i.e. exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity), all vulnerability assessments require a detailed contextual understanding of the relevant systems and of the multiple stressors (Füssel

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2014</xref>). These assessments have made use of a wide array of technical tools such as local-level case studies (O’Brien et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2004</xref>; Sutanta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2013</xref>), resilience indicators (Brenkert and Malone 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2005</xref>), bio-economic models (Schilling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2012</xref>), general equilibrium models (Parry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2004</xref>; Tol 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2002</xref>), and cross-sectional studies (Mendelsohn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2006</xref>). The selection of the appropriate approach depends on the research or policy questions addressed, the urgency of the threat, the geographical and temporal scope of the analysis, the reliability of future climate impact projections, the level of previous knowledge, and the availability of data, expertise, and other resources (Füssel and Klein
