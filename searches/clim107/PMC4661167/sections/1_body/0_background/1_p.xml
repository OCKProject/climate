<p class="p">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines vulnerability as the degree to which geophysical, biological, and socio-economic systems are susceptible to, and unable to cope with adverse impacts of climate change (Houghton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">1996</xref>). As these impacts at local scales are uncertain, vulnerability assessments have become necessary (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2004</xref>) to increase the understanding of climate-sensitive systems and to inform the specification of targets and allocation of funds. Other uses for assessments are to prioritize political and research efforts, to develop and to implement adaptation strategies (FÃ¼ssel and Klein 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2006</xref>); and to evaluate program/policy effectiveness in data-scarce regions (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2004</xref>; Pandey and Jha 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2011</xref>).
