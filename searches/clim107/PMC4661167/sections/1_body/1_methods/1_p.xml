<p class="p">We choose Ecuador as a case study because socioeconomic data are readily and publicly available. Also the cantons in this country show a large degree of heterogeneity in terms of development and climatic conditions. We map vulnerability indicators at the canton level and show how different factors that shape vulnerability vary within Ecuador. The dataset includes 221 cantons of the continental territory of Ecuador, and other settlements such as Manga del Cura, El Piedrero and Las Golondrinas, which, at the time the data were collected, did not belong to any province.</p>
