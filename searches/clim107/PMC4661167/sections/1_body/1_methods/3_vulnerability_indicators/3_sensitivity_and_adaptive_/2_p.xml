<p class="p">To construct the institutional capacity indicator we apply polychoric principal component analysis to a set of variables related to whether the canton has developed information, programs, strategies or policies on: (1) environmental sensitivity assessments; (2) environmental development; (3) pollution management; and (4) climate change. Though these programs and policies are not uniform across cantons, their availability and extent are an input for the management of climate-related hazards and other environmental risks. Thus, the institutional indicator and its weight signal that in Ecuador the capacities and the relative institutional development of the cantons play a significant role in terms of resource management to cope with changing climatic conditions. We also include the per capita funds municipalities allocate or receive for investments on environmental protection.</p>
