For appropriate selection of the variables we held extensive discussions and a workshop with experts both in Ecuador and at the headquarters of the Inter-American Development Bank, Washington DC. Thus, we selected 42 variables and did not attempt to reduce dimensions (e.g. via principal components analysis) as our interest is to identify the effects of each variable on the formation of the composite indicator.
