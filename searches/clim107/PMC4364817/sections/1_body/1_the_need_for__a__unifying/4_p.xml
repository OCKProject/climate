<p class="p">Thermal ranges are principally wider in isolated molecules, organelles, or cells than in the intact organism. Molecular or organellar functions thus become thermally constrained earlier when integrated into the organism. The latter provides regulatory feedback on the use and expression of genome, transcriptome, and proteome such that these patterns follow the shape of the thermal reaction norm (Windisch et al. 
 <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), reflecting the mechanistic integration of molecular into whole organism functioning. Functional scope of the organism becomes constrained by limiting biotic interactions (e.g., limited food availability, competition, predatory pressure), which demand energy and reduce the energy excess supporting other life-sustaining performances and thus fitness. Such effects constrain the fundamental niche to the realized niche at ecosystem level and shrink the temperature-dependent geographical distribution of multicellular organisms such as animals and plants (Pörtner et al. 
 <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). These links and interdepencies across organizational levels, accessible through OCLTT, are only just emerging and need further investigation (Pörtner 
 <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). We are not aware of alternative concepts equally powerful in integrating molecular to whole organism and ecosystem functioning under climate change. We also suggest that recent attempts to prove or disprove the OCLTT framework have not been successful when using reductionist approaches outside ecological or evolutionary context. OCLTT may be common in animals using a convective oxygen supply system (thus possibly excluding adult insects). It has been proposed that more “classic” ways of interpreting the results of reductionist experiments (e.g., by Clark et al. 
 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Gräns et al. 
 <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; and Wang et al. 
 <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) do not capture relevant aspects and contrast the more integrative, ecosystem-oriented, and evolutionary ways of interpretation in accordance with OCLTT (cf. Farrell 
 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Pörtner and Giomi 
 <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Pörtner 
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, the term “capacity” is used differently by the OCLTT sceptics than by those who apply OCLTT. The former asks whether the circulatory system if pushed to its limits is able to provide sufficient oxygen to the organism until lethal temperatures (Gräns et al. 
 <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The latter emphasize the interdependence of capacity and cost (e.g., of mitochondria, or cardiocirculation) and therefore variable maintenance costs and associated functional scope. Such cost is relatively low within the optimum but becomes overproportionally high toward the edge of the thermal tolerance range, then constraining functional scope (the percent increment with warming is highest in low capacity systems such as in polar or winter stenotherms, e.g., Pörtner, 
 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>, Wittmann et al. 
 <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). In this way, the progressive increase in thermal limitation is captured from the earliest onset of constraints to lethal temperatures. OCLTT might be viewed as an early evolutionary principle in animals that has been modified in various climate zones (e.g., polar areas, Pörtner et al. 
 <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) or during the evolution of air breathing (Giomi et al. 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). This emphasizes the need for the parallel development of theoretical and experimental approaches, especially as experiments cannot resolve all facets of complex phenomena. Current theories of evolutionary biology illustrate these requirements (e.g., Angilletta 
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>).
