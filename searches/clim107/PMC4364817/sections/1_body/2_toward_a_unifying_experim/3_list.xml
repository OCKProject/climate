 <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p class="p" xmlns="">To determine the effects of isolated and coupled climate variables at physiological levels of different taxonomic groups; and to determine the bases of sublethal and lethal stress and capacities to respond to stresses induced by climate. </p>
 </div>
 <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p class="p" xmlns=""> To explore the physical, chemical, and biotic factors that affect and limit the distribution of species. At distribution limits, these factors may well indicate some of the likely consequences of climate change in the future. Such analyses may be most important in species that face extreme conditions today. </p>
 </div>
 <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p class="p" xmlns=""> To study the relationship between tolerances and climate in scenarios of climate change; as well as to analyze how trade-offs in genetic adaptation may set limits to distribution and abundance. </p>
 </div>
 <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p class="p" xmlns=""> To assess how phenotypic traits are affected by high levels of environmental variability encountered over large geographic distances, but also over long time scales. </p>
 </div>
 <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p class="p" xmlns=""> To identify how physical, chemical, and biotic factors linked to climate change induce noxious phenotypic states in some species but not in others, and shape the distribution and coexistence of species. </p>
 </div>
 <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p class="p" xmlns=""> To test how trophic interactions (e.g., plantâ€“herbivore) are affected by changes in temperature and how it may impact community structure and function. In this case, an herbivore may alter how species respond to raised temperatures. This dependency in the response of both herbivore and plant to temperature suggests that the ecological impacts of future climate change on trophic interactions may be an import avenue of research. </p>
 </div>
 <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p class="p" xmlns=""> To determine the limits and pathways of genetic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, and life-history strategies to climate change and to analyze how different life-history stages are affected by climate variables. </p>
 </div>
 <div class="list-item" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p class="p" xmlns=""> To improve the capacity of modeling tools used to predict effects of climate on species distributions and abundances, by incorporating physiological and molecular information. </p>
