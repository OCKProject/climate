<p class="p">Ecologists would need to consider this framework when developing different models of how functional biodiversity can be impacted by climate change. Many of them concur that these models lack or oversimplify the physiological basis of climate change responses, which may lead to very large under- or overestimations of risks and vulnerabilities for individuals, species, and ecosystems (Huey etÂ al.
