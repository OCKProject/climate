<p class="p">Power analysis reveals that, holding constant the estimated effect on the beliefs about whether climate change is occurring (Column 1 of 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t006" class="xref">Table 6</xref>), we would need about 2,600 observations in total (1,300 treated and 1,300 control) to have an 80% chance of rejecting a null hypothesis of no treatment effect with 95% confidence. For the beliefs about whether humans are causing climate change (Column 2 of 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t006" class="xref">Table 6</xref>), we would need about 5,200 individuals to do so. If these two long-run estimates were significant, they would show that about 50–55% of the original effect of the “hard information” treatment persists for at least six months. Given the magnitude of these estimates, the simplicity of the treatment (i.e., each treated respondent read only one paragraph), and the relative lack of research about whether or not information treatment effects persist, obtaining a larger sample size to see whether the long-run effects are indeed significant should be a fruitful area for future research.
