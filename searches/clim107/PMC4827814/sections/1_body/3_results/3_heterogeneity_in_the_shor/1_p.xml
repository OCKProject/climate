<p class="p">Next, we decompose the treatment effect according to respondents’ political ideology, education, and climate change knowledge. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the effects of information broken down by reported political ideology. In Column 1, the belief that climate change is already underway seems to be most strongly affected by information among the liberals and the conservatives. However, the standard errors are large and we are unable to reject that the three coefficients are significantly different from one another. Columns 2, 4, and 5 suggest that information most strongly affects moderates’ beliefs about humans causing climate change and about the probability of temperature increases, although once again, we are unable to reject that the three ideological groups respond to information in an identical manner. Beliefs about policy actions are not significantly affected by information for any of the ideological groups (Column 3). Finally, treated conservatives donate marginally more to climate change causes, although we fail to reject that the point estimates for the three groups are equal (Column 6).
