<p class="p">Climate change generates much public disagreement, despite the broad consensus of scientists that it is a real phenomenon caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases [

 <xref rid="pone.0151469.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Because climate change is a high-profile issue, implementing meaningful policies to address it will almost surely require a significant degree of public consensus. However, only 50% of US adults believe that climate change is mostly man-made, compared to 87% of scientists [
 <xref rid="pone.0151469.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Moreover, differences between the beliefs of liberals and conservatives are stark and have recently widened. In 2001, 60% of Democrats and about 50% of Republicans believed the effects of global warming have already begun to happen; by 2008, that figure was 75% of Democrats compared to 42% of Republicans [
 <xref rid="pone.0151469.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Thus, the current gap between the consensus among scientists and the public consensus on this issue is driven largely by conservatives [
 <xref rid="pone.0151469.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In the US Congress, one political party can prevent another from passing legislation unless the latter has a supermajority. Because of this, the ideological divide on climate change can hinder public policy even if that policy has the support of the majority of Americans. Thus, whether and how the overall public consensus on this issue can be brought closer to that of scientists, and how the ideological divide can be bridged are both important public policy questions.
