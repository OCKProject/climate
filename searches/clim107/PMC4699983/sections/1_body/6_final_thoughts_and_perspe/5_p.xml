<p class="p">The relationship between tick development rates and temperature is nonlinear, as the relationship between entomological measures of infection and human risk of vector-borne diseases (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hollingsworth et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, there are also several methodological caveats (e.g., use of inadequate environmental variables, differences between real and visible tick populations) that should be taken into account while developing models to investigate tick responses to changes in climate and host densities (

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Balashov, 2012</xref>), pathogen diversity, human demography, human behaviour, economics, politics, and human exposure to pathogens, also considering all ecological processes (e.g., trophic cascades) and other possible interactions (mutual effects of increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased deforestation rates). The elevated number of variables and of interacting factors involved and their complexity make tick-borne pathogen transmission systems beyond (current) human comprehension (
