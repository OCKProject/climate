<p class="p">Even if the relationship between grey wolf reintroduction and increased fruit availability and consumption by grizzly bears (

 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ripple et al., 2015</xref>), the occurrence of a wolf-inducted trophic cascade in this area is evident. The reintroduction of wolves triggered important changes in the local ecosystem, when they started preying on ungulates, particularly elk (

 <italic class="italic">Vulpes vulpes</italic>), and so on, resulted in important changes in terrestrial mammal and bird communities in the Yellowstone National Park.
