<p class="p">The response of ticks to changes in climate and in densities of their hosts can be variable. For instance, manipulations of models (even deterministic ones) can produce different outcomes, including tick populations that either rise or fall under increasing host densities, depending on initial conditions (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dobson, 2014a</xref>). Tick-borne pathogen transmission systems are also difficult to predict (perhaps, unpredictable) in the long term, because of the possibility of chaotic behaviour (sensitive dependence on initial conditions). The existence of complex ecological processes (e.g., trophic cascades) and their possible influences on the tick-host-pathogen triad increase the complexity of models of multi-host transmission systems. For instance, a trophic cascade is ecological process that starts at the top of the food chain and fall down to the bottom (
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Paine, 1980</xref>). Food-webs may be influenced by top-down effects from carnivores to plants and by bottom-up effects that link plants to herbivores and higher trophic levels, and the importance of each in a given ecosystem is a subject of debate (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Muhly et al., 2013</xref>). A classical example of a trophic cascade is what happened in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States, when grey wolves (

In his talk “For more wonder, rewild the world” filmed July 2013 at TEDGlobal 2013, George Monbiot presented a very exciting description of what happened in this park, explaining how wolves transformed not just the local ecosystem, but also its physical geography (see video at:
