<p class="p">Trophic cascades may potentially affect the transmission dynamics of pathogens such as

 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Levi et al. (2012)</xref> elaborated a theoretical model suggesting that changes in predator communities may have cascading impacts that facilitate the emergence of Lyme disease. They showed that increases in Lyme disease in the north-eastern and mid-western United States over the past three decades coincide with a range-wide decline of a key small-mammal predator, the red fox, likely due to expansion of coyote populations, being uncorrelated with deer abundance as usually thought.
