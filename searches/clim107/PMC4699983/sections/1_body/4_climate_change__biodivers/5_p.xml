<p class="p">Habitat disturbances may alter terrestrial mammal communities and tick-borne pathogen transmission systems. For instance, 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lou et al. (2014)</xref> developed a model to investigate the joint effects of seasonal temperature variation and host community composition on 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> transmission by 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic>. They proposed a stage-structured periodic model by integrating seasonal tick development and activity, multiple host species and complex pathogen transmission routes between ticks and reservoirs. In such model, climate warming can amplify and slightly change the seasonality of disease risk. Both the dilution and amplification effects could be detected by feeding the model with different animal hosts.
