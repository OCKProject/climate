<p class="p">Climate change is modifying the environment where we live and our way of living. For instance, global warming is booming the market for air conditioning, which is expected to grow in the coming decades. The explosive growth of the air conditioning market and the increased fossil fuel burning in response to increased temperatures may contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and, again, to global warming. Indeed, the discovery that chlorofluorocarbons are major contributors to ozone layer breakdown, resulted in their replacement by hydrochlorofluorocarbons and, more recently, by hydrofluorocarbons (
