<p class="p">Human development is a major threat to global biodiversity. Transformation of natural environments (e.g., tropical forests) into farming lands and urban settlements, introduction of invasive alien species, pollution of land, air and water, sustained over-exploration of natural resources, and unsustainable harvesting of wild plants and animals are among the main drivers of biodiversity loss (

For example, across the tropics, between 1980 and 2000, more than 55% of new agricultural land (

It may be anticipated that the growing world human population and the consequently increasing demand for food will cause profound changes in terms of hydric resources, land cover, and global biodiversity in the coming years.
