<p class="p">Many studies have recently investigated the effects of climate change on the Earth's biodiversity. The predicted impact of climate change on biodiversity may vary widely, depending on several variables (e.g., method of analysis, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered). In their review, 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bellard et al. (2012)</xref> came to the conclusion that “the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the Earth”. This has been just been confirmed (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ceballos et al., 2015</xref>) and the scenario is expected to be worse in the fore coming decades, not only due to climate changes and but also other factors such as deforestation (
