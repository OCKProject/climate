<p class="p">In the United Kingdom, the onset of larval activity coincides with a threshold of 10 °C (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Randolph et al., 2002</xref>), whereas the threshold temperature for activity by questing nymphs and adults of 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> has been estimated as a weekly mean daily maximum temperature of approximately 7 °C (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Randolph, 2009</xref>; and references cited therein). Interestingly, questing nymphs and adults of 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> may be found during winter in southern Italy, the southernmost part of its distribution range, often in sympatry with the winter tick 
 <italic class="italic">Haemaphysalis inermis</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Both species can be collected with mean daily temperature below 5 °C in southern Italy (
