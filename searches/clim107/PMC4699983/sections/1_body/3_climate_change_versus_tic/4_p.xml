<p class="p">On the occasion of the IECID meeting in Sitges, someone asked me about the threshold temperature for 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic>, considering that winter temperatures in Sweden and Russia may be very cold for any living creature (a Brazilian would be inclined to agree). I probably did not elaborate a proper answer for that question, because the relationship between tick development rates and temperature is nonlinear (

 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tomkins et al. (2014)</xref> stated “while the idea of fixed temperature thresholds applying across populations may be a convenient assumption from the point of view of predicting the distribution of ticks, it may lack realism”. For instance, it has been demonstrated that geographically separated populations of 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> show clinal variation in the response of questing to temperature, suggesting that physiological thresholds are not fixed in this species (
