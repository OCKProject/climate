<p class="p">Climate change will likely increase the climatic niche of

 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Porretta et al., 2013</xref>). However, the response of ticks to climate change will vary widely from region to region and according to tick species. A recent ecological niche model for 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> in Europe under a changing climate scenario predicted a potential habitat expansion of 3.8% in all of Europe. Interestingly, this model indicated habitat expansion in some areas (e.g., Scandinavia, the Baltics, and Belarus) and habitat contraction in others (e.g., Alps, Pyrenees, interior Italy, and north-western Poland) (
