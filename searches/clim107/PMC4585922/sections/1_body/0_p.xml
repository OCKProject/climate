 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century of up to 2.0 m above 2000 levels. Although the rates of sea-level rise and the ultimate elevations of sea-level rise by 2100 are debated, the existing data and predictive models all suggest that eustatic sea-level will be higher by the end of the century and that it will have a profound impact on low-lying coastal areas
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. Sea-level rise is particularly critical for low-lying carbonate reef-lined atoll islands, many of which have maximum elevations less than 4 m above present sea level

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Most atoll islands have limited land and water available for human habitation, water and food sources, and ecosystems that are vulnerable to inundation from sea-level rise. Because vertical reef flat accretion rates for the coral reefs upon which carbonate islands sit (1–4 mm/yr
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>) are up to an order of magnitude smaller than the rates of projected sea-level rise (8–16 mm/yr
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>), projected sea-level rise will outstrip new reef flat accretion, resulting in a net increase in water depth over atolls’ reefs.
