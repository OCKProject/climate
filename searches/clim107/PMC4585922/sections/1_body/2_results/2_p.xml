<p class="p">Waves on most atoll reef crests and reef flats are water depth-limited, which suggests as water depth increases with sea-level rise, larger waves

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Wave heights along the islandsâ€™ shorelines will become larger with rising sea level. Because wavelength in shallow water is primarily a function of the ratio of wave period to water depth, wavelengths will also increase with sea-level rise (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>, will similarly increase with sea-level rise. Although there is large heterogeneity in the resulting wave-driven run-up around the islands
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref> due to spatial variations in waves around the islands (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) and beachface slope, there is a general trend of higher wave-driven run-up on the sides of the islands closer to the reef crest. This is related to greater wave and resulting set-up that influences depth-limited wave heights on the reef flat because less wave energy is dissipated on the narrower reef flats.
