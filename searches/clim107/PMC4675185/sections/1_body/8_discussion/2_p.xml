<p class="p">Regarding the future of the Town of Tangier, except small portions of each ridge (&lt;10%), the remaining upland is at a mean of +1.2 m PMSL. Based on projected rates of land loss and RSLR, the town will be uninhabitable in less than 100 years (likely by 2063) and all current uplands, with the possible exception of the three small higher areas (&lt;10% of current uplands), will be converted to a mix of intertidal and high estuarine marsh.</p>
