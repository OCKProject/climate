<p class="p">The Tangier Islands were examined for the rate of shoreline loss over time (1850â€“2013) using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System from USGS
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. The overall historic rate of land loss from all three (Goose, Uppards, Tangier) Tangier Islands was determined using available shoreline data and further analyzed to assess the rate over time. We discarded transects that did not touch all shorelines, as well as transects that were not striking the shoreline at an angle close, or perpendicular, to the shore, in order to obtain accurate results (

Further statistical analyses were done to determine if the rate of the western shoreline and eastern shoreline retreats differed, and if they differed between Tangier and Uppards Islands. We also conducted analyses (multiple linear regression) on the shoreline erosion data to determine, if possible, on which shorelines erosion was dominated by storm-induced erosion and/or RSLR.
