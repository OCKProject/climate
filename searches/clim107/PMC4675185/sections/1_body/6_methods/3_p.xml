<p class="p">Applying the rate of shoreline retreat calculated for the Western Shore of Uppards, Eastern shorelines of Uppards and Tangier, and internal land loss, projections were made in ARCGIS to predict the amount of land loss and island configuration in 25, 50 and 100 years from a 2013 baseline. We used the local RSLR (Sewells Point) as it is very close to the southern Chesapeake Bay mean of 4.0 mm yr
