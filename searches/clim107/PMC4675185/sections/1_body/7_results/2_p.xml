<p class="p">We then separated island transects of shoreline data from 1850, 1905, 1938, 1943, 1960, 1987, 2001, 2009 and 2013 into western, eastern, and interior shores using USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System, and developed estimates of land loss over time for these shorelines. The erosion rate on the eastern shore of Tangier Island (1850–2013) was lower (86.61 m or 0.53 m yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) than that of the eastern Uppards Island shoreline (214.52 m or 1.32 m yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). In order to assess the possible impact of major storms (wind speeds from 63 to &gt;119 km hr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), we consulted historic records
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref> to identify major storms that struck the Tangier Islands (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>) and assessed Uppards Island out of the three main islands due to its large size, similar persistence to Tangier Island and that it has not been protected by any stone breakwaters as Tangier has been. For Uppards Island eastern shoreline, RSLR is the driving factor for land losses (multiple linear regression, p &gt; 0.291 for storms over time, p &lt; 0.019 for RSLR over time). Major storms had significant impacts on the western shores of Uppards Island (multiple linear regression, p &lt; 0.028 for storms, p = 0.763 for RSLR). Interior shorelines of tidal creeks have also lost significant land since 1850 (0.301 m yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>); however, due to limited data we were unable to resolve the reason statistically. These estimated future rates of land loss developed from the regressions were applied when we used ARCGIS to project future land-loss scenarios.
