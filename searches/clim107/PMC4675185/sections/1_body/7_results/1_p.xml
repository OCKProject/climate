<p class="p">Land loss has been extensive since 1850, especially along the western shore (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). As of 2013, only 33.25% (319.35 HA) of the Tangier Islands remain since 1850 (875.33 HA) giving a mean annual loss of 3.41 HA yr

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>) and Tangier Island, before breakwater construction. We fit linear regressions (all parameters had p &lt; 0.05), to the data to predict the lifespan of the island system (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) using the historic land- loss rate projected into the future. Best fits were linear, quadratic or cubic (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). These fits suggest that, if historic rates of land loss and RSLR were to continue, the islands should be inundated by 2106, possibly as early as 2070. Goose Island, the smallest island of the three, is the first predicted to be completely submerged-before 2050 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figs 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">4</xref>)-regardless of the RSLR scenario (linear, low, mid, or high) chosen. The low and mid-range RSLR scenarios predict a similar time of inundation for Uppards and Tangier by approximately 2106, with the high RSLR scenario predicting these islands will be lost by the late 2060s.
