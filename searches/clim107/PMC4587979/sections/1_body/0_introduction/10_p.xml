<p class="p">The choice of target words for the tweets and for the Google trend searches were the specific topic phrases [
 <xref rid="pone.0138996.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0138996.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. These were chosen because of the descriptive nature of the phrases. Scientific literature is very specific in its use and therefore has very definitive meanings. The appropriation of these words by the population as a method for describing their response to the variation in the environment provides the basis for the choice as target words for the study. The classification of the words as being positive versus negative lies in the direction provided by Frank Lutz. This politicization of a scientific word as a means of directing public awareness, means the prescription of one phrase (climate change) as being more positive than the other (global warming).
