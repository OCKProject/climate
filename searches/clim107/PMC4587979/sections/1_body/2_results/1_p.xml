 <xref rid="pone.0138996.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) from 2004–2014, people searched for the term global warming (n = 8,464; mean ± S.D = 25.33 ± 2.05) more frequently than climate change (n = 8,283; mean ± S.D. = 7.97±0.74). Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 and was awarded the Nobel Prize, interest in the term global warming as used in internet searches has decreased significantly since 2010 (K = 51493, t = 2010-May-23, P&lt;0.001). Further the change in RSV also been indicative of the decreased pattern (Kendall’s tau = -0.336, S = -44563, P&lt;0.001). The use of the term “climate change” has risen marginally since 2006 (K = 38681, t = 2006-Oct-08, P&lt;0.001), as indicated by a slight increase (Kendall’s tau = -0.07, S = 9068, P&lt;0.001). These findings show that the difference in usage of the two terms climate change and global warming has recently been reduced.
