<p class="p">The Pearson correlations in 
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> provide direct information for how people’s willingness to endorse mitigation and adaptation—either on a personal or societal level—are related. Most importantly, all correlation coefficients between mitigation and adaptation are positively related with medium to large effect sizes (.44 ≤ 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> ≤. 66). The strongest relationships were found between variables that were on the same level of implementation (either personal or societal): The correlation between support for mitigation and adaptation policies was 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> =. 66 in the UK and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> =. 61 in Switzerland. People’s personal behavioural intentions to mitigate climate change and adapt to its consequences were also strongly correlated 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> =. 60.
