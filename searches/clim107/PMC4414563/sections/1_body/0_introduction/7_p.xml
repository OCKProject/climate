<p class="p">Lastly, there are at least two reasons why the relationship between mitigation and adaptation may be 
 <italic class="italic">unsystematic</italic>. First, the media typically frame climate change mitigation and adaptation independently of each other [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. This makes it difficult for laypeople to relate the two strategies to each other, other than via their common association with the issue of climate change. Second, it is possible that the way different people relate mitigation to adaptation varies strongly (e.g., some people may endorse both strategies because of their common goal, others favouring one strategy because of its specific characteristics). In this case the pattern between the two strategies could look unsystematic (i.e., zero-relationship). In sum, good reasons can be advanced for a negative, positive, or unsystematic relationship between mitigation and adaptation.
