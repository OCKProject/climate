<p class="p">To respond to the challenges posed by climate change, societies around the world are faced with two related but separate strategies. The first strategy, 
 <italic class="italic">mitigation</italic>, involves reducing the magnitude of future climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., reduction of energy consumption) and enhancing greenhouse gas sinks (e.g., afforestation) [

 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], it is also important to prepare for and deal with the negative consequences of climate change (e.g., protecting coastal zones from sea-level rise) as well as taking advantage of the positive consequences of climate change (e.g., growing wine in regions that were previously too cold for that purpose). This second response to climate change is referred to as
