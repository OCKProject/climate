<p class="p">The third shortcoming of this research has to do with the selection of predictor variables. Although we included a variety of psychological processes to study similarities and differences between endorsement of mitigation and adaptation, there are other potentially relevant variablesâ€”for example, the extent to which people believe that the proposed measures will be effective (i.e., efficacy beliefs [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]) and see themselves as personally capable of responding to climate change (i.e., self-efficacy beliefs [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Other relevant processes might include perceived costs of responses [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], experience with the effects of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], or beliefs and opinion of relevant others [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Studying these alternative predictors of endorsement of mitigation and adaptation could reveal that the motives to mitigate and to adapt vary more strongly than suggested by our findings.
