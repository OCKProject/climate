<p class="p">Within analytical risk perception another differentiation should be made when dealing with climate change: that of generalised risks (e.g., to other people) versus the risks that are seen to be self-relevant to the individual contemplating action. Typically, people estimate the risks to others to be greater than those to themselves [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], something that can interfere with taking action because it deflects personal relevance and responsibility. This type of thinking has also been highlighted in relation to the risks of climate change: People generally perceive climate change as a distant threat, something that affects strangers, and that happens in remote times and places rather than here and now [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The perception of climate change as a distant threat could lead to the perspective that climate change risks are irrelevant to the individual and that there is no need for personal action. Put the other way around, when climate change is perceived as a phenomenon with proximal consequences, then people should also have a greater sense of urgency and responsibility, and should ultimately be more motivated to respond to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The assumption that proximal risk perceptions should increase people’s willingness to act seems especially relevant with regard to adaptation, given its predominantly local focus [

 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Haden and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] provide some empirical evidence for this assumption. They found that the more farmers were concerned about future
