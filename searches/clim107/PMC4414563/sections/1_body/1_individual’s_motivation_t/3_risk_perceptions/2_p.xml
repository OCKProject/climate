<p class="p">When used to explain people’s endorsement of 
 <italic class="italic">mitigation</italic>, both analytic and affective appraisals of risks have been found to be reliable predictors: The more people considered climate change as a risk and the more negative feelings they had about it, the more they were willing to mitigate [

 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Most studies that investigated risk perceptions explicitly related to climate change found no relevant (or only a negligible) link with people’s level of adaptation support [

 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and is inconsistent with more general research on hazard preparedness, which typically finds that risk perceptions are strongly related to people’s willingness to take preventive measures [
