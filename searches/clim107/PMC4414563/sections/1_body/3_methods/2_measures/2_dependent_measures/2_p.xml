<p class="p">Participants were presented with a brief introduction (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>) explaining the need and the rationale underlying the idea of adaptation. To assess 
 <italic class="italic">support for pro-active adaptation policies</italic>, we developed a catalogue of 15 adaptation measures that were guided by adaptation research [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and by strategies from large cities [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The proposed adaptation measures focused on conservation of species, protection against water scarcity, heat, and floods. Participants were told that there were many steps that “we can take as a society to adapt to climate change” and then asked to indicate how much they would support different adaptation measures. The 15 items formed a reliable scale (α
