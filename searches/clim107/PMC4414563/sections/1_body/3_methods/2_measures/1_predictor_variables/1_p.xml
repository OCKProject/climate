<p class="p">To assess the degree to which people were 
 <italic class="italic">sceptical</italic> about human-made climate change, we adopted seven previously used items [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] and added an item that referred to the previous unusually cold winter. Participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed with these statements (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1 Table</xref> for all items used). The seven items formed a reliable scale (Cronbach’s α in the UK survey =. 85, Cronbach’s α in the Swiss survey =. 87).
