<p class="p">In the Swiss survey, we assessed

 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]). In the UK survey, participants were first asked if they had any negative feelings about climate change (1 = 
 <italic class="italic">none</italic>). If they replied with “yes”, they were also asked to rate the degree of their negative feelings (2 = 
 <italic class="italic">slightly</italic>, 5 = 
 <italic class="italic">extremely</italic>).
