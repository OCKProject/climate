<p class="p">Our research questions posed whether social vulnerability and health susceptibility (RQ
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1</sub>), and risk exposure (RQ
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>), influence perceptions of climate changeâ€™s health threat. The results suggest these effects exist. Addressing our first research question, five of the seven factors for social vulnerability and health susceptibility are significant predictors of climate change health risk perceptions in a direction that would suggest that people who are more vulnerable feel themselves to be at higher risk, even holding constant general health risk perceptions, political ideology, and climate change beliefs (

Having one or more chronic medical conditions, being a member of a community of color (African American/black, Hispanic/Latino), and having less income are significant predictors of higher risk perceptions; being female is of near significance (
