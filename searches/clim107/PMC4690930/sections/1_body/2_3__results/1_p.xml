<p class="p">In 2013, more than half of Marylanders (53%) said that they and their households are moderately or very vulnerable to the potential health effects of climate change (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Only 17% of residents said that there would be no health impacts from climate change, or that they and members of their household were not vulnerable. There is substantial variation in climate health risk perceptions across the state, with mapping of the aggregate dependent climate health risk variable revealing specific regions of higher and lower risk perception than others, such as some coastal and urban areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-14994-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Visual interpretation of the mapped results suggests that some of the higher areas of perceived risk are both more exposed to physical risks and have greater social vulnerability. The low-lying regions of the DelMarVa peninsula, the geographic region located between the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay, are prone to flooding and at risk from projected inundation from sea-level rise, especially south of Cambridge [

Areas of the state with medium to high social vulnerability include almost all of Maryland’s Eastern Shore on the DelMarVa peninsula; Baltimore City and the surrounding county; Prince George’s County to the immediate east and north of Washington, D.C. (see Bowie on the map); the southernmost county on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay, St. Mary’s; and the state’s panhandle north of West Virginia [
