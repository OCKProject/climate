Direct impacts result in human injuries; illnesses and deaths related to extreme weather events and changes in weather patterns; rises in infectious diseases due to changes in vector-pathogen relations; and increased disease burdens from declines in water and air quality. Indirect impacts include impaired food security and nutrition as a result of changes in crop yields, as well as displacement and loss of livelihoods leading to negative health effects.
