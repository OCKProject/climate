<p class="p">Public awareness and knowledge of climate health risks are an important component of climate adaptation [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, there has been little research on peopleâ€™s perceptions of health risks from climate change either in the United States or abroad [

 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,

 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Surveys from the United States, Canada and Malta that assessed public understanding of the links between climate change and human health have found that less than half of American respondents believe that they themselves are at risk from climate impacts [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]; conversely, rates of concerned respondents are higher in Canada and Malta [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The frequency of cited health impacts is greater for multiple choice responses or specific prompts than open-ended questions [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. This suggests that although people believe climate change will cause declines in public health, it is not a highly salient issue.
