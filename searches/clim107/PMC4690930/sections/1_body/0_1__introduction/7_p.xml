<p class="p">To our knowledge, the influence of health susceptibility on personal and household perceptions of climate change health risk has not been studied, particularly in combination with two of the most common climate impacts that vulnerable communities in the United States are likely to face: extreme heat in urban areas, and flooding [

In this study we hypothesize, based on previous literature, that general health risk perceptions, political ideology, and climate beliefs will strongly predict perceptions of climate change as a personal and household health threat. Furthermore, we pose two research questions:
