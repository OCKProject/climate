 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], but is particularly of relevance for climate adaptation planning. Public health organizations have shown an increasing interest in communicating with vulnerable populations in order to promote successful adaptation strategies for these health threats [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established a Climate and Health Program in 2009 [

Maryland participates in the CDC Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative in which it is tasked with assessing state health vulnerabilities and potential interventions, developing and implementing a climate and health plan, and conducting ongoing activity evaluation.
