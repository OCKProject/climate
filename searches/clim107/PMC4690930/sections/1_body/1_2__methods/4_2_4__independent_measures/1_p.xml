 <italic class="italic">Climate change beliefs.</italic> Climate change certainty is measured with two questions: “Do you think that climate change is happening?” (yes, no, don’t know); and “If you answered either yes or no, how sure are you?” (not at all sure, somewhat sure, very sure, extremely sure). The two measures are combined into a 9-point scale ranging from (1) extremely sure climate change is not happening to (9) extremely sure climate change is happening. A scale comprised of four dichotomous items represents the number of perceived local climate health impacts that respondents believe will occur in Maryland. The question “Which—if any—of the following health problems will become more common in Maryland in the future because of climate change?” includes four response categories: respiratory and breathing problems; infectious diseases such as West Nile virus; heat stroke; and injuries from storms or other extreme weather events. The responses were added to create an additive scale from 0–4 correct responses.
