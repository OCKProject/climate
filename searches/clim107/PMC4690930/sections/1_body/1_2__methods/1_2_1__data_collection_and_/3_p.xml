All missing survey data, with the exception of race and ethnicity, were substituted using hot deck imputation, a strategy for handling missing data that is widely employed by government statistics agencies, survey organizations, and academic researchers [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. This single imputation technique is distinct from multiple imputation [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The matched variables were gender, age and education, for which there was no missing data but expected differences on attitudinal measures and income.
