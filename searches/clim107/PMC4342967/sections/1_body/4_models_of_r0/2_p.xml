<p class="p">The recent application of next-generation matrix (NGM) models to tick-borne diseases has provided some useful guidance about which demographic and epidemiological parameters are most important for the basic reproductive rate of the infection,

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. This observation is relevant to the spread of tick-borne disease in a changing climate since all of the steps in this transition, from moulting to overwintering survival to survival while questing, are sensitive to climate conditions. Also, when the phenology of ticks and the duration of infectiousness are included in the NGM of Lyme disease in North America, the probability that a nymph finds a competent host is also strongly influential [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. We suggest that a focus on those parameters with high elasticities will prove most fruitful, especially when considering alternative assumptions and hypotheses in this framework. For instance, most NGM models de-emphasize the importance of tick and host densities (but see [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]), but this is probably because they assume that tick–host encounters are essentially constant [
