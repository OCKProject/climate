<p class="p">If temporal trends in Lyme disease incidence are correlated with temporal trends in climate, this would suggest that long-term climate change will cause directional changes in the public health burden of tick-borne disease. An early study of correlations between climate variables and Lyme disease cases was performed by Subak [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>], who collated the annual number of Lyme disease cases between 1993 and 2001 in seven states from the northeastern United States. Subak asked whether the Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI, a measure of summer moisture) and the average winter temperatures in these states predicted Lyme disease incidence the following year or 2 years later. Although winter temperatures were poor predictors, PHDI 2 years previously correlated positively with Lyme disease incidence for four of the states, although a plausible mechanism was not provided [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Analysing the same dataset, McCabe &amp; Bunnell [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] concluded that Lyme disease cases in the northeastern United States were positively correlated with precipitation during May and June of the same year, but not with precipitation in any prior years. Perhaps because of these conflicting conclusions and the lack of a mechanistic understanding of processes that might underlie the correlations, not to mention the issues with identifying limiting conditions for a process that is generally increasing [
