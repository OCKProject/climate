 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>] used remotely sensed data on mean monthly temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; an index of plant photosynthetic activity reflecting combined moisture and temperature) to generate a climate suitability envelope. This model was then used to hindcast changes in the distribution of suitable habitat between 2000 and 2010, showing spreading suitable conditions that roughly match apparent increases in tick distribution. Estrada-Pena 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] suggest that continued climate warming will cause a continued range expansion for this tick and potentially the pathogens it transmits, reinforcing the predictions based on process models described in §§3 &amp; 4. Similarly, Porretta 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] developed a MAXENT climate envelope model from over 4500 tick occurrence locations using 19 bioclimatic variables derived from monthly rainfall and temperature data. Their model predicted a massive spreading of habitat suitability throughout northern Europe and northwestern and northcentral Russia by 2050. Both the more severe greenhouse gas emission scenario (A2) and more modest (B2) scenario produced similar predicted spread, although the B2 scenario generally predicted greater habitat suitability within the range [
