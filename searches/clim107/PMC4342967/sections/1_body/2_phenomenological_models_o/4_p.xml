 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>], such bioclimatic modelling results must be considered provisional because they incorporate only some of the variables known to affect ticks and tick-borne diseases. Without first establishing the mechanisms governing the effects of environmental variables on tick demography, the phenomenological approach risks basing models on spurious rather than causal relationships. In addition, the absence or rarity of ticks in certain regions could be caused by insufficient time for ticks to disperse from the established range rather than by unsuitable current conditions [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In general, for species like 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> that are rapidly expanding their geographical range, the environmental conditions correlated with their distribution at any given time are necessarily a subset of all permissible conditions and thus must underestimate the range of conditions under which they can exist.
