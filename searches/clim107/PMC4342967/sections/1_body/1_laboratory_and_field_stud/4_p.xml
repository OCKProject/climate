 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Low relative humidity (
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic> 50%) permits survival when temperatures are below 5°C, but relative humidity above 
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic> 70% is required when temperatures exceed 
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic> 15°C. These studies also have shown that 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> employs sophisticated movement patterns to seek favourable microclimatic conditions, e.g. under leaf litter or in the soil, when air becomes too warm or dry. For instance, a large saturation deficit reduces activity levels of 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> but apparently has little impact on survival because it is unrelated to tick abundance in the subsequent year [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. As a consequence of these behavioural adaptations, the relevance of laboratory-determined lethal conditions to demographic patterns in nature remains elusive. Climatic restrictions on questing behaviour and host encounters (e.g. saturation deficits; [
