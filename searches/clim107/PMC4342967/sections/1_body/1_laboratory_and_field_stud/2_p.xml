<p class="p">Most 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> ticks spend more than 95% of their lives on or just below the ground surface digesting a blood meal, moulting, in diapause or seeking a host (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20140051F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>). The conditions at the ground thus seem critically important to tick survival and habitat suitability. Research on 
 <italic class="italic">Â Ixodes scapularis</italic> conducted around the time of the discovery of Lyme disease, indicated that tick populations in coastal Massachusetts, USA, were only found after mild winters [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. At this time, 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> in the northeastern United States appeared to be restricted to coastal southern New England [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], a zone of relatively cool summers and warm winters compared with inland sites. These observations led to the conclusion that extreme cold and heat were unsuitable for this species, limiting its distribution and affecting its population dynamics. At the time of these observations, researchers mistakenly considered their study organism a distinct, northern species of tick that had been named 
 <italic class="italic">I. dammini</italic>. Only later, when it was revealed that the New England ticks under study belonged to populations of a widespread species, 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic>, were many of the conclusions revised [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The presence of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> in much colder climates of Minnesota and Wisconsin and in much warmer climates of Georgia and South Carolina provided evidence that the species tolerated a considerably wider range of conditions.
