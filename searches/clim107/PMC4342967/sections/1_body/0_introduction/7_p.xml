<p class="p">Recent advances in modelling effects of climate change on both free-living and parasitic species offer promising avenues for assessing climate effects on tick-borne disease. For instance, hierarchical analyses of both the fundamental and realized niches of the key interacting species (e.g. parasite, vector, reservoir host, ‘accidental’ host), at multiple spatial scales can help bridge the gap between phenomenological and mechanistic approaches [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] provide an example of a species distribution model applied to a pathogen in which habitat structure, host diversity and propagule pressure are considered, while autocorrelation and sampling bias are statistically controlled. Also, the recent application of next-generation matrix models to tick-borne diseases has provided a robust means of identifying the most important demographic and epidemiological processes in the establishment of ticks and tick-borne disease.
