<p class="p">Despite these challenges, the importance of understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change for the distributions and intensities of ticks and tick-borne infections is only increasing as the global climate continues to warm. This is particularly true for 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> ticks and the pathogens they transmit, which are the focus of this review. Two main approaches have been used to project how the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> and the pathogens they transmit will change as the climate changes. The first approach consists of an effort to find the set of environmental factors that best explains the current distribution of ticks (or of tick-borne disease) and, assuming that those conditions represent suitable habitat, project future distributions using models that estimate where that set of conditions will occur in the future. This approach is largely 
 <italic class="italic">phenomenological</italic>, in that environmental factors are selected based on correlations between those factors and the presence (or less commonly, the abundance) of ticks or of tick-borne disease, but typically without knowledge of underlying mechanisms. The second attempts to determine the relationship between specific environmental factors and at least some tick-demographic transitions, and asks which geographical locations currently or in the future provide the environmental conditions that allow tick populations and their associated pathogens to persist or grow. This approach is largely 
 <italic class="italic">mechanistic</italic>, in that it focuses on the mechanisms by which abiotic factors affect tick-demographic parameters. Importantly, both approaches also assume that abiotic conditions are predominantly important, an assumption we return to in ยง2.
