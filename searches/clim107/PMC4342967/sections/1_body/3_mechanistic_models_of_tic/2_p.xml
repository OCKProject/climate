<p class="p">While mechanistic models have the advantage of being able to project biological mechanisms, as opposed to associations, forward in time, the sheer numbers of both climatic parameters and tick-demographic and behavioural response variables pose enormous challenges to the constructing and understanding mechanistic models. Most mechanistic models, therefore, embody one or a few relationships that are thought to be dominant. The approach by Ogden 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], using the average number of degree days greater than 0°C to describe present and project future habitat suitability with climate warming, has been very influential (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]). The authors built their model around the relationships between the key developmental rates (e.g. moulting, eclosion) and temperatures that they had observed in the field for 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> near the northern extent of their North American distribution [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Because of data limitations they tuned many parameter values, including those determining density-dependence and on-host mortality, to reproduce observed patterns. Their simulation model, which included 48 parameters for tick vital rates and two parameters for host-finding, was reasonably successful in mimicking natural patterns of population dynamics for all three blood-feeding stages [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Not surprisingly given its underlying assumptions, this model and several follow-up studies [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>,

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] suggested that the average number of degree days greater than 0°C was the key climatic parameter limiting tick distribution; that vast areas outside the current distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> were suitable and that the tick's geographical range would expand northward and westward well into Canada as the climate warms. However, the model results rest heavily on the assumption that off-host tick mortality rate is a time-constant variable, such that the number of ticks surviving decays exponentially with time in each developmental stage, a reasonable first approximation, but an important assumption that needs testing.
