<p class="p">In a related vein, these complex models have rarely been rigorously statistically tested against empirical data. While these models can produce many response variables (e.g. the presence, peak or overall density and phenology of tick populations), model output does not necessarily match the available data (e.g. [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]). Indeed, finding 
 <italic class="italic">any</italic> data with which to test models properly has sometimes required a great deal of creativity [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. One common approach has been to compare the predicted and observed phenologies by gestalt [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], correlations [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] or ad hoc methods [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>], but what constitutes an adequate or good fit is subjective. Models are rarely challenged with independent datasets from other regions or times. Dobson 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] took the commendable step of challenging their model with data from two independent sites and found substantial deviations between their model's predictions and observed dynamics at these sites. Determining which parameter values needed to change to improve the model fit in each location proved enlightening [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], but we again caution that with so many parameters to tweak, these insights should be viewed as hypotheses rather than fundamental lessons about tick biology. Even with data limitations, we suspect a great deal of rigour and clarity may be gained by incorporating model fitting and validation into formal statistical (i.e. likelihood or Bayesian) frameworks.
