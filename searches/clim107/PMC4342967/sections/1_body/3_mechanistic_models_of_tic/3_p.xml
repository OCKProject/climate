 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Such sensitivity or elasticity analyses can help identify the parameters that most strongly influence tick population dynamics and are thus the most important to validate. However, these models, like any other, simply expose the consequences of the assumptions that they make [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Wu 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], for instance, essentially recreated the model of Ogden 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] using a set of periodic differential equations. It is not surprising that they found that variation in summer temperatures and the specific temperature-dependent rates of development were key parameters. We are not aware of any study with mechanistic models that explicitly considers alternate assumptions or hypotheses (e.g. as alternative model formulations). While these complex mechanistic models can reproduce the general patterns of tick population dynamics, it is unclear which biological mechanisms are necessary and sufficient to do so, and which simply add degrees of freedom. In other words, these models might often make the ‘right’ predictions for the wrong reasons. We see the overparameterization of models as an important deficiency that needs to be addressed and encourage researchers to consider multiple competing hypotheses in their models.
