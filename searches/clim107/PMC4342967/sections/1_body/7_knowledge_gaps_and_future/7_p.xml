<p class="p">For mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, experimental and modelling studies have demonstrated that climate variability in the form of daily temperature range can affect risk of disease transmission [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>]. In both cases, models suggest that incorporating daily temperature variation (as opposed to including only a daily mean temperature) when baseline conditions are cool would increase the probability of an outbreak. However, when baseline conditions are hot, including a daily temperature range is likely to reduce the chance of an outbreak. To date, studies of the effects of temperature variability on the dynamics of tick-borne disease appear to be lacking, but variability could be important nevertheless [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. Climate variability could affect tick survival, host-seeking patterns and phenology, as well as replication rates of tick-borne pathogens.
