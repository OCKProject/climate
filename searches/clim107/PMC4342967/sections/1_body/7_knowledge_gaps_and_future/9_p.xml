<p class="p">To date, there has been little consideration of how environmental conditions such as temperature or temperature variation might influence the replication and persistence of pathogens (e.g.

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>]), but we are aware of no studies addressing this issue for tick-borne pathogens. Alternatively, the immune responses of many invertebrates are temperature sensitive, so it is possible that ticks will be more likely to reduce pathogen densities or even clear their infections at warmer temperatures. In either case, environmental temperatures after the first blood meal have the potential to alter the effective transmission rate from hosts to ticks.
