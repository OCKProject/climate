<p class="p">A unified conceptual model linking climate change to tick-borne disease would be helpful in guiding better understanding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20140051F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>). Guided by this conceptual model, future research could explore the specific, local abiotic variables affected by regional or global changes in climate; the impact of those abiotic variables on behavioural, developmental and demographic processes of ticks, and on the dynamics of tick-borne pathogens. An understanding of climatic impacts on the vector and pathogen will allow researchers to predict how risk of human exposure to these pathogens will change as the climate continues to change. And, finally, climate-driven changes in risk, together with changes in human behaviour, will allow epidemiological patterns to be forecast.
