<p class="p">Another major challenge in understanding the relative importance of directional climate change in dynamics of tick-borne disease is disentangling the climatic effects from temporal variability unrelated to climate change. Recent studies in other disease systems, such as cholera and malaria, have provided models in which causes of fluctuating disease risk from factors intrinsic to the parasites and hosts are distinguished from extrinsic factors such as warming trends [

 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>]. Similar approaches applied to long-term datasets on tick-borne disease could be illuminating. Data–model fusion approaches using hierarchical state–space structures also can be useful in integrating multiple data sources (e.g. entomological and epidemiological), spatial scales, and explicitly incorporate uncertainty in observations and latent processes [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. Such approaches have rarely been applied to tick-borne diseases under changing climate, but would greatly facilitate the objective comparison of alternative models (i.e. hypotheses) in a coherent framework.
