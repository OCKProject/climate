<p class="p">Direct effects of climate on tick-borne pathogens have been neglected, but the potential exists for climatic conditions experienced by ticks to influence persistence and replication rates of pathogens before, during and after seasonal diapause. Recently, both theoretical and empirical studies have addressed how climatic conditions, specifically the severity of winter cold, affect genotype frequencies of 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> via influences on the phenology of larval and nymphal ticks [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. In North American Lyme-disease-endemic regions with relatively mild winters, including the northeastern United States, each year's cohort of larval ticks ecloses and begins seeking hosts in August, about two months after the prior generation's nymphal cohort has peaked in May or June. As a result of this time lag between host inoculation by nymphs and pathogen acquisition by larvae, larvae should acquire only those genotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> that are able to persist in hosts for several months [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> genotypes known to persist well in white-footed mice tend to be the ones that are particularly invasive in humans [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>]. In the Midwestern United States, where winter temperatures are lower and the climate is more extreme, 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> exhibits a 3-year life cycle with fairly synchronous nymphal and larval emergence, and the more persistent human-invasive genotypes thus tend to be under-represented [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>]. Consequently, it is plausible that a warming climate will facilitate dominance by human-invasive strains of 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> in the Midwest, with potentially strong epidemiological consequences [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. Similarly, if we assume that larval development and emergence will be accelerated relative to nymphs in a warming Northeast (e.g. if nymphal emergence is primary controlled by photoperiod [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]), then we would expect less persistent 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> strains to become more common. An analysis of tick phenology in a warming climate by Levi 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTB20140051C115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>], however, indicates that activity peaks of both larval and nymphal 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> s have advanced equally over the past 20 years, in which case the persistent strains should remain dominant.
