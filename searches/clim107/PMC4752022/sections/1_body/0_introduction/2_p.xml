<p class="p">These climate-driven changes challenge the way the planning and practice of conservation have traditionally been done. Most conservation has been predicated on the fact that the environment is relatively stable over the time frames of management planning (generally less than 50 years). However, projected changes in species distributions and ecosystem functions present obvious challenges to this assumption. Over the last decade, there has been a growing literature on what climate change means for biodiversity
