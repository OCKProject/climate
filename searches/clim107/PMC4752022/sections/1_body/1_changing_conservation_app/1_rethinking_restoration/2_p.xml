<p class="p">Rethinking how restoration efforts are applied in light of climate change has led to shifts in thinking as well as in practice. Most fundamentally, practicing restoration in a changing climate requires embracing uncertainty and accepting that the goals of a project may need to change over time

 </sup>. Instead of relying on historical benchmarks, restoration efforts will likely need to look into the future and anticipate changeâ€”perhaps relying on a dynamic reference process that accounts for variability in reference ecosystems

 </sup>. Looking forward will also include rethinking the mix of species to be planted and potentially focusing on ecosystem function rather than particular assemblages of species. Restoration efforts have begun to make use of the same niche modelling methods that have been used to assess potential species responses to climate change

 </sup>, but there is clear recognition that better models are needed
