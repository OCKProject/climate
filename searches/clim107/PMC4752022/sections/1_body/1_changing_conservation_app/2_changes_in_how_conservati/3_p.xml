<p class="p">An approach to planning that has gained some traction for conservation in a dynamic climate involves conserving the underlying geophysical variation in a region, also referred to as “conserving nature’s stage” 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>. The rationale for this approach is that, theoretically, there should be a strong relationship between species distributions and geophysical settings (for example, elevation and geology)
