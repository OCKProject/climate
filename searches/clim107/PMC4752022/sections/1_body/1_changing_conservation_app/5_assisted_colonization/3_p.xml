<p class="p">As the debate worked its ways through the scientific literature, many researchers started to ask more productive questionsâ€”facing the reality that assisted colonization was already being used. There were, for example, several early efforts to develop frameworks for determining under what circumstances assisted colonization would be a viable conservation option

  <xref rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>
 </sup>. Other studies have highlighted the importance of the timing of assisted colonization efforts

  <xref rid="ref-81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>, 
  <xref rid="ref-82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>
 </sup>. Overall, it appears that, at least in the scientific literature, assisted colonization is gaining acceptance as a tool in the conservation toolbox and one that may not differ so much from other movements of species for conservation reasons
