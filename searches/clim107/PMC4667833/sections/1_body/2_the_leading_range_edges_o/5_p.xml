<p class="p">In addition to local adaptations to cold temperatures and photoperiod, range‐edge populations are simply the closest populations in geographic space to the areas that are likely to become newly climatically suitable in the future. Hence, leading range‐edge populations represent the most likely dispersal sources for the individuals that will recruit into and colonize these newly suitable areas. Furthermore, in some tree and invasive plant species, populations at the cold or leading range edge show traits that enhance the potential for long‐distance seed dispersal (Cwynar and MacDonald
