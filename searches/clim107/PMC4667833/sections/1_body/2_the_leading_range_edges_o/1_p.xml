<p class="p">While mean temperatures are increasing almost everywhere on Earth, the magnitude and frequency of extreme cold events are generally changing at much slower and idiosyncratic rates (Kodra et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Therefore, locally‐adapted populations at species' cold range edges could become a key component for species survival. Cold adaptation in trees is not yet fully understood, but it is likely to be controlled by the complex interactions of dozens of different genes, each with small individual effect sizes (Howe et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Local cold adaptations lead to the optimal balance between growth and avoidance of potentially damaging freezing events during the local growing season (Howe et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Common‐garden experiments highlight that reductions in performance outside of the home site are usually attributed to asynchrony between an individual's genetically determined growth phenology and the optimal growing season at the planting site (Howe et al.
