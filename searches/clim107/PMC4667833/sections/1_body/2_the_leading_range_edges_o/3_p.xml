<p class="p">Increasing mean temperatures have advanced the spring growth patterns of many North American trees, such that they now initiate growth earlier in the spring making them more vulnerable to spring frost events (Gu et al.

 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). This pattern of increased freezing damage due to accelerated spring phenology can be seen across large geographic areas, which encompass the entire ranges of many tree species (Gu et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). If the selective pressures of avoiding spring frost events remain constant or increase under future climates, then we can predict that the more conservative growth patterns of cold‐adapted populations (i.e., delayed onset of spring growth) such as those found at treeline ecotones will be favored. If this is the case, warm‐adapted populations could be prevented from expanding or shifting their ranges. In contrast, cold‐adapted populations may maintain their current distributions as well as expand into areas that become climatically suitable under climate change (Fig.
