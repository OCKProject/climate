<p class="p">The southern Amazon is widely known as “the arc of deforestation” due to large‐scale forest clearing for agricultural development (Soares‐Filho et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Beyond simply reducing total forest area, this geographically clustered deforestation may be having the additional negative effect of eliminating the populations that are best‐adapted to the dry and seasonal conditions that will be increasingly widespread in the future. To illustrate how deforestation relates to local climate, we mapped current total annual precipitation and MCWD across the Amazon (resolution of 2.5 arc min based on the WorldClim high‐resolution extrapolated climate database; Hijmans et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). We then overlaid areas that were mapped as being deforested as of 2002 and in areas that are predicted to be deforested by 2050 under a spatially explicit model of deforestation assuming business‐as‐usual (BAU) rates and constraints (Soares‐Filho et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). These analyses clearly show that deforestation is currently occurring and is predicted to occur, predominantly in those areas that have lower annual precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>A, C) and higher seasonality of precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>B, D) such as the Amazon‐cerrado ecotone.
