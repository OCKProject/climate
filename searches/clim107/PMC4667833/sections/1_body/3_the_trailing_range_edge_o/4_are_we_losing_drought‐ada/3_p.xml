<p class="p">We found that current deforestation reduces the extent of climate analogs (i.e., the extent of populations that will be available to populate future Amazonian forests) by an average of 16% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>A) and that future deforestation will reduce the extent of climate analogs by an additional 36% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>B). These results highlight the fact that because deforestation is occurring predominantly in the dry seasonal forest of the southern Amazon, and because the Amazon as a whole is predicted to become increasingly dry and seasonal, the effects of deforestation will extend well beyond its footprint. In other words, deforestation is reducing the number of drought‐resistant populations that can potentially immigrate into the increasingly widespread dry conditions that are analogous to conditions that are currently restricted to the southern Amazon.
