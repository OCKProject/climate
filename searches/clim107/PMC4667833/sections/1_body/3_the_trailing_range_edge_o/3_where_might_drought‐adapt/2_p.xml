<p class="p">The range of MCWD values occurring within the distributions of widespread tree species' was a median of 321 mm (95% confidence interval: 29.8–523 mm; Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>A). Based on the geographic distribution of MCWD values in the Amazon, this corresponds to an estimated median range extent of more than 3000 km (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>B). Local adaptation to drought and summer moisture stress in populations of temperate species can be found over distances of just tens to hundreds of kilometers (Rehfeldt et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; St Clair et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). We found that Amazonian species experience large differences in MCWD across species' ranges, and that these differences occur over large geographic distances. Therefore, our findings support the contention that many of these tropical species are likely to maintain strong local adaptations to moisture stress conditions. More specifically, we predict that populations of widespread species that occur in the southern Amazon will be locally‐adapted to more extreme and/or prolonged drought conditions. If traits related to drought tolerance (e.g., water use efficiency) are limited to specific genotypes that are currently restricted to populations in the southern Amazon, then the individuals capable of persisting and populating the increasingly drier future Amazonian (Malhi et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) will likely originate from southern populations.
