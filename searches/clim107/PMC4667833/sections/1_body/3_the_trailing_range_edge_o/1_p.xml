<p class="p">In the lowland tropics, temperature gradients are shallower than at higher latitudes (Wright et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). This means that across expansive lowland tropical forests, such as the Amazon, temperature remains relatively constant over very large geographic areas. In contrast, precipitation patterns can change markedly over much shorter distances and are believed to be a large driver of diversity and composition patterns throughout the lowland tropics (Engelbrecht et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In lowland Amazonia, there is a distinct moisture gradient, with the south and southeastern Amazon being drier than areas to the west and north along the base of the Andes (Malhi and Wright 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). In addition to being drier, the southern Amazon experiences large seasonal fluctuations in rainfall with a distinct and extended dry season (Malhi and Wright 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Over the last several decades, dry season length has increased in much of the southern Amazon, further intensifying moisture seasonality in this region leading to declines in forest vegetation (Hilker et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Moreover, seasonality is expected to increase across the Amazon, with dry seasons becoming more pronounced and extreme drought events occurring more regularly, even in areas that are not currently affected by water shortages (Malhi et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>).
