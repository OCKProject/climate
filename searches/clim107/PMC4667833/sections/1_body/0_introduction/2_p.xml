<p class="p">By their very nature, species range shifts take place at range edges, and therefore, range‐edge populations play a critical role during climate‐driven range shifts. At the leading range edge (i.e., the expanding or colonizing edge), populations can act as important stepping stones by serving as dispersal‐foci or by maintaining unique genetic adaptations that promote colonization of newly suitable areas (Gibson et al.

At the trailing range edge (i.e., the contracting or retreating edge), populations often exhibit high degrees of local adaptation and contain unique genotypes that may be necessary to species' persistence under future climates (Hampe and Petit
