<p class="p">Biome boundaries, or ecotones, are defined by the convergence of many species' range edges and therefore represent geographic areas where locally‐adapted range‐edge populations are concentrated. Historically, many ecotones, such as those separating forests and savannahs or tundra, are also subject to high levels of human disturbance (Payette et al.

 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). For example, the highest rates of deforestation in the Amazon occur along the so‐called arc of deforestation at the frontier between the lowland forest and savannah/cerrado biomes, which by definition corresponds to the southerly range edge of many rainforest species (Soares‐Filho et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Similarly, alpine treelines representing the upper range edge of many montane species have been subject to human disturbance for millennia (Körner 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Such geographically concentrated disturbances at ecotones may disproportionately remove range‐edge populations, impacting the overall ability of species' to persist during times of rapid climate change, and suggesting that these areas should be given greater prioritization as conservation targets.
