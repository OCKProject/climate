<p class="p">If extreme climate events become more common as is often predicted (Kodra et al.

 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), then range‐edge populations may have a fitness advantage (e.g., higher rates of survival) relative to the more central conspecific populations that are less tolerant of these events (Gutschick and BassiriRad 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). According to this hypothesis, locally‐adapted range‐edge populations at both the leading and trailing range edges are predicted to expand their distributions and become increasingly abundant throughout species' ranges in the future (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>B–D). However, some geographic areas where many species' range‐edges converge (e.g., ecotones) may also be disproportionally affected by anthropogenic habitat disturbances relative to core populations. Therefore, range‐edge populations and their unique genotypes could be lost, reducing the ability of a species to rapidly colonize new climatically suitable habitats.
