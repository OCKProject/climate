<p class="p">Many predictions of how the geographic ranges of species will shift as a result of climate change are based on models that incorporate only a single summary climate variable such as mean annual temperature or total annual precipitation (TAP; Zimmermann et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Under these predictions, a best‐case scenario is one in which species do not suffer from any sort of dispersal limitation and local populations track changing climates perfectly through time and space (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>A). However, such a scenario is clearly over‐simplified and unrealistic, as supported by the observation that the distributional shifts of many species' lag well behind concurrent climate shifts (Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). One explanation for the observed lag in species' distributional shifts is that many species do not respond to just one measure of climate, but rather to multiple facets of climate including climatic extremes and variability (Zimmermann et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Furthermore, within species, local populations may respond differently to changes in climate depending on the degree of local adaptation and the characteristics of the local environment. Understanding how species and local populations respond to various aspects of climate change (e.g., changes in means vs. variation of climate variables) will greatly improve our ability to predict species' persistence under climate change.
