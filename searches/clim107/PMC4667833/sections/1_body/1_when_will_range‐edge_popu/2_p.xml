<p class="p">At the individual species level, when equilibrium climatic conditions are experienced, climate is commonly most suitable toward the center of the species' range and less suitable, or harsher, toward the range edges (Brown 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984</xref>). Range‐edge populations are often portrayed as being at their physiological limits because they are thought to be located at the edges of a species' climatic niche (MacArthur 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1972</xref>) even though harsh climate at one species' range edge may be considered benign by another species. From the species' perspective, range‐edge climates are considered harsher than climate at the species' core as a result of an increased frequency and severity of extreme climate events, such as droughts, heat waves, or freezing episodes (Hoffman and Parsons 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>; Gaston 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). These extreme climate events can play a strong role in determining the demographics and fitness of individuals and local populations (Gutschick and BassiriRad 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Jentsch et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Lynch et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). There is also strong evidence that populations distributed across climatic gradients commonly show high levels of local adaptation, especially in tree species (Savolainen et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Aitken et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Leimu and Fischer 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Hereford 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Alberto et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Localized range‐edge populations are therefore likely to maintain specialized genotypes that are particularly well‐adapted to the harsh or extreme climates that they experience.
