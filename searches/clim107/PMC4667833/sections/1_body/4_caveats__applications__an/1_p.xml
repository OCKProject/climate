<p class="p">During future climate change, extreme climatic events will become more frequent and severe across large geographic areas, significantly affecting the ability of many species to persist into the future (Zimmermann et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Reyer et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In addition, asynchronous rates of change in different climate variables will result in novel climates being introduced throughout the globe (Williams et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31645-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Using relatively simple conceptual models and empirical analyses, we highlight how locally‐adapted populations occurring at tree species range edges are perhaps the best suited to survive extreme climate events and persist under future novel climates. We also discuss and show how large‐scale habitat disturbances are removing unique range‐edge populations, predominantly at ecotones, potentially hindering species' abilities to respond to climate change.
