<p class="p">We calculated wheat yield with the M-GAEZ crop model
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. In this model, yield for each grid is determined not only by biophysical conditions including climate (1° × 1°) but also by management conditions including water management (rain-fed or irrigated) and input level, which is a collective indicator incorporating factors that affect yield (e.g., fertilization level, technological development level)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. The input climatic variables are monthly mean temperature (°C), precipitation (mm/day), solar radiation (W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), wind speed (m/s), and diurnal temperature range (°C). The spatial resolution of final output yield is 2.5′ × 2.5′. To develop adaptation pathways, we aggregated grid-based yield into country-based yield.
