<p class="p">For MIROC-ESM, we used two extremely different radiative forcing scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): the RCP8.5 scenario
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref> and the RCP2.6 scenario
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. The RCP8.5 scenario corresponds to the highest greenhouse gas emissions scenario, leading to the greatest increase in global mean temperature, whereas the RCP2.6 scenario corresponds to a mitigation scenario aiming to limit the increase in global mean temperature in the 21st century to 2 °C from the pre-industrial level. We used the RCP8.5 scenario throughout the analyses, and then used the RCP2.6 scenario for comparison. For the other models and ensemble runs, we used the RCP8.5 scenario.
