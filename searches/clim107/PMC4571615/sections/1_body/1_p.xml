<p class="p">Recent studies have analyzed climate-change impacts and the benefits of adaptation on crop yields
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. However, many of them assessed the situation while assuming that the adaptations are fully implemented or not implemented at all, especially at the global scale, and that adaptation is completed immediately. Few studies have assessed the course of adaptation along with the progress of climate change in each of the current major food-producing countries. Information on the course of adaptation, which shows the timing and intensity of future adaptations, will be useful for adaptation planning. At least during the planning phase, adaptation steps should be regarded as irreversible so as not to spend funds in vain; and future adaptations must be forecast because substantial time is required from planning to the introduction and dissemination of an adaptation
