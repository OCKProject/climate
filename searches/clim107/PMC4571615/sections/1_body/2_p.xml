<p class="p">An effective way to examine the timing and intensity of adaptations is to describe the temporal sequences of the adaptations. The concept of describing a sequence of adaptation options over time, termed “adaptation pathways,” was recently proposed
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref> and applied to assessing regional adaptation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. In the previous studies, the adaptation pathways showed potential sequences of actions under climate change and social changes in order to explore robust adaptive plans. Here, however, we focus on describing adaptation pathways by sequential implementation of the minimum necessary adaptation. The resulting pathways reveal the timing and intensity of adaptations required to meet the challenges of climate change.
