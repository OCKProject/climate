<p class="p">If no forecast is conducted (i.e., adaptation to be implemented in the next decade is determined by the yield change in the current decade) and the amount of adaptation implemented is limited to one level per decade each for irrigation and crop variety, the adaptation pathways without prioritization result in the red dashed lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">2</xref> (referred to as “Non-forecast” in the figures), under the MIROC-ESM projection. In India, Germany, and Pakistan, in which a large amount of adaptation (multiple increments of levels) is required over a short period in the timely case, a substantial yield decrease occurs in the non-forecast case; the negative impact of not forecasting is remarkable. However, the decreases in yield could be moderated if forecasts of 10 yr ahead were conducted (see Methods), even if the amount of adaptation implemented is limited (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>; 10-yr-forecast case). If a forecast to 20 yr ahead is available, further yield decreases may be moderated. In India, forecasting to 20 yr ahead could achieve a yield comparable to that in the timely case without implementing a high level of adaptation in a short period (
