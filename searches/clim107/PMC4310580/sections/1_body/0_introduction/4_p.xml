<p class="p">Although the form of the interactions between biological invasions and these other environmental change drivers has yet to be fully generalized (Darling and Côté 
 <xref rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Bradley et al. 
 <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Treasure and Chown 
 <xref rid="b295" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), the current view is that interactions are likely most often to be synergistic (Brook et al. 
 <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Walther et al. 
 <xref rid="b308" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Moreover, the simultaneous effects of environmental change drivers on indigenous species, and human responses to counter at least some of the effects of environmental change, such as through managed relocation (Schwartz et al. 
 <xref rid="b260" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), are likely to make management decisions about biological invasions much more difficult than in the past (Webber and Scott 
 <xref rid="b312" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>).
