<p class="p">Over the short term, heterosis (improved performance of hybrid offspring) could be important for overcoming demographic stochasticity associated with initial establishment (Drake 
 <xref rid="b90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Keller and Taylor 
 <xref rid="b156" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Rius and Darling 
 <xref rid="b245" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Although heterosis is transitory in most cases (Hochholdinger and Hoecker 
 <xref rid="b138" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>), fixed heterozygosity can be maintained across generations in allopolyploids (assuming disomic inheritance occurs) and asexually reproducing species (Ellstrand and Schierenbeck 
 <xref rid="b97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Rieseberg etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="b243" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). In addition, if dominance is the primary cause of heterosis, the advantage of hybridization may continue in later generations and facilitate the purging of genetic load (Burke and Arnold 
 <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). Alternative mildly deleterious alleles can become fixed within diverging populations due to the effects of genetic drift. Hybridization between these lineages could produce descendants with an intrinsic fitness advantage over their parents that is maintained if the combined effects of recombination and natural selection erode the frequency of these deleterious alleles (Ellstrand and Schierenbeck 
 <xref rid="b97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Burke and Arnold 
 <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>).
