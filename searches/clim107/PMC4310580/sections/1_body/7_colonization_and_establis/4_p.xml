<p class="p">Hybridization is expected to be important from the perspective of invasiveness under climate change for two reasons. First, evidence is growing that climate change is increasing rates of hybridization, as species that were previously geographically isolated come into contact with each other (Garroway et al. 
 <xref rid="b114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Muhlfeld et al. 
 <xref rid="b203" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Second, evidence from genomic studies is revealing that genes associated with climate change adaptation can be of hybrid origin (Becker et al. 
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; De La Torre et al. 
 <xref rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Thus, when hybrids are formed, they may contribute to rapid adaptation under climate change. Although most information on hybridization comes from plants, hybridization is also likely to play an important role in the adaptation of animal lineages to climate change. Genomic comparisons have indicated introgression of invasive genes across lineage boundaries affected by climate in birds (Taylor et al. 
 <xref rid="b287" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) and stick insects (Nosil et al. 
 <xref rid="b208" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Introgressed genotypes can be favoured under changing climatic conditions as evident in hybridization events in swallowtail butterflies (Scriber 
 <xref rid="b262" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) and in 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (Besansky et al. 
 <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Genome scans across multiple related species along climate gradients are likely to provide many other examples of candidate genomic regions associated with climate adaptation and exchanged through hybridization and introgression.
