<p class="p">Genomic studies on populations can be used to test ecological hypotheses about dispersal patterns in invasive species once these have become established in a new area and started to spread, including the widely documented lag phase before populations disperse widely (Richardson et al. 
 <xref rid="b241" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). For instance, Rohfritsch et al. (
 <xref rid="b248" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) used genomic data to map the spread of an invasive oyster across Europe following its introduction from Asia. This approach is particularly powerful when combined with ecological models that predict the extent to which populations are expected to occupy new space across time or maintain refugia under a changing climate, both of which should be reflected in patterns of genetic variation (Fordham et al. 
 <xref rid="b106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, genomic approaches have been used to understand patterns of spread in Australian 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia</italic> species that have subsequently invaded southern Africa. These include estimating the impacts of human-assisted dispersal in the native range prior to introduction (Le Roux et al. 
 <xref rid="b169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) and better forecasting of the effects of climate change by accounting for genotypic variation (see Millar et al. 
 <xref rid="b195" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Thompson et al. 
 <xref rid="b291" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>).
