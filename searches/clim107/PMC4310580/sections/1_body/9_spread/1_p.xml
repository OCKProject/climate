<p class="p">Understanding the spread/expansion phase of an invasion has similarities with species range projections in climate change biology (Caplat etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). To expand its range into new environments, a species requires appropriate dispersal traits and tolerance of a range of environments or capacity to experience the new environment as consistently receptive. Dispersal traits are a key characteristic of invasive species, and dispersal occurs through direct movement (in the case of animals) or indirect movement, by seed or vegetative dispersal (in the case of plants), dispersal through soil or water (e.g. the plant pathogen
