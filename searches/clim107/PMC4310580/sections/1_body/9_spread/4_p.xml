<p class="p">Mechanisms of dispersal can evolve, as in the case of leg length in the cane toad (Phillips et al. 
 <xref rid="b218" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), and seed dispersal in 
 <italic class="italic">Abronia umbellata</italic> (Darling et al. 
 <xref rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008b</xref>). In these cases, genomic studies on quantitative traits can provide information on the genes and pathways involved. Dispersal evolution may involve traits directly involved in movement, such as cane toad leg length, or more subtle changes that nevertheless enhance dispersal potential, such as altered timing of reproduction that increases seed dispersal. Genomic data can identify the nature of these evolved changes in mechanisms that alter the potential of populations to spread. For instance, QTLs have been isolated that control the formation of rhizomes in perennial wild rye that represents an important trait facilitating colonization in weedy ryegrass species (Yun et al. 
 <xref rid="b329" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Understanding the genomic basis of traits involved in non-human-mediated dispersal may aid in predicting the invasive potential of suspect species before introduction or at the establishment stage (Pérez et al. 
 <xref rid="b215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), as well as projecting their future spread in cases where dispersal traits can evolve.
