<p class="p">Population genomic data can also be used to understand the impact of spreading invaders through hybridization and introgression. As discussed above, invaders spreading into non-native habitat, particularly under climate change, are expected to hybridize with local species where reproductive isolation is incomplete. This can lead to the incursion of genes from the invaders into native species. As a consequence, local species can become genetically ‘polluted’, resulting in the loss of species integrity. Genomic markers provide a way of detecting such pollution (e.g. Yamazaki et al.
