<p class="p">An increasing number of studies have documented evolutionary changes in invasive populations, typically over ecological timescales (Lee

 <xref rid="b225" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Whitney and Gabler 
 <xref rid="b316" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). These studies have shown that evolutionary adaptation can be rapid in a broad range of invasive organisms. Examples include copepods adapting to different salinity levels (Lee and Petersen

 <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>), and invasive weeds adapting through mimicry to evade eradication (Barrett 
 <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1983</xref>). Moreover, several of the documented examples of rapid evolutionary adaptation involve responses to climate change over a few decades. These include the evolution of

 <xref rid="b143" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>), the evolution of rabbits along a heat gradient following invasion into Australia (Williams and Moore 
 <xref rid="b318" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1989</xref>), and changes in flowering time in
