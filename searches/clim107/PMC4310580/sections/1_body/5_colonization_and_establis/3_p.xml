<p class="p">Genomic approaches provide a means to help resolve the apparent paradox. For example, success with limited genetic diversity may be due to the expression of phenotypic plasticity, aided by epigenetic responses to the environment (Richards et al. 
 <xref rid="b236" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) that can be identified with genomic approaches. Epigenetic mechanisms may be particularly important in these situations because they generate heritable changes in response to environmental cues, although their ecological significance remains unclear (Bossdorf et al. 
 <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Alternatively, functional traits may remain variable even when genetic variation is low, as the loss of rare alleles will not greatly affect the quantitative trait distribution, and nonadditive genetic variance may either aid in fitness directly, or be converted to additive variance due to allele frequency shifts (Dlugosch and Parker 
 <xref rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Dawson et al. 
 <xref rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Le Roux et al. 
 <xref rid="b169" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Genomic tools provide a way of identifying variation in functional traits (see next section). They also provide new means to understand the nature of introductions of invasive species. As mentioned in the previous section, genomic markers provide a much higher level of resolution when identifying source populations, and they can therefore clearly indicate the number of introductions from different environmental regions involved in invasions.
