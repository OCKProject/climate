<p class="p">The role of genetic variation in successful invasions has proven contentious though, with authors often taking opposing views depending on the nature of the system that they study (Rius and Darling 
 <xref rid="b245" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Indeed, many species have spread successfully with low genetic diversity (Myburgh et al. 
 <xref rid="b204" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Darling et al. 
 <xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008a</xref>; Richards et al. 
 <xref rid="b236" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The success of invaders with low genetic variability may depend on the nature of the environment into which they invade; weedy species moving into agricultural landscapes may require less genetic variability because they enter a relatively homogeneous landscape, whereas for species invading natural environments, a high level of variability may be required (Moran and Alexander 
 <xref rid="b201" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
