<p class="p">The genomic and transcriptomic basis of variation in phenotypic plasticity is still poorly understood. Several gene expression studies have now been undertaken across related species or populations exposed to different environmental conditions to assess whether these might provide clues about the mechanistic basis of variability in plastic responses (Smith et al. 
 <xref rid="b271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Dunning et al. 
 <xref rid="b92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Meier et al. 
 <xref rid="b194" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). A few of them have considered populations from native and invaded parts of their range to assess whether there are differences in plastic responses to the different environmental conditions encountered in invasive situations. For instance, in sticklebacks, the invasion of freshwater environments by marine populations has involved an increase in expression plasticity, including some genes that are thought to be involved in adaptation to these new habitats (Morris et al. 
 <xref rid="b202" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), while in 
 <italic class="italic">D. melanogaster</italic> populations from warm environments, there was an enrichment of down-regulated genes when flies were raised in conditions that were not commonly encountered in their native range (Levine et al.
