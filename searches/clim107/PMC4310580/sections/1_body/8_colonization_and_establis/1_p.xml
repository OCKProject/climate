<p class="p">Although the link between phenotypic plasticity and distribution has not been comprehensively supported (Dawson et al. 
 <xref rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), phenotypic plasticity clearly contributes to environmental tolerance in various ways (e.g. Ghalambor et al. 
 <xref rid="b120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Des Marais et al. 
 <xref rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Schilthuizen and Kellermann 
 <xref rid="b257" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Moreover, at least under conditions of resource abundance, it appears that invasive species do show greater plasticity than their indigenous counterparts (Davidson et al. 
 <xref rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), although the way in which such comparisons should be made has been the subject of much recent discussion (Van Kleunen et al. 
 <xref rid="b301" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Leffler et al. 
 <xref rid="b173" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
