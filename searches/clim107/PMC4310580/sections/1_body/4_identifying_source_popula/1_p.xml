<p class="p">Although genetic markers have been used for some time and are now used almost routinely for identifying source populations of species, genomic markers promise a much higher level of resolution and they are being increasingly applied. A recent example is provided by the dengue vector mosquito, 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>, whose source populations have traditionally been identified using mtDNA markers coupled with microsatellites (Endersby et al. 
 <xref rid="b99" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). These provide some indication of population sources and are currently used in countries such as Australia to locate source populations. However, a much higher level of resolution for identifying source populations can be obtained from SNP nuclear markers that can now be scored in the thousands; this was demonstrated in the extent to which geographic samples of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> could be completely resolved based on 18 000 SNP markers compared to 10–15 other markers (Rasic et al. 
 <xref rid="b233" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) (Fig.
