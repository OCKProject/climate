<p class="p">SNP markers are now being developed for other invasive species including invasive plants (De Kort et al. 
 <xref rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) and mammals (White et al. 
 <xref rid="b315" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) as well as insects. These markers promise to revolutionize risk assessment and quarantine control because they can reveal both contemporary and historical population processes. The potential of this approach in detecting and understanding past patterns based on whole-genome sequencing is evident from recent human studies on invasions and contractions of different cultural groups that provide new insights into patterns of relatedness and the spread of cultural practices (Sikora et al. 
 <xref rid="b265" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
