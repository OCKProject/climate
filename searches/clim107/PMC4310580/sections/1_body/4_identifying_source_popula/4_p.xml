<p class="p">In the future, genomic information will likely prove useful in identifying source risk and predicted outcomes of invasions when they are detected. For instance, in ragweed, it appears, based on microsatellite and chloroplast markers, that invasive populations have developed in the native range of this species associated with human habitation, and these populations are then likely to form the basis of invasive populations into other areas (Martin et al. 
 <xref rid="b185" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Predictions are that invasions will grow in number and be increasingly difficult to distinguish from range shifts (Walther et al. 
 <xref rid="b308" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Genomic techniques that can facilitate rapid identification of source populations will prove especially useful for addressing this problem (for an application in identifying the basis of range expansion, see Krehenwinkel and Tautz 
 <xref rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).
