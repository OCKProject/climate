<p class="p">At their most straightforward, DNA barcoding approaches can identify alien species at a given location (Darling and Blum 
 <xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). They are now proving useful for a range of taxa. Mostly, the aim has been to characterize the diversity of an assemblage and identify alien species among its members in a given recipient area, or to verify whether given populations are from species thought to be nonindigenous (e.g. Scheffer et al. 
 <xref rid="b255" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Smith and Fisher 
 <xref rid="b268" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Porco et al. 
 <xref rid="b221" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Fernández-Álvarez and Machordom 
 <xref rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="b330" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013a</xref>). Such approaches nonetheless are subject to the same kinds of problems as those facing DNA barcoding generally (see review by Taylor and Harris 
 <xref rid="b286" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). These include substantial error rates in some taxonomic groups (e.g. Hickerson et al. 
 <xref rid="b136" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Meier et al. 
 <xref rid="b193" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="b331" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013b</xref>) and lack of clarity about the questions being posed or rigorous independent assessment of the hypotheses being tested (Collins and Cruickshank 
 <xref rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).
