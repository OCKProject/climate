<p class="p">As DNA barcoding approaches were developed, it has now become possible to screen simultaneously samples of many species. Such metabarcoding provides relatively reliable estimates of community composition and turnover (Yoccoz et al. 
 <xref rid="b326" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Yu et al. 
 <xref rid="b328" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Ji et al. 
 <xref rid="b150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The approach has also been broadened to include what may be termed environmental metabarcoding or eDNA metabarcoding (Taberlet et al. 
 <xref rid="b281" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012a</xref>; Bohmann et al. 
 <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Here, rather than the organisms being sequenced directly, DNA is typically extracted from soil or water (Collins et al. 
 <xref rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Porco et al. 
 <xref rid="b222" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Piaggio et al. 
 <xref rid="b219" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), but may also come from other sources such as the gut contents of flies (Calvignac-Spencer et al. 
 <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The terms metagenomics and ecogenomics have also been applied to this approach, although typically metagenomics involves analysis of functional characteristics and assembly of whole genomes for microbes (Taberlet et al. 
 <xref rid="b281" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012a</xref>). Considerable success has been had in detecting invasive alien species using this approach, with the method surpassing traditional survey approaches both in terms of sampling effort and sensitivity. Notable demonstrations thereof are for carp in waterways linking to the Laurentian Great Lakes (Jerde et al. 
 <xref rid="b149" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), the American bullfrog in France (Ficetola et al. 
 <xref rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Dejean et al. 
 <xref rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) and several other aquatic species (Bohmann et al. 
 <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Rees et al. 
 <xref rid="b234" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Much interest exists in the application of eDNA barcoding to surveillance of ballast water in ships, a substantial source of aquatic invasions, with novel tools being developed to enable rapid screening by nonspecialists (Mahon et al. 
 <xref rid="b182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>).
