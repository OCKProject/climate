<p class="p">Throughout this review, we have demonstrated how genomics approaches can improve understanding, and in many cases forecasting, at each stage of invasion (Fig.
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref>). These include better understanding of source areas and the identity of introduced species. In this sense, genomic approaches are typically improvements on genetic tools that have been available for sometime; they allow source populations to be identified more accurately, provide a clearer picture regarding multiple interactions, including the role of hybridization, and lead to better estimates of population size, gene flow and other processes. NGS techniques can provide ways of detecting invasive organisms that have previously not been available, and identifications become more accurate as additional sequence information is added. Microsatellite and mtDNA markers have been widely used to understand the population dynamics of agricultural pests and disease vectors in the past and thereby assisting in programs aimed at controlling pests and/or limiting their impact. However, the new genomic tools provide an unprecedented view of past and present population processes (e.g. Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Rasic et al. 
 <xref rid="b233" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). With invasion frequency increasing under climate change, these are all important tools in improving an understanding of invasion processes.
