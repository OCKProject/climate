<p class="p">Where control of invasive species is being considered, genomic approaches can help in defining units for eradication and risks of reinvasion once eradication is achieved (Fig.

 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). With the use of genomics approaches, managers should become much more confident of likely movement patterns and reinvasion potential as local movement patterns can be tracked much more accurately than in the past.
