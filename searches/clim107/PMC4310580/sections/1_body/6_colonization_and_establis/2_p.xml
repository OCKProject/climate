<p class="p">While there is abundant evidence for changes in neutral markers following invasion, characterization of adaptive molecular differences, such as those established in stickleback populations, remains relatively scarce. Transcriptome comparisons of plants in common garden experiments suggest that invasive populations of ragweed show altered patterns of gene expression that are distinct from most populations from the native range, and genes showing altered patterns of expression appear to be linked to stress and biotic responses (Hodgins et al.

 <xref rid="b126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), but whether changes to expression during invasion primarily involve certain functional groups, as indicated by these studies, will require more examples across a broader array of organisms.
