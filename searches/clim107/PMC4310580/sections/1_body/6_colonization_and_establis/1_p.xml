<p class="p">Identifying risk factors associated with establishment would be assisted by more information on the genetic basis of adaptive changes in colonizing species. If these changes were known and repeatable, it might help predict when colonizations occur. One of the best examples is the evolutionary changes involved in the repeated independent colonization of freshwater environments by sticklebacks (summary in Bell and Aguirre 
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). These colonization events have been associated with repeatable changes in lateral plate morphology across populations involving the ectodysplasin (EDA) locus. Many loci in different genomic regions also appear to be involved, but nevertheless there appear to be changes across the same set of genomic regions in different, isolated freshwater populations of sticklebacks following invasion (Jones et al. 
 <xref rid="b152" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The stickleback situation may be unusual because there has been a repeated process of invasions that have been occurring over 10 million years (Bell and Aguirre 
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), but more cases need to be examined. Because invasive species often occupy similar habitats in the introduced range to those in the native range (see Guisan et al. 
 <xref rid="b127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref> for a recent overview and perspective), there is an opportunity to determine whether the same genomic regions contribute to adaptations in the native and introduced ranges across many invasive species.
