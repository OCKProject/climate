<p class="p">In future, methods can be employed that maximize the genomic information obtained from such limited material, rather than focusing on a few anonymous markers. Whole-genome resequencing has been used successfully for historic samples (Rowe et al. 
 <xref rid="b250" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), although contamination by nontarget DNA can make this expensive proposition even more cost-prohibitive. Sequence capture, which utilizes probes to enrich target sequences (e.g. Bi et al. 
 <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) (Box 
 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1" class="xref">1</xref>), offers a compromise between minimizing sequencing costs and maximizing sequence information from target regions of the study organism. Pooling individual samples together prior to either whole-genome (e.g. Futschik and Schlotterer 
 <xref rid="b112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) or reduced-representation (e.g. Vandepitte et al. 
 <xref rid="b303" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) sequencing is another approach that can greatly reduce costs, while still providing useful information about the genomic extent and location of variation and divergence. Genome-wide analysis of historic DNA in invasive species will provide exciting opportunities to assess the temporal dynamics of evolutionary change during colonization and spread, and over periods of rapid climate change. It can also provide evidence of past changes in population size across time through coalescence methods (do Amaral et al. 
 <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) and indicate parts of the genome that have been affected by selection and population processes (Excoffier et al. 
 <xref rid="b101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Such data will improve inference of invasion history and aid in the identification of the genetic basis of recent adaptation.
