<p class="p">Many genomic approaches can be applied to population genetic studies of nonmodel species that lack a reference genome assembly. The use of sequence tagging and ‘Pool-Seq’ technologies, together with relatively inexpensive RNA-Seq, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and other reduced-representation library methods, means that data on many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be collected at moderate cost on multiple samples from a population without a reference genome (Box 
 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1" class="xref">1</xref>) (e.g. Hohenlohe et al. 
 <xref rid="b141" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Elshire et al. 
 <xref rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Bi et al. 
 <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Neves et al. 
 <xref rid="b206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Yeaman et al. 
 <xref rid="b324" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, even draft reference genomes or genomes from related species can be useful when implementing these approaches to identify variants. The expansion of reference genomes across a wider array of species will facilitate the study of invasion genomics. Several impediments to genome construction still exist (Ellegren 
 <xref rid="b95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), although new technologies are emerging to overcome them and the cost of short-read sequencing is declining. Nonetheless, many plants and animals have large genomes, and the common occurrence of higher ploidy, especially in invasive plants, adds significant difficulty and expense. Higher ploidy also complicates other approaches such as SNP identification and analyses (see below).

  <p class="p">Whole-genome resequencing is cost-prohibitive and unnecessary in many cases. As an alternative, several methods of genome reduction make it possible for many individuals to be combined in one sequencing run while maintaining high coverage. This results in the reliable identification of SNPs and genotypes for each individual at a subset of regions throughout the genome.</p>
  <p class="p">Restriction-enzyme-based reduced-representation sequencing: Genomic DNA is digested with specific restriction enzymes, followed by ligation of adaptors, amplification and sequencing. Several methods employ this strategy, including genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS; Elshire et al. 
   <xref rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) and RAD-Seq (Hohenlohe et al. 
   <xref rid="b141" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided using methylation-sensitive enzymes (Elshire et al. 
   <xref rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). This approach is relatively inexpensive and easy to use in nonmodel organisms, but can suffer from biases such as those associated with the loss of restriction sites in some individuals (Gautier et al. 
   <xref rid="b119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).

  <p class="p">RNA-Seq: Sequencing mRNA from the genes that are expressed in the whole organism or specific sampled tissues at a particular point in time and development and under specific conditions (the ‘transcriptome’ of a whole organism or specific tissue; Wang et al. 
   <xref rid="b309" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). This method targets the expressed portion of the genome (protein-coding sequences and untranslated regions of genes). Gene expression and sequence information is simultaneously identified, as it is possible to compare counts of reads that map to genes and identify variants given sufficient expression of that gene in each individual.

  <p class="p">Targeted sequence capture by hybridization: This approach uses oligoprobes to enrich specific regions of the genome for subsequent next-generation sequencing. The scale of the capture can range from a handful to several thousand targeted loci, making it appropriate for wide range of projects. However, prior genomic knowledge is essential for the development of the probes (e.g. through RAD-Seq or RNA-Seq projects). The development of noncommercial protocols and PCR-based probes (Peñalba et al. 
   <xref rid="b214" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) is making this approach more attractive for smaller-scale sequencing projects in nonmodel species. Several alternative methods are available that enrich target regions prior to sequencing (for review, see Mamanova et al. 
   <xref rid="b183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>).
  </p>
  <p class="p">Gene-space sequencing: Many genomes are replete with repetitive regions along with genes present in high copy number (e.g. chloroplast genes), and whole-genome sequencing without reducing their quantity can be a substantial waste of sequencing space. Consequently, some approaches seek to deplete these regions rather than enrich specific portions of the genome (e.g. Matvienko et al. 
   <xref rid="b187" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>).
