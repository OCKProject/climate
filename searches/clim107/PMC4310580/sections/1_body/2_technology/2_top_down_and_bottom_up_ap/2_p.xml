<p class="p">‘Top-down’ methods offer a complementary approach for identifying the genetic basis of adaptation (Wright and Gaut

 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Here, the genetic basis of specific traits under selection during invasion can be dissected by looking for the cosegregation of these traits and genetic markers. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping uses pedigreed populations descended from known parents. Linkage disequilibrium between genetic markers and causal loci enables the identification of genomic regions segregating with the phenotypes of interest. This method limits the identification of loci to those present in the initial cross, and the genomic resolution is low due to high linkage disequilibrium in the mapping population. Association mapping studies use unpedigreed mapping to look for associations between traits and markers, either using a candidate gene approach or genome-wide markers (GWAS studies) (Box

 <xref rid="b294" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). The approaches offer greater resolution than QTL studies due to the lower linkage disequilibrium found in natural populations relative to pedigreed mapping populations.
