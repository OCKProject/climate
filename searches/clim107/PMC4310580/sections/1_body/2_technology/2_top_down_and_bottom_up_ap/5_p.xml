<p class="p">The identification of candidate ‘invasion’ genes using these top-down and bottom-up approaches is only the first step. Comparisons across species will be essential for determining whether there are similar functional groups, genes or genetic pathways that frequently evolve during invasion and in responses to changing environments further precipitated by local climate change. This might be expected, for example, if invading species commonly evolve along similar fitness trade-offs in response to changes in the biotic and abiotic environment in the introduced range (Blossey and Notzold 
 <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>; Bossdorf et al. 
 <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; He et al. 
 <xref rid="b133" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). The context dependence and sometimes idiosyncratic nature of invasion and adaptation may, however, make such generalities unlikely (though see also Richardson and Pyšek 
 <xref rid="b238" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b239" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Experimental studies, where possible, will be important to assess fitness effects of these candidate loci in nature, while controlling for genetic background (Barrett and Hoekstra 
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). The development of more model invasive species amenable to reverse genetics will be key for dissecting the functional role of candidate loci and will be a step forward for invasion genomics (Stewart et al.
