<p class="p">There has been a general trend toward earlier flight periods in Swedish butterflies the last 20Â years, and 
 <italic class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</italic> is among the species that has advanced its adult emergence most. Moreover, most Swedish butterfly species follow the typical pattern of later flight dates in more northern populations but this cline is steeper in 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic>. This type of correspondence appears to be a general trend as the rate of phenological change over time shows a significant correlation with the degree of change in flight date with latitude. This was true for both the full dataset with all Swedish butterflies as well as for the subgroup of univoltine, pupal diapausers, to which 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic> belongs. The results also show the quite intuitive pattern that butterfly species that are bivoltine start reproduction earlier in the year compared to univoltine species. This is most likely because selection in bivoltine species favors individuals that can use a longer period of the favorable season to produce two rather than one generation. In this respect, the early spring flight period of 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic> is clearly atypical for an univoltine butterfly in Sweden, occurring on average more than a month earlier than the other species (May 31 as compared to July 5). The early emergence of 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic> is very probably a direct consequence of that newly hatch larvae feeds on flowers and developing fruits of early flowering Brassicaceae plants.
