<p class="p">Our results also show that within species, the phenological state and size of the hosts at the time of butterfly reproduction are important for oviposition. For most of the plant species, we found that later-flowering individuals attracted more eggs, although in one of the main hosts, 
 <italic class="italic">C. paludosa</italic>, early flowering plants were significantly more used for oviposition. These results are important in two respects. First, they provide further evidence that phenological stage is important for butterfly host plant selection and that not only among-species choice but also choices within species are influenced by the phenological stage of the host plant. Moreover, several within-species patterns varied among regions suggesting that the exact temporal overlap between butterfly oviposition and host plant flowering had a strong effect on the realized host use across the climatic gradient described by the latitudinal range and that this overlap differed among regions. This suggests that the effect of climatic variation on host plant phenology, both in space and over time, will be of major importance for the realized host use of

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2014</xref>), the documented patterns of butterfly preferences translate to butterfly-mediated selection on plant flowering phenology. Given that butterfly attacks are relatively frequent in host plant populations, our documented patterns suggest that butterfly-mediated selection on plant flowering phenology may differ not only among different host plant species but also among regions within species.
