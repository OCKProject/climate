<p class="p">In the field survey examining host plant use of 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic> in three regions along a latitudinal gradient, we documented significant differences among regions in which of the host species that were used for oviposition. Given that the butterfly has strong preferences for plants in a given phenological stage (Arvanitis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2008</xref>; this study), it is likely that effects of climate on the temporal overlap between the butterfly and each of the host plant species were important for these among-region differences. Such differences in temporal overlap between the butterfly and the different host plant species in response to latitudinal variation in temperature are to be expected if the thermal reaction norms differ between host plants and between the butterfly and its preferred host plants. It might seem reasonable to assume that phenological specialists, such as 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic>, are particularly sensitive to changes in climate. However, while the butterfly is expected to be under strong selection to match its phenology with the temporal distribution of Brassicaceae flowers in the spring, it is simultaneously strongly selected to be able to use multiple hosts given that the temporal overlap with one given species varies among years (Wiklund and Friberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2009</xref>). As a result, the specialized feeding on the young fruits and seeds of its hosts is combined with the ability to utilize a quite wide host range of Brassicaceae species. Such a notion, that the species can be characterized as a phenological specialist but a host species generalist, is strongly supported not only by our data on latitudinal variation in host use but also by data on between-year variation in host use at a given site. During a 5-year study of the species at one locality in Sweden (the central location in this study), the species oviposited on 16 of the 18 available Brassicaceae species (Wiklund and Friberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2009</xref>). A tentative conclusion is therefore that an assumed sensitivity of herbivores specializing in particular phenological stages of their host plants to climatic variation might sometimes be buffered by an ability to switch host plant species. If such host plant switching does not occur, we should expect very strong selection on consumer reaction norms to match the reaction norms of their resources.
