<p class="p">Given that butterflies are strongly selected to maximize synchrony with their host plants and that host plants to some extent differ from each other and from butterflies in their response to increased temperatures, we expect butterfly responses to be related to the specific set of host plants that they depend on. For example, Diamond et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2011</xref>) showed that butterfly species with a small diet breadth, i.e., with only a few species of larval host plants, have higher advancement rates compared to species with a large repertoire of host plants. It can also be expected that butterfly species that feed exclusively on specific developmental stages of their hosts, e.g., flowers, young fruits, or young leaves, shift their phenology more strongly in response to warming than species that are not restricted to specific developmental stages.
