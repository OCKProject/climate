<p class="p">Butterflies critically depend on plants as larval hosts and for nectar, and it is likely that optimal butterfly phenology in many cases strongly depends on the phenology of their host plants. Butterflies and host plants may respond differently to a warming climate, either because they use partly different cues or because their sensitivity to given cues differ (e.g., Menzel and Fabian

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2001</xref>; Parmesan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2007</xref>). Moreover, the direct effects of increased availability of CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">1985</xref>), which may result in climate-dependent variation in relative abundances of different host species during the period of reproduction and growth of the butterflies (Schweiger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2008</xref>). Such differences in reaction norms should lead to changes in species interactions with changes in climate.
