<p class="p">At the individual level, we used GLMs with binomial error structure and logit link function to study the effects of host region, size, and phenology on egg presence (0 or 1). The two predictor variables, size and phenology, were the principal components PC1 and PC2, respectively, extracted from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the traits plant size, inflorescence size, and phenological state. We used PC1 and PC2 instead of the traits because original trait values were correlated (Pearson, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &gt; 0.25, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> ≤ 0.05). PC1 and PC2 explained 48.4 and 32.7% of the variance, respectively (accumulated explained variance = 81.1%). PC1 was positively correlated with the plant size and total number of flowers, whereas PC2 was correlated with the phenological state. PCA loadings for the three host plant traits are shown in Table 10.1007/s13280-014-0602-7 (Electronic Supplementary Material). As preliminary analyses detected significant interactions between region and traits for some species, we evaluated effects of trait variables in separate models for each region.
