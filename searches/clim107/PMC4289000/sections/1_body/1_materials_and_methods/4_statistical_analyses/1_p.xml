<p class="p">At the plot level, we used a generalized linear model (GLM) with Gaussian error structure and identity link function to study the effects of region and host species identity on the mean number of eggs per plant. Intra-specific host plant density was included in the model as a covariate. The mean number of eggs per plant was log-transformed, and its variation among regions and host species was examined with analysis of deviance. We also examined models including the summed density of all other potential host plant species in the plots. However, inter-specific host plant density had no significant (
