<p class="p">The mean number of eggs per plant (number of eggs/number of plants in each plot) varied among host species (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). However, host use differed among the three regions (significant interaction region × species in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). In the south region, the most used species for oviposition was 
 <italic class="italic">C. paludosa</italic>, in the central region it was 
 <italic class="italic">C. pratensis</italic>, and in the north region, 
 <italic class="italic">A. glabra</italic> was the most attacked species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). From the butterfly’s perspective, there was a difference between regions concerning which host plant was most used for oviposition (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
