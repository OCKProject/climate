<p class="p">Since 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic> is a univoltine species throughout its geographic range, it is of interest to restrict the comparison to species sharing this characteristic. Among the 66 species investigated by Karlsson (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2013</xref>), univoltine species generally have significantly later flight dates compared to bivoltine species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) (and also compared to adult overwintering species where adults appear two times per season but with generally only one cohort of larvae developing each year) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</italic> has a relatively early flight also when compared only to other univoltine butterfly species; only 2 out of 46 investigated Swedish univoltine species fly at earlier dates than 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic>. To summarize, our focal species appears early in the season and much earlier at southern than at northern latitudes, and has advanced its flight dates in response to climate warming more strongly than most other butterfly species in the same area.
