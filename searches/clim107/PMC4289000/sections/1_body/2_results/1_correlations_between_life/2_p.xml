<p class="p">Correlations between temporal and spatial trends were also evident in terms of a significant correlation between the yearly change in flight date and the dependence of flight date on latitude in the 66 species of butterflies investigated (

 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic>, this relationship still holds true (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This suggests that spatial and temporal variations are partly caused by the same factors and that investigations of latitudinal trends should be useful to predict expected future temporal trends in butterfly species.
