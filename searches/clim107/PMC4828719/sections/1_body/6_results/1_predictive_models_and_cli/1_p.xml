<p class="p">AFLA-maize, a mechanistic model, was applied to predict 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic> growth and aflatoxin production in maize, using weather data as input
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>. AFLA-maize was also linked to a crop phenology prediction module, based on temperature sums, with a focus on the crucial stages of flowering and ripening, or date of harvest. Two climate change scenarios, +2 °C and +5 °C above pre-industrial levels, which take into account whether or not mitigation strategies for climate change are applied, in addition to the present (baseline) scenario, were considered.
