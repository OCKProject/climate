<p class="p">Considering variation between years, the lowest and the highest means of AFI computed for maize are, respectively, 0.5 and 0.9 for the present scenario, 0.83 and 1.49 for the +2 °C scenario, and 1.03 and 2.06 for the +5 °C scenario. Therefore, a decrease of around 20% and an increase of around 34% with respect to the means were determined in the least and most conducive year, respectively. The variation between years is comparable in the +2 °C scenario, with −22% and +38%, and in the +5 °C scenario (−28% and +43%).</p>
