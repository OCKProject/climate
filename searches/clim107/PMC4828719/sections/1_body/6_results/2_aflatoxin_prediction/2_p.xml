<p class="p">In the present scenario, for maize, mean AFI computed over all sites was 38, the percentage of sites with mean AFI &gt; 0 was 39%, but only in 20% of the sites mean AF contamination was predicted to be above the current legal limit in Europe (AFI &gt; 95). In the +2 °C and the +5 °C scenarios, mean AFI (over all sites) was 73 and 95, respectively. Mean AFI increased by 92% and 149% when moving from the present scenario to the +2 °C and +5 °C scenarios, respectively, and 39% and 54% of the sites with AFI &gt; 95.</p>
