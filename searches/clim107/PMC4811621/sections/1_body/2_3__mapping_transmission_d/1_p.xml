 <sub class="sub">0</sub> for each pixel in a GIS. The datasets used covered the entire continent of Africa. Data on mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation for the baseline climate (i.e., average values for the period from 1950 to 2000) were downloaded from the WorldClim database as raster grids with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 km at the equator) [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. For the future climate, we used temperature and precipitation projections of the HadCM3 and CSIRO Mk3 general circulation models (GCM) based on the A2a emission scenario. Data for the future climate (average values for 2020–2039, hereafter 2040) were downloaded from the Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) database in raster format at the same spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds [

 <sub class="sub">0</sub> was calculated separately for the baseline climate and for each GCM model.
