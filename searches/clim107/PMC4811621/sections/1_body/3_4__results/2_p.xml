We observe distinct geographic patterns in the intensity of falciparum malaria. The transmission intensity is highest in the tropics as well as the coastal areas of East Africa. The subtropics exhibit low levels of transmission intensity. Our simulations fall within the observed spatial distribution of falciparum malaria on the continent described by Gething et al. [
