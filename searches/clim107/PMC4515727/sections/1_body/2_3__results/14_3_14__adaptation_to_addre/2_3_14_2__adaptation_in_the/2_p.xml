<p class="p">In Canada, agricultural adaptation over the past century has included the development of new agricultural practices and infrastructure to conserve and enhance water supplies and distribution and targeted institutional activities to improve water management [

 <xref rid="B275-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">275</xref>]. For example, less frequent tilling and reductions of other field management practices that lowered soil moisture and increased erosion aided in lowering the vulnerability of farmers to the 2001â€“2002 drought relative to the drought of the 1930s [

Governments have also increased regional resilience by producing drought plans and enacting legislation to support coordinated water management. In England, water resource management plans have been incorporated into climate change adaptation plans [
