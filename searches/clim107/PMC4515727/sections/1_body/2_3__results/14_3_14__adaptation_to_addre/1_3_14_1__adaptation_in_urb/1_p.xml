 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Mainstreaming can be assisted by integrating learnings about effective risk management options and adaptations from experiences with current climate variability, particularly extreme weather events. However, mainstreaming also requires consideration and use of information about risks expected from future climate change in adaptation planning. A range of measures to adapt to changes in water quality and quantity in the context of climate change, such as leak detection, outreach, adjustments to the building code and management policies have been reported in the province of Quebec [
