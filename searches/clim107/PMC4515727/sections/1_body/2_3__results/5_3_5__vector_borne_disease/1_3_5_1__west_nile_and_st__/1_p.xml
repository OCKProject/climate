<p class="p">Vector-borne diseases—particularly mosquito-borne ones—are frequently associated with increased precipitation [
 <xref rid="B111-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>] because standing water is needed for the development of immature stages of mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are important disease vectors in Canada as they can transmit West Nile virus (WNV). There were 110 total clinical cases of West Nile virus reported in Canada between January and the end of November, 2013, including three cases potentially related to travel outside the province where they were reported [
 <xref rid="B112-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>]. High precipitation in the prairie provinces in 2007 was thought responsible for an unprecedented abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Culex tarsalis</italic> mosquitoes that in turn led, later that year, to the largest ever outbreak of WNV in Canada (2,401 cases) [
 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>,

 <xref rid="B114-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. Studies on the mosquitoes 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Cx. restuans</italic>, which are the main WNV vectors in eastern Canada, also suggest that precipitation is positively associated with their abundance [
 <xref rid="B115-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. However, in some circumstances periods of drought have been directly associated with increased risk from mosquito-borne infections, such as WNV in southeastern, northeastern, central and western U.S., the Canadian prairies, as well as in Europe [

 <xref rid="B116-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>] which can lead to mosquito population increases [
 <xref rid="B115-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>] and changes in communities and densities of the bird species that are reservoir hosts of WNV, resulting in increased WNV prevalence in mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B123-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>,
 <xref rid="B124-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>]. Semi-permanent rather than permanent wetlands are thought to be particularly prone to the effects of drought given the fluctuations they experience in response to precipitation. Irrigation during times of drought may create new breeding sites for WNV mosquito vectors and thus shift the local geographic focus of risk from WNV [
 <xref rid="B125-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. In the matrix of mosquito breeding habitat found in urban and suburban environments, small numbers of locations can contribute to mosquito breeding and abundance and these are frequently man-made water courses, sewage overflow systems and holding pools, 
 <italic class="italic">etc .</italic> [
 <xref rid="B126-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>], which are likely to continue to hold water during drought events. Associations of WNV incidence with droughts or low precipitation (e.g., in Virginia, U.S. [
 <xref rid="B127-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">127</xref>]) may be due to reduced flushing of mosquito larvae and eggs from breeding sites in urban areas during rainfall; this flushing reduces mosquito abundance [
