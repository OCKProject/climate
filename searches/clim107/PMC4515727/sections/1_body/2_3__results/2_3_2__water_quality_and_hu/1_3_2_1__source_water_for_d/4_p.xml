<p class="p">Climate change-related impacts on water, including drought, are recognized as leading to greater risks from water-borne diseases such as hepatitis A [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. However, there appears to be limited discussion of the relationship between drought and water-borne pathogens and the interactions between climate change and water-borne diseases are complex. In the U.S., the survival and multiplication of bacteria leading to leptospirosis outbreaks may have been altered by temperature and pH changes resulting from the stagnation associated with drought [
 <xref rid="B75-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Similarly, although 
 <italic class="italic">Naegleria fowleri</italic> is rare, increased water temperature during drought can allow for the amoeba to grow in greater concentrations [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Drought conditions may concentrate pathogens while at the same time inactivate them (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Cryptosporidium</italic> oocysts) [
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. In Canada, it is important to note that the greatest burden from enteric, food and water-borne diseases, drawing on 2012 data, is associated with 
 <italic class="italic">campylobacteriosis</italic> (10,174 cases), followed by salmonellosis (6828 cases) and giardiasis (3862 cases). Other reportable diseases in this category have a far smaller number of cases, such as shigellosis with 1,068 reported cases and approximately 500 cases each of 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> and cryptosporidiosis in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>].In addition, while at its peak in 1970, there were 12,283 cases of hepatitis A reported in Canada; this has since fallen to approximately 200â€“300 cases per year [
 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Future changes to the frequency and/or severity of drought could modify the burden associated with these diseases in Canada.
