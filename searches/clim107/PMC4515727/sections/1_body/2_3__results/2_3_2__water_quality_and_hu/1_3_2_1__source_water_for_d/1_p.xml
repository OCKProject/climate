 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. The pattern of reduced water levels, stream flow and resultant stagnation during drought can increase contaminant concentrations in ground and surface waters [

For example, measurements taken during a drought in 2003 over the Rhine and Meuse rivers in Europe showed not only a substantial reduction in river discharge relative to the year before, but also that chloride concentrations were inversely related to the flow (m

 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. This effect is thought to increase when contaminants continue to be added to the system [
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Lower water levels can also facilitate an increase in reactions between the water, contaminants and sediments [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. This can be further reinforced by greater soil erosion during drought [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In the U.S., elevated nitrate, orthophosphates, chlorides and sulfates in groundwater have also been associated with drought, in some cases exceeding the U.S. EPAâ€™s Maximum Contaminant Level [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Frequent detection in wells near agriculture and septic systems suggested these systems were at risk of contamination [

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] found that variation in total organic carbon and nitrate was associated with changes to river flow in France, with a high ratio of total organic carbon to nitrate concentrations under conditions of very low river flow. A UK study found that drought can lead to greater contamination of drinking water source water from dissolved organic carbons and can increase difficulty in contaminant removal [
