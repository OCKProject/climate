<p class="p">During drought, there can be a drop in pressure at water treatment plants [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], which can increase turbidity leading to a greater potential risk of water contamination and consequently a greater need for water treatment [
 <xref rid="B84-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="B85-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. The impact of drought on contaminant levels in source water has been discussed above. In the event that well water becomes unavailable during drought, turning to alternative water sources can also increase risks to health if appropriate safeguards for those treatment measures are not in place [
 <xref rid="B86-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Inadequate water treatment is important as pathogens, including bacteria and viruses, are known to be taken up by particles in water [
 <xref rid="B87-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Costs also increase with the additional treatment required to address higher levels of turbidity [
 <xref rid="B88-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B89-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. Changes to water flow and levels associated with climate change could further contribute to stress on water treatment systems and increase the cost of treatment [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In northern Ontario, some First Nations communities may already be near the limit of their capacity in this regard [
