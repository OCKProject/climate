<p class="p">In the Canadian context, data from 2005 show that over 90% of the water withdrawn in the country was to support economic activity [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The impact of drought on economic activities overall, in particular through reductions in power generation capacity, could be considerable. For example, between 1999 (winter) and 2004 (fall), seasonal decreases in precipitation of up to 60% compared to normal conditions were observed in the Canadian cities of Calgary, Edmonton and Saskatoon [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Hydroelectricity generation accounts for 62% of electricity generation in Canada [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] (A large amount of hydroelectricity is generated in Canada and when in-stream use is taken into account, this industry accounts for the largest amount of water use in Canada [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The volume of water used for hydroelectricity generation was over 70 times the total of all other combined water use in Canada in 2005 [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Thermal (nuclear and fossil fuel) power generation and manufacturing are responsible for the largest and second largest total withdrawals of freshwater in Canada [

 <xref rid="B334-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">334</xref>]). Shortfalls in this area could further amplify costs and stresses associated with drought, for example through the lack of revenue or the need to purchase alternative energy (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot12dot2-ijerph-12-08359" class="xref">section 3.12.2</xref> for additional discussion of the health impacts of these shortfalls). During the 2001 drought, hydroelectric power generation in Saskatchewan fell to 66% of the past four year average in the province resulting in power being purchased from other jurisdictions to meet electricity needs [
 <xref rid="B174-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">174</xref>]. During the 1987â€“1992 drought in California (U.S.), hydroelectricity generation fell to under 60% of normal levels [
 <xref rid="B200-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>]. Additional energy was purchased from more expensive sources [
 <xref rid="B200-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>] and led to more than a $3 billion increase in electricity costs for consumers [

The climate change-related decrease in water levels anticipated across the Great Lakes is expected to result in direct economic impacts between 2014 and 2030 of $9.61 billion (2012 USD) due to impacts on recreation, shipping and harbours, hydroelectricity generation, waterfront property values and groundwater use [
