<p class="p">A recent 2013 systematic review of the effectiveness of public health interventions to reduce the health impacts of climate change highlighted a gap in the literature around adaptation to drought [

 <xref rid="B311-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">311</xref>] and public health promotion activities that touch on related impacts, such as spinal cord injury [
 <xref rid="B250-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">250</xref>,
 <xref rid="B251-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">251</xref>], none of the public health adaptations specific to drought identified in the international literature had been evaluated. Here, again, a lack of specificity around drought among other climate change-related extreme weather events limits the relevance of these discussions for public health planning.
