 <xref rid="B154-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">154</xref>] which can have significant health impacts. A study of a lake desiccated through persistent drought in Saskatchewan found a greater prevalence of coughing, wheezing and eye and nasal irritation among residents living near the lake than among those in a control group [
