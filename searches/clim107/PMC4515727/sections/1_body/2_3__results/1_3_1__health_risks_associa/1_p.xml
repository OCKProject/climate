<p class="p">Drought can affect human health through a broad range of pathways including those shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-08359-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. They are discussed in greater detail in the following sections. Generally speaking, these broadly fall into environmental services and socioeconomic areas. There is agreement that globally, drought leads to an increase in morbidity and mortality [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>,

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Although discussions have pointed to direct drought-related deaths in low-income countries [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], a broad range of public health impacts associated with drought has been identified in the U.S. [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Research also indicates that climate change may impact drought-related health outcomes in Canada [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In fact, some evidence of drought-related health impacts has been identified for Canadians living on the Prairies [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. For example, there is some evidence of respiratory impacts related to dust and increased risk of water-borne disease [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Furthermore, reviews of impacts from Ontario [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] and the U.S. [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] have identified climate change and future drought as having the potential to affect food-, vector- and water-borne diseases [
