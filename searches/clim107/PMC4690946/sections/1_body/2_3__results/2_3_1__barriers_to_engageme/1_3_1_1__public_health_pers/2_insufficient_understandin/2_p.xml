 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p class="p" xmlns="">
   <italic class="italic">“We do air quality projects… I’m very familiar with the concept of co-benefits but have never thought about it with regard to climate change.”</italic> And, 
   <italic class="italic">“It’s uncanny how connected our work is to climate change. It’s almost coincidental. But I wouldn’t necessarily link Safe Routes to School or physical activity to climate change.”</italic> Finally, 
   <italic class="italic">“WIC would be active in obesity, nutrition, social and environmental determinants of nutrition, but I don’t think of it as a climate change issue. The climate change issue is what happens when the food supply gets disrupted. That is emergency preparedness.”</italic>
