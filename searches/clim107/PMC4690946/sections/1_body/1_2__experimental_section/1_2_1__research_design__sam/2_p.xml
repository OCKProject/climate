<p class="p">We began with a purposive sample of “PH engaged” in climate change and “Non-PH” professionals we knew through practice or published literature who were working on climate change as a primary focus of their work. Examples of “PH engaged” participants’ activities include research on the public health impacts of climate change, participation in climate change policy-making and planning to provide a health lens, and explicit integration of climate change co-benefits in chronic disease prevention activities. Through snowball sampling, we identified “PH non-engaged” colleagues working on areas with a potential public health relationship to climate change (e.g., physical activity nutrition, asthma), and enlarged our sample for all categories. Individuals were invited to participate with a detailed email, follow-up emails and phone calls leading to a participation rate of 84%.</p>
