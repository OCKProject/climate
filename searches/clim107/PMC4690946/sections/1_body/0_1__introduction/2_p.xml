Climate change threatens to disrupt the life support systems on which humans depend (food, air, water, shelter, security), and therefore, in concert with other global environmental changes, threatens our survival. Climate change also disproportionately impacts poor and marginalized populations [

Climate change policies and strategies could have significant and immediate beneficial effects on public health and health equity, or “co-benefits”, through improving social determinants of health across many sectors [

These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, regional, and local levels, and are mostly responsible for health inequities [
