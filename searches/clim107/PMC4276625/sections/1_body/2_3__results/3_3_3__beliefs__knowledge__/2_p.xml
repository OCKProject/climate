Only a minority reported being “very” (6%) or “moderately” (18%) knowledgeable about the association between climate change and health impacts; conversely, many reported being only “modestly” (48%) or “not at all” knowledgeable (28%). Nearly half of respondents indicated that, outside of their role as a health professional, they had personally experienced climate change “a great deal” (10%), or a “moderate amount” (38%); others indicated “only a little” (40%), “not at all” (7%), or “don’t know” (7%.).</p>
