<p class="p">Except for the regions 4 and 9, the mean projected changes under RCP8.5 exceed the current interannual variability of the PV production series from 2050 onwards (we will call this detectability of the mean change hereafter; see Methods). Under RCP4.5, only the regions 1, 5 and 6 display detectable mean changes from 2050 onwards, and regions 2 and 3 at the very end of the century (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). However, in all cases the magnitude of the ensemble mean projected changes, even for those noted as robust in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>, is smaller than the ensemble spread, indicating a relatively high degree of uncertainty compared with the magnitude of the ensemble mean signals. Only for region 1, and especially under RCP8.5 towards the end of the century, the signal-to-noise ratio (S2N; see Methods) exceeds 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). In regions 2, 3, 5 and 6, with mean changes of about 5% and spreads of 10% by the end of the period, S2N falls down to as far as 0.5 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). It drops to even below 0.5 in regions 4, 7, 8 and 9 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), although this is neither surprising nor very relevant because mean changes in these regions are (1) close to zero, thus providing a close-to-zero value for the numerator of the S2N ratio, and (2) generally non-robust, that is, the spread mostly involves non-significant signals.
