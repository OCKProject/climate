<p class="p">Going a step further to evaluate changes in actual PV power generation, we now make assumptions on where the PV power capacity is/will be installed in Europe. For that, the CLIMIX model

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>; see Methods for more details). Under such a fixed scenario of high-PV penetration, a general and progressive decline of the generated PV power is found in all regions along the entire period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). This is most pronounced in the northernmost region 1, with ensemble mean projected changes up to −6% and −10% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. In Northern, Western and Central Europe (regions 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6) changes of −3 to −6% are obtained by the end of the century. In Southern Europe, changes are smaller (see also 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>). Note that the fact that changes are expressed here in relative terms partly contributes to obtain the smallest changes over regions and seasons (see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) with the highest potential (that is, southwards, summertime).
