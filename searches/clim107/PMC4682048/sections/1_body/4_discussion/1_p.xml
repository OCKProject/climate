<p class="p">Climate change is therefore projected to affect PV power production by a reduction of at most 10–12% in Scandinavian areas where, admittedly, solar PV is not expected to become the main source of renewable energy
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. In southern areas, in contrast, slight increases in the mean PV supply and in its daily stability were found. Uncertainties still remain in our assessment though, due for instance to indirect effects of natural and anthropogenic aerosols
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref> and to land-use changes, both features being currently poorly represented or totally ignored in RCMs, and to the tilt of PV panels, a fact not considered here. Also, whereas the effect of ambient conditions on the PV cell temperature and, thereby, performance has been explicitly accounted for here, other factors that may affect the outdoor performance of PV modules, such as the solar spectrum distribution and the airmass effect on it
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>, are absent in our analysis. These unrepresented factors may have an impact on the reported signals for northern areas, which will suffer more from the low irradiance performance of PV modules than sites in the south of Europe where the solar irradiance retains higher values and the PV cell temperature effect prevails
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. Besides, we found somewhat conflicting signals when comparing GCM and RCM-downscaled results regarding PVpot projections, which needs further investigation. Nevertheless, and although it should be acknowledged that climate models tend to underestimate the multidecadal variations in RSDS
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>, indicating the potential for larger changes than currently projected, none of the simulations analysed so far, here or elsewhere

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>, provides strong changes. Not even, or even less, if we incorporate the assumption of a well-developed PV power supply system across Europe. Actually, the fact that PV systems are foreseen to largely expand over the 21st century, together with other technological and politico-economical aspects (for example, increased lifetime of PV modules, module price decrease and appropriate policies supporting PV system deployment)—all non-physical aspects determining the evolution of the PV energy market

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>, as discussed in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>—should amply counteract the reported climate change-derived negative signals for the resource availability. Therefore, climate change hardly compromises the European development of PVs.
