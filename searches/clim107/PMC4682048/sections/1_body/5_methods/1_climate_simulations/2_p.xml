<p class="p">A concise evaluation exercise of the simulated RSDS, further supported by the results presented in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>, is also included in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>. All ensemble members are well able to capture both the spatial distribution and variability of the observed mean RSDS pattern, which is mainly dominated by a latitudinal gradient both in models and observations. Small negative errors (below 10%) appear in a few points mainly in the Iberian Peninsula, while overestimation errors prevail elsewhere reaching up to 20%. Excessive RSDS is a long-standing problem in climate modelling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. There is, however, a number of points where positive biases grow even beyond 40%, usually located in mountainous regions, such as the Alps, where the limitation of climate models to reproduce single measurements is well known. Regarding RSDS variability, ensemble mean errors at the annual and monthly (daily) timescales are generally negative and mostly below 2% (10%), rarely up to 6% (15%). However, while the spatial distribution of the simulated monthly and daily variability patterns is acceptable, it is not the case for the annual variability simulated pattern. Nonetheless, taking into account (1) the small number of observational points, (2) the very nature of models that perform a spatial discretization of the simulation domain, along with the actual spatial representativeness of ground-based solar radiation measurements
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>, (3) the still moderate accuracy of models to properly reproduce cloudiness
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref> and (4) the lack of a dynamically modelling of aerosols concentration levels, the results of this validation exercise are within an acceptable range, thus allowing a moderately high confidence on the analysed simulations.
