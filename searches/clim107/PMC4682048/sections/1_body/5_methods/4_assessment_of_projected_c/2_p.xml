<p class="p">The ensemble mean (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">mean</sub>) signals are computed as the arithmetic mean of the set of individual signals within each ensemble. The following criteria are used to consider them as either uncertain or negligible: at least two significant individual signals differ in the sign of the projected change (uncertain); the uncertainty condition is not fulfilled and less than a half of the individual signals are significant (negligible). Otherwise, the ensemble mean signals are referred to as robust.
