<p class="p">Furthermore, using a theoretical example we show that complex biogeographic responses to climate change can be interpreted by using the appropriate metrics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). We assume that the distribution of a theoretical species is determined by a group of relevant metrics (in this case the thermal extremes measured as ‘winter minimum’ and ‘summer 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile’) and follows Liebig’s law of the minimum (i.e., at each location density is dependent on the least favourable relevant metric). In the simplest form, the distribution pattern will be determined by the least favourable of a number of relevant metrics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>, light orange area). If climate change results in a favourable monotonic change of all metrics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>), the extent of suitable locations increases and a range expansion can be expected — the “general perception” poleward scenario. However, studies have highlighted that climate change not only can result in increased mean, minimum and maximum temperatures but also in increased variability — and that the exact signature of climate change varies regionally

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. In this case, if at least one metric becomes less favourable due to the increased variability, the whole distribution can be adversely affected, and an equatorward range contraction may occur (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>). Using the metrics computed in this study it is possible to further expand the example. If the distribution of a species was found to be dependent on the interplay between extremes like ‘winter minimum’ and ‘summer 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile’ the initial distribution pattern should include a gap at shore H, and a polar range limit at shore B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2d</xref>). If both ‘winter minimum’ and ‘summer 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile’ become warmer, a poleward range expansion can be expected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2e</xref>), but if ‘summer 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile’ becomes warmer while ‘winter minimum’ becomes colder, the harshness of winter conditions prevail over the favourable summers and a equatorward range contraction should occur (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2f</xref>). Interestingly, in a few locations suitability would actually increase because the limiting factor was ‘summer 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile’ and not ‘winter minimum’ (shores L and N, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2h</xref>), highlighting the consequences of different mechanisms limiting species’ densities across different locations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. The crucial point is that if field surveys were to reveal an equatorward range contraction for this species, this range shift would not be contrary to predictions, as general perception would suggest. Instead, it would be consistent with the predicted direction of change for this biological system’s response to climate change, thus representing positive evidence towards the establishment of a link to climate change.
