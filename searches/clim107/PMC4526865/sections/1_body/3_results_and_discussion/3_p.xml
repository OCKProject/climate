<p class="p">In addition, it is conceivable that some organisms’ physiological requirements may include more complex interactions of aspects of a stressor than those depicted here

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. For example, a mobile organism will be able to explore the various microhabitats available within a site for thermoregulation. If that organisms’ physiology is found to be negatively impacted by ‘summer maximum’, it is likely that the appropriate metric to study will instead be the difference between ‘summer maximum’ and ‘summer microhabitat range’, as very high temperatures can be avoided if cooler microhabitats are available. These complex interactions between aspects of a stressor can generate new stress landscape patterns that do not match that of the grand mean, ‘summer maximum’ or ‘summer microhabitat range’, further increasing the likelihood of erroneous expectations about the extent and direction of range shifts in face of climate change if the stress landscape is not properly characterized. The findings presented in this study reinforce the notion that using the appropriate metrics of a stressor and identifying the appropriate stressor
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref> can provide decisive insights towards the detection, interpretation and prediction of complex distribution patterns, spatial and temporal variations of mechanisms controlling species distributions and the direction of range shifts. In addition, the conceptual framework here outlined emphasizes the paramount importance of coupling the collection of environmental data at the appropriate scales with a detailed characterization of species’ physiological requirements (see Ashcroft

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref> or Greenberg 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref> for analogous approaches using modelled data). Although focused on the thermal regimes of the European Atlantic intertidal ecosystem, the concepts here outlined can be extended to other geographical regions, ecosystems, and stressors. Taken with necessary caution (see, for example, the cautionary advice by Austin
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref> regarding assumptions of linear response to temperature), these results suggest that some of the cases where species have been shown to be shifting in directions contrary to expectations, the predicted direction of change may have been wrongly established.
