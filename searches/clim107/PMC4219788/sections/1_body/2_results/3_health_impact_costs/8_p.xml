<p class="p">For air pollution-related deaths, the attributed cost of acute and chronic mortality to climate change was estimated by the Climate Cost project at €125 billion per annum in 2050 for the 27 European Union countries.
 <xref rid="b16-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref> These costs are dominated by premature death (€86 billion), with the majority of the remaining accounted for by the cost of chronic bronchitis (€17 billion), restricted activity days (lost productivity at €14 billion), and suffering from disease symptoms (at €9 billion). One-third (€42 billion) of the overall economic impacts can be reduced by mitigation measures.
