<p class="p">Within the project “Climate change and adaptation strategies for human health in Europe” (cCASh), a contingent valuation survey was carried out to estimate the benefits of reducing the risk of dying during heat-waves. In contingent valuation, a survey questionnaire builds theoretical scenarios to enable values to be obtained for situations that do not commonly arise in real-life, or cannot easily be observed. The survey was administered to adults aged from 30 to 75 years in the Czech Republic and Italy. For the city of Rome, the monetized mortality damages of the heat-waves in the absence of planned adaptation programs was estimated to be €281 million for the year 2020 (in 2004 values).
