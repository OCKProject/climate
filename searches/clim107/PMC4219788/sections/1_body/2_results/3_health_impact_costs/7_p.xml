<p class="p">Other studies estimate the costs of excess deaths from heat-waves, but do not estimate attributed costs to climate change, such as the 2003 heat-wave in the United Kingdom that led to 2,157 excess deaths at a cost of £2.6 billion (€3.6 billion) using valuation of a death at £1.2 million (€1.7 million), or £32 million (€45 million) using valuation of a saved year of life of £15,000 (€21,000).

Likewise, the 2003 heat-wave in France was estimated to have caused 14,800 excess deaths from August 1 to 20, 2003, costing society more than €500 million using a value per life saved of €37,500.
 <xref rid="b22-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref> Both studies assume an average of 1 year of life lost per deceased person given that the majority of excess deaths were of people 75 years and over. Furthermore, the absence of a surge in health insurance expenses for the year 2003 in France led the authors to conclude that the increased hospitalizations from excess cases balanced out with hospitalizations averted because of excess deaths in the same year.
