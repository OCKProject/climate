<p class="p">Limited economic studies on vector-borne disease have been conducted in Europe. A hypothetical tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine for French troops stationed in the Balkans was estimated to avert 121 cases of TBE at a program cost of €10.05 million, thus costing €83,000 per case prevented.

For Lyme disease, an economic study from the USA estimates the average cost per case averted to be US$4,466 (€4,190).

Hence, cross-border extrapolations should be made with care, adjusting for differences in key determinants.
