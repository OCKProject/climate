<p class="p">Health economic studies not only assess adaptation costs (above) but also compare these costs to health impacts and other outcomes in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) or cost–benefit analysis (CBA).
 <xref rid="b25-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref> Ideally, economic evaluation includes a comparative economic assessment of alternative policy options. The literature search revealed no studies that have specifically examined the costs and health effects of interventions specifically related to addressing the additional disease burden associated with climate change. However, several studies were found that assessed cost-effectiveness or cost–benefit of health interventions targeting climate-sensitive diseases. These are most available in the areas of preventing food-borne diseases, preventing diarrhea through rotavirus vaccination and preventing or treating air quality-related conditions. However, as these studies were non-specific to climate change, they fell outside the initial systematic search criteria. Therefore, the studies presented below illustrate the types of studies available, but they do not represent the entire published economic literature. These were included in this assessment as they provide indications for future research.
