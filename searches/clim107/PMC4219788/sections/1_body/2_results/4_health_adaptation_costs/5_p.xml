<p class="p">Heat-health action plans have been strengthened in recent years. In France, the cost of preparing the heat-wave and health alert system (Système d’alerte canicule et santé [SACS]) in 2005 was calculated at €287,000 and the operating cost between June 1 and August 31 was calculated at €454,000, summing to a first year cost of €741,000.
 <xref rid="b22-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref> These costs cover mainly the additional human resource costs. Compared to the estimated health costs of more than €500 million, including loss of human life at the value of €37,500 per year of lost life, this intervention cost is relatively small.
