<p class="p">In all, 40 relevant studies from Europe were identified, covering the health damage costs (10 studies) or adaptation costs (5 additional studies) related to the health effects of climate change, and the efficiency of response measures for climate-sensitive diseases (25 additional studies). Efficiency means an input–output metric such as cost per death averted or cost–benefit ratio. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehi-8-2014-043" class="xref">Table 1</xref> presents data on the health impact cost studies and adaptation cost studies where projections are available. Studies that do not estimate health impact or adaptation costs attributed to climate change (but only of climate-sensitive diseases or conditions) are described in the text but excluded from the table, as they are not comparable.
