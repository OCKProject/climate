<p class="p">Evidence plays a more important role than it currently does in guiding health and policies that cut across different sectors. This fact is generally recognized across EU member states, for example, where health systems regulate what health interventions are applied through strict Health Technology Assessment procedures and other evidence-to-policy initiatives.

More evidence is required to show the health-protecting effect of safe environments (eg, urban areas, homes, workplaces) as well as the intangible health and non-health impacts. To support the generation of this evidence, methodological guidelines specific to the economics of health and climate change are needed to stimulate more economic research and provide standardization of approach. The first step has been done by the recent economic tool developed by the WHO Regional Office for Europe to guide health damage and adaptation studies.

Access to the underlying data and tools remains a challenge, in particular when health effects estimations are not available or detailed health service utilization costs are required.
