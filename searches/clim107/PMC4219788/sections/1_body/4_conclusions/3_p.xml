<p class="p">Significant health gains can be achieved through interventions that are not primarily under the control of the health sector, but are embedded in action at, for example, the urban or regional level. Health gains from investments in other sectors are an opportunity rather than a threat. Economic analyses in areas such as air pollution, nutrition, and transport policy generally show the importance of health outcomes. The new Health 2020 aims at promoting health in all policies.

Economics can be used as a common language to make the case for intervention and hence bring others on board. To achieve this, a standardized approach, increased transparency of methods and interests, and a more common presentation from economic studies are needed.
