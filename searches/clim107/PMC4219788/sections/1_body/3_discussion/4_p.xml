<p class="p">Third, widely varying climate models and economic methods and impacts were used in the studies reviewed, making it difficult to compare results between studies. There are a large number of climate models that vary in their specifications and precision. Economic models include various types of general equilibrium model (where linkages between impacts in different sectors are quantitatively assessed), sector-specific estimates (with no linkage assessed between sectors), and also a mixture of the two such as the WITCH model.
