<p class="p">Second, the lack of standardization of economic outcome measures is a serious constraint to the use of evidence by decision makers. As the literature review reveals, a range of economic outcomes are used, such as cost per DALY averted, cost per QALY gained, cost per case averted, cost per death averted, net cost or net present value, and economic benefits per unit of money invested. Few studies present all of these outcomes together. The outcome presented depends primarily on the study aim. Indeed, the choice of different outcome measures is justified by the fact that different decision-making contexts require expression of efficiency in different units. Interventions requiring public health funds tend to favor the use of cost per QALY gained or cost per DALY averted. Interventions requiring private investment or cost recovery from households, such as food-borne disease prevention or water and sanitation services, tend to show net present value or benefitâ€“cost ratio. However, the reviewed economic studies do not analyze the mix of financing sources that might be required to successfully implement the evaluated interventions. This is a particular gap given that the analysis of financing options provides a concrete link from academic studies to policy makers.</p>
