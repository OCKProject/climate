<p class="p">This analysis, however, will not capture every hurricane or tornado mentioned on Twitter, only those that were referenced alongside the word “climate”. Hurricane Arthur, for example, occurred in early July, 2014 and does not appear as a spike in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>. This particular hurricane did not cause nearly as much damage or as many fatalities as the hurricanes that do appear in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>, and perhaps did not draw enough attention to highlight a link between hurricanes and climate change on Twitter. Additionally, a large tornado outbreak in Kentucky, Alabama, Indiana, and Ohio occurred in early March 2012 and does not appear as a spike in our analysis.
