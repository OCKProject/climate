<p class="p">Using the first half of our dataset, Dodds et. al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] calculated the average happiness of tweets containing several individual keywords including “climate”. They found that tweets containing the word “climate” were, on average, similar in ambient happiness to those containing the words “no”, “rain”, “oil”, and “cold” (see Table 2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]). In the following section, we compare the happiness score of tweets containing the word “climate” to that of 5 other climate-related keywords.
