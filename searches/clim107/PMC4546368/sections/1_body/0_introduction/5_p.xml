<p class="p">The majority of the topics trending on Twitter are headlines or persistent news [
 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], making Twitter a valuable source for studying climate change opinions. For example, in [
 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], subjective vs objective and positive vs negative tweets mentioning climate change are coded manually and analyzed over a one year time period. In [
 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], various climate hashtags are utilized to locate pro/denialist communities on Twitter. In the present study, we apply the hedonometer to a collection of tweets containing the word “climate”. We collected roughly 1.5 million such tweets from Twitter’s gardenhose API (a random 10% of all messages) during the roughly 6 year period spanning September 14, 2008 through July 14, 2014. This time period represents the extent of our database at the time of writing. Each collected tweet contains the word “climate” at least once. We include retweets in the collection to ensure an appropriately higher weighting of messages authored by popular accounts (e.g. media, government). We apply the hedonometer to the climate tweets during different time periods and compare them to a reference set of roughly 100 billion tweets from which the climate-related tweets were filtered. We analyze highest and lowest happiness time periods using word shift graphs developed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], and we discuss specific words contributing to each happiness score.
