<p class="p">We built models using the following parameters: (i) learning rate = 0.01, (ii) tree complexity = 5, (iii) family = Bernoulli. These settings resulted in models built with an average of 3100 and 2800 trees for winter and summer species, respectively, well beyond the suggested minimum of 1000 [

 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] in R and cross-validation was performed using 10 folds.
