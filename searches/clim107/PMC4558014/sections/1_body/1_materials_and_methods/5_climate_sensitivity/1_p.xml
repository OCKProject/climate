<p class="p">We assigned each species to a climate sensitivity status based on overall changes in climatic suitability: 
 <italic class="italic">Climate endangered</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">climate threatened</italic>, or 
 <italic class="italic">climate stable</italic>. We defined 
 <italic class="italic">climate endangered</italic> as projected loss of more than 50% of current range by 2050 across all scenarios, with no net gain from potential range expansion. 
 <italic class="italic">Climate threatened</italic> was defined as projected loss of more than 50% of current range by 2080 across all scenarios, with net gain from potential range expansion possible. 
 <italic class="italic">Climate stable</italic> was defined as projected loss of less than 50% of current range across scenarios. 
 <italic class="italic">Climate stable</italic> included 46 species, defined as introduced (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 14) or native species with ranges that occur only marginally within our study area (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 32).
