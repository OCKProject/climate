<p class="p">Shifts in the geographic locations of species distributions were heterogeneous (
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.g004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). While distributions were estimated to shift northward an average of 322 km during the breeding season and 116 km during non-breeding season (SRES A2, 2080), forecasts varied considerably, with 16% of breeding taxa and 27% of non-breeding taxa projected to shift southward.
