This will then allow a framework for prioritizing the establishment of new sites in regions that are data‐poor or sensitive to change, and for providing justification for maintaining operation of well‐established time series stations (Henson, 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In the analysis presented here we provide quantitative information on both the time and space scales needed for observing climate change effects on a range of ocean biogeochemical variables, which establishes a basis for assessing the adequacy of the current ocean observatory network for climate monitoring.
