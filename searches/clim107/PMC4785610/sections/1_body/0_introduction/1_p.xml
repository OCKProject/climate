 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Warmer temperatures will tend to increase ocean stratification, restricting the supply of nutrients to photosynthetic organisms in the surface waters (Steinacher 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Warmer waters will also reduce the solubility of oxygen and exchange of subsurface low oxygen waters with the atmosphere, potentially resulting in deoxygenation with subsequent negative effects on marine organisms (Vaquer‐Sunyer &amp; Duarte, 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The synergistic effect of these changes is predicted to be an overall decrease in primary production (PP) over most of the global ocean, with the possible exception of the Arctic region (Bopp 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In addition, in high latitudes the structure of the phytoplankton community is expected to shift away from dominance by large species to smaller pico‐ and nanoplankton as the subtropical gyres expand (Henson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In turn, this reduction in large phytoplankton is predicted to result in a decrease in upper ocean carbon export (Doney 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and hence a reduction in organic carbon sequestration.
