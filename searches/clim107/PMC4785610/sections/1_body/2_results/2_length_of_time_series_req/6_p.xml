In some cases (Table S2), these stations are located in regions where climate change should be relatively rapidly detectable, for example at ALOHA (ranging from ~13 years for SST to ~29 years for chlorophyll concentration) or the PIRATA stations in the equatorial Atlantic (from ~11 years for SST to ~26 years for oxygen at the southerly station). At other stations, considerably longer time series would be needed to distinguish a climate change trend, for example at BATS (ranging from ~11 years for SST, ~47 years for export flux, to undetectable in a 95 year record for PP) or the Southern Ocean Time Series station off Tasmania (from ~20 years in SST to ~46 years in chlorophyll, to undetectable in export flux).
