<p class="p">For a trend to be rapidly detectable, the ratio of the signal (i.e. the trend magnitude) to the noise (i.e. the variability) needs to be high. The number of years of data needed to detect a trend (
 <italic class="italic">n*</italic>) in biogeochemical variables is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. The natural variability, here defined as the standard deviation of the residuals (see 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Materials and methods</xref>), is presented in Fig. S2. In many variables, 
 <italic class="italic">n*</italic> is shorter at low than at high latitudes. This arises because at low latitudes trends are strong but variability tends to be smaller than at high latitudes, and therefore fewer years of data are needed to detect a long‐term trend. An example of how the noise and signal interact in estimating 
 <italic class="italic">n*</italic> can be found in the Northeast Pacific oxygen content, where low noise and a strong decreasing trend result in an estimated ~25 years of data needed to detect a trend. A scenario at the other extreme is nitrate concentration in the Southern Ocean which has weak noise, but also a weak trend, resulting in larger
