<p class="p">Spatial patterns of coverage for all variables are shown in Fig. S3 which plots the number of BGC‐SOs that are representative of each 1 × 1° pixel, that is the regions of overlap in Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. Some ocean regions are very well‐represented by multiple BGC‐SOs, such as the west coast of the USA. Much of the North and equatorial Atlantic, North Pacific, western Indian Ocean and Mediterranean are covered by existing BGC‐SOs, but vast tracts of the Southern Hemisphere are not.
