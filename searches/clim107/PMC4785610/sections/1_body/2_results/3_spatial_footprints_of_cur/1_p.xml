<p class="p">Ocean observing stations are typically single point locations, although in some cases arrays of sampling may be carried out, such as the CALCOFI (southern California) grid covered by regular cruises. Here, we assess whether the current network of ocean observing stations provides adequate coverage of ocean conditions to determine a climate change trend. The spatial area wherein each observing station is statistically similar, in terms of its mean and variability, with surrounding conditions (see 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-sec-0002" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Materials and methods</xref>) provides an indication of each station's ‘footprint’, that is where single‐point observing stations may be considered representative of conditions in a larger area.
