<p class="p">The locations of ocean observing stations that include a biogeochemical component were taken from the OceanSites database (

Here, we limit our analysis to fixed point observatories that are identified in the OceanSites database as currently operational or planned, and which have a biogeochemical component, although they may not measure all the variables explored here (hereinafter these are referred to as BGC‚ÄêSOs).
