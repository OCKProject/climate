<p class="p">An analysis of the SST and pH data collected at BATS illustrates how the 
 <italic class="italic">n*</italic> estimates presented in Table S2 and Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> can be applied to 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> time series. At BATS, our analysis suggests that ~15 years of data are needed to distinguish a long‐term trend in pH from background variability (Table S2). We split the observed pH time series (Bates

 <xref rid="gcb13152-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref> and N. Bates, personal communication) into overlapping 10 and 15 year chunks and tested for trends by applying Eqn 
 <xref rid="gcb13152-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(1)</xref>. Time series as short as 10 years evince statistically significant trends for most periods, however our analysis suggests that, with an estimated 
 <italic class="italic">n*</italic> of 15 years, it would be ill‐advised to unequivocally attribute the trend in a 10 year time series to climate change. For 15 year time series, all periods show a statistically significant trend which is likely a genuine long‐term trend. For the whole time series of 30 years, the trend is −0.002 units, which is statistically significant at the 95% level. As the length of the complete time series far exceeds the 
 <italic class="italic">n*</italic> suggested by our analysis, this trend is highly likely to be climate change‐driven.
