<p class="p">Although existing BGC‐SOs may not necessarily be in an ideal location if the primary aim is detecting climate change, for the well‐established stations little is to be gained from relocating them. Generally, 
 <italic class="italic">n*</italic> is &gt;20 years (except for SST and pH), so if &gt;20 years of data have already been collected, then in most cases more than half the required time series to detect climate change is already in hand (and in some cases much more than half). Importantly, some BGC‐SOs do not have climate change detection as a primary goal, focusing instead on process understanding. In these cases, the discussion presented here of time and space scales is of less relevance.
