<p class="p">To anticipate increased health care demands and prepare accordingly, information on climate change and health vulnerabilities at the community level can be used [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In many urban communities in Canada, climate change will contribute to poor air quality (e.g., from wildfire smoke, smog, allergens) that can lead to increased hospital cases of asthma, COPD, acute bronchitis, chest pain and other cardio-respiratory illnesses [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Early warning systems can help increase preparedness to support the delivery of care. Health care facilities can benefit by being linked to weather alert and warning systems [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] such as heat alert and response systems (HARS) [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]; air quality alerts [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]; boiled water advisories and critical service disruption notifications to better anticipate increases in hospital visits. Many communities in Canada have adopted HARS to notify vulnerable groups, the general public and health care and community services of impending extreme heat events and to provide information on how people can protect themselves from heat-health impacts [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Such systems can help health care facilities be more prepared for increased heat-related hospital visits.
