<p class="p">The resource guidebook provides helpful resources for health care facilities to increase understanding of climate change and health risks and actions to increase resiliency. In Canada, resources are available to increase awareness of climate change risks to the health care sector. In 2008, Health Canada released a report entitled: “
 <italic class="italic">Human Health in a Changing Climate: A Canadian Assessment of Vulnerabilities and Adaptive Capacity</italic>” which provides information for Canadians and health authorities on climate change and health risks as well as the adaptive capacity of the health sector in Canada to manage risks [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. A Government of Canada climate change impacts and adaptation assessment, released in 2014, provides updated information on climate change and health challenges in urban, rural, coastal and northern communities and innovative adaptation measures available to health sector decision makers [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The Canadian Coalition for Green Health Care provides information to help hospital officials reduce the environmental footprint of their facility and mitigate greenhouse gases [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Internationally, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change produces regular assessment reports [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] and special reports (e.g., Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation: a Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) that includes information on climate change risks to human health. The WHO has published information about climate change and health related risks for a number of areas including extreme heat [
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], flooding, economic valuation, gender implications [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] and innovative ways to reduce risks, for example, by linking climate services with emergency management and health care services [
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Links to these resources and others are provided in the resource guidebook to facilitate its application and subsequent use to increase climate resiliency in health care facilities. Completion of the assessment checklist by a health care facility provides information on the degree to which that facility is resilient to current climate variability and future climate change based upon the indicators presented above. Identification of important gaps related to emergency management and health care services, greening of operations or supply procurement and management may be used by hospital officials to inform the implementation of needed adaptations.
