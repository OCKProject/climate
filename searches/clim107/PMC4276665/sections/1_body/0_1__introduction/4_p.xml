<p class="p">Information exists to support efforts by health care facilities to prepare for climate change but guidance is piecemeal. For example, Blashki provides examples of adaptations to climate change hazards for health systems that are included in Australia’s National Adaptation Research Plan [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Health care facilities contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions through the energy intensive 24 h operation of services and to environmental degradation through the high demand of health care services and operations on natural resources (energy, water, and food procurement) [

 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. As such, tools are available to help health care facilities reduce their environmental footprint [

 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. A lack of a coherent and integrated approach to adaptation results in preparedness gaps that can leave some health care facilities and surrounding communities vulnerable. Furthermore, no climate change resiliency tool has been developed and tested in Canada and tailored to the needs of facilities in the country.
