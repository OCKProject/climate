<p class="p">Climate change has been identified as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In Canada, climate change is expected to pose greater health risks to Canadians from increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events (e.g., more heat events of longer duration [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], floods, droughts, wildfires andstorm surges), poor air quality, impacts on drinking and recreational water quality, food-borne diseases and vector-borne and zoonotic diseases [

 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Health care facilities play a critical role in reducing health impacts from climate change by treating illnesses and injuries attributable, at least in part, to climate-related hazards, caring for patients during and after disasters [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and actively participating in community efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Health care pressures in communities will increase with climate change and are expected to occur coincident with important socio-economic changes (e.g., ageing population, increased urbanization) and environmental degradation that can further increase health risks in populations and demands on health care facilities [
