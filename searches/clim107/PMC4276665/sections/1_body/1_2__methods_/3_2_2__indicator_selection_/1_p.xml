Based upon this definition, indicators were identified to capture key climate change resiliency metrics to describe actions to prepare for, cope with and constructively respond to extreme weather events and gradual shifts in average weather conditions. Best practices identified from the literature review helped inform selection of the indicators used to develop the assessment checklist. Indicators were categorized into two general groups that included emergency management and strengthening health care services and climate-proofing and greening operations (referring to measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce waste and improve the health of the environment).
