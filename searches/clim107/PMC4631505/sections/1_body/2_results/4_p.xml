Habitat decline is predicted to occur gradually, with an average range change of -25% (± 2), -44% (± 11), and -56% (± 2) by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, under the RCP 4.5 scenario and -27% (± 2), -59% (± 8), and -74% (± 2) under the RCP 8.5 scenario (
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.g006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). Predictions of range change differed markedly under the two greenhouse gas scenarios; more habitat was predicted to be lost by the 2050s under the RCP 8.5 scenario than by the 2080s under the RCP 4.5 scenario. The three general circulation models (GCMs) showed strong agreement in their predictions of the future distribution of suitable ptarmigan habitat and indicated that remaining suitable habitat will be located within Strathcona Provincial Park, with little to no remaining habitat in the southern ranges and only small, isolated habitat patches in the northern ranges by 2085 (
