<p class="p">To model the distribution of VIWTP in the future, we extracted the above climate predictors from ClimateBC for the 2020s (2010–2039), 2050s (2040–2069), and 2080s (2070–2099) across three general circulation models (GCMs): CanESM2 from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, CCSM4 from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and GFDL-CM3 from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) from the International Panel on Climate Change AR5 report: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. We chose these three GCMs to represent a range of possible climate futures on Vancouver Island based on scatter plots of future temperature and precipitation using all 16 GCMs made available through ClimateBC. The GFDL model predicts a hot, moderately wet future, the CanESM2 model predicts a hot, very wet future, and the CCSM model predicts the least change in both temperature and precipitation (

The RCP 4.5 scenario represents lower future greenhouse gas concentrations and more conservative predictions of climate change, whereas the RCP 8.5 scenario represents higher future greenhouse gas concentrations and a more extreme climate change scenario. In order to predict future ptarmigan distribution, we extracted the three climate predictors for every cell in the 100-m DEM covering all of Vancouver Island for each GCM and greenhouse gas scenario combination.
