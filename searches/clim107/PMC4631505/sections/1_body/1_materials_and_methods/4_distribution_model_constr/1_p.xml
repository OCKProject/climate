 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] with the ‘randomForest’ package in R. Random Forest models had high accuracy and were most consistent when modeling the field survey and public data separately [

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]). Random Forest models produce many classification trees, each constructed using a bootstrap sample of the input data. The number of predictor variables randomly selected at each tree node was set to the default (the square root of the total number of predictors), and 1500 classification trees were constructed.
