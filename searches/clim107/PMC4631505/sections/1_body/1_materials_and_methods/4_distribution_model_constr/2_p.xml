<p class="p">We used ptarmigan presence and pseudo-absence locations from the pooled datasets as the response variable and all abiotic predictor variables in the model. In order to convert probability of presence into binary presence-absence predictions, we used the threshold probability that maximized sensitivity (percent of presences correctly classified) at 90% using the ‘PresenceAbsence’ package in R. Map pixels with probabilities above the threshold were considered ‘suitable’ habitat and those below the threshold were considered ‘unsuitable.’ We felt that from a conservation perspective, errors of omission (misclassifying presences as absences) were more “dangerous” than errors of commission (misclassifying absences as presences). Furthermore, since we knew the presences to be true presences but absences were pseudo-absences and may have been false (located in areas where ptarmigan are present) we chose to maximize the number of presences correctly predicted at 90%, recognizing that this may result in slight over-prediction of suitable habitat compared to other threshold-setting measures (e.g., maximizing kappa). We evaluated the RF model by calculating out-of-bag (OOB) errors based on bootstrapped samples of the input data according to the pre-chosen threshold using the R package ‘PresenceAbsence’. We constructed all models using R 3.1.2.</p>
