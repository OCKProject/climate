<p class="p">We calculated baseline and future habitat area by multiplying the number of raster grid cells considered “suitable” in each predicted distribution by the area of each grid cell (0.01 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). We assessed the potential effects of climate change on predicted distributions by evaluating potential net range change. Range change (RC) was calculated using the formula
