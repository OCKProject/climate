<p class="p">Some methods for generating pseudo-absences first predict low suitability areas using presence-only models and select pseudo-absences from those areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] apply a novel three-step approach to select pseudo-absences using environmental constraints which can outperform models where pseudo-absences are randomly generated. We used distribution maps of BEC zones, which incorporate environmental variables known to be correlated with ptarmigan presence, to define environmental constraints for pseudo-absence selection. In contrast to methods that generate pseudo-absences outside of suitable habitat, we differentiated ‘‘suitable” from ‘‘highly suitable” habitat by generating pseudo-absences within potentially suitable habitat (which included both Mountain Hemlock and Coastal Mountain-heather Alpine zones). Such a distinction is important for rare and threatened species [
