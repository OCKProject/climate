We used a threshold that maximized sensitivity (set at 0.90) to correctly predict the largest number of ptarmigan presence locations while attempting to avoid overpredicting habitat suitability across the landscape by setting sensitivity too high. However, as in most studies of this kind, we cannot be sure that areas without ptarmigan sightings represent unsuitable summer habitat. A series of initial trials revealed that our choice of threshold and resulting estimates of habitat loss were conservative; other methodological choices for setting a threshold, such as maximizing model accuracy according to kappa or setting a lower sensitivity, resulted in smaller estimates of suitable habitat area and greater predictions for climate-induced habitat loss. By utilizing a threshold that slightly over-predicts baseline suitable habitat for VIWTP, we minimized the chances of “missing” areas of suitable habitat and overestimating habitat loss as often occurs in climate envelope studies [
