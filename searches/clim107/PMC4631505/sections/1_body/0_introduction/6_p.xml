<p class="p">Species distribution models can be a useful tool for assessing the impacts of environmental change and the distribution of organisms. In a previous study describing the quantity and location of suitable ptarmigan breeding habitat on Vancouver Island, we showed that species distribution models trained using opportunistic observations submitted by hikers (citizen science) are comparable in quality and predictions to models trained using time- and cost-intensive field survey data [
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Thus, although large-scale avian citizen science platforms such as eBird may not adequately capture observations from alpine regions, localized and species-specific citizen science programs can provide valuable information about elusive alpine species such as VIWTP. Here, we build on our comparison of five modeling techniques using citizen science and field survey input data to investigate how climate change will alter the size, distribution, and configuration of suitable VIWTP breeding habitat. Specifically, we ask how the total amount, mean patch size and number of patches of suitable VIWTP habitat will change by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s due to climate change. Our study identifies areas of highest vulnerability and guides future plans for conservation of this threatened subspecies, along with providing a baseline for future studies of connectivity for mountain wildlife across increasingly fragmented habitat.
