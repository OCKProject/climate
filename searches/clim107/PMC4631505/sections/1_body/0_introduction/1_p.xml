 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Mountains often have high levels of biodiversity and harbour large numbers of endemic species [

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], many of which are restricted to alpine habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Such habitats are gradually being lost due to tree and shrub encroachment [
