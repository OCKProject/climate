<p class="p">Coastal temperate mountains are particularly vulnerable to climate change as they occur at lower elevations compared to interior mountains and contain a smaller area of alpine habitat [
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Relatively little is known about the importance of alpine ecosystems for avian biodiversity, and most large-scale bird sampling schemes, including citizen science programs such as eBird and the Breeding Bird Survey, lack adequate reports from high elevations because of their relative inaccessibility and low population densities [

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. However, British Columbia’s coastal mountains, including those on Vancouver Island, harbour a remarkable diversity of birds, many of which are of conservation concern and threatened by climate change ([
