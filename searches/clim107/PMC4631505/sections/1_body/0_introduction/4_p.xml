<p class="p">The Vancouver Island White-tailed Ptarmigan (
 <italic class="italic">Lagopus leucura saxatilis</italic>; hereafter VIWTP) is endemic to Vancouver Island and was designated a subspecies in 1939 based on unique morphological characteristics [

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. An alpine specialist bird that spends its entire life history above the treeline, VIWTP was blue-listed as vulnerable by the British Columbia government in 1992 given its endemic status and low density [

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. They rely on permanent snow fields for thermoregulation [

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] and areas with sufficient moisture (from summer precipitation and snowmelt) for food such as ericaceous shrubs, grasses, and forbs [
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Because the coastal alpine comprises lower elevations than interior mountains, VIWTP habitat exists as smaller, more fragmented “sky island” patches than interior White-tailed Ptarmigan habitat on the mainland. For example, the size of alpine patches comprehensively surveyed for VIWTP in 1997 varied from 0.14 to 7.10 km

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Although ptarmigan have persisted on Vancouver Island, there is likely a demographic cost to utilizing smaller habitat patches. For instance, VIWTP in the central island (with larger, more continuous patches of alpine) had higher breeding success and higher adult survival than birds in the more fragmented south island populations in 2011 [
