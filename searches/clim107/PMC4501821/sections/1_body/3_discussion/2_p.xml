<p class="p">There are few related studies available in the literature to compare against, as this is the first time that a G&amp;Y model has been developed and validated against tree data for both present-day (i.e., PSP data) and projected future climates (JABOWA-3 generated data). Statistical indicators of model accuracy (i.e., BIAS, RMSE, and ME) demonstrate good overall model performance compared to conventional models designed for static climatic conditions. The Forest Vegetation Simulator-Inland Empire model (i.e., FVS-IE), generally over-predicted diameter increments by 14% compared to field records, whereas discrepancy in predicting different species diameter ranged from -49.1% to 5.9% [

This was reported in a study validating the BA increment component of FVS-IE with forest inventory data across the Inland Empire region, USA. Basal area increment models developed in Norway generated coefficients of determination (r
