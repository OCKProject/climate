 <xref rid="pone.0132066.g005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 5
  <italic class="italic">a</italic>
 </xref> for existing field records. Residual analysis revealed that most data points (-∞,-300] or [300, ∞) belonged to red maple (
 <italic class="italic">Acer rubrum</italic> L.) with its growth expected to increase with climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0132066.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Similar trends were observed in residual plots (
 <xref rid="pone.0132066.g006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>) for volume growth predictions. Generally, these results indicated the advantage of pooling data (JABOWA-predicted + PSP tree data) together for joint influence on ANN development. As the number of data points associated with field-measured PSP data was greater than that of the JABOWA predictions, the PSP data may have helped to adjust some over-prediction with red maple under scenarios of climate change.
