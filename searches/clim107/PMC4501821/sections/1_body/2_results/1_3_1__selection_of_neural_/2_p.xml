 </xref>. The R values ranged from 0.90 to 0.95 and MSE from 0.00074 to 0.00136, whereas BIAS ranged from -0.00007 to 0.00280. Overall highest R and lowest MSE were produced with ANNs with eight hidden nodes, while average minimum BIAS occurred when eight hidden nodes were used. In general, prediction accuracy increased from four to eight hidden nodes, and decreased from eight to ten nodes.
