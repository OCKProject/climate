<p class="p">Values of R, MSE, and BIAS for the individual ANNs with four to ten hidden-layer nodes are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0132066.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>; variations according to the number of hidden-layer nodes are illustrated in 
 <xref rid="pone.0132066.g003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. For BA increment, ANN configurations with four to ten hidden-layer nodes produced R values between 0.87 and 0.93, MSE of 0.00124 to 0.00219, and BIAS of -0.06670 to 2.69360. The R values increased with the number of hidden layer nodes from four to six, but were similar for six and eight hidden layer nodes, and increased with ten hidden nodes (

  <italic class="italic">a</italic>
 </xref>). Lowest MSE values were observed for ANNs with ten hidden nodes and greatest with four hidden nodes. BIAS values were consistent, lowest, and close to zero for network structures with eight hidden nodes; BIAS values were progressively higher with four, six, and ten hidden nodes (
