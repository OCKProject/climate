 <xref rid="pone.0132066.g004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>. Predictions with the optimised ANN for BA increment, when compared to the validation data produced a BIAS of -0.0177, RMSE of 40.53, and ME of 0.82. Similarly, ANN-predictions for volume increment generated a BIAS of 0.00079, RMSE of 0.0393, and ME of 0.89. High ME-values (&gt; 0.80) indicated good overall ANN performance for both BA and volume increment under present-day and future projected climates. Overall, average difference between ANN-predicted and observations (i.e., BIAS) was low for both BA and volume increments.
