<p class="p">The quality of forest management plans hinges on the quality and reliability of growth and yield (G &amp; Y) predictions. Traditionally, G&amp;Y models are developed from large amounts of historical data using statistical techniques [

 <xref rid="pone.0132066.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. These models usually require simple inputs and predict with relatively low bias at regional scales [

 <xref rid="pone.0132066.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Growth models are available for even-aged and uneven-aged stands as well as single and mixed species forests. These models have the capability to produce information from individual-tree to stand and forest levels. However, these models are empirical in nature and as a result are applicable only to stand growing conditions similar to the conditions for which they were developed [

 <xref rid="pone.0132066.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Also, these empirical models rely on a core assumption that climatic and environmental conditions significant to tree growth are not violated [
