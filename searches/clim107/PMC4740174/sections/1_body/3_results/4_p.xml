For example, mean annual temperatures in Antarctica were up to 4 °C warmer during the estimated period of megafauna extinctions than at the end of MIS4 (the interval from 72 to 59 kyr
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>), representing a shift of temperature anomaly in Antarctica (i.e., temperature differences from the present day) from a mean of −10 to −6 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1d</xref>). Temperatures in Sahul indicate a similar trend, although MIS3 warming was &lt;1 °C higher than MIS4 conditions (a shift from a mean anomaly of −2.5 °C at MIS4 to −1.5 °C at MIS3; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1e</xref>) and precipitation anomaly decreased by &lt;1 mm per day during the MIS4/3 transition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1f</xref>). These temporal trends in climate are supported by higher ENSOp during MIS3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1g</xref>), which indicates more arid conditions. Climate velocity proxies indicate that genera would have had to shift their ranges by moving up to 10 and 150 m per year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1h</xref>), to track shifts in temperature and precipitation, respectively, during MIS3. During MIS5 (123–72 kyr)
