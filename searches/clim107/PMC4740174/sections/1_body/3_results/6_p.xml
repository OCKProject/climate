<p class="p">The lack of statistical support for a linear relationship between the number of extinct genera and any of the climate proxies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) indicates that the role of climate change was either negligible, secondary and/or synergistic with humans, or operated at spatial scales too restricted to be detected in the continent-wide megafauna data set. There are also physiological and ecological reasons to expect that any increase in aridity would have favoured large-bodied animals

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref> could have led to local extirpation of genera and habitat fragmentation, possibly exacerbating human predation on megafauna, as has been suggested for Eurasia

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref> and South America
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. This continent-wide result is consistent with the fact that there are no unique extreme climate conditions during MIS3 that could plausibly lead to the inferred accumulation of extinction events during this period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>). Indeed, even more extreme conditions occurred during MIS5, when all the genera we tested were extant.
