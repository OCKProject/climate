<p class="p">To test whether climate could have affected the number of genera that went extinct in Sahul, we used an information-theoretic evidence-ratio approach (evidence ratio (ER) of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) model weights; 
 <italic class="italic">ER</italic>&gt;&gt;3 would indicate strong evidence of a climate effect; see Methods and ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>). We fitted two regression models to the number of extinct genera every 2 kyr (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>) against the value of each of the six climate proxies at the same date (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1d–h</xref>). The first model assumes a linear relationship between climatic variation and the number of extinct genera, whereas the second assumes no relationship (intercept-only ‘null' model). The ER quantifies the extent of support for the linear model (that is, climate related to the number of extinct genera) relative to the ‘null' model (no climate effect)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. We also accounted for possible temporal lags, as extinctions could be driven by earlier climatic variation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref> (see Methods). We detected no evidence of a correlation between the timing of extinction events and variation in climate based on any of the measures of climate used here. ERs were ≤1.2 for all climate indices whatever the temporal lag (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), based on either the estimated model-agreement extinction outputs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>) or the distribution of last fossil ages for each taxon (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). This demonstrates no support for the climate-driven extinction hypothesis.
