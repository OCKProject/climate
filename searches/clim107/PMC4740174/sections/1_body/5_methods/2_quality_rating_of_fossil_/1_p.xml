<p class="p">The quality-rating scheme is based on a two-stage set of objective criteria (see full method description and justification in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>). An initial assessment is made of the reliability of an age, based on the dating procedure used, followed by an evaluation of the confidence in the stratigraphic relationship (referred to as â€˜association') of the dated material to the target megafaunal taxon or archaeological event.
