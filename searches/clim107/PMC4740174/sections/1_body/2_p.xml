<p class="p">Here we use the largest, most diverse and rigorously quality-controlled data set in existence for Sahul, to investigate the role of variation in climate on megafauna extinction in Sahul and to estimate the window of coexistence of megafauna and humans, indicating the likelihood of a human-driven alternative (i.e., we hypothesize that the longer the overlap, the more time humans would have had to alter the environment and affect megafauna). We achieve this by (i) developing a robust chronological framework that reduces uncertainties in the timing of megafauna extinctions and first human occurrence; and (ii) testing the correlation of the chronology of megafauna extinctions (i.e., the number of genera that went extinct through time) against six high-resolution climate records and hindcasts. We show that (i) over the last 120 kyr, the chronology of megafauna extinctions is not correlated with changes in climate variability or more arid events at a continental scale; and (ii) the period of human–megafauna coexistence lasted ∼13.5 kyr across the continent as a whole, but with shorter periods of overlap probably in any particular region. These findings imply that human pressure, rather than climate change, was most likely to be the main driver of these extinctions.</p>
