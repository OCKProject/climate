<p class="p">This month, as we celebrate National Children’s Health Month with 
 <italic class="italic">Environmental Health Perspectives’</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">EHP</italic>) annual issue focused on children’s health around the world, one particular nexus of concern has risen to the forefront: the current and potential impacts of climate change on children’s health. Although climate change has become a constant topic of scientific inquiry and political discussion, scant U.S. attention has been paid to what it may hold in store for some of the most vulnerable members of our society—the youngest. Recently, though, this has begun to change: The President’s Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, a federal interagency group that coordinates efforts on a variety of topics important to children’s health, and others such as the American Academy of Pediatrics have recognized the need to investigate and understand the risks that climate change poses to children so that we can take measures to protect children’s health. In July, the Subcommittee on Climate Change of the Task Force, co-led by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Homeland Security, organized an Expert Consultation on the Effects of Climate Change on Children’s Health that engaged academic and government experts, children’s advocates, and leaders from federal agencies and the White House. NIEHS interest in and support for this topic represents a natural convergence of our institute’s investment in children’s health research with our efforts to examine the implications of climate change on the health of all people, but particularly those populations likely to be most vulnerable to its effects.
