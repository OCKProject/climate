<p class="p">Children’s environmental health has been a priority of our institute for decades. Early work funded and conducted by the NIEHS formed the foundation of global understanding of the health effects on children of lead, mercury, arsenic, and other toxicants. More recent work has elucidated the mechanisms and effects of endocrine disruptors, pesticides, and allergens. In 1998, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and the NIEHS established the Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction, known as CERHR. The center served until 2010 as a clearinghouse for scientific information on environmental agents that could affect human reproduction and development. In 2011, the center was subsumed into the current NTP Office of Health Assessment and Translation, which continues this important evaluation work more broadly, but with ongoing attention to children’s development and health. Also in 1998, the NIEHS and the U.S. EPA launched the Centers for Children’s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Program. These co-funded centers comprise a national network of scientific and community leaders, health care providers, and government officials who share the goals of preventing and reducing childhood diseases and translating research findings to the affected communities and the broader public.</p>
