<p class="p">Our institute’s efforts to determine the potential health impacts of climate change are similarly long-standing. The NIEHS was named as the Department of Health and Human Services principal to the U.S. Global Change Research Program in the

In 2009–2010, the NIEHS led, with the U.S. EPA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a federal interagency working group that published the landmark paper “A Human Health Perspective on Climate Change” (

Included in the 11 impact areas and associated research needs identified in the paper were many specific to children’s health and development. In 2011, the NIEHS launched a funding program to explore the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations, including pregnant women and children.
