<p class="p">Climate change, like all other environmental health issues, is not a for/against proposition. The health of our planet and the health of the people who live on it are inextricably intertwined. Therefore, how we act today to understand and address climate change is intricately linked to the tomorrows our children, and our children’s children, will face. As the impact of climate change on our children’s futures and health increasingly becomes an issue of concern for the nation and the world, so will it continue to be an issue of concern for the NIEHS.</p>
