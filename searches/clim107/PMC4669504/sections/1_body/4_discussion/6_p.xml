<p class="p">In high-latitude and mountainous regions of Canada, the widespread retreat of glaciers has contributed to increase in streamflow

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. Since this study does not account for impacts of climate change on retreat of glaciers, it underestimated the actual human contribution to decreased streamflow. Some studies show that potential impacts of a warmer climate do not significantly affect the availability of water in snow-dominated regions such as Canada

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. However, recent studies reported conflicting results on the sensitivity of streamflow to global warming impact, e.g., a general decrease in observed streamflow caused by a shift from snowfall to rainfall in USA

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref> which may be partly because hydrologic impacts of human activities are not considered in hydroclimatic models. More detailed analysis will be necessary to better estimate anthropogenic impacts such as landuse changes and streamflow regulations to watersheds studied.
