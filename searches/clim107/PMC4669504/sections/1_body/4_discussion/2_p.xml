<p class="p">From 1960s onward, human activities generally lead to decreasing streamflow until 2010 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>), while climate change predominantly lead to increasing streamflow but the impact could be opposite for some watersheds until about 1980s, when the reverse happened (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4b</xref>). The range of standard deviations (mean) in climate and human contributions to streamflow change over the five 10-year windows of data analyzed for the 30 watersheds was 8.5–75.3 mm (33.7 mm) and 8.8–54.8 mm (29.4 mm), respectively. It seems that the mean contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow change of these 30 watersheds obtained from the five 10-year window analysis for 1961–2010 agree well with results obtained from using 1980 as the common change-point for the 30 watersheds (
