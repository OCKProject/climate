<p class="p">From analyzing the 1961–2010 annual water balance of 370 watersheds using streamflow data of Water Survey Canada (WSC), Wang, 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref> found that large spatial variabilities of basin-scale water budget over Canada, and some significant discrepancies in the water budget of some watersheds in northern Canada (above 60°N) were partly due to mass loss of glaciers. Given the Budyko framework is meant for the long-term (&gt;1 year) water balance analysis, 96 Canadian watersheds with drainage area &gt;2,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and an annual water imbalance &lt;10% of the annual precipitation were selected for this study.
