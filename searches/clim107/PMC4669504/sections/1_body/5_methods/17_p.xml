 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>, Equation 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq14" class="xref">(2)</xref> was expanded by Taylorâ€™s series to estimate errors associated with using a first-order approximation for estimating streamflow change. The results show that in 94 out of 96 watersheds, the relative error of approximating precipitation change to the streamflow change is less than 9%. Therefore, it is acceptable to apply the elasticity method in this study.
