The elasticity of streamflow, defined as the percentage change of streamflow from a 1% annual change in climate or land conditions and analytically derived from the Budyko Framework
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, was used to estimate hydrological responses to climate change, land use and cover changes (LUCC) for each watershed. Hydroclimatic data was separated to two subseries for pre- and post-change periods (periods-1 and -2, respectively) from an abrupt change-point. Thus, the relative contribution of changes in precipitation and PET, and the relative contribution of human activities (LUCC) to streamflow change from periods-1 and -2, can be obtained from the difference in precipitation, PET and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> between periods-1 and -2, and the corresponding streamflow change based on its elasticity to the above changes. The separate results were further validated by a decomposition method
