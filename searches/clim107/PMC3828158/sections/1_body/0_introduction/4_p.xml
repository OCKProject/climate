<p class="p">Several empirical models have been developed for estimating the effects of weather on dengue (for example, references 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Sriprom1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[13]</xref>), and some of these have been used as a baseline to estimate the potential impacts of climate change on the future distribution and risk of dengue infection (for example, references 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Sriprom1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Confalonieri1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[14]</xref>). However, the majority of these studies have been conducted in small geographical areas, covered relatively short periods of time, and include very limited non-climatic confounders (for example, references 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Sriprom1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[15]</xref>) leading to several limitations. For example, small populations commonly result in low disease numbers leading to unstable risk estimations 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[16]</xref>; small areas are also more likely to be climatically and socioeconomically homogeneous 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Eisen1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[18]</xref>, making it harder to extrapolate the results to areas with greater climatic or socioeconomic variability.
