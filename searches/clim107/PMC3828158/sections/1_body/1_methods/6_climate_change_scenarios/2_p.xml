<p class="p">We retrieved province-specific temperature and precipitation ensemble outputs of multiple models (relative to the base period climatology of 1970–1999) from the website of the Mexican National Institute of Ecology for the years 2030, 2050 and 2080. The methodology and outputs of these ensembles have been described by Magaña and Caetano 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Magaa1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[36]</xref>. Briefly, the three scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1) describe rising temperature at an increasing rate all over the country. The north-west region is the most greatly affected by temperature at the end of the century 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Magaa1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[36]</xref>. In these scenarios, changes in precipitation are be very irregular; though they agree that decreases are expected mainly in the north and north-west, followed by the Yucatán Peninsula and central Mexico 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Magaa1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[36]</xref>. Changes in both temperature and precipitation are expected to be greater under the A2 scenario (high emissions) followed by the A1B and B1
