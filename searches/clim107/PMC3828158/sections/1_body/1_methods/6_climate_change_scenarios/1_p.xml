<p class="p">We generated extrapolations of projected dengue risk based on our fitted GAM parameters for the years 2030, 2050 and 2080, under the A1B, A2 and B1 climate change scenarios. The storylines behind these scenarios are described in detail elsewhere 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[12]</xref>. Briefly, the A1B scenario relates to a future with very rapid economic growth, global population peaking in mid-century, and the introduction of more efficient technologies with a balance in energy-sources-related technological change 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[12]</xref>. The A2 scenario describes a future with a continuously increasing global population, economic development regionally oriented, and a slower and fragmented per capita economic growth and technological change than other scenarios 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[12]</xref>. Lastly, the B1 scenario considers a similar global population growth as the A1B, but with an economic structure towards a service and information economy, reductions in material intensity, and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies
