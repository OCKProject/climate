<p class="p">Our findings regarding the impact of weather on dengue risk are consistent with the results of other studies using empirical modelling (for example, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Sriprom1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Earnest1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[41]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Gomes1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[42]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Karim1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[43]</xref>). However, previous studies using OLS, GLM, or ARIMA methods are unlikely to have fully captured the nonlinearities that we have demonstrated. Also, because of the larger database over more climate zones, we have been able to model these relationships over the whole range of climate variations likely to be seen under future climate change. Our results should therefore be generalizable to other regions and climatic zones and provide a better basis for modelling the impact of future climate change.
