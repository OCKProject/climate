 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002503-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> presents the estimates of our Poisson GAM for dengue incidence per province. This specification explained 61% of the deviance of dengue incidence. The high values of the effective degrees of freedom (
 <italic class="italic">edf</italic>) of the smooth functions indicate that associations between dengue and weather are highly nonlinear. The effects of all meteorological variables and access to piped water on dengue were found to be significant. The estimate of the scale parameter was very high (&gt;80) indicating over-dispersed data. The results presented here were robust to other model specifications with different controls for long-term and seasonal trends (
