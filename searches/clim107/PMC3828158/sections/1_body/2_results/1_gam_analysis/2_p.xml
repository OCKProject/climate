 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002503-g002" class="xref">Figure 2D</xref> depicts a positive relationship between dengue incidence and the proportion of the population with access to piped water, indicating that as access to piped water rises so too does dengue. Urbanisation and GDP did not show a significant association with dengue. This may indicate that these variables do not play a key role in determining dengue transmission in Mexico or that our data, after the removal of time invariant characteristics by the province-specific fixed-effects, do not contain enough variability for estimating meaningful relationships for these variables.
