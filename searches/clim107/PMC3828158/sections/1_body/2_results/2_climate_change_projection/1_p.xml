<p class="p">Our projections suggest that mean annual dengue incidence may increase by about 12—18% by 2030, 22—31% by 2050, and 33—42% by 2080 across Mexico showing an increasing effect of climate change on dengue (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002503-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Such positive and increasing impact of climate change on dengue cases is also evident at the province level. As an illustration, we report the results obtained for the Mexican provinces of Nuevo León, Querétaro and Veracruz. These provinces not only have very different climatic regimes, but also show different levels of endemicity. Veracruz is an endemic province with very regular seasonal transmission and a warm and humid climate. Nuevo León is endemic but with periods of very low or no transmission during the dry season, and it has a semi-warm semi-dry climate. Querétaro, on the other hand, is epidemic-prone with very intermittent transmission, and a temperate semi-dry climate. Further information on the province-specific projections for the whole country can be found on 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002503.s003" class="xref">Table S2</xref>. Our projections indicate that in already endemic provinces (Nuevo León and Veracruz) we observe a very significant raise in dengue cases, (from 1.7 to about 2.4 reported cases/100,000 people in Nuevo Leon; and from 2.6 to about 4.2 reported cases/100,000 people in Veracruz annually). On the other hand, in epidemic-prone provinces (Querétaro), we do not observe a significant increase in transmission; with dengue cases remaining uncommon (from 0.04 to about 0.08 reported cases/100,000 people annually).
