 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002503-g003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows that the majority of provinces across Mexico are expected to undergo an increase in dengue transmission under future climate change. The difference in mean annual dengue incidence between the projections and the baseline scenario are likely to be greater in endemic provinces (with year-round transmission or with periods of no transmission during the dry season), and particularly stronger in southern and eastern provinces characterized by warm and humid climates. However, our projections show significant spatial heterogeneity with some north-western provinces and the north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula being likely to observe decreases in dengue incidence by 2080 presumably due to the impact of reduced precipitation on the creation of breeding sites
