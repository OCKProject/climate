<p class="p">Before presenting the results of the regression analyses, we first present the results from a factor analysis conducted on the items in the NEP scale. As shown in the Rotated Component Matrix (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), we identified four factors which we labelled 
 <italic class="italic">Eco Crisis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Human Ingenuity</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Human Rule</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Earth Limits</italic> based on the variables that loaded highly on each factor. The four factor solution had moderate total variance explained (58.6%), though a high KMO statistic (0.889). The reliability of two of the items was satisfactory, but the alphas for 
 <italic class="italic">Human Rule</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Earth Limits</italic> were slightly but not substantially below the standard acceptable level of 0.60.
