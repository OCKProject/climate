<p class="p">To further explore the relationship between religious affiliation and climate change beliefs, results are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> showing climate change beliefs for the four religious groups identified in this research. The results mostly mirror what was reported in 
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Those who identify with a Christian non-literal denomination have very similar attitudes to the sample overall. Those who are Buddhist or Atheist/Agnostic/No religion are more likely to believe: that global warming is occurring, in human causation, that there is a scientific consensus about global warming and the issue is important. They are also more likely to think that their own actions will make a difference, and that Australia should do something to reduce global warming, and to have a higher level of knowledge about climate change (as indicated by the test score). Again, those who identify with a Christian denomination with a literal view of scripture are less likely to believe: that global warming is occurring, in human causation, that there is a scientific consensus and that their own mitigation actions would be effective. They are also less likely to consider the issue to be important and that Australia should act to reduce emissions. ANOVA and Chi-square tests were also run to determine whether there were significant differences between the religious groups on these eight variables; there were in all cases (see final column of 
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>).
