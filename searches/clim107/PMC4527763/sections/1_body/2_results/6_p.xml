 <xref rid="pone.0134868.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> presents the results of three regression analyses that show the effect of religious affiliation, socio-demographics and environmental attitude, and knowledge on climate change segment membership. The 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> segment was scaled as “1” for the dependent variable and the 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segment was scaled as “6”. The Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion category was omitted and the various effects were measured relative to this group. The first model only included religious affiliation as an independent variable. In this regression, similar to the results presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, the Buddhist category was negatively signed but with an insignificant coefficient. The Christian non-literalist and Christian literalist had positively signed coefficients, indicating that members of both of these groups were less likely to be in one of the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic> segments, and more likely to be in the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segments. Furthermore, the magnitude of the coefficient for the Christian literalists was almost one, implying that Christian literalists were on average likely to be located one segment lower than Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion respondents.
