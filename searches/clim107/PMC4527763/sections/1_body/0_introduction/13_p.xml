<p class="p">Despite the research activity proceeding elsewhere, there has been little consideration in Australia of the relationships between climate change and religion [

 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] research comes closest to examining climate change and religion, but includes results only for those with no religion and those engaging in spiritual religious practices. It is important that more research on religion is conducted in Australia, because as Tjernstron and Tietenberg [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] show there is considerable difficulty in simply transferring results from one national jurisdiction to another. By comparing survey results from 26 countries, they showed that individual attitudes towards climate change affect the type of climate change policy that different countries introduce. Further, individual attitudes are shaped by how individuals react to the specific consequence of climate change, information, the openness of their society, and by attitudes toward the trustworthiness of government.
