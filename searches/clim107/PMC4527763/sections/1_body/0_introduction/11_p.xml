<p class="p">For Buddhism the relationship between environmental concern and religious affiliation is a complex one. White [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] had contrasted the dominion over nature view which he felt lay at the base of Judeo-Christian faiths with the “very nearly the mirror image” view on the human-nature relationship of Buddhism [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Harris [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] challenged this characterization by White and argued instead that the Buddhist goal of detachment includes detachment from the natural environment. The injunction in classical Buddhist texts for monks not to dig in the ground due to the possibility of injuring a worm is driven more, Harris argued, by concern to avoid spiritual pollution for the monk than it is by any inherent value for the natural environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Other writers [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] have argued that the White interpretation of Buddhist environmental principles is a modern Western creation that bears little resemblance to traditional Buddhist views.
