<p class="p">The first stage of our analysis involved identifying climate change segments. We used the same 36 questions in the questionnaire as the Maibach et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] survey. Consistent with the main analysis in the ‘six-America’s study’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], we used Latent Class Analysis to derive segments. We identified the same six segments as Maibach et al. that differ in their attitudes and behaviors towards climate change. Thus the method of segmentation is driven by respondents’ attitudes and behavior with respect to climate change. The six segments are: 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic>. The 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> segment are the most concerned about climate change, and the 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segment are the least concerned and generally do not believe that it is occurring. A comparison between the segmentation results from Maibach et al.’s [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] study and our segmentation results is presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The key result was that compared with the US, there are fewer in the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic> segments in Australia, about the same proportion in the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segments, and consequently a much higher proportion in the 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> segments. As discussed further in [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], this seemed to indicate that there was much scope to develop majority support for climate policy in Australia by focusing on these middle two groups.
