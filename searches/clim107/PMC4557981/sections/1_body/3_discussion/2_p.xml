<p class="p">Nonetheless, these models are an important first step in understanding wetland response to climate, and strongly suggest that, looking forward, climate change will significantly alter water availability for individual wetlands, which will lead to substantial future shifts in the distribution and composition of wetlands across montane landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. These hydrologic shifts imply widespread changes in the many ecological roles served by wetlands, including: habitat for plants and animals, water storage, groundwater recharge, water quality (filtration), and shifts in nutrient cycling. For wetland-reliant species like amphibians and invertebrates that are particularly sensitive to the timing of water availability in montane areas, the projected changes in wetland hydrologic response are likely to reduce habitat availability and recruitment, and cause declines or extinctions in some regions [
