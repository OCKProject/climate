<p class="p">The soil moistures in the middle and bottom soil layers were better correlated with observed wetland water levels than other water balance variables (
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). The best predictor differed among years and regions. Soil moisture in the middle soil layer was the best predictor for most of wetlands based on observed data in 1992 for Mount Rainier National Park and 2000 for Olympic National Park (
 <xref rid="pone.0136385.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). However the strength of correlations differed substantially between the 1992 Mount Rainier and 2000 Olympics datasets, with fairly strong correlations between wetland water levels and middle layer soil moisture in Mount Rainier and far weaker correlations and poor overall model performance in the Olympic sites in 2000. Overall, though, soil moisture in the bottom soil layer was the best predictor for all wetlands except the 1992 Mount Rainier and 2000 Olympics datasets, with fairly robust correlations between simulated and empirical data (
