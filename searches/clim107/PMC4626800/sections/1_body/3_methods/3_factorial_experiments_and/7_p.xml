<p class="p">The other two-way interactive effects are calculated using the same methods. To derive the main and two-way interactive effects of all six factors, we conducted 23 sets of factorial simulations (summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>): one control simulation driven by mean environmental and vegetation conditions of the 1980’s (1982–1989); six simulations where only one of the six factors is varied each time; and fifteen simulations where two of six factors were varied for each model run. The sum of all higher-order interactive effects is the difference between (
