<p class="p">All temporal trends in this study were estimated using the Kendall-Theil robust line and tested by the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test. Temporal anomalies were computed on a grid cell-by-cell basis and over the entire global domain relative to average conditions defined by the 32-year record. The null hypothesis of the trend testing is: there is no trend. The null hypothesis of the linear correlation testing is: there is no linear correlation between two variables. Statistical significance of the resulting trends was classified at α values of 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01. If a 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value is smaller than a given α, the null hypothesis is rejected at a significance level of α.
