<p class="p">We applied an updated process-based land surface ET/heat fluxes algorithm
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref> to estimate global terrestrial ET and PET at 1/12Â° spatial resolution on a daily basis from 1982 to 2013, driven by satellite observations of photosynthetic canopy cover and surface meteorology inputs (see Methods and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Section 1</xref>). We separated the primary climatic controls to ET into three independent factors: demand, supply and energy, and analyzed changes in the three factors over the 32-year period (see Methods). Demand is quantified by a calculated potential ET rate that only depends on variabilities of air temperature, air vapor pressure, and wind speed, while supply and energy are determined by precipitation and solar radiation, respectively. All the three factors are normalized between 0 and 1. Details on the definitions and calculations of these factors are described in Methods. Finally, we obtained gauge and satellite based global monthly precipitation from three independent sources and used these data with the ET and PET records produced in this study to investigate changes in the global TWA and CWD over the 32-year period.
