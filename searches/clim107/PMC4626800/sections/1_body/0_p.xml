<p class="p">Land ET plays a vital role linking global water, energy, and carbon cycles, and is controlled by environmental factors and vegetation dynamics. The terrestrial water availability (TWA), defined as precipitation (P) minus ET, strongly influences the states of global ecosystems and human well-being, while the climatic water deficit (CWD), namely P minus potential ET (PET)

Comprehensive analysis of recent changes in land ET and their attribution in the context of variable climatic and ecological control factors, and natural climate oscillations are still lacking.
