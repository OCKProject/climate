 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information Section 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S1</xref>). It also agrees reasonably well with three independent ET data sets (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information Section 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>). As a whole, the global land area shows a significant upward ET trend of 0.88 mm yr

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). The rising global ET is consistent with the upward trend seen in a data-driven global ET record from 1982 to 2008 in a previous study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> (the black line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>). The global ET record derived in the current study shows similar inter-annual variability (r = 0.75;

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.01) with the ET record in the previous study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> for the overlapping 1982–2008 period. Both the current results and ET records of the previous study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> show slowing or ceased growth rates from 1998 to 2008, which was primarily attributed to moisture limitation in the Southern Hemisphere
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. However, our extended record shows a recovered ET growth rate after 2008 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>). This suggests that the lapse in the ET growth rate from 1998 to 2008 is likely an episodic phenomenon of the Earth’s climate system. This finding is also supported by another recent study, which suggests that the ET declines from 1998 to 2008 reflect transitions to El Niño conditions and are not the consequence of a persistent reorganization of the terrestrial water cycle
