<p class="p">In 1994, the Inner Station was characterized by marked depth zonation, mainly modulated by ice action (
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">32</italic>
 </xref>). At 15 m, the bivalve 
 <italic class="italic">Laternula elliptica</italic> and the pennatulid 
 <italic class="italic">Malacobelemnon daytoni</italic> dominated the benthos. The community was more complex, diverse, and dominated by ascidians with increasing depth. At 30 m, the assemblage was characterized as “sessile suspension feeders with associated fauna, dominated by nonsponges,” in this case, the dominant filter feeders being ascidians [following the ecological classification of Antarctic benthic communities proposed by Gutt (
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">33</italic>
 </xref>)]. During this first survey, ascidians occurred at 28.4 ind m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, occupying 28.1% of cover at 30-m depth. Density of the ascidian 
 <italic class="italic">Molgula pedunculata</italic> alone was 16.5 ind m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, covering 16.5% of space. In 1998, the fauna at the Inner Station was impoverished, with ascidians rare at 20 m, densities had halved, and coverage was reduced to 9.6% at 30-m depth. 
 <italic class="italic">M. pedunculata</italic> was the most affected species with just 2.5 ind m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> and 0.5% coverage. The increase in density/percentage cover relationship indicates a decrease in the size of the individuals. In contrast, the sea pen 
 <italic class="italic">M. daytoni</italic> increased from 27.1 to 86.8 ind m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> at 20-m depth. In 2010, our third survey of these locations found further shifts: ascidians were even less abundant than in 1998, reduced by a third in density and sixfold in coverage when compared to 1994 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, sea pens increased 12-fold in density to 314.2 ind m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. Furthermore, their depth range was extended. In 1994, they were restricted to 15 to 20 m, but by 2010, they were ubiquitous between 15 and 30 m of the Inner Station, as well as deeper (25 to 30 m) at the Middle Station [that is, areas more affected by sediment input (

 </xref>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figs. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Sponges also increased in abundance in 2010 and dominated the Inner Station at 30-m depth. Space occupation by actinians and mobile fauna, such as echinoderms, nemerteans, and isopods, increased at the Inner and deeper (25 to 30 m) Middle Stations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). By 2010, the structure first detailed in 1994 had shifted to a “mixed assemblage” (
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">33</italic>
 </xref>), dominated by suspension feeders accompanied by mobile fauna, deposit feeders, scavengers, and predators (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and fig. S4). The major suspension feeders switched from being ascidians to sponges and the pennatulid 
 <italic class="italic">M. daytoni</italic>, and echinoderms, isopods, and actinians became more prevalent in the new assemblage. Similarly, in deeper waters (25 to 30 m) at the Middle Station, macroalgae (rather than ascidians) declined from dominance. Between 1998 and 2010, macroalgae were replaced by a fauna similar to that of the Inner Station dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">M. daytoni</italic>, ascidians, and sponges (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and fig. S2). This change could be indicative of an extension in the sediment plume darkening the area and thus hindering the establishment and growth of macroalgae in previously suitable areas. In contrast to the changes observed in the Inner and deeper Middle stations, composition, abundances, and benthic community structure changed neither at the Outer Station nor at the Middle station shallows (15 to 20 m) (
