<p class="p">Raw data of percentage cover obtained from photo-transects were square root–transformed to down-weigh the influence of the most dominant taxa, and then a similarity matrix was constructed using the Bray-Curtis similarity distance. Three multivariate procedures were applied on the basis of the similarity matrix. In the first term and to visualize changes in species composition and assemblage structure across stations, depths, and time, an indirect ordination analysis, nMDS, was used. Then, for testing spatial differences and temporal changes in surveyed assemblages, an ANOSIM was used. This analysis provides a test statistic 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> that varies between −1 and 1, the zero value representing the null hypothesis of no differences among a set of samples. Values between 0 and −1 are unlikely as they would indicate higher dissimilarity among replicates within a sample than with replicates from different samples. Generally, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> lies between zero and l, representing the magnitude by which samples differ (
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">41</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">42</italic>
 </xref>). Finally, to identify the taxa responsible for the overall dissimilarity between two groups of samples, the SIMPER procedure was used. Multivariate analyses were performed using the PRIMER and PAST software packages (
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">41</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">43</italic>
 </xref>).
