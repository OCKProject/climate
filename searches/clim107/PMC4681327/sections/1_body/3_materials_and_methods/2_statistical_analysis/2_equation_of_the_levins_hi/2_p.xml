<p class="p">Then, species 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic> could only colonize the fraction of space that is free, that is, the space fraction that has not already been occupied by that species 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic> or by species that are better competitors than 
 <italic class="italic">i.</italic> Each species 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic> can colonize this fraction as a function of its abundance (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <italic class="italic" xmlns="">i</italic>
 </sub>) and its own colonization efficiency. The space is never completely full because each species has its own mortality rate that is constantly enhancing space. There is also a competition term that includes the abundance that species 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic> lost as a function of its abundance (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <italic class="italic" xmlns="">i</italic>
 </sub>) and the abundance (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <italic class="italic" xmlns="">j</italic>
 </sub>) and colonization efficiency (
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <italic class="italic" xmlns="">j</italic>
 </sub>) of each better competitor species 
 <italic class="italic">j</italic>. For this particular work, a term of mortality due to sedimentation 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> was included. This mortality is a function of the species abundance (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <italic class="italic" xmlns="">i</italic>
 </sub>), its sensitivity to sedimentation (
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <italic class="italic" xmlns="">i</italic>
 </sub>), and the sedimentation rate (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>).
