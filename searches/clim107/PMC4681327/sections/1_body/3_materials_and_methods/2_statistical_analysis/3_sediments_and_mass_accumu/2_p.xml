 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb analyses were carried out for five samples obtained from a 34-cm-long sediment core (PC/P03), which was obtained in the inner Potter Cove (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Activities of radionuclides (
 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb, 
 <sup class="sup">214</sup>Pb, and 
 <sup class="sup">214</sup>Bi) were measured by γ-spectrometry (Ge-detector, GWC 2522-7500 SL, Canberra Industries Inc.) and processed with Genie 2000 3.0 (Canberra Industries Inc.). Counting statistics showed a lack of precision lower than 5% for the samples except those with very low 
 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb activity (&lt;0.08 Bq g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The accuracy of this method was tested by using a standard reference material similar in matrix composition to the sediment samples (UREM-11) and was better than 10% for all radioisotope concentrations. To take account of changing sedimentation rates with time, the age of each sediment slice and mass accumulation rates of bulk sediments (MAR
 <sub class="sub">BS</sub>) were determined according to the constant flux model of Sanchez-Cabeza and Ruiz-Fernández (
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">47</italic>
 </xref>), which is based on the constant rate of supply model of Appleby and Oldfield (
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">48</italic>
 </xref>). 
 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb excess data were calculated by the difference of the total 
 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb activity and the supported 
 <sup class="sup">210</sup>Pb flux, which is given by the average of 
 <sup class="sup">214</sup>Pb and 
 <sup class="sup">214</sup>Bi activities. Activities of radionuclides of lacking sediment samples were interpolated at 1-cm steps.
