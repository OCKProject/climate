<p class="p">In polar areas, temperature rise is often predicted to be the pervasive factor, for example, the still controversial colonization of spider crabs, which could severely affect shelf benthic communities by a top-down control that was absent in these ecosystems for millions of years (

However, in the short term, cascading effects such as ice scouring action and the increased sedimentation caused by glacier retreat seem to be influencing coastal benthos more significantly than temperature directly. Sedimentation effects on community structure or species performance have recently received attention (
