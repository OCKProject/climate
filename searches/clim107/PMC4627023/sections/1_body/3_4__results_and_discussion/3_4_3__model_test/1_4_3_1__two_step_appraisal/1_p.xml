 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] argued that a correlation coefficient greater than 0.85 indicates multicollinearity between variables. The correlation coefficients between the latent variables of the ECC model ranged from approximately 0.132 to 0.627 (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-13162-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), indicating that there were low or medium correlations between the latent variables of the ECC model. In the second step, SEM was conducted to test the ECC model. The values of the fit indices showed good model fit:
