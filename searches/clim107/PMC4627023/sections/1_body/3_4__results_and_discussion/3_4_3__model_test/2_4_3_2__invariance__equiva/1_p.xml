<p class="p">To test the stability of the ECC model, the model can be measured across specified groups. For this purpose, an invariance (equivalence) test was used. Vandenberg

 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] argued that tests for measurement invariance (the associations of observed scores with latent variables) should precede tests of structural invariance (associations of latent variables with one another). This study divided the sample by gender and tested the invariant covariance matrices across gender groups. The results showed acceptable fit (
