<p class="p">Greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be naturally released (e.g., through volcanic activity) or stored (e.g., in peat). Anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth [

 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] emphasized that the household sector is one of the major emitters of GHGs; direct energy use by households is responsible for approximately 38% of the overall CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in the U.S., which amounted to approximately 626 million metric tons of carbon in 2005. Household energy use in the U.S. alone thus accounts for approximately 8% of total global emissions and surpasses the total emissions of any other country, except China. By contrast, in OECD countries, households are responsible for 20% of total CO

 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Many governments have thus set policies that aim to reduce household energy use and GHG emissions. Despite these policymakersâ€™ efforts, household energy consumption continues to increase, and more effective energy strategies seem to be warranted to reduce household GHG emissions [
