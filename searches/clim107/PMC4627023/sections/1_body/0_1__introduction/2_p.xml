 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The majority of mitigation or adaptation strategies for climate change are directed at long-term options, such as introducing new low-carbon technologies or creating cap-and-trade regimes for emissions. Most people believe that climate change and sustainability are important problems, but too few global citizens engaged in high-GHG-emitting behaviors to halt the increasing flow of GHGs and other environmental problems [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] has argued that certain carbon-reducing behaviors are not easy to carry out; thus, humans seem to have strong intentions to avoid immediate dangers but weak intentions to avoid long-term threats, a phenomenon that Lin [
