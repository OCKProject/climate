 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub> emissions in Kaohsiung originate in the industrial sector (68%), followed by the commercial and household sectors (23%). Therefore, the Taiwanese government encouraged households to purchase energy-saving appliances and classified the energy consumption of appliances into five levels. Level one represents the most energy-efficient appliances, which typically have the highest prices. This study aimed to develop the ECC model and applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to confirm the model’s applicability in the study’s sample of Kaohsiung residents.
