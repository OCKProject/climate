<p class="p">The amount of energy consumed is determined when appliances are brought to a house. One of the critical places within which the household sector can reduce GHG emissions is in the appliance market. This study recommends that the industrial sector provide the energy consumption information of all the appliances and make a comparison list for salespeople and retailers who introduce these appliances to consumers. Households can then compare the energy consumption and cost of the appliances immediately. For example, households could determine how many years it would take for the savings from reduced energy costs to exceed the price premium of an energy-efficient appliance. Such a strategy might increase householdsâ€™ intention to purchase the most energy-efficient appliances.</p>
