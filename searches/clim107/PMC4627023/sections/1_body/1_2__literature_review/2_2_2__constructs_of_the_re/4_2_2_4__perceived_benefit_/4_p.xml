<p class="p">For example, although an incandescent light bulb and an LED light bulb emit the same luminous flux, an incandescent light bulb costs about US$1.57 in Taiwan, whereas an LED light bulb costs about US$4.72. The consumer has the perceived ability to buy both types of light bulbs. If the consumers do not have any more information, the cheap product is always purchased. However, including the BOC analysis in the same cases reveals that the annual electricity bill is approximately US$3.14 for an incandescent light bulb and US$1.50 for an LED light bulb. Thus, it is a good deal for the consumer to choose the LED light bulb over the incandescent light bulb if it will be used for more than 2 years.</p>
