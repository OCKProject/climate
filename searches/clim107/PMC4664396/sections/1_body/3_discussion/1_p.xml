 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], but the magnitude of the potential impact on biodiversity remains largely unknown [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Not all organisms respond in the same way across different spatial and temporal scales. Hence, specific information on a species’ response is required for effective conservation and management of biodiversity. Species may respond to climate change by adapting to changing environmental conditions, shifting their niche, expanding to newer areas or in the worst case scenario become extinct if unable to adapt to changing environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Niche models can be helpful in predicting species’ distribution in relation to climate change. The climate change and invasive species together can have a drastic effect not only on biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] but also on human well-being [
