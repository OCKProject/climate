<p class="p">The maximum entropy niche modeling procedure was adopted here to understand 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> distributions in India under present conditions and three climate change scenarios and to identify the areas most vulnerable to invasion under changed climate. The models show high AUC values (&gt;0.94 for both test and training data) indicating that models successfully predict species distribution with a high degree of accuracy. An earlier work by Sridhar et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] using CLIMEX model to predict 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> invasion under current climate scenario used much coarser grid (0.5Â° degrees) than the present study (30 arc seconds). This study showed that much of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, the warmer and drier regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat and some parts of North Eastern states are less vulnerable to invasion, which is also shown in our study. Apart from these states, most parts of India are highly prone to invasion [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. However, contrary to this, our study being at much finer scale emphasizes that not all parts of each state are equally vulnerable to invasion. Another study at a much smaller scale using maximum entropy modeling has predicted an increased infestation of

 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> in Kerala [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. However, our results suggest that there is no significant difference between invasion risks in Kerala under current and all three future climate change scenarios.
