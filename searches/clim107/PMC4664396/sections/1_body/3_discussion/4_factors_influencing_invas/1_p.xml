<p class="p">The results of niche modelling of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> in India show that most of the invasion risk is in the regions with high rainfall and warm climate. The regions with extreme cold and heat are less vulnerable to invasion under current as well as in future climate scenario. 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> have a broad altitudinal (1-1000m asl), precipitation (350-5000m/year) and temperature range (0째C to 45째C), but with an optimal temperature range from 22째C to 32째C [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The ideal condition for their growth and activity is a good amount of rainfall, humidity, shade and optimum temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. In our study also, in all three scenarios, temperature is the major influencing factor for distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic>. Our model has predicted annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality and temperature annual range to be the major factors determining the invasion in all scenarios reinforcing the above results [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. The highest infestation takes place with the onset of monsoon (June) and remains active throughout the rainy season and start declining gradually from mid-November [

 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Our study shows that the maximum invasion risk occurs between June and November during which India receives monsoon [

 <xref rid="pone.0143724.g003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 3b</xref>). Apart from temperature and rainfall, altitude also plays a significant role in 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> invasion. Raut and Ghose [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] reported that hilly regions of eastern and northern India above 1500m were not suitable due to low temperature. Raut [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>] reported that population of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> decreased with the increase in altitude, this is also seen in our study. Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> distributions seem to be predominantly influenced by altitude, mean temperature and precipitation.
