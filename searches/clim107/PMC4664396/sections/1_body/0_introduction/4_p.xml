 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> under present and future climate change scenarios using ecological niche modeling tools. The ecological niche models (ENM) integrate species occurrence records with climatic and other environmental variables and generate maps of species’ potential distribution [

 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. In this study, we used maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) to predict the invasion potential of the introduced invasive snail species,

 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> in India and develop a risk map of areas likely to be invaded in the future, which can be used for prioritization and effective management of this species. The specific objectives of this paper were (1) to generate a map of the potential present distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> in India, (2) to assess the impact of climate change on the potential invasion patterns and (3) to identify bioclimatic factors that contribute to invasion of 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>.
