<p class="p">The giant African snail (
 <italic class="italic">Achatina fulica</italic> Férussac, 1821: Achatinidae) is a highly invasive terrestrial snail native to East Africa. According to the global invasive species database, 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> is the second worst invasive alien species in the world. It has now invaded most parts of the world with particular impact in tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. It was introduced either accidentally along with agriculture or horticulture produce or deliberately as pets, or ornamental, medicinal or food resources [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Given the very high density of this large pest, it is likely to have a great impact on the native biodiversity and ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> has been recognized as a major agricultural and garden pest [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. It is known to consume more than 50 species of native plants, agricultural and horticultural crops, modify habitats and outcompete native snails [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The species reproduces rapidly under optimal field conditions and can reach high densities and biomass in a very short time [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,

 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> spreads the spores of pathogens of a variety of cultivated plants in the introduced range [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. It is also a vector of the rat lungworm, 
 <italic class="italic">Angiostrongylus cantonensis</italic>, which causes eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Apart from economic loss and human health issues caused by 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic>, they are also a general nuisance to people. According to Mead [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], there are reports of car accidents due to cars skidding on crushed snails on roads.
