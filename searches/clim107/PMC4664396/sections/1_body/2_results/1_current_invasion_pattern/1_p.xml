<p class="p">The MaxEnt model for 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> predicts three potential hotspots for invasion viz., western India, parts of peninsular India and eastern India. In western India, the Coast, especially in Kerala and parts of Karnataka, are most susceptible to invasion. In peninsular India, parts of southern and northwestern Karnataka, parts of eastern Tamil Nadu and coastal Andhra Pradesh have high risk of invasion under current climate scenario. In eastern India, the Tarai region, the Gangetic region of Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, the Brahmaputra river basin (in Assam), Meghalaya and Tripura have high (0.50â€“0.70 suitability scores) to very high (&gt;0.70 suitability scores) probability of invasion. The low to moderate risk region extends till Odisha, parts of Andhra Pradesh in the East Coast and the Eastern Ghats (
