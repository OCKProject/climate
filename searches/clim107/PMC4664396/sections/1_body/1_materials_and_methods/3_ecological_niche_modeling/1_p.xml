<p class="p">Maximum entropy modeling was used with the MaxEnt algorithm (version 3.3.3k) [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] for quantifying relative risk of invasion and mapping the potential geographic distribution of

 <italic class="italic">fulica</italic> in India. The selection of MaxEnt is based on following reasons: (1) it is a presence-only modeling algorithm (i.e. absence data are not required); (2) the performance is relatively better than other modeling methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]; and (3) the model is hardly influenced by small sample sizes and hence prediction will be relatively robust [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. MaxEnt estimates the probability of presence of a species based on presence records and randomly generated background points by finding the maximum entropy distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. MaxEnt uses a regularization parameter to control over-fitting and can handle both categorical and continuous variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. It uses five different features viz., linear, quadratic, product, threshold, and hinge, to constrain the geographical distribution of a species. We have used “logistic” output format in MaxEnt, which is a continuous map with an estimated probability of species’ presence between 0 and 1, which allows us to make distinctions between the suitability of different areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. All 19 bioclim layers were tested for collinearity by examining pairwise correlations between them. When a pair of variables had a Pearson’s correlation coefficient &gt;0.75, one of the two variables was removed and finally only seven variables were used for ENM.
