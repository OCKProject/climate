<p class="p">In common with other studies of inequity in climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>, we used terminology from the economics literature to define ‘free riders’ and ‘forced riders’
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>, recognising that a strict definition of these terms often applies only to situations where one agent’s use of a resource does not directly incur a cost to another agent. We define climate free riders as those countries in the ‘acute’ GHG emissions quintile and the ‘low’ vulnerability category, as they disproportionately receive benefits from climate change (via the national wellbeing generated by GHG emissions) but pay few costs in the sense they are the least vulnerable to negative climate change effects
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. Conversely, we define climate forced riders as those countries that fall within the ‘acute’ vulnerability category and the ‘low’ GHG emissions quintile, as they are the most susceptible to the negative consequences of climate change but receive the least benefits. Those countries that we define as equitable, fall in the same emissions quintile and vulnerability category (for example, low emissions quintile, low vulnerability category), as their emissions benefits are concomitant with their climate change burden.
