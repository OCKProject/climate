<p class="p">Data on GHG emissions (by countries) were exported from the World Resource Institute’s (WRI) Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>, a database of national and international GHG emissions derived from multiple sources. The CAIT data set compiles data for the six main GHG gasses (carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF
 <sub class="sub">6</sub>)) from 185 countries over the period from 1990–2012. We used the 2010 data for this study to match the CVM vulnerability data. The WRI compiled GHG data from UNFCCC reports and complemented with data from several NGO sources
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>, including emissions data from six major sectors (Land Use Change &amp; Forestry, Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture, Waste, and International Bunkers) and several subsectors. The CAIT data set reports at the national level, however we extrapolated per capita emissions results by dividing data by 2010 and 2030 population data from the World Bank
