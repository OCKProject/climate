<p class="p">AMAP concludes that some Arctic animal species, in particular marine top predators, such as toothed whale, polar bears and some bird species, experience levels of mercury in their tissues and organs that are believed to exceed thresholds for biological effects [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The Arctic marine food webs consist of seven functional groups spanning five trophic levels that include primary producers (such as ice algae or phytoplankton), grazers, predatory invertebrates, fish, predators (such as beluga whales and seals), and apex predators (such as polar bears and humans) [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. In ice algae and phytoplankton, mercury concentrations can range from a few up to hundreds of ng/g dry weight (dw), although lower concentrations have been observed in the winter season [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Many fish species and marine birds that feed in surface or subsurface waters display varying levels of methylmercury [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Estuarine and coastal fish may also display heightened concentration of methylmercury [

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Mercury concentrations of Arctic cod range from 0.05 µg/g·dw [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] to 0.37 µg/g·dw, although higher concentrations have been observed in spring under the ice in the Amundsen Gulf/Franklin Bay [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Beaufort Sea benthic species (that comprise an important part of the beluga diet) have displayed mercury levels ranging from 0.2 µg/g·dw in flounders and predator invertebrates (such as shrimps), to 0.5 µg/g·dw in sculpins [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The highest mercury concentrations in polar bear hair have been found in the northern Canadian Arctic (such as in Lancaster Sound (3.1–73 µg/g) and in the Hudson Bay (2.6–8.7 µg/g)), compared to somewhat lower levels observed in Svalbard (0.2–3.9 µg/g) [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Blood levels of total mercury (THg) in polar bears from Alaska ranges from 7 to 213 μg/L [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In harp seal from Labrador and St. Lawrence, mercury concentrations have been found to increase with age (10 and 150 µg/L for male pups and adults, respectively). Some bird species such as ivory gull and black guillemot from Canada have mercury levels in their eggs sufficiently high (1.61 and 0.75 µg/g, respectively) to raise concern about negative effects on reproductive ability [

 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. A recent study on blacklegged kittiwakes from Svalbard has suggested that high mercury concentrations could affect the ability of long- lived birds to skip breeding and thus affect their population dynamics [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-12-03579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Arctic fish muscle (especially marine species) generally displays mercury concentrations below suggested toxicity thresholds, and the guideline limits are only exceeded in a few species (e.g., 1.3 µg/g for landlocked Arctic char fish in Canada) [
