<p class="p">Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref> shows the results of a logistic regression analysis predicting the probability of the belief (strongly agree, agree) that climate change is an important issue based on demographic variables. For the predictor variable region of the country, the South was the reference region. The corresponding 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values of the indicator variables, West (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.003), Midwest (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.008), and Northeast (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.00005) denote that the effects of these variables are statistically significant. That is, if living in the Midwest, West, or Northeast, the odds of strongly agreeing or agreeing that climate change is an important issue is 2.1, 2.4, and 3.5 times that of those living in the South (the reference region), respectively – holding all other variables constant.
