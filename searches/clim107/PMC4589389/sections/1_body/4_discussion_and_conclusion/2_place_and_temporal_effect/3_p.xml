<p class="p">The New Hampshire time series was initiated to monitor possible changes in public agreement with the scientific consensus on climate change. The relative 
 <italic class="italic">lack</italic> of change was an early, unexpected discovery. As the series lengthens, however, we see evidence of upward drift. Overall, New Hampshire public acceptance of anthropogenic climate change moved up about five points, from 53% in 2010 to 58% in 2015. This small but statistically significant (
 <xref rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) drift roughly agrees with yearly nationwide results based on other survey questions [
 <xref rid="pone.0138208.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. That agreement on trends incidentally provides further encouragement for viewing the New Hampshire series as a proxy. Despite upward movement, both New Hampshire and national public opinion falls far short of the 97% consensus among climate scientists.
