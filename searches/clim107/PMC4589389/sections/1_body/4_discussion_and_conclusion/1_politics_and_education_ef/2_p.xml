<p class="p">Political identity dominates other background characteristics in predicting individual climate-change beliefs. Politics moderate effects from education, the second-strongest predictor. Agreement with the scientific consensus increases with education among Democrats and Independents (or liberals and moderates), but stays level or declines with education among Republicans (or conservatives). Similar interactions were first tested with different climate variables in 2006 GSS data [

 <xref rid="pone.0138208.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and nationwide [

 <xref rid="pone.0138208.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] surveys. Variations on this pattern include objectively-assessed science knowledge [
