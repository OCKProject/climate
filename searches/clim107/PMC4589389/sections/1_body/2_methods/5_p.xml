 <xref rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> pools data from 11 regional CERA or CAFOR surveys representing 38 different counties or occasions (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0138208.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Previous analysis found substantial county-to-county variation [
 <xref rid="pone.0138208.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], so intercept dummy variables (0,1 indicators) for counties are included among the predictors. To represent 38 counties we need one intercept and 37 dummy variables, but for readability these 38 coefficients are not listed in the table. Instead, an adjusted Wald test for all of them together confirms significant (
