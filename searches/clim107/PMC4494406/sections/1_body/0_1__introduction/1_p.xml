 <xref rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. To reduce the contribution of emissions attributable to animal agriculture, a number of mitigation strategies involving changes to farming practices have been proposed. Although this is an important and timely goal, and many of the proposed solutions seem reasonable on the surface, mitigation strategies can have complex effects on people and animals in practice. While there has been occasional mention [
