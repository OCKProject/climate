<p class="p">Some authors are calling attention to the wide application of growth promoting technologies, including β-adrenergic agonists (βAAs) and recombinant bovine somatotrophin (rbST), for their climate change mitigation potential [

 <xref rid="B109-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]. While the research to date has focused on US production systems, the call is being made in the context of meeting increasing global demand for animal protein. Zilpaterol hydorchloride and ractopamine hydrochloride are βAAs that are used as feed additives in grain rations for cattle [
 <xref rid="B110-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. βAAs are fed in a 20–40 day period prior to slaughter to improve feed efficiency and weight gain [

 <xref rid="B108-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]. However, both rbST and βAAs are cause for substantial animal welfare concern [
