 <xref rid="B120-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. Observations at slaughter plants additionally find that difficulty walking due to ractopamine may contribute to a greater incidence of non-ambulatory (or “downed”) pigs, those too weak to stand and walk on their own accord [
 <xref rid="B117-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>]. The number of studies investigating the animal welfare effects of βAAs is, thus far, small, but given the problems identified already, calls for their increased use clearly should be made more cautiously.
