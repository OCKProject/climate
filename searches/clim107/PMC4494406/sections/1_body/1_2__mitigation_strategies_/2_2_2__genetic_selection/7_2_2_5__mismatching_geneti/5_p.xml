<p class="p">While promoting highly productive genetics to address climate change will reduce GHG emissions in some ways, maintaining biodiversity and the genetic resources of locally adapted breeds will be needed to complement other climate change mitigation strategies and to ensure the animals thrive. A potential solution may be more research and genetic selection of local breeds, but only with due consideration to welfare. Cradle-to-grave analyses that include the full range of trade-offs will become increasingly necessary [
 <xref rid="B107-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. Genetic suitability for survival in less hospitable regions with more variable climates and diverse, changing feed resources is currently, and may become even more so, an essential requirement for both human and animal welfare.
