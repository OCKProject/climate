<p class="p">In Africa, resistance to trypanosomiasis is a factor that limits the geographical distribution of cattle breeds. Indigenous taurine (humpless) breeds of cattle including the N'Dama and West African Shorthorn are genetically trypanotolerant [
 <xref rid="B104-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>], but European taurine breeds have no resistance, and even Zebu cattle imported from other regions of the continent do not thrive in the humid tropics of West Africa occupied by tsetse flies, vectors of trypanosomiasis [
 <xref rid="B103-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. Clearly there are limits to importing more highly productive breeds in this large swath of the world, and such circumstances call in to question the notion of “genetic improvement”—indeed the improved breeds here would appear to be the ones that can best survive the local conditions.
