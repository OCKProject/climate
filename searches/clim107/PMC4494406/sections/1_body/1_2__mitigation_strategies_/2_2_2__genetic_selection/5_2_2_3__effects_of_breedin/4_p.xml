<p class="p">The parent generation of broiler chickens grown for meat shares the same genetics as their progeny. Like breeding sows, these broiler breeders must be feed restricted, or they will suffer from health and reproductive disorders due to weight gain. Parent birds are usually feed-restricted starting when they are as young as one week old [
 <xref rid="B87-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. In many parts of the world broiler breeders may be fed on a “skip-a-day” regimen, in which the animals are fed as infrequently as every other day—though this practice has been outlawed in several European countries [
 <xref rid="B88-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Experimental studies suggest that artificial selection for increased body weight may have altered the brain mechanism controlling satiety and appetite [
 <xref rid="B89-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>], and evidence from behavioral studies suggests that feed restriction interferes with learning [

 <xref rid="B93-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. While free-range chickens normally devote about 50% of their daily time budget to foraging [

 <xref rid="B97-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>], feed restricted parent birds can consume their daily feed allotment in as little as 15 min [
 <xref rid="B87-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Feed restriction is believed to cause undernourishment, nutritional deficiency, and abnormal behavior including increased pecking at non-feed objects, pacing, and heightened aggression [

 <xref rid="B98-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Given that target body weights for broiler breeders have changed little in the past 30 years, but broiler body weight continues to increase, the welfare of parent birds may become more serious in the future as they will be feed deprived to an even greater extent [
