 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (1993) postulated that genetic changes have altered body fat metabolism, body composition, and hormonal state, resulting in lean tissue growth that makes piglets heavier but less mature at birth compared to lines that have not been so intensely selected for production traits. This reduces piglet survival rate [
 <xref rid="B67-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], which is an intractable problem in the pork industry. Selection for leanness may have also inadvertently decreased the nutritional quality of sowsâ€™ milk [
 <xref rid="B68-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], in turn further affecting survival of the piglets.
