<p class="p">Pigsâ€™ stomachs are biologically designed for numerous, small meals throughout the day of high fiber feedstuffs [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. However, in intensive production, they have little access to roughage. Feed processing improves feed-to-gain efficiency, but it is also associated with intestinal problems. These low fiber diets can impact mucosa integrity leaving pigs prone to gastric ulcers in the pars esophageal region of the stomach [
 <xref rid="B31-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. This is a problem worldwide. Reports vary, with incidence of pigs showing distinct signs of ulceration between farming operations ranging from zero to nearly 90% [

 <xref rid="B37-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The production systems in which most pigs are kept appear to have a large impact on the incidence of these ulcers, as pigs with access to straw, sawdust, or outdoor paddocks have fewer ulcers than those confined on bare, solid or slatted concrete floors [
