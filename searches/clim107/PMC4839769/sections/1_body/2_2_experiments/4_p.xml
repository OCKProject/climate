<p class="p">In all but the 100% deforestation scenario only grid cells that contain both crops and forests are defined as eligible for deforestation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). In these simulations deforestation is performed by reducing the forest cover by a fixed amount in all eligible grid cells. The rationale is that experiments should simulate, as well as the coarse spatial scale of the model allows, land cover change resulting from an expansion in agricultural areas. In the 100% scenario, any grid cell with forests was deemed eligible for deforestation. There is no 75% deforestation simulation for the high latitudes, as the requirements for deforestation did not allow sufficient grid cells to be used to reach the required forest loss.
