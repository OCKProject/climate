<p class="p">At the start of 2010, all experiments have the same crop area distribution based on [
 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The vegetation is specified by a land cover data set [
 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. All results are compared to a control run where the crop area fraction remained fixed at the 2010 distribution. In the deforestation experiments crop area fraction is increased by different amounts in order to generate arbitrary deforestation ranging from 5% to 100% of the total forested area of the three different latitudes at 2010. The land cover change is performed in a single step at the start of 2011 by substituting trees with crops.
