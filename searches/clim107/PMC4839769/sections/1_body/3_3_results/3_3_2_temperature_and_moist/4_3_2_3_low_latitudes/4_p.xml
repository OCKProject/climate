<p class="p">While the mean local response is drying, some areas in equatorial Africa and the Amazon become wetter after deforestation. Our simulations indicate that contrary to the areas that become wetter in the mid latitudes simulations, the positive P-E anomalies in the low latitude deforested bins are caused by an increase in precipitation and not decreased ET.</p>
