<p class="p">In all scenarios, deforestation leads to mean drying over land, with the decrease in moisture driven predominately by change over deforested bins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>). Drying over deforested areas tends to be proportional to the deforestation fraction, the exception being the 100% simulation which, although drier than the control, has slightly higher P-E values than the 75% scenario.
