<p class="p">Mean global SAT anomalies, while statistically significant by year 2100 (
 <xref rid="pone.0153357.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), are small and straddle zero K. At the end of the century the general tendency is cooling in the lower deforestation fraction with slight warming in the 15% and 25% scenarios. The larger input of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into the atmosphere results in initial warming for deforestation of and above 45% (see Carbon Cycle section below). By mid-century albedo effects overcome the initial increase in greenhouse gas concentration and at the end of the simulation these scenarios exhibit very small SAT change or some cooling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). The increase in local albedo dominates the temperature response over deforested areas which remain colder than the control even during periods where higher atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> cause mean global positive SAT anomalies (
