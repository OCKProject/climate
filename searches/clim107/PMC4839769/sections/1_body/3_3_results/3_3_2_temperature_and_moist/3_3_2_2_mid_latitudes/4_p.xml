<p class="p">Mean ET and precipitation both increase over deforested areas, however in all simulations ET increases more than precipitation. Differing from the mean response, conditions are wetter in a significant number of deforested bins over Eastern Asia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>). While precipitation does increase, the positive P-E anomaly over these deforested bins is caused by a decrease in ET. The change in soil temperature over deforested areas in Eastern Asia also tends to be different from that of other areas. While the general response is warming, the temperature increase tends to be smaller and many bins in the area show cooler soil conditions after deforestation (
