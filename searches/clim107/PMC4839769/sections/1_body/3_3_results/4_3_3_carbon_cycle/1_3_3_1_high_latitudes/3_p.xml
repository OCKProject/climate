<p class="p">Atmospheric carbon closely mirrors the changes to land carbonâ€”the sum of soil and vegetation carbon. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels are higher in experiments where deforestation leads to net loss of carbon by the land reservoir and lower in simulations where the removal of trees cause an increase in land carbon stocks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" class="xref">Fig 14</xref>). Deforestation always results in an decrease in vegetation carbon and an increase in the soil carbon pool. Some of this increase takes place over non-deforested areas where, for high- mid- and low-latitude deforestation, NPP increases due to changes in climate and the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect. The net change in the land carbon pool, and consequently the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> response, is determined by the relative magnitude of these soil and vegetation carbon changes.
