<p class="p">Removal of trees shortens the roughness length and causes a reduction in outgoing sensible heat flux, a warming effect, over deforested bins. At the same time, deforested areas—due to an increase in modeled evaporation—experience increases in the outgoing latent heat flux and a decrease in shortwave absorption. The final result is a reduction in net incoming energy and soil cooling (
