It is this rapid albedo-related cooling, and the associated slow down of soil respiration, which lead to the larger retention of carbon over land in these scenarios. As the surface albedo and atmospheric CO

In the case of the high latitudes, the resultant magnitude of the changes to the energy balance that lead to the decrease in soil temperatures.
