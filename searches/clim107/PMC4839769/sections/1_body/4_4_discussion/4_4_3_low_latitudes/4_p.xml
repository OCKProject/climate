<p class="p">Satellite based studies show that that depending upon the scale of deforestation, cloud cover may not change and may even increase over disturbed areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] found that the net albedo change over the deforested regions was negligible as the increase in surface albedo was compensated by the decrease in atmospheric albedo, and suggests that cloud cover may play a major role in tropical climates.
