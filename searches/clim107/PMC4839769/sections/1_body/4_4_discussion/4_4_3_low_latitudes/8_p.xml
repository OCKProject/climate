 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Although NPP increases due to the forest-to-cropland conversion, this is not enough to overcome the changes in respiration, where consistently higher soil temperatures, as well as less drying than is observed in the mid latitudes (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012" class="xref">12</xref>), lead to a larger reduction in local soil carbon. However our 50%-100% simulations present the same response as our high and mid latitude results, where local soil carbon increases. This highlights the importance of the initial magnitude of land use change, and resultant climate change, on the soil carbon response to deforestation in the UVic ESCM. The 15%-75% simulations all have converging levels of forest loss by 2100 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>), thus the rate of change of land cover can also play a role in soil carbon retention. This further enhances the argument that the change in soil carbon arises through a multitude of pathways, which influence the influx and outflux of carbon.
