<p class="p">Low latitude deforestation has been associated with a decrease in modelled total land carbon [
 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], and the same occurs in all of our simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" class="xref">Fig 14</xref>). The same authors [
 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] also see a reduction in soil carbon in the deforested areas, and increases in the non-deforested areas, which is observed in our 5%-45% scenarios, but is in disagreement with our 50%-100% experiments where we record an increase in soil carbon in all locations, regardless of land cover change. Soil temperatures were larger in the low latitudes, and conditions were wetter than the mid latitudes. It is likely this difference in climate that causes the larger reduction in local soil carbon, in the 5%-45% scenarios than the mid latitude cases. During the simulations the 5%-25% scenarios become wetter, relative to their initial drying following deforestation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g012" class="xref">Fig 12</xref>). This change in behaviour, as well as warmer soil temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g011" class="xref">Fig 11</xref>), can account for the increased respiration relative to carbon drawdown, and hence the decreased local soil carbon in these experiments.
