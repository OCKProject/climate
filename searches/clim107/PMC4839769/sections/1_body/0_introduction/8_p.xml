<p class="p">Here we use a global climate model of intermediate complexity, with a coupled carbon cycle model, to determine to what degree the scale of deforestation may influence the climate systemâ€™s response to high, mid and low latitude deforestation. This is done by a series of experiments, where deforestation fractions range from 5%-100% of the tree covered area over these distinct latitude bands. The simulations are conducted from 2011 to 2100 with CO
