<p class="p">Most modelling studies so far have analyzed the response to large-scale land cover change. In some, deforestation was global or performed over whole latitude bands [

 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In general terms, these past simulations show that the temperature response of high latitude deforestation is still dominated by the albedo effect, resulting in a cooler climate. That is, while deforestation causes atmospheric CO

 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Global temperature changes associated with mid latitude deforestation follow the same trend as for the high latitudes but with temperature changes of smaller magnitude [
 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Contrary to the cooling seen in the mid and high latitudes, simulated low latitude deforestation yields a warmer climate, with the increase in temperature attributed to the reduction in ET, and increased atmospheric CO

 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Some studies have noted that a reduction in cloud cover, and hence, reduced atmospheric albedo over deforested regions was an important contributor to the modelled warming [
 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. There have been indications from satellite based observations [

According to these studies, in many high latitude and mid latitude areas deforestation would result not in cooling but in net warming or no significant change as the CO
