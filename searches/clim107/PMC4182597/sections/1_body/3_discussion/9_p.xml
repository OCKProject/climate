<p class="p">The next requirement is accurate models linking climate change to hydrologic responses, so we could accurately determine changes in hydrology, amount of sea level rise, the degree to which plant communities will change in response to climate change, in both inland and coastal regions,. Accurate models that allow these predictions do not exist 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Vano1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[117]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-He1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[121]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-OGorman1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[123]</xref>. Even if we had accurately developed models, we also would need accurate assessments of species' ranges as well as niche–based models for each species we want to evaluate that accurately predicts, with a very high level of variability in distribution explained, the distribution of species, cf. 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Reed2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[106]</xref>. We do not yet have these, e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Pearson1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[124]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Essl1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[127]</xref>, and it is not clear to what extent or rate different bird might respond behaviorally to climate change 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Devictor1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[128]</xref>. Finally, we need models that accurately depict community–wide biotic responses to climate change, including accurate anticipation of inter–specific interactions, how local species invasions and extinctions will affect resource availability, how they might change as niches shift 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Smith1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[129]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Brantley1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[133]</xref>. We do not have these either, and we might be unlikely to accurately anticipate shifting realized niches for a variety of practical reasons 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Williams1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[134]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Veloz1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[136]</xref>. These challenges are exacerbated by migration because the relationships must be known in breeding, non–breeding, and migration habitats 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Knudsen1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[137]</xref>. These relationships we just described are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108899-g003" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. Even the highly restrictive requirements we just presented might ultimately be insufficient, because they do not take into account human responses to climate change. For example, what will be the human responses in changes to agricultural practices, relocation away from coastal areas, and so–called adaptive response measures, e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Olesen1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[138]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[140]</xref>, and how will they affect the capacity for ecosystems and shorebirds to respond?
