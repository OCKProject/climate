<p class="p">Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are also likely, but the aggregate effects on tundra hydrology are difficult to predict 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[48]</xref>. Drier overall conditions may be likely, and may reduce food availability during the breeding season 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[48]</xref>. It is unclear how climate change will affect the water balance on tundra breeding habitats due to the complex interaction of several factors, including amounts and timing of precipitation events, timing and extent of spring thaw, depth of the active layer, and erosion events

 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Woo1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[53]</xref>. While annual rainfall is predicted to increase throughout the breeding range, evapotranspiration is also expected to increase enough to more than offset the effect of increased precipitation 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[36]</xref>. The result may be a loss of some wetland breeding habitat to dryer conditions, but this is unclear. Confidence = medium.
