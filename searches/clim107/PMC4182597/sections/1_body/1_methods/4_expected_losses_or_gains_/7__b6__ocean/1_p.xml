 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Milligan1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[82]</xref>. One hypothesis is that ocean acidification could reduce the fitness of many plankton species by reducing calcification and other physiological processes

 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[84]</xref>. If ocean acidification does negatively impact marine plankton food resources, the decrease could be offset, however, by increased ocean upwelling which could function to increase food resources
