We then summarized, based on current understanding reported in the literature, the effects climatic change should have on habitats used by our focal shorebirds in the western hemisphere. What follows is our assessment of these changes (designated B1–B5), and brief statements about our confidence in these changes. These approximate confidence levels of &gt;70%, 30–70%, and &lt;30% are modified from the 5–category scale developed by 
 <xref rid="pone.0108899-Moss1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[38]</xref> for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report. We reduced the number of categories because we did not think the implied precision of 5 levels of confidence was defensible.
