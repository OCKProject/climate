<p class="p">Each risk factor was assessed for each species using information from the literature regarding the natural history of the species and anticipated changes due to climate change. A summary of each species' risk level associated with climate change for each risk factor narrative, as well as confidence scores can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108899.s001" class="xref">Appendices S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108899.s002" class="xref">S2</xref>. For each risk factor, for each species, we also included a subjective confidence score (1 = low to 5 = high confidence). We recognize that a species might have increased extinction risk due to climate change, but it might not increase enough to change risk categories.
