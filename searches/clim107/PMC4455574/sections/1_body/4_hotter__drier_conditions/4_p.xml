<p class="p">“This [danger] is particularly important in monsoon regions in places like India, where there is a distinct wet season—four months long—and then a long dry season,” Trenberth says. Large amounts of air pollutants can build up during the long dry season, and the air pollution itself prevents the sun from penetrating through to the surface, he explains. That shuts down evaporation, and when moisture doesn’t get into the atmosphere, air pollutants don’t rain out as they do in a normal cycle.</p>
