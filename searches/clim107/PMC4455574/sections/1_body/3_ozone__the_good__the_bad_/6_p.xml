<p class="p">Cities can have lower levels of O
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3</sub> than one might expect, based on the amount of precursors produced by urban sources. Interaction with traffic-related NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> emissions transforms a portion of urban O
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3</sub> to O
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>, the most stable form of oxygen. Furthermore, once a stagnation event ends and winds resume, large concentrations of urban O
