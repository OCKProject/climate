<p class="p">Cities can have lower levels of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> than one might expect, based on the amount of precursors produced by urban sources. Interaction with traffic-related NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions transforms a portion of urban O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> to O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, the most stable form of oxygen. Furthermore, once a stagnation event ends and winds resume, large concentrations of urban O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and precursor pollutants can be transported into surrounding rural areas hundreds of miles downwind. O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentrations therefore tend to peak downwind of major cities, not in them.
