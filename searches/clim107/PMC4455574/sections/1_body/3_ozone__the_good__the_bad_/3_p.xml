 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is created by chemical reactions between ultraviolet radiation and precursor air pollutants, including oxides of nitrogen (NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>), carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These precursors come from anthropogenic sources such as automobile emissions, gasoline vapors, and power plants. They also come from natural sources, including vegetation (in the case of VOCs) and lightning (in the case of NO
