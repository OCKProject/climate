Scenario RCP2.6 is representative of mitigation policy aiming to limit the increase of global mean temperature to 2Â°C. Scenario RCP8.5 does not include any mitigation target [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. We used two independent global circulation models (MIROC5 and CCSM4) suitable for the study area to predict the changes. To obtain a straightforward view of the species distribution in the future, we also averaged all predicted trends for scenarios, models and time periods (2050 and 2070).
