Thus, it is suspected that climate change will influence the extent and suitability of this wintering ground for birds, but no information is available on the potential strength and spatial distribution of changes. These changes have potential conservation implications because can affect the survival or the subsequent reproductive success of migratory birds and thus their populations trends [
