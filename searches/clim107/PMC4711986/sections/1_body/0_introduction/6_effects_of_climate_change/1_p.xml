<p class="p">Finally, we use the validated distribution models to forecast the suitability of wintering grounds according to climate projections. The effect of climate change on breeding bird distribution has already been studied in the western Mediterranean [

 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], but little is known about the way climate change will affect winter bird ranges. It has been predicted, for instance, that warming will improve the suitability of colder sectors, such as mountain and highlands [

 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and the concomitant suitability of present wintering grounds for some species [

 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Thus, climate changes will likely be affected by latitudinal and altitudinal gradients producing a patchy distribution of the future climate trends. This study attempts to map the location and extent of these changes in climate suitability of the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb for the two study species.
