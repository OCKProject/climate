 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. In the case of migratory birds, distribution results from large-scale geographical and climate processes affecting the historical configuration of migratory routes [
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] and the local arrangement of individuals according to their particular habitat preferences [
