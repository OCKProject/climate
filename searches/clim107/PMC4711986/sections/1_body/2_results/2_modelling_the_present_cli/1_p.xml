<p class="p">Winter temperatures and precipitations were the most important variables in modelling the occurrence probabilities of the meadow pipit and the chiffchaff with Maxent (
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). In the two species, the most suitable areas were located on coastlines and in lowlands of the study region (
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.g004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). The occupancy and abundance distribution of the two species fitted well to the distribution of low, medium and high climate suitability sectors resulting from ring recovery occurrences (
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). As predicted, the main difference between the all habitat vs. suitable habitats approaches was related to increased occupancy and abundance scores in suitable habitats. This supports the ability of occurrence probabilities provided by Maxent to predict the distribution of pipits and chiffchaffs in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb.
