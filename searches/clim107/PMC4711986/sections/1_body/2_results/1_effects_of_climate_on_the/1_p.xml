<p class="p">A negative binomial distribution for the count model and a logistic regression for the binomial model was the best zero hurdle model for the two species (
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The meadow pipit occurred more frequently in warm and rainy areas covered by grasses with low woodland cover, and the chiffchaff was more frequent in southern, warm sites covered by woodlands. The best count model was a zero altered negative binomial regression with log link (
 <xref rid="pone.0146958.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). According to this model, the meadow pipit was more abundant in northern, rainy sites covered by grasses and the chiffchaff in warm sites covered by grasses. The two methodological approaches support an effect of climate variables on the species distribution, with more frequent and abundant meadow pipits in warm and rainy sectors and more frequent and abundant chiffchaffs in warmer areas.
