<p class="p">According to predictions for the period 2050–2070, winter mean temperature will increase (mean ± SE, 1950–2000: 7.47 ± 0.16°C; 2050–2070: 9.28 ± 0.16°C; repeated measures ANOVA F

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1,492</sub> = 518.22, P&lt;0.001) and winter precipitation seasonality (48.34 ± 0.82 mm,42.73±0.64 mm; F

These trends will be followed by a predicted increase in winter mean climate suitability for the meadow pipit (mean ± SE, 1950–2000: 0.28 ± 0.01; 2050–2070: 0.33 ± 0.01; repeated measures ANOVA F
