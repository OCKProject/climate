 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. Recent research also demonstrates that this same asymmetric cooling effect occurred following the injection of sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere following large volcanic eruptions over the last 100 years (based on instrumental data)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref> and 500 years (based on stalagmite rainfall proxy data)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. These studies collectively demonstrate that over the last few centuries NH aerosols (volcanogenic and anthropogenic) forced the ITCZ to the south by cooling the NH relative to the SH, and that SH eruptions forced northward ITCZ migration. The atmospheric and temperature response associated with the Toba eruption is therefore consistent with the recently detected climate response to more recent (but far smaller) NH eruptions. We suggest that the Toba eruption initiated southward ITCZ migration by inducing a NH-SH temperature asymmetry, which resulted in more SAM rainfall but reduced rainfall in the NH low latitudes (e.g., the EASM), consistent with speleothem-based evidence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), and identical to the response to NH eruptions over the last 500 years. A southward displaced ITCZ would have shifted Hadley circulation cells to the south, compressing the SH Polar Cell, forcing the SH Polar Front southward, and resulting in locally warmer Antarctic temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>). The opposite response would have occurred in the NH, where atmospheric reorganisation would have resulted in extreme and sudden cooling in Greenland and extension of NH glacial and sea ice, characteristics associated with the abrupt transition between DO-20 and Greenland Stadial (GS) 20 occurring at that time. We propose that the positive feedbacks following NH eruptions (e.g., NH sea ice expansion, NH continental glacier expansion, increased NH albedo, and AMOC weakening) prolonged the climatic response to the Toba eruption by several hundred years, not dissimilar to recent results suggesting that Little Ice Age cooling was initiated by NH volcanism in the 13
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> Century but was sustained over hundreds of years by a positive feedback involving sea ice and oceanic circulation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. The timing of the Toba supereruption is consistent with the abrupt cooling into GS20, although this seems superimposed on a cooling trend that began ~100 years earlier, potentially linked to decreasing insolation. However, the Toba eruption is nearly indistinguishable from the inception of Antarctic warming (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">2</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>). We suggest that large NH eruptions that occurred during interstadials abruptly ended Greenland interstadial conditions and promoted a rapid transition to stadial conditions, which were favoured during much of the Last Glacial because of low atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and insolation conditions. Conversely, large NH eruptions that occurred during already cold conditions resulted in less Greenland cooling but led to glacier extension and Heinrich Events. This is supported by the established association of the 39.280 ± 0.110 ka BP Campanian Ignimbrite supereruption of the Campi Flegrei supervolcano with GS9 and Heinrich Event 4 (HE4)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. We also note that the inception of HE5a at ~53 ka BP is indistinguishable from the timing of the magnitude (M) 7 Ischia eruption (53 ± 3.3 ka BP). Additionally, all eight very large (M ≥ 7; Tambora-sized or larger) Pleistocene NH eruptions (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref> for selection criteria used) are within error of a NH cooling event (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>), and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that this relationship is significant at the 95% confidence level (
