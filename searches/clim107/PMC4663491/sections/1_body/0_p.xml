<p class="p">Millennial scale climate change is one of the most characteristic and yet enigmatic features of recent glacial intervals. From 30 to 80 ka BP, glacial baseline conditions were interrupted by 21 abrupt climate change events, termed Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, associated with warm interstadial conditions in Greenland but colder conditions in Antarctica. The apparent temperature shifts were locally dramatic; for example, DO Event 8 (DO-8) occurred 38.17 ka BP, and was characterised by 11.8 °C Greenland warming

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Any explanation for DO events must therefore account for both the rapidity and magnitude of the observed temperature change. Similarly, any cause must also explain the apparent hemispheric asymmetry characteristic of DO events; Greenland warming was associated with Antarctic cooling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>, a phenomenon known as the ‘bipolar see-saw’
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. The hemispheric asymmetry is not restricted to high latitudes. Increasing speleothem-based evidence indicates that DO events were associated with substantial atmospheric reorganisation at low latitudes, with a strengthening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) system

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref> in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and a weakening of the South American Monsoon (SAM) and the Australasian Monsoon (AM) in the Southern Hemisphere (SH)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. Explanations for the asymmetric hemispheric response to DO events often invoke Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) shifts possibly induced by meltwater pulses

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>, but this interpretation is not universally accepted, and other proposed explanations include solar forcing
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>, internal ocean-atmosphere oscillations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, and volcanism
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Because the substantial climate shifts associated with DO event initiation can seemingly occur on human timescales, identifying the underlying cause of such abrupt climate change and considering these forcings in a modern context is critical.
