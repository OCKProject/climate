<p class="p">This hypothesis not only clarifies the mechanisms that forced abrupt millennial scale climate change during glacial conditions, but also helps predict future change. Large, explosive eruptions may indeed lead to low latitude drought in the hemisphere of the eruption, but our model suggests additional consequences that merit further consideration. For example, an extremely large NH eruption might cause nearly global cooling, but may result in localised SH high latitude warming by forcing the SH Polar Front to the south. A sufficiently large atmospheric disruption could initiate or accelerate the destabilisation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Paradoxically, very large eruptions could therefore not only cause substantial mean global cooling, but also high latitude warming (in the hemisphere opposite the eruption), ice sheet collapse, and catastrophic sea level rise.</p>
