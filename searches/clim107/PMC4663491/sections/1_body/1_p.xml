 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>), volcanological, and speleothem-based evidence to argue that DO events were triggered by asymmetrical hemispheric cooling caused by explosive SH volcanic eruptions. Conversely, we argue that very large NH eruptions forced abrupt Greenland cooling events and, under the right conditions, were associated with large ice rafting events (Heinrich Stadials). This perspective is consistent with recent results suggesting that ice rafting events were a consequence of, but did not trigger, NH cooling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. Large explosive volcanic eruptions are conventionally thought to result in global cooling for several years following the eruption, based on the concept that stratospheric volcanogenic sulphate aerosols reflect solar radiation and cool the planet essentially uniformly. Large low latitude eruptions are therefore often considered the most climatologically significant because low latitudes receive a disproportionately high amount of insolation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>, although in-depth studies highlight considerable complexities in the climate response to eruptions based on ejecta volume, sulphate content, explosivity, and latitude

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>). However, global cooling does not seem to have occurred following several large, well-documented Pleistocene eruptions. For example, the Toba supereruption at ~74 ka BP is followed by lower NGRIP δ

The apparent absence of ‘volcanic winter’ in response to the largest eruption of the Quaternary is enigmatic when considered from the conventional perspective. Similarly puzzling is the apparent strengthening of the SAM and AM and concomitant weakening of the EASM coinciding with the Toba eruption (
