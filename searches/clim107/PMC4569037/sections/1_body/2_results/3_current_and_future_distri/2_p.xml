<p class="p">In all sectors, germination ground maps (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">2</xref>) indicate that the common reed has probably not yet invaded all sites favorable to its establishment by seed. For example, in the Boucherville Islands, for the 1980–2009 period, 648 ha of wetlands having suitable conditions for the germination and survival of common reed seedlings was not yet invaded. In the other sectors and for the same period, surface areas not yet invaded totaled 1270 ha in Lake St. Louis, 1068 ha in Contrecœur Islands, and 13,118 ha in Lake St. Pierre, respectively. In other words, even though 29% (262 ha invaded out of a possible 910 ha) of suitable areas were already invaded in the Boucherville Islands, this proportion was much lower in Lake St. Louis (4%), the Contrecœur Islands (9%), and Lake St. Pierre (1%).
