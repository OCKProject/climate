<p class="p">The method used for modeling the distribution of germination grounds of the common reed under future climate conditions also resulted in a loss of accuracy. For most years (86%), results produced with the COMP hydrologic series were less accurate than those from the MEAS series, all of which were obtained using quarter-monthly time steps. Differences between the COMP and MEAS series ranged from 3% to 35% for a given year; COMP values for total area of wetlands suitable for common reed germination and seedling survival were in almost all cases below MEAS values.</p>
