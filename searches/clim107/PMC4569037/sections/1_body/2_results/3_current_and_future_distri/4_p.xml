<p class="p">For the St. Lawrence River section between Lake St. Louis and Lake St. Pierre, hydrologic and temperature changes, associated with the two selected climate change scenarios, increased the surface area for the establishment of the common reed in wetlands (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" class="xref">2</xref>). Under climate conditions associated with the WAWE (wetter) and WADR (drier) scenarios, germination grounds covered 23% more surface area than those modeled with the COMP (reference) data (1961–1989). The difference was particularly high in Lake St. Louis (up to 50% increase) and in the Contrecœur Islands (up to 41%). There was little difference between the results of the WAWE scenario and those of the WADR scenario, except in Lake St. Louis, where the WADR scenario predicted greater surface areas. Under climate change conditions, sites conducive to common reed seed germination and seedling survival were found on a much larger portion of the floodplain and extended further from the bank toward the centre of the river (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">3</xref>). In Lake St. Louis, new sites were present in the lake centre. In Lake St. Pierre, the formation of new common reed stands, extending from the lake banks to its centre, was especially notable.
