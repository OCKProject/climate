<p class="p">Whereas the negative effects of a common reed invasion on native flora are tangible and well documented (Keller 
 <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Meyerson et al. 
 <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Lavoie et al. 
 <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>), its impacts on fish and wildlife are not as clear. Although faunal assemblages in brackishwater marshes are significantly affected by the presence of the common reed (Dibble et al. 
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), freshwater fish (Larochelle et al. 
 <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), amphibian (Mazerolle et al. 
 <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), and bird assemblages (Meyer et al. 
 <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Gagnon Lupien et al. 
 <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) do not appear to be strongly disturbed by the invader. It is nevertheless possible that the number and extent of common reed populations in freshwater marshes have not yet reached a threshold beyond which adverse effects on biodiversity become more important (Gagnon Lupien et al. 
 <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). This hypothesis remains to be tested, but a model predicting the distribution of the common reed under climate change scenarios would be extremely useful for evaluating the risk to wetland biodiversity.
