<p class="p">The impact of climate change on the spread of the common reed was assessed for the St. Lawrence River wetlands, in a section of the river 150 km long (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">1</xref>), from Lake St. Louis (45°19′N; 73°56′W) to Lake St. Pierre (46°16′N; 72°38′W). The St. Lawrence River flow is fed by the Great Lakes and Ottawa River watersheds, which drain an area of 917,000 km

However, the Moses-Saunders Dam (Cornwall, Ontario) regulates the flow to minimize extreme fluctuations in water level, both along the Great Lakes and the river. Spring floods normally increase water flow in Lake St. Pierre to 13,000 m

In the other sectors (Lake St. Louis, Boucherville Islands, Contrecœur Islands), wetlands cover smaller areas and are mainly found near islands. Overall, wetlands of the St. Lawrence River are made up by high marshes (55% of the total surface area), low marshes (26%), and swamps (19%; Létourneau and Jean
