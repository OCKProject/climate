<p class="p">Each climate change scenario was associated with monthly temperature differences, also known as monthly deltas, between current values and those of the 2040–2069 period. From the overall number of climate models developed for small-scale gridding (approximately 400-km

 <xref rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>), a unique monthly value was applied to the entire study area. Daily temperature data recorded at Dorval-Trudeau (1961–1989) were used as reference. The monthly temperature deltas were then applied to each quarter-monthly time step of the series measured at Dorval-Trudeau for the entire period studied. The monthly differences applied to the reference temperature data for scenario HadCM3 A1FI were, on average, 4°C, and ranged from 3.2°C (May) to 5.2°C (August). For scenario CGCM2 A21, the average monthly temperature difference was 3.0°C and ranged from 1.0°C (December) to 5.9°C (January). The beginning and the end of the common reed germination and seedling growth period, determined using mean daily temperature values, were recalculated for each climate change scenario based on the adjusted temperature data available in a quarter-monthly time step format.
