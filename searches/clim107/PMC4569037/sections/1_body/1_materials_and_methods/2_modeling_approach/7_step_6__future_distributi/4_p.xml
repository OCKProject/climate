<p class="p">A total of four hydrologic series were used in this study. The first two series were (1) the historically measured (MEAS) series, corresponding to the data observed between 1961 and 1989 (Morin and Bouchard

 <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>); and (2) the comparison (COMP) series, developed using the same method as for the climate change series, but taking into account previous climate data (1961â€“1989; Croley 
 <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Fagherazzi et al. 
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Morin et al. 
 <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The COMP series was used to compare results with or without climate change, thereby identifying any biases associated with this comparison method. If the models were perfect, the COMP series would provide the same results as the MEAS series. The next two series, used for future climate conditions; were (3) the warm and wet (WAWE) series, associated with climate scenario HadCM3 A1FI; and (4) the warm and dry (WADR) series, associated with scenario CGCM2 A21. The MEAS and COMP series were roughly similar, but to fully understand the impact of climate change on hydrology, it was important to compare both climate change scenarios to the COMP series and not the MEAS series. Finally, to determine the impacts of climate change on wetlands, the model was initiated with reference conditions from 1960. Changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of the various classes of wetlands were determined by the hydrologic conditions associated with each hydrologic series (see Turgeon et al.
