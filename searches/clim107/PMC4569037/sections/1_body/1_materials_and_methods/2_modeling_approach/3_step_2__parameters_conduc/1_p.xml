<p class="p">One of the challenges in modeling common reed establishment in a natural environment resides in the fact that it is extremely difficult to determine the exact moment of seed germination, because there is always a lag of a few years between seed germination and the formation of a reed stand (of about 5 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) that can be detected on aerial photographs or satellite images. It was thus impossible to characterize conditions conducive to seed germination and seedling establishment based on historical data. As a result, the model could only be developed using a deductive approach (Ottaviani et al. 
 <xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) and was essentially based on the most current knowledge regarding the biology of the common reed.
