<p class="p">Bare, wet (not flooded) soils are necessary for a new common reed stand to develop from a seed (Galinato and van der Valk

 <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>; Hudon et al. 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Such exposure conditions are present along the St. Lawrence River during summer-long episodes of low water levels or in areas with anthropogenic disturbance (Hudon 
 <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Hudon et al. 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). These nonflooded conditions must be present at the beginning of the growing season. Seedlings need at least 120 days of growth; otherwise, they are not able to accumulate sufficient reserves, which will hamper their survival the following year, particularly during spring floods and frosts (Haslam 
 <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1971</xref>; Weisner and Ekstam 
 <xref rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>; Ekstam and Forseby 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Furthermore, common reed seed germination occurs at a mean daily air temperature of ≥10°C (Haslam 
 <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1972</xref>; Ekstam and Forseby 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>) and a daily temperature range of ≥10°C (Ekstam and Forseby 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). However, very early germination is not necessarily beneficial because seedling risk exposure to late spring frosts (Weisner and Ekstam 
 <xref rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>). We thus considered that germination and subsequent seedling growth periods could not start until the first day of the year when mean daily temperatures reached 10°C (and were not followed by temperatures below 0°C) until the first autumn frost.
