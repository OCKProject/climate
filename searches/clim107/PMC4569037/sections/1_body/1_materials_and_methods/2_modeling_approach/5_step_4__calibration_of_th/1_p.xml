<p class="p">The invasion stage, which reflects the proportion of invaded to invadable areas, directly impacts the ability of a model to predict areas vulnerable to invasion (Václavík and Meentemeyer 
 <xref rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). If the invasion is advanced, one can presume that the species occupies most of the sites that foster its establishment; it is then easy to establish a correlation between site conditions and their likelihood of being invaded. It is much more difficult to establish such a correlation if the invasion is still in the early stages: the invader absence at a given site does not necessarily correspond to unfavorable local conditions. Thus, the accuracy of the parameters associated with common reed germination and seedling survival was verified in the Boucherville Islands, that is, in the sector of the river containing one of the oldest populations of the plant, the greatest surface area of common reed stands, and a well-documented invasion history. To do so, the common reed distribution, as simulated by IERM, was compared to the real distribution (see step 1). The simulated distribution was generated from 1980 (beginning of the common reed invasion in this sector) to 2009 and took into account the historical environmental data integrated into IERM. Given that satellite images were taken during the 2010 growing season, the period used for modeling ended in 2009.
