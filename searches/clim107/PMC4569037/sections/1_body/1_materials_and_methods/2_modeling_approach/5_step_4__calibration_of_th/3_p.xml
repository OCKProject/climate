<p class="p">Given that the common reed invasion in the Boucherville Islands is relatively recent and still ongoing, we hypothesized that the polygons identified as false positives, while having a high germination potential, had not yet been invaded either as a result of insufficient time or the random dispersal of seeds. It was also possible that stand size within a false-positive polygon was simply too small to be detected via satellite imagery. To confirm this hypothesis, 213 of the 317 false-positive polygons (randomly selected) in the Boucherville Islands sector were visited between October 1 and 5, 2012. Each polygon was verified by an observer on foot. Searching continued until either common reed was found or the entire polygon had been covered. If common reed stems were found, their origin (from seed – not connected by rhizomes or stolons to adjacent stands – or from vegetative propagation) was noted.</p>
