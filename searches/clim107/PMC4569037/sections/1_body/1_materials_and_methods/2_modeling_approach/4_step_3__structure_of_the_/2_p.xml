<p class="p">The location of a common reed stand did not necessarily correspond to the exact location of a node of the IERM grid. The IERM node network was therefore transformed into a square polygon grid with surface areas varying from 0.04 to 2.56 ha, depending on the distance between nodes in the original grid. The information associated with the central node of each polygon was then applied to the entire polygon. The presence of at least one common reed stand in a polygon was enough to consider this polygon as conducive to the establishment of the invader. The spatially explicit information layers used in this study were topography, water level, and wetland class. Air temperature data, available at only one station, were extracted from the historical series measured at the Montréal Airport (Dorval-Trudeau; Environment Canada, 
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). This series is the longest (1953–2012) and most complete available in the study area. These values were also used as references for the entire area (Morin et al. 
 <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Temperature data were thus not spatially distributed: they were associated with each node (polygon), but were the same for all the nodes of the modeling domain. The other data, measured or simulated for each node (polygon) of the grid, were extracted from the models developed by Morin et al. (
