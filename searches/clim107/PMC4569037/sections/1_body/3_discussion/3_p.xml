<p class="p">Testing various combinations of parameters during the development of the model showed that a low water level at the beginning of the growing season is the best environmental predictor for the establishment of a new common reed stand through sexual reproduction. Including the type of wetland as additional parameter helped to improve the model performance, but this factor had much less influence than water level. Temperature has a definite impact on the duration of the growth season, but the interannual variability of areas with the potential for germination of the common reed seed (data not shown) was essentially tributary to variations in the river water level. Several studies showed that common reed seed germination occurs only in the presence of an exposed wetland substrate (Weisner and Ekstam
