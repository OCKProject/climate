<p class="p">The common reed is not very abundant in the wetlands of the St. Lawrence River wetlands, but our model suggests that current climate conditions are already suitable for a considerable expansion of the species through sexual reproduction. Climate changes expected over the next 50 years may also exacerbate common reed expansion, particularly if combined with a water level drop, which will expose large bare areas suitable for seed germination. This expansion may be particularly noticeable in Lake St. Pierre, where existing common reed stands could increase their surface areas by a factor of 100, potentially creating the most extensive complex of reedbeds in North America, with over 13,000–16,000 ha. By comparison, the Delaware Bay is believed to currently have the largest reedbed complex in North America, covering a total of 2770 ha (Balletto et al.

However, it is unlikely that all the common reed germination grounds predicted by the model will ultimately be invaded, because other invasive plants could also take advantage of low water levels to expand their populations, especially the reed canary grass and the flowering rush (

 <xref rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). In the long term, however, even highly invasive species such as the reed canary grass will be outcompeted by the common reed (Březinová and Vymazal
