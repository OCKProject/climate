<p class="p">Citizen science, the practice of nonscientists collecting information for investigations in an organized manner that yields data to test hypotheses, represents a key method to link science education and environmental education (

 <xref rid="b54-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>). Additionally, it may create a foundation for enhancing the engagement of citizens of all ages with the sciences by allowing them to participate actively rather than passively in science. The expansion of inquiry-based education to encourage curiosity also has led to the rise of publishable research based on well-crafted testable hypotheses, with students participating in the faculty memberâ€™s research project (

Citizen-science projects in evolution have shown success in allowing ordinary citizens to help test important hypotheses, a notable example being the large-scale Evolution MegaLab project, which spanned 15 countries and involved over 6,000 participants (

 <xref rid="b16-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>) have multiplied the ways popular technologies can be integrated into citizen-science research. Mobile devices and social media may be useful tools for encouraging participation. However, regardless of these advances and expanding projects, the results of such research are not often accepted as traditionally publishable data in the peer review process, but instead as education or outreach only (
 <xref rid="b7-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). New interest from scientific and educational research perspectives must be utilized to validate the data generated and develop an appreciation for the scientific process.
