<p class="p">Among the topics perceived as controversial in the biological sciences, perhaps the most commonly discussed is evolution (

Teaching climate change content in a biology classroom is complicated by many factors, some of which are present also when teaching evolution. Biology instructors and researchers regularly encounter the interconnected nature of the environment and organisms; contemporary discussions of climate change therefore should be enriched by fundamental concepts such as evolution and extinction.
