Herein, we acknowledge the nature of the debate being limited to “controversial” in the public eye, which classifies it as a socioscientific debate, not a scientific one (
   <xref rid="b57-jmbe-17-107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>). The major distinction between climate change and evolution is the nature of the sides—evolution is disagreeable with certain religious groups and climate change finds opposition primarily in the political arena.

On a larger scale, climate change and its implications require an even greater diversity of knowledge of many fields to understand the vast effects, even outside of the traditional science disciplines, with far-reaching implications into our everyday lives (

   <italic class="italic">There is debate, disagreement, and uncertainty between opposing sides.</italic> Primarily, we encounter the “sides” of this debate in the media and political arenas. In both situations, the press plays a key role in influencing public opinion to perpetuate these debates. Although outside of our primary focus, legislature and politics often complicate the interactions of civics and education. For example, several states (Louisiana, South Dakota, and Tennessee) have legislature-mandated laws concerning the teaching of climate change, including aspects such as teaching it as a controversy (
