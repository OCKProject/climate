<p class="p">Using the principles of citizen science, students of all ages can be involved in research. Although ecology, evolution, and climate change are vastly interconnected, such studies have yet to show a strong presence in the science education literature. Searches of popular academic literature sites, for example Web of Science and ERIC Social Sciences database, with Boolean key words “citizen science AND education AND climate change” reveal approximately 50 or fewer total results, most of which relate to developing a productive or knowledgeable citizenry, instead of a citizen-science research project. The limited results show a large unexplored niche in educational research for the integration of citizen science in the curriculum and subsequent studies for efficacy or validation. In the case of climate change, this integration would be possible across many disciplines, especially with established topics of socioscientific controversy.</p>
