<p class="p">Findings from both the field and laboratory experiments revealed a strong relationship between elevated water temperature during the summer months and 
 <italic class="italic">P. lividus</italic> mortality. In both years, survival rate in the field cages decreased with the seasonal SST rise during the summer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, maximum temperature 30.5 °C in 2011, and 31.11 °C in 2012), and stopped almost entirely when SST dropped during the autumn (seen in the 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> experimental period only). In the first experiment, survival rate was reduced to 50% by the end of August 2011, before restocking. In the second year, the survival rate reduced to 78% by the end of July 2012 (after temperature crossed the 30.5 °C threshold and just before the termination of the experiment—prior to peak summer water temperatures).
