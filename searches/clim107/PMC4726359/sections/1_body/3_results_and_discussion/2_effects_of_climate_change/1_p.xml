 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, maize yield of the 1980s variety for the entire CMB decreased by an average of 8% due to climate change from the 1980s to the 2000s for both irrigated maize (from 9.5–8.7 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and rainfed maize (from 8.9–8.2 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) ((grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*1980s’ climates - grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*2000s’ climates)/grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*1980s’ climates) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). This decrease was greater than the 3.8% decrease in global maize yield attributed to climate over the same period
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Simulated yields with varieties used in the 1980s decreased by 10–11% in the NCP but by only 5–8% in the cold-temperate maize systems in the NE. For tropical and sub-tropical maize in SW China, grain yield has decreased 4% since the 1980s. The only area without negative effects of climate change (1980s vs. 2000s) was Heilongjiang Province (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>), which is located in northernmost region of China where the baseline temperature in the 1980s was not above the optimum for maximum grain yield
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. For all regions, the scenarios analysis for irrigated maize showed the attribution of maximum and minimum temperature for yield decrease from the 1980s to the 2000s was similar (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). For NCP, the 4% yield decrease for irrigated maize from the 1980s to the 2000s was attributed to the decrease in solar radiation.
