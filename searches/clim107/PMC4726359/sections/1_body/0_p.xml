<p class="p">To meet the needs of the global population, which is expected to peak at 8.5–10 billion in 2050, grain production must increase by at least 50% and perhaps by as much as 110% relative to production in 2006

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Maize is one of the world’s most important cereals, and its production must roughly double to meet the growing demand for food, biofuel, and livestock feed, especially in developing countries
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. Achieving these increases, however, will be difficult because of water scarcity, which is already a critical problem in many parts of the world and is expected to become more severe in the future
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. While maize is widely cultivated from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere, and from arid and semi-arid to humid and semi-humid areas
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>, water scarcity will increasingly constrain maize production. In addition, climate change will likely affect water supply and water demand, heightening this problem in the future
