<p class="p">In light of the lack of progress in instituting climate change and environmental policy in most countries, an important focus for social identity researchers should be on policy acceptance and providing communicators with the tools to convince people of the need for environmental protection policy. From a social identity approach perspective, lack of policy acceptance reflects that environmental goals are not normative in many groups and this may arise in part because of intergroup conflicts that create divisions rather than bridges between groups. An important challenge for social identity researchers is to identify frames that can appeal to decision-makers and unite disparate groups who conflict over environmental issues. For example, what is the best way to frame climate change policy that will elicit positive responses from political conservatives and liberals alike? Researchers have begun to recognize the importance of finding frames that appeal to differing values and ideologies, for example, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Feygina et al. (2010)</xref> showed that conservatives were more likely to endorse environmental protection when it was framed as protecting the American way of life and 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bain et al. (2012)</xref> demonstrated that framing climate change responses as making society a better place or as stimulating development increased climate change skepticsâ€™ environmental citizenship intentions relative to a frame that focused simply on environmental protection. Focusing on frames that appeal to decision-makers and elites may be particularly important given their power to appeal to the broader group. At present there is little research to provide evidence for what works and what does not.
