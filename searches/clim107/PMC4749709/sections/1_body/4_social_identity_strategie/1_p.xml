<p class="p">If we accept that the social identity approach offers a helpful theoretical lens through which to examine environmental attitudes and behavior, then it should also be able to offer solutions to address environmental problems and conflicts. We provide some social-identity based strategies below and a summary can be found in 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>.
 </bold> They are not exhaustive but are instead meant to provide a starting point that can stimulate future research to empirically test and further refine social identity approaches relating to the environment. Although some of these strategies have been discussed previously (see e.g., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reynolds et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ferguson et al., in press</xref>), we see a benefit in presenting the range of strategies that emerge as the logical outcome of our social identity analysis of environmental attitudes and behavior.
