<p class="p">One of the most prominent theoretical lenses applied to understanding climate change beliefs is cultural cognition theory, which adapts the theorizing of 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Douglas and Wildavsky (1982)</xref> on cultural influences and risk perceptions. The theory of cultural cognition (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kahan et al., 2010</xref>) draws on Douglas’s grid/group taxonomy – 
 <italic class="italic">individualistic-communitarian</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">hierarchical-egalitarian –</italic> and argues that these cultural orientations shape people’s appraisal of risk, evidence, and scientific consensus. For example, people who subscribe to relatively individualistic and hierarchical values favor self-reliance, competition and free market solutions. In contrast, people who subscribe to relatively communitarian and egalitarian values are concerned with social injustice, are suspicious of authority (including industry) and are committed to cooperation. Hence, those high on individualism and hierarchy are more inclined to value industry, downplay its risk to the environment and oppose regulation. Research guided by this theoretical framework has shown empirical evidence of the influence of these cultural values. For example, judgments of expertise were influenced by the extent to which that expert’s position aligned with participants’ cultural values in relation to climate change, nuclear waste, and gun laws (

Specifically, when an expert presented climate change as a high risk, egalitarian communitarian participants were much more likely to agree that they were an expert than hierarchical individualist participants and vice versa, when the expert presented climate change as a low risk (see also 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Price et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, a meta-analysis shows that ratings of hierarchicalism and individualism share robust and medium-sized relationships with people’s skepticism that anthropogenic climate change is real (
