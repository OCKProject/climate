<p class="p">The effectiveness of health systems strategies and policies are likely to change as the climate continues to change and as development choices affect vulnerability and the ability to cope with the health risks of climate variability and change. Therefore, strategies and policies should be designed and implemented within an adaptive management framework.

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref> This includes regularly evaluating whether policies and programs continue to be effective or whether adjustments are needed. Adaptive management also calls for explicit exploration of different approaches to achieve objectives (eg, reducing vulnerability to particular health outcomes), testing alternatives to determine which are more effective, and then using the lessons learned to update knowledge and make modifications to policies and programs. This exploration is helpful when choosing which programs to scale out to wider geographic regions.
