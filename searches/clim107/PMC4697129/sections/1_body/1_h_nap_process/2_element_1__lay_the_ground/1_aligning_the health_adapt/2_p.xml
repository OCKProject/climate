<p class="p">The coordination between the Thailand Ministry of Health and the national adaptation planning led by the National Climate Change Committee is an example of this process. Furthermore, such coordination is critical to facilitate access to adaptation funds established by international donors and development partners to prepare for and manage the risks of climate variability and change. Health is underrepresented in these funds. A review of the inclusion of health within NAPAs concluded that 39 of 41 (95%) NAPAs identified health as a priority sector negatively affected by climate change, and 30 of 41 (73%) countries listed health interventions among their priority adaptation needs and proposed actions.

Having health represented in the overall national adaptation planning process could facilitate access to urgently needed adaptation funds to address current and projected health risks of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 2014 that climate change has already contributed to levels of ill health and that major changes are projected across all emission pathways.
