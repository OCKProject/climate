<p class="p">Although monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of adaptation options are well established in health systems, current approaches were not designed for issues such as climate change where, for example, the magnitude of the “exposure” to weather and climate events cannot be reduced until at least mid-century; where local socioeconomic and environmental conditions are key determinants of the magnitude and pattern of risks; and where upstream drivers mainly arise from sectors outside health. Monitoring and evaluation frameworks also need to be adjusted to describe explicit baselines against which the effectiveness of adaptation options can be measured over time and to inform future modification of adaptation options. Baseline variables include those describing the patterns of vulnerability, patterns of weather and climate variables important for health, the effectiveness of current health systems interventions, and the capacity of health systems to manage the health risks of climate variability and change. Low- and middle-income countries are developing baselines as they implement adaptation projects (cf
