 </xref> The goal of conducting an H-NAP is to strengthen health systems to protect health from climate variability and change; this includes addressing upstream drivers of health risks. The determinants of a climate-sensitive health outcome interact with development patterns and other factors to create baseline vulnerability to climate change. Future vulnerability will be partially determined by the effectiveness of policies and programs to prepare for, respond to, and recover from the consequences of changing weather patterns. That is, the success of development policies in a particular location will depend to some degree on climate change, and the magnitude and pattern of climate variability and change will depend on development policies.
