<p class="p">All actors in health systems, from research scientists to ministries of health staff to health care providers, are responsible for understanding, engaging in, and supporting the health component of a national adaptation plan. Most H-NAP elements and steps will be familiar; understanding and managing risks are at the core of health systems. However, climate variability and change bring new dimensions that will require training and capacity building to mainstream climate change concerns into health system strategies, policies, and programs and into research and development. Focusing on strengthening health protection systems for climate-sensitive health outcomes is important, including increasing access to vaccination, safe water, and improved sanitation. But that is only the start. Risks will evolve with climate and development, requiring proactive planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation if health systems are to be prepared to reduce risks to the fullest extent possible.</p>
