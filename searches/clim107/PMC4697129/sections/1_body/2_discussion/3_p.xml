<p class="p">The health risks of climate variability and change are already unacceptable, with the burden projected to increase as the climate continues to change. Proactive and efficient adaptation can reduce health burdens over coming decades but cannot eliminate all risks.

 </xref> Mitigation is equally as important as adaptation; rapid and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required to reduce risks past mid-century. But even with substantial reductions and with significant investments in adaptation, climate-sensitive health risks in excess of what countries will be able to manage will be aÂ feature of coming decades. Conducting an H-NAP is the best opportunity for preparing for very different socioeconomic and environmental conditions that will likely challenge the ability of health systems to maintain and improve population health.
