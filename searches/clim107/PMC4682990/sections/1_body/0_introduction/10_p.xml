<p class="p">Deriving the full benefits of coupling mesocosm experiments with theory and real-world observations to better predict and mitigate the worst effects of climate change on biodiversity will require an immediate movement away from short-sighted funding strategies. This is because ecological responses to climate change can take multiple generations to be expressed [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002323.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Furthermore, there needs to a be a more unified approach to the use of mesocosms in climate change research, whereby investigators and funding bodies alike see the benefit of simultaneously replicating experiments across different systems, to establish the generality of results and theory [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002323.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Doing this will avoid extrapolating from isolated, uncoordinated, and contingent case studies [
 <xref rid="pbio.1002323.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Lastly, predictions of biodiversity loss from climate change will be improved by adopting a wider range of future climate change scenarios in mesocosm experiments. Future scenarios should include changes in the frequency, duration, and magnitude of extreme events, as well as gradual shifts in average conditions.
