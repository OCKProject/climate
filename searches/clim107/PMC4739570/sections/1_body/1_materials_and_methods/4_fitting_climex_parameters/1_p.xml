 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic>. For a full description of the model parameters see Sutherst and Maywald (
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>). A manual iterative procedure is used in CLIMEX to fit parameters. During this procedure, parameters are adjusted and the model is run (Kriticos et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). A visual comparison between the various indices and the species distribution data is undertaken. This procedure is repeated until a satisfactory level of agreement between the model results and the distribution data is obtained with higher EI values coinciding with areas of recorded distribution (Shabani et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The derivation of the parameter values are discussed below. CLIMEX utilizes meteorological data that represents long‐term monthly averages, not daily values. Thus, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between parameter values that were derived using the model and directly observed instantaneous values (Kriticos et al.
