<p class="p">The minimum amount of thermal accumulation necessary to complete one generation depends on the length of the growing season which is calculated from the PDD and DV0 parameters. PDD is the number of degree‐days of thermal accumulation above DV0 required by a species to complete one generation (Kriticos et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). The plant cannot reproduce if this amount of heat is not available. A threshold parameter for PDD of 2900 degree‐days above DV0 (15°C) was fitted to the native African distribution as this value just allowed the persistence of this species at its limits of distribution in Southern Africa.
