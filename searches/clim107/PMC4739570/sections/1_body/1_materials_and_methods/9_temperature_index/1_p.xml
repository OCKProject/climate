 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> distribution is restricted to warm tropical regions (Paynter et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Using the Wet Tropical species template as a starting point, the minimum (DV0) and maximum (DV3) threshold temperatures were set at 15 and 33°C, respectively. The lower (DV1) and upper (DV2) optimal temperatures were set at 18 and 30°C, respectively, based on the response of similar tropical vines. These provided a good fit to the observed global distribution (Taylor et al.
