<p class="p">In parts of the Pacific region, 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> is considered a troublesome weed, capable of smothering trees up to 20 m tall (GBIF, 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). It commonly occurs in plantations and forest clearings where it often suppresses other important vegetation and regeneration of native species (Bacon

 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Many local and academic experts consider it to be a serious threat to the native ecosystems of the Pacific islands (Meyer 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Furthermore, a weed risk assessment undertaken for this species for Australia and Hawaii resulted in a rating of “high risk” indicating that 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> posed a high risk of becoming a serious pest (PIER, 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). It has also been suggested as a serious weed for which biological control should be explored in this region (Dovey et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). However, any uncertainty associated with the status of a species needs to be resolved through investigations into its genetics (Dodd and Hayes 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Paynter et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Biological control should not be suggested for management of any species within its native range because their regulating natural enemies are already present and they may have expanded their range due to other factors such as overgrazing (Pemberton
