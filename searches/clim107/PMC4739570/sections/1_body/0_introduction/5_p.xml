In Samoa, it also appeared to play an important role in rainforest regeneration and attempts to control it could promote other invasive species (Kirkham

 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> behaved differently depending on whether it occurred in the forest canopy or as ground cover. It was found to suppress species diversity when acting as ground cover and also aided the spread of other invasive vines such as 
 <italic class="italic">Mikania micrantha</italic>; however, it seemed to support species diversity when occurring in the forest canopy. The dominance of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> is driven by fluctuating patterns of disturbance on the landscape, both anthropogenic and natural. The anthropogenic disturbance has been mainly caused by changes in land‐use due to increase in agriculture, while disturbances caused by tropical cyclones also have an effect on the dominance of
