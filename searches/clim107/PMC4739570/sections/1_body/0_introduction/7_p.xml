<p class="p">To this end, CLIMEX, a popular species distribution modeling software for undertaking risk assessments for weeds (Chejara et al.

 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic>. A range of information, such as experimental observations of its growth response to temperature and soil moisture, current distribution, and seasonal phenology, were used in model development. This model was then used to examine its potential current distribution and future distribution under climate change on some of the main archipelagos in the South Pacific. Despite rapid advances in the development of gridded data sets for global climate normals (Hijmans et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Mitchell and Jones 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), these datasets are still inappropriate for very small islands because they are unlikely to reflect the variations in climate that can occur over small distances on mountainous islands (Taylor and Kumar 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013a</xref>). Hence, results are only presented for the following archipelagos: Fiji, Hawaii, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.
