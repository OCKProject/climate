<p class="p">The gridded climate datasets used in this study have a coarse resolution and may not reflect the climatic variation that can occur over small distances on the mountainous islands in the Pacific region. However, in the absence of finer resolution data sets, this study has utilized the best available data to perform the climate change modeling.</p>
