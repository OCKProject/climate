<p class="p">The two GCMs are consistent in their projections of changes in potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> under future climate for Fiji, Hawaii and Vanuatu while some differences can be seen in the projections for the other four countries. In general the MIROC‐H projections indicate that larger areas will remain climatically suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> in the future compared to CSIRO‐Mk3.0. The MIROC‐H GCM predicts a temperature increase of approximately 4.31°C, while the CSIRO‐Mk3.0 GCM predicts an increase of 2.11°C by 2100 (Kriticos et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Their predictions for changes in precipitation levels also differ with CSIRO‐Mk3.0 predicting a 14% decrease in future mean annual rainfall while MIROC‐H predicts a 1% decrease (Chiew et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> is restricted by low rainfall (Paynter et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) and so the larger decreases in rainfall predicted by CSIRO‐Mk3.0 would lead to reduced climatic suitability in the future under this GCM.
