<p class="p">It is worthwhile to note that the relative sensitivity of HFM in eight cities among the twelve effective cities was smaller compared to that in the surrounding rural counties. There was also a similar phenomenon in the effect of absolute humidity change on HFM. The incidence of HFM in eleven cities of the sixteen effective cities were less sensitive than that in the nearby rural counties to the change of absolute humidity. It is evident that better medical conditions in cities 
 <italic class="italic">versus</italic> rural counties can reduce sensitivity of climate change to some extent.
