<p class="p">By comparing the 
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> calculated from the disease incidence and precipitation in the exposure and non-exposure groups, the relative sensitivity indicator showed that precipitation change has direct or indirect effects on the sensitivities of dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid fever and schistosomiasis in more than 50% of the effective counties in Anhui Province. For the diseases of HFM, malaria, influenza, meningitis, and hemorrhagic fever, most effective counties (67%â€“80%) had not witnessed the impact of precipitation change on disease epidemics in Anhui Province.
