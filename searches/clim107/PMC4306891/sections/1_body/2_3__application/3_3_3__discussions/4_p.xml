<p class="p">Although the impacts of climate change on infectious diseases are detected worldwide, the forms and degree of impacts differ greatly. Because of the complex interactions process between climate variables and infectious diseases’ components (pathogen, host and transmission environment) for the specific diseases [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], the impacts are different at different geographic scales for different infectious diseases, and sometimes controversial [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Moreover, the incidence of infectious disease is tied to many other factors besides climate, such as the location of the respective countries and socio-economical situations, pollution, and healthcare conditions [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. In this study, we also found that the Relative Sensitivity of infectious diseases to climate change in Anhui province is different in space. For example, dysentery and HFM are more sensitive to climate change in rural areas than that in urban areas. Taking HFM for example, it is a childhood disease caused by human enteroviruses, particularly coxsackie viruses and human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Different thermal effects on HEV71 rely on the local sensitivity of temperature and humidity, or resistant serotype [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Warmer and moister environment was helpful to prolong the viability of HEV71 and the transmission of HFM [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. At the same time, lower temperature could decrease the gathering activity and cross infection between children, thus interrupting the disease transmission. Many researchers measured the correlation between climate variables and HFM and reported a 1.4% to 36% increase of disease incidence per 1 °C increment of temperature [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] and a 0.5% to 4.7% increase for every 1% increase in relative humidity [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. On the other hand, some non-climatic determinants could impact the transmission of HFM, such as the child population density, good hygiene practices, and disease surveillance systems [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Importantly, there was an obvious difference of these non-climatic determinants in Anhui province, for example, the expenditure on food and health care was much higher in urban areas than that in rural areas [
