<p class="p">To our knowledge, this is the first study on identifying the sensitivity of the incidence of many infectious diseases to climate change in an area based on a statistical indicator. There are three main strengths of the Relative Sensitivity indicator for screening climate-change sensitive diseases. First, it could reduce the influence of seasonality and inter-annual trends in the data to some extent. It is well noticed that the original data, especially the climatic data, has notable seasonality and inter-annual trends (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00767-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>a). Thus, the existing methods (e.g., correlation analysis) always require essential data pre-processing to avoid these influences. However, when calculating Relative Sensitivity, the exposure and non-exposure groups were defined according to the difference of the climate variable between the month of interest and the historical mean value of that month, which could considerably reduce the impact of seasonality and trend. Second, Relative Sensitivity is a comprehensive indicator with a statistical basis for screening climate-change sensitive diseases,

As mentioned before, one of the limitations for the correlation analysis methods is that they require a relatively long and continuous time series dataset for a reliable result. Therefore, the unavailability and discontinuity of long-term epidemic data seriously limit their applications. On the contrary, Relative Sensitivity could work well, even if the time series is relatively short and discontinuous in the temporal domain. Specifically, Relative Sensitivity only needs more than five data points in each group for the linear regression model, although we acknowledge that more data points could improve the reliability of relative sensitivity to some extent.
