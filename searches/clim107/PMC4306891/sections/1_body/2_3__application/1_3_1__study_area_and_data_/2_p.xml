<p class="p">Both the infectious diseases data and climate data at the county level were collected. Monthly cases of thirteen infectious diseases at the county level from 2004 to 2010 in Anhui Province were collected from an Internet-based infectious disease reporting system coordinated by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). The system provides a standardized platform for data collection throughout the entire nation, and ensures data quality and reliability much better than before. In Anhui Province, the infectious diseases include: dysentery, hand, foot and mouth disease (HFM), hepatitis A, hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, malaria, meningitis, influenza, schistosomiasis, Japanese encephalitis, avian influenza, leptospirosis and cholera. Months without reported incidences of a disease were excluded. The monthly incidence of each disease was calculated by dividing monthly cases through the corresponding population for each county except for HFM. For this illness, we divided the monthly cases by the number of children younger than 9 years old (0, 9) because of the special population that suffers from this disease [
