<p class="p">In order to screen the infectious diseases which are sensitive to climate change, we defined a new statistical indicator, Relative Sensitivity (RS), based on the relative risk statistic, to identify differences in the sensitivities of the infectious disease to climate variables at two different climate statuses (
 <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, historical climate and present climate). In detail, the group with the larger difference between two climate statuses is regarded as the exposure group, and the group with the smaller difference is defined as the non-exposure group. Thus, larger differences in the sensitivities of the two groups (
 <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, exposure and non-exposure groups) for an infectious disease indicate that the infectious disease is more sensitive to the change in the climate variables. The flowchart of the calculation of 
 <italic class="italic">RS</italic> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00767-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, and a detailed introduction is given below. Here, it is noted that weather variables (
 <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, temperature and precipitation) have a direct influence on the epidemiology of infectious diseases, while climate change influences the epidemiology of infectious diseases through weather variables indirectly. In most literature, weather variables are also called climatic variables. Accordingly, we used climate variables or climatic variables instead of weather variables and have assumed that local weather variations can approximately reflect the average status of climate change.
