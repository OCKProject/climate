<p class="p">Climate change is likely to affect mental health in many ways. Droughts, floods, rising sea level, increasing ambient temperatures and other consequences of climate change can produce increasing psychological distress through many mediators. These mediators include economic strain, migration and acculturation stress, lowering social capital, and traumatic events among others. Efforts to increase access to mental health services and attempts to mitigate the climate change with time would be appropriate responses to deal with the challenge of climate change in the time to come.</p>
