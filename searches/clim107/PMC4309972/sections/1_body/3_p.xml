<p class="p">In this analysis, we combine the set of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, based on consistent radiative forcing levels
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>, and the set of Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) scenarios, based on the best estimates of the current emissions and further mitigation potential
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. The comparison between RCPs and SRES is useful to determine the mitigation potentials or pressures of China's development and make the reasonable N management measures.
