<p class="p">Anthropogenic interventions of the global biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle have substantially raised the levels of reactive N [Nr, in general, including organic N, ammonium (NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-N in water and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> in air), nitrogen oxides (NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>), nitrous oxide (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O), and nitrite &amp; nitrate] in circulation, and caused severe damage to the environment at local, regional and global scales
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Such dramatic increases can aggravate the impacts on the balance of climate forces in many ways, either through changes to the atmospheric constituents, or through feedbacks within the terrestrial ecosystem
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. The atmospheric N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emission directly contributes to global warming and ozone depletion; NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> compounds indirectly produce the short-lived climate-forcing agents (e.g. ozone, aerosol particles) and remove the long-lived climate-forcing agents (e.g. methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>)); NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> also increases the formation of aerosols. In addition, the deposited and applied N into the terrestrial ecosystem alters the carbon (C) exchange and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes between land and air
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. There are many cooling and warming interactions between N and the climate; the dominant effect of N on climate change is likely to vary across regions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. For an equivalent increase in the human population, the emission mass of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-C into the environment is about 40 times that of Nr
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Although the absolute climate impact of Nr is dwarfed by the impact of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions, the variety of Nr species and sources, and the complexity of climate forcers, indicates a need to better assess the integrated effects of Nr and to identify the key forcers at different scales, so as to take targeted measures for N management. A few studies have attempted to assess the combined impacts of Nr at global and regional scales
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. The lack of systemic study of Nr on climate at the national level has also been noted by Pinder 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>, taking the United States as a case study. China is becoming the largest producer of Nr from both agricultural and industrial activities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. The climate effects of Nr emissions in China are global rather than regional. The magnitude and acceleration of Nr creation in China warrants an integrated assessment of the significance of anthropogenic Nr on climate change.
