<p class="p">The realistic trajectory of NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> reflects a compilation of environmental policies and economic activities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> emissions in many industrialized countries are expected to decrease
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. For example, the NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> reductions in Europe in 2010 can be partly attributed to the global economic recession, and partly to the European NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> emission controls
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. Due to rapid economic development and the coal-dominated energy consumption structure, however, large increases in NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> from China have persisted over the past several decades
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>. According to our results, the ozone-CH
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub> effect of NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> emissions in China is the largest cooling agency at a short time horizon, but is nearly negligible at a longer time horizon. The ozone-CH
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub> effect varies greatly across different regions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. Investigations have shown that the ozone-CH
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub> effect is more sensitive to ozone precursor changes from tropical regions (e.g. East Asia) than from mid-latitude and high-latitude regions (e.g. Europe and North America)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. Therefore, control strategies that reduce emissions of ozone precursors in China have a significant impact on the net climate forces from ozone and CH
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub>. However, if only considering NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> alone, NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> emissions exert a negative force from decreased CH
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub>, which far exceeds the smaller positive force from increased ozone, resulting in a net cooling effect. The scenario of NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> emissions reduction alone lead to a positive force and a net warming effect from overwhelming increased CH
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub>, and as a result fails to produce mitigation potential for climate warming. Combined reductions in NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> and other ozone precursor emissions (such as CO) are beneficial, because they can produce a net cooling effect through the stronger negative force from decreased ozone
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. Hence, in order to obtain co-benefits from reducing radiative forces and mitigating air pollution, simultaneous emission reductions of various ozone precursors at the regional scale are feasible. In addition, the indirect radiative force on climate change by ozone effects on plant production has proved to contribute more to global warming than the direct radiative force of elevated ozone levels
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. The effect of NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> on plants is the secondary contributor to climate warming at both timescales. In China, the combined climate effects of current NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> emissions on ozone-CH
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub>, aerosol and the ozone-induced C sink were estimated at −336 ± 290 and 98 ± 97 Tg CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e on a GTP
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">20</sub> and a GTP
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">100</sub> basis, respectively. From the results of our scenario analysis, the NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> reduction has a secondary mitigation potential. Therefore, reduction of NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> in China can provide the co-benefits of climate-change mitigation and air pollution reduction in the long run. In especial, the NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> emission reduction still exist a large mitigation pressure when comparing with the RCP scenarios. China should confirm the implementation of total NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> quantity control required by taking policy measures. Meanwhile, continued push to improve the denitration level is an essential measure for mitigating NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> pollution.
