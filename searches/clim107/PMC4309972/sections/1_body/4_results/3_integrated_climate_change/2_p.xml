<p class="p">The relative contributions of agriculture and industry sectors are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>. The overall impact of industrial Nr is cooling (−287 ± 306 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e) on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">20</sub> basis but converts to warming (136 ± 107 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e) on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> basis. The reason is that the cooling effects are largely from the short-lived agency, i.e., NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions from fuel combustion. The effect of agriculture Nr is dominated by the long-lived effect of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions. As a result, agriculture shows a net warming effect and a minor difference at two timescales, at 187 ± 108 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">20</sub> basis and 186 ± 56 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> basis, respectively. The climate effects of Nr from agricultural and industrial sources cancel each other out on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">20</sub> basis, but together contribute to warming effect on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> basis.
