<p class="p">The inputs of Nr into the terrestrial ecosystem are in the forms of N deposition and N fertilization. N addition into ecosystems can alter the physiology of soil microbes and vegetation, and concomitantly alter the balance of biogenic fluxes of GHGs
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. Our literature analysis results provide an explicit spatial map of N deposition over China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). N deposition sums to 15.1 Tg N/yr across China, with 3.56, 5.28, 5.68 and 0.57 Tg N deposited into cropland, forest, grassland and wetland, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b–e</xref>). The estimated N deposition is closed to the published inventories of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> emissions used in our study. Without considering the response of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions mentioned above, N addition can stimulate terrestrial CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> assimilation in both natural vegetation and agricultural land; meanwhile, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions caused by N simulation to some extent offset the benefit of N-induced CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> uptake in terms of climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. These opposed impacts of Nr enrichment differ markedly depending on the land cover type

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission/uptake factors for different ecosystem types of China are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S6</xref>. Our results show that in China forest land has the largest potential for CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> uptake (−27 to −5 kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-C/kg N), while cropland has the largest potential for CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions (0.01 to 0.03 kg CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-C/kg N). Applying the flux factors of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> uptake and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission by ecosystem types in China from 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S6</xref> to estimate the net C exchange (NCE) due to N deposition, the overall result indicates that the uptake of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-C (27 to 176 Tg C) overwhelmingly surpasses the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-C emissions (0.11 to 0.21 Tg C), resulting in an NCE of 27 to 176 Tg in terrestrial ecosystems during 2000–2005 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S6</xref>). Most regions in China's terrestrial system function as a net C sink; only a minor area in western China is an N-induced C source (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3f</xref>). Our results further show that, during 2000–2005, forest land has the largest C sequestration potential, with 31.9 to 136 Tg C as a result of N deposition, followed by grassland (4.5 to 45 Tg N) and cropland (1.8 to 5.6 Tg N). For fertilized cropland, in addition to N deposition, applied N, including chemical and organic fertilizers, was evaluated at 35.7 Tg in 2005
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>, resulting in a net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> uptake of 14 to 58 Tg C and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions of 0.40 to 1.06 Tg C. The NCE of croplands due to N fertilization amounts to 13.6 to 57.0 Tg C.
