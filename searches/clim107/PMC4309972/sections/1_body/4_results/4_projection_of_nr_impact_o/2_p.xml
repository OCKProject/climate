<p class="p">The detailed comparisons between SRES and RCP scenarios are showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>. All RCP scenarios on a GTP
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">20</sub> basis show a net warming effect, in contrary to our improvement scenario. However, the advantage of our improvement scenario diminishes with time. On a GTP
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">100</sub> basis, its warming effect in 2020 (379.4 Tg CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e) nearly approaches that of the lowest RCP scenario (RCP2.6, 356.4 Tg CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e), or even in 2050 (613.6 Tg CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e) surpasses that of the highest RCP scenario (RCP8.5, 499.6 Tg CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e). The warming effect of our abatement scenario on a GTP
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">20</sub> basis is lower than that of the RCP8.5 in 2020 and 2050. However, on a GTP
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">100</sub> basis, its warming effect in 2020 (452.3 Tg CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e) and in 2050 (646.1 Tg CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e) become higher than that of RCP8.5 (423.5 and 499.6 Tg CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e in 2020 and 2050, respectively). The comparison results between SRES and RCP indicate that, (i) our reported SRES scenarios reveal the obvious mitigation potential on climate change but only on a short timescale not on a long timescale. (ii) the objectives of our scenarios in 2020 (i.e. realizing the total quantity control for NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> and improving the N use efficiency with 20%) is well-targeted to the concentration levels of RCP. However, the objectives in 2050 are too cautious to meet the emission under the RCP scenarios. More aggressive target should be made for the year of 2050.
