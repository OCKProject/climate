<p class="p">Under the SRES I-Business as Usual (BAU) scenario, we assume that Nr emissions and Nr addition will keep the current annual rates of increase. In 2020 and 2050, Nr in China will produce a cooling effect at −314 and −725 Tg CO

The results indicate that the increase of Nr compounds without any measures will mitigate the climate change on a 20-y basis however aggravate the warming effect on a 100-y basis. On a 100-y basis, the cooling effect of N-induced C sequestration declines significantly, from 86.0 Tg CO

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e in 2020, then approaches zero in 2050. By contrast, the impact of Nr emissions on climate change becomes more important, increasing from 408 Tg CO

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e in 2050. The SRES II-improvement scenario is built on the assumption that the N use efficiency of cropland will increase by 20% in 2020 and another 20% in 2050. Compared to the BAU scenario, on a GTP
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">20</sub> basis, the improvement scenario enhances the net cooling effect with 41% and 38% for the years of 2020 and 2050, largely due to the agricultural N

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> removal rate in 2050, respectively. On a GTP
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">20</sub> basis, the abatement scenario reduces the net cooling effect by 95% and 139% compared to the BAU scenario, ultimately appearing as a net warming effect in 2050. The reduction in NO

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>O reduction) is the most timely and effective measure for the mitigation of the climate impact of Nr in China. On a GTP
