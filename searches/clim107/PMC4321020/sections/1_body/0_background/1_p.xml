 </sup> In tropical climates within Asia and Africa, the proportion of the urban population is increasing by 1.5 and 1.1% per annum, respectively.

 </sup> Over the same time period, depending on the season and exact location within the tropics, the mean surface temperature is expected to rise by between 1 and 3Â°C.

 </sup> Urbanization and climate change could each alter the composition, intensity and seasonality of pathogen transmission and disease incidence across the tropics, but since both changes will occur at once, the drivers of these disease systems will interact in complex ways to determine what diseases are present and the corresponding seasonality of infection, disease and death.
