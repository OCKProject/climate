<p class="p">Several studies have found that development of a region has resulted in a decrease in the intra-annual variation in disease occurrence. Frequently this is due to an improvement in healthcare access,

 </sup> Although individual diseases are still influenced by climatic drivers such as rainfall and temperature, an increase in access to healthcare appears to mute the seasonal signal of disease and disease-related death. While improved access to healthcare is of an obvious benefit to the public, it unfortunately masks the proximal mechanisms driving temporal variation in incidence. As such, to adequately account for the role these drivers and the changing landscape plays on the seasonality of disease-related deaths, even more data is required.
