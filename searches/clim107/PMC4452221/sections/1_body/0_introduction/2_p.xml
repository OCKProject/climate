 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], duration of the incubation period [

 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination, with warmer nests producing female hatchlings and cooler nests producing males [

 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The temperature of the nest is influenced by physical traits of the beach, such as sand albedo [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] and vegetation cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], but is mainly impacted by prevailing climatic conditions. High levels of precipitation can reduce nest temperature and increase production of male hatchlings [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Seasonal changes in air temperature can cause shifts in hatchling sex ratios over the course of the nesting season [

 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and may also drive long-term changes in incubation conditions [
