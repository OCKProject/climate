<p class="p">Temperatures in watered plots returned to control levels within 10 days after the end of watering. There was not a significant effect of water treatment on temperature during the month after watering was completed. Depth affected temperature significantly (p &lt; 0.001), but to a much lesser degree than during the watering (Ƞ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.088), and shade continued to exert a strong influence on temperature (Ƞ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.689, p &lt; 0.001). During this time, at both depths none of the water treatments were statistically different from plots that did not receive water (p &gt; 0.05 all cases).
