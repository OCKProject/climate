<p class="p">Depth, amount of water received, and shade significantly influenced temperature during the course of treatments (p &lt; 0.001 all cases). Shading had the largest impact (Ƞ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.566), followed by water treatment (Ƞ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.441) and depth (Ƞ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.138). There were significant interactions between depth and shade treatment (p &lt; 0.001) and between depth and water treatment (p &lt; 0.001), but not between shade and water treatment (p = 0.360). The Bonferroni post hoc test showed significant differences in temperature between the control and all water treatments (p &lt; 0.001 in all cases), between low and average treatments (p &lt; 0.01) and between low and high treatments (p = 0.001), but not between average and high treatments (p &gt; 0.05).
