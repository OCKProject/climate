<p class="p">Watering regimens should be applied with caution, however, as excessive water can be harmful. At greater than 0.06 g g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> gravimetric water content, loggerhead hatchlings become smaller and hatching success decreases [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Saturation of the sand with water or flooding of the nest could prevent gas exchange in the nest and reduce hatching success [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. However, gravimetric water contents of 0.05 to 0.08 g g
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> correspond to matric water potentials of about -5 kPa and gravimetric water content down to 0.01 still has a matric water potential of aboutâ€”10 kPa [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] so it is not dry. The water potential difference between the egg (about -900 kPa) and the sand will cause water to enter the egg and it will gain mass, which is why a sea turtle egg usually becomes turgid soon after deposition by absorbing water from the sand [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Rainfall will not flood a beach at sea turtle nest depth as long as the nest is above the water table, but will drain down through the sand due to gravity until it reaches equilibrium with the capillary forces between the sand grains. Water potential in the sand column will usually be between -10 and -25 kPa [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Only when there is a dry layer at the surface in which all of the water has evaporated and kPa reaches as high as -100,000 kPa will the water potential cause the eggs to dry out.
