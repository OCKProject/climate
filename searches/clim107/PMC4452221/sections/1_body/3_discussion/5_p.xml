<p class="p">In addition to increasing reproductive output, watering regimens can also influence hatchling morphology. In loggerhead turtles, eggs incubating in artificial nests with very low gravimetric water content in the sand produced smaller hatchlings, while sand with a gravimetric water content of 0.06 (similar to water content in average and high water treatments in this study) produced the largest hatchlings and also had the highest hatching success [

 <italic class="italic">Pituophis melanoleucus)</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. These larger sizes may incur fitness benefits, as larger turtle hatchlings exhibit greater survivorship [

 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], and better swimming capability. High water treatments in this study corresponded to high levels of rain that resulted in the highest hatching success and emergence of leatherback hatchlings at Playa Grande [
 <xref rid="pone.0129528.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Even if watering is less effective at reducing sand temperature, it is still beneficial because it keeps moisture in the sand. Moist sand results in higher hatching success and may produce hatchlings with higher fitness levels while greatly increasing hatchling production.
