<p class="p">The incidence of HFRS has also been associated with climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall and relative humidity. Warmer conditions can increase activities of rodents and the rate of rodent reproduction, thus leading to an increase in the incidence of HFRS [

 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. However, hot and dry conditions and lower relative humidity may increase the mortality of rodents, reduce the survival rate of hantaviruses in the reservoir, and thus curb the transmission of HFRS [

 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Plentiful rainfall can create an ideally moist environment for rodents and better growth conditions for vegetation that provide a food source, thus leading to an increase in the population size of rodents and contributing to HFRS transmission [

 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Similarly, increased relative humidity can promote rodent reproduction, infectivity and stability of the virus, and thus increase the incidence of HFRS [
