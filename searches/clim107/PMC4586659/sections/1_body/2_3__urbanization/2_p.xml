<p class="p">At present, China is estimated to have a migrant population exceeding 221 million [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The migrant population, often described as the “floating population”, largely consists of people originating from rural areas to urban areas in search of better economic and social opportunities. The “floating population” constitute a salient and disadvantaged group in China accounting for more than 10% of China’s total population [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The migrants are often poor and less educated than the general population in urban areas. They typically live in low quality housing with inadequate sanitation, and have limited access to local health services. The needs of the migrant population have not been taken into full consideration in health care policy-makers’ formulation of relevant policies and regulations, such as health insurance, occupational injury and infectious disease prevention strategies including immunization. Meanwhile, the “floating population” itself is reluctant to spend its already limited discretionary resources on health care. It comes as no surprise that the overall health status of rural-urban migrants is generally lower than that of local urban residents [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. In particular, migrants can be more susceptible to infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted diseases (STD), as well as vector/food-borne diseases, and are less likely to receive proper treatment or be cured of infectious diseases than local permanent residents [

 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Further, children of migrant parents are also shown to have poorer health, lower nutrient intakes and constrained access to education compared to children of local or permanent residents [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Additionally, vaccination coverage among migrant children is lower than the rates for children of local or permanent residents [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. These factors, in addition to the large size, high mobility and poorer health of the migrant population, have the potential to contribute to the spread of infectious diseases, adversely impacting on national health. Access to health care, insurance coverage, education and community support needs to be extended to the migrant population irrespective of residence and employment status.
