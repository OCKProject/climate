<p class="p">China is one of the largest and most populous countries in the world with nearly 20% of the world’s population [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Over the last few decades, China has witnessed an unprecedented economic boom with its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita growing from $193 in 1980 to $6092 in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. However, such great economic growth may have been achieved at the cost of the environment and public health programs as compared to other aspects of development including economy, education and technology. One issue is infectious diseases, which continue to impair population health in this populous country [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Although infectious diseases only accounted for about 0.89%–1.06% of all deaths in China in 2011 [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], estimates suggest that there are about 7 million cases of notified infectious diseases, such as viral hepatitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, dengue and malaria, occurring amongst the 1.3 billion population, leading to approximately 17,000 deaths each year [

 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Tremendous efforts were made to reduce infectious diseases after 1949 [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], but some infectious diseases have rebounded and even increased in some areas since the 1980s [

 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Malaria, for example, has been a serious public health problem in China for many years and great efforts have been made to address the problem. Despite a remarkable decline in its incidence from about 2800 per 100,000 in 1970 to 10 per 100,000 in 1990, malaria has re-emerged in some areas since 2001, e.g., Henan, Hubei and Anhui provinces [
