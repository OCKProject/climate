 <xref rid="pone.0126228.g002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). We analysed the distribution of the change rates for population growth rate in BCI, and the results showed that the population growth rates for most species (84.4%; 65 of 77 species) decreased (Figs

 <xref rid="pone.0126228.g003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3A</xref>), with 27.7% of those species showing a significant decrease. Based on the 77 species in BCI, we carried out a correlation analysis between the population growth rate (lnÎ») and time (the median of each five-year interval) to explore the relationship between the correlation coefficients and the abundances of species. The results indicated that many species with higher abundance showed decreasing trends of population growth rate (
