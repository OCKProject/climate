<p class="p">The linear regression analysis between climate factors and community composition change rate, Slnλ, showed that climate factors had no significant effects on Slnλ except on the maximum and minimum temperature in DBR and the minimum temperature in BCI. The maximum temperature had a positive effect on Slnλ, while the minimum temperature had a positive effect in DBR but a negative effect in BCI. The overall trend seems to link increasing temperature with increasing community composition change rate (5 in 6 regressions) (
