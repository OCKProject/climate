<p class="p">The BCI plot (9°9'N, 79°51'W) covers an area of 50 ha; it was the first plot established by the CTFS (Center for Tropical Forest Science) and is undoubtedly one of the best-studied forests in the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The island receives an average of 2634 mm of rain per year, with a pronounced four-month dry season from mid-December through mid-April [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Daytime temperatures reach an average of 32°C, with night-time lows of approximately 23°C. This island has 1500 ha of diverse, moist, lowland, tropical forest, and has been protected from human disturbance for 70 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Abundance data collected from 1981 to 2005 on the 50 ha plot were obtained from the Center for Tropical Forest Science (

There were 319 species recorded for woody stems ≥ 10 mm diameter at breast height. Among these species, only species with an average of at least 10 individuals per ha for 6 censuses were included in our analysis because large percentage changes in abundance of rare species could be caused by minor, chance events [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Consequently, we finalised a list of 77 species for analysis (
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). The total abundance of 77 species accounted for 91 percent of the total individuals on the plot.
