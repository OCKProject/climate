<p class="p">We employed two long-term datasets for use in our analysis. One is a dataset containing 30 years of data from DBR (Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, Guangdong province, China); the other contains approximately 25 years of data from BCI (Barro Colorado Island, Panama). DBR has a subtropical climate, and BCI has a tropical climate. Rare species were not included in this study, because they are more sensitive to disturbance and the variations of their numbers are more stochastic.</p>
