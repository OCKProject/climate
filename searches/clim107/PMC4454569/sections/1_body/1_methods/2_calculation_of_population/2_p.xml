 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. We obtained 8 sequential intervals in DBR and 5 sequential intervals in BCI to estimate the species-specific population growth rate. Once the population growth rates were estimated, we determined the direction and rates of change in the parameters by calculating the linear least-squares regression coefficient (β) of lnλ vs. time separately for each of the species. For BCI, we also analysed the distribution of β to see the overall trend of population growth. We also analysed the relationship between the correlation coefficient and the abundance of each species to explore whether there is any influence of abundance on population growth rate.
