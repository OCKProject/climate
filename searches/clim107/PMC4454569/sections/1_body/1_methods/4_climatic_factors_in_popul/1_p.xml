<p class="p">Two basic models (the unrestricted exponential growth model and the restricted logistic growth model) are often used to simulate continuous population growth. Almost all populations undergo three phases: the increasing phase, the stabilising phase and the decreasing phase, but neither of the two models is able to describe the population declining stage. The interaction of three fundamental processes—(i) competition for resources, (ii) the effect of body size on resource use and (iii) the effect of plant density on growth and mortality—will affect the development of plant populations [

The limitation may come from the external environment or the self-limiting of a species. Although the logistic growth model has frequently been used in forest ecology, species replacement during forest development makes the population growth of the majority of species more likely to resemble a Gaussian curve (
