<p class="p">Here, Sln位 is the community composition change rate, expressed as the average of changes in population growth rate for the dominant species in a community, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> is the number of species counted in the analysis and ln位
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is the population growth rate of the 
 <italic class="italic">ith</italic> species. The index Sln位 is a combination of the changes in biodiversity and population dynamics and reflects the rate of community change over a relatively short period. A larger Sln位 value indicates a greater change in community composition.
