<p class="p">Average population growth rates are usually expected to be stable, but patterns of variation in population growth rates are different for different species. Variation in population growth rates is related to species birth, growth, reproduction and death [

 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. A recent study considered forest population dynamics, particularly the rate at which forest distributions might shift under climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Change in a forest community is related to species-specific responses of the tree species in that community to climate change. In terms of population dynamics, dominant species respond differently to changing environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], thereby giving rise to a change in community composition. For instance, Feeley et al. (2007) [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] found a widespread decrease in tree growth rates for species occurring in large forested dynamic plots at Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), and the changes in growth were significantly associated with regional climate changes. Not long after, the authors revealed that, in this same plot, there have been consistent, directional changes in the tree species composition towards a significantly greater representation of species with greater drought tolerance, which was consistent with long-term climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Declines of population growth rates were found in other studies, and these declines were usually climate-correlated [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Furthermore, traditional analyses usually assume that tree species composition or population growth rate is constant and fail to capture the temporal dynamics of these factors, making it difficult to attribute the change to environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Thus, quantifying the temporal growth dynamics of population in the context of community change when the influences of climate variations are of interest is necessary.
