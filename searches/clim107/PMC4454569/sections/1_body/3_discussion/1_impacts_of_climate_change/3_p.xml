 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Experimental warming has consistently produced an increase in vascular plant growth across the Arctic [

A recent study assessed the climate drivers of recent unfavourable silversword population dynamics and found that the declining population growth rates of silversword were associated with changing climatic conditions. Annual population growth rates were strongly tied to rainfall patterns [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. A modelling study of a steppe plant community from eastern Idaho, USA, found strong effects of climate on the population growth in 2 of 3 target species. A 1% decrease in the previous yearâ€™s precipitation would lead to a 0.6% decrease in population growth for one species, and a 1% increase in summer temperature would result in a 1.3% increase in population growth for the other species [
