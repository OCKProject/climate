<p class="p">To detect the community composition change rate over decades, we propose a relatively more concise index, Slnλ, which refers to an overall population growth rate based on the dominant species in a community. The variation of Slnλ over time is mainly determined by community development. Climate factors can influence the population growth rate and accordingly affect the community composition change rate. The present study indicates that increasing temperature has a positive effect on population growth rate and community change rate. Decreasing precipitation has a positive effect on population growth, but shows a complex effect on community change. As global warming will bring more precipitation to high latitudes in both winter and summer and less precipitation to low latitudes [
