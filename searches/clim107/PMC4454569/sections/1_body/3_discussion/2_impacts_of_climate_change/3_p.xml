<p class="p">We used linear regression analysis to detect the relationship between climate and community change rate, Slnλ (

Our results suggest that a positive relationship exists between increasing temperature and increasing community change rate. Although decreasing precipitation has a positive effect on population growth rate for most populations, the overall effect on the community composition change rate seems complicated in our study. As we know, changes in precipitation can affect community composition by altering germination, seedling establishment, growth, and survival [

Another experimental study found that drought and warming treatments slowed down secondary succession in a Mediterranean climate, and indicated that future drier and warmer conditions may severely affect plant succession due to the existence of both abundance-dependent and species-specific responses [

For the BCI plot in our analysis, the impact of El Niño event in early 1983 caused immediate increases in tree mortality, and since then there has been a persistent directional change in the flora toward and increased abundance of drought-tolerant species[
