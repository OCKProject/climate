 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], but did not take population dynamics into account. In fact, community change not only indicates the species composition change but also implies a proportional change of each species relative to one another [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. One could not say a community is unchanged when no old species disappears and no new species established over years because the community composition often changes with different proportions of each species. Therefore, using the index Slnλ is more precise for detecting the rate of community change. Slnλ is determined by population growth rates of dominant species of a community, which can be predicted by environmental and temporal factors. Thus, community composition change rate, Slnλ, in a relatively short time period is predictable.
