<p class="p">Comparing the response between the climate chamber and the outdoor group in response to time showed a difference in nectar volume per flower, number of flowers per plant and biomass per flower (Table

 </bold>). Number of flowers per plant and biomass per flower also showed a separate response to temperature in the outdoor models (Table 
 <xref rid="PLV111TB2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), thus it is more difficult to say how much of the difference could be caused by the elevated temperatures in the climate chamber

 </bold>. However, the difference in the case of nectar volume per flower is likely caused by the effect of elevated temperatures in the climate chamber
