<p class="p">In the climate chamber, the traits of 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> showed a significant dependence on temperature through time (henceforth simply ‘temperature’; Table

 </bold>). All tested traits had a positive unimodal relationship to temperature, except sugar concentration per flower, which showed a negative unimodal response (Table 
 <xref rid="PLV111TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" class="xref">1</xref>). Optimum temperature for nectar volume per flower and sugar content per flower and per plant was at ∼25–26 °C (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" class="xref">1</xref>A, C and D), even though nectar sugar concentration per flower was the lowest at these temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" class="xref">1</xref>B). Number of flowers per plant per day was also highest at the same favourable temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" class="xref">1</xref>E), but biomass per flower declined unimodally through the test period (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" class="xref">1</xref>F). Contrarily, trait variation (CV) within a plant did not show significant changes in response to elevated temperatures in most of the tested traits, except CV of sugar concentration

 </bold>. Elevated temperatures in the climate chamber also accelerated flower production and thus resulted in shortening the flowering period nearly 2-fold compared with the outdoor group (duration of the experiment was 24 days in the climate chamber vs 45 days outdoors).
