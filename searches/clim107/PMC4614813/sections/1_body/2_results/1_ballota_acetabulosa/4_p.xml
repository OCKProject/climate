<p class="p">At the moderately warm temperatures in the climate chamber (∼26.5–29.5 °C) the plants had no empty flowers (producing no nectar) per plant, while at lower and higher temperatures the proportion of empty flowers increased. Nevertheless, modelling showed that the proportion of empty flowers per plant was not significantly related to temperature and the comparison between climate chamber and outdoor data was also not significant
