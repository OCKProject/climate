<p class="p">Under this experimental design we were, however, unable to distinguish between the effect of temperature and time in the climate chamber as the relationships in this group could be due to both temperature and time. Under naturally varying conditions in the outdoor group we were able to model the effect of temperature separately, although the observed temperature range was narrower than the one tested in the climate chamber. For the outdoor group of 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic>, the linear models were favoured over the quadratic ones in all traits. Nevertheless, only sugar content per plant and biomass per flower had a significant relationship with temperature, showing a negative response to higher average temperatures (Table 
 <xref rid="PLV111TB2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Trait variation (CV) did not show a response to temperature, similarly to the climate chamber data, except in the case of CV of sugar concentration per flower, which was positively unimodally related to temperature (
