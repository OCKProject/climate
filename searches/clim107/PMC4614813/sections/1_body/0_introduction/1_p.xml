 <xref rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</xref>). Plants have an optimum range of temperatures for nectar production, determined by their habitat and species characteristics (
 <xref rid="PLV111C19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jakobsen and Kristjánsson 1994</xref>). Often a moderate increase in average temperature can have a positive effect on plant nectar production (

 <xref rid="PLV111C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nocentini 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>) but beyond that plants experience temperature stress, which can induce changes in nectar production (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</xref>). A number of studies from different systems have found decreased nectar volumes and nectar production rates at higher temperatures under both experimental and natural conditions (

 </xref>). At the same time, nectar sugar concentration is usually less dependent on external factors and more constant throughout the day and the flowering season (

 <xref rid="PLV111C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nocentini 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>). The amount of sugar produced per flower has nevertheless been shown to depend on nectar volume rather than concentration (
