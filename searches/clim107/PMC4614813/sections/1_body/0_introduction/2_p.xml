<p class="p">A decrease in nectar quantity and sugar content in response to global warming reduces the amount of resources available for pollinators and thus can have negative effects on plantâ€“pollinator interactions (

 <xref rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Petanidou and Smets 1996</xref>), which further reduces the amount of resources. A decrease in floral rewards, but also in the variation of nectar production patterns within a plant, can change pollinator behaviour patterns (

 <xref rid="PLV111C49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zimmerman 1988</xref>). Most often, pollinators are found to be risk-sensitive to greater variability of nectar volume (

 </xref>) and high variation can therefore decrease plant attractiveness to pollinators (
 <xref rid="PLV111C49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zimmerman 1988</xref>). Consequently, climate change can reduce plant reproductive success due to changed interaction patterns with pollinators and possibly threaten the persistence of both plant and pollinator populations (
