<p class="p">Our two study species responded to the elevated temperatures somewhat differently, which suggests possible disparate responses to climate change in phryganic species. For one, 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> optimal temperatures for nectar and sugar production were in general lower, close to the current average temperatures, and the species therefore more sensitive to climate warming than 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic>, which had higher optimal temperatures for nectar secretion (FigsÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" class="xref">2</xref>). Additionally, several traits of 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> exhibited dependence on elevated temperatures (nectar volume per flower, sugar content per flower and number of flowers per plant) in addition to the effect of time through the flowering period. On the other hand, in 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic> it was only nectar volume per flower that clearly depended on elevated temperatures. Strong dependence on temperature implies that 
 <italic class="italic">B. acetabulosa</italic> could be rather sensitive to temperature changes, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic> might be more moderately affected by climate warming.
