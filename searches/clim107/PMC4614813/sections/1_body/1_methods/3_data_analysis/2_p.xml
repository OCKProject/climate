<p class="p">We tested for the possible differences between the original and replacement plants of 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic> in their response to time, using linear mixed models (LMM) with interaction terms (‘time × replacement group’). There were no significant differences in the studied traits, except in sugar concentration per flower in the outdoor group (time
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>× replacement group interaction, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = −2.013, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.049). Similarity of response indicates that the replacement plants had similar response patterns to the original plants and that the two plant groups can be analysed together in order to identify the general response patterns.
