<p class="p">Data analysis was carried out in three consecutive steps. First, we used LMM models to identify the effect of temperature on plant traits in the climate chamber, testing both linear and quadratic effect of temperature on the traits and using plant number (plant ID) as a random factor. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the fit of the linear and quadratic models, based on the AIC values. However, it is essential to note that in the climate chamber we could not truly separate the effect of temperature and time on plants, since the temperature was increased linearly with time.</p>
