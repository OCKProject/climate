<p class="p">Plants in the outdoor group were placed in an open area in full sunlight and were covered with large and airy tulle cages to prevent pollinator visits. The light intensity inside the covered cages was higher than in the climate chamber (∼1400 μmol m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> or ∼75 000 lx). Data on ambient temperatures outdoors were obtained from the nearby (&lt;300 m) climate station at the University of the Aegean in Mytilene (

The average temperature of the 3 days corresponding to each temperature step in the climate chamber was used in the analyses. The mean outdoor temperature during the test period ranged from 16.7 to 26.1 °C.
