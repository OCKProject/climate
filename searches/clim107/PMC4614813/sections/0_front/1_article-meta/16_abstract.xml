 <p class="p">The negative effect of climate change on plants and plantâ€“pollinator interactions is a matter of concern worldwide. The Mediterranean region is considered particularly susceptible to climate warming and the communities of this region will need to face considerable climatic changes over the 21
  <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. We studied the effect of temperature on nectar secretion of two Mediterranean species (
  <italic class="italic">Ballota acetabulosa</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Teucrium divaricatum</italic>) to evaluate their potential responses to climate change and a consequent effect on their pollinators. Both species would handle moderate warming relatively well but would be negatively affected by strong warming predicted for the end of this century.
