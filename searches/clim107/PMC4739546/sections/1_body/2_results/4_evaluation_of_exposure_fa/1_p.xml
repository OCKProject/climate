<p class="p">Mean ocean surface temperature change (upper 10 m) and mean surface pH change were determined to be important factors in the climate vulnerability scores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). These factors were scored as very high exposure for all species owing to the magnitude of change projected by 2055 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s011" class="xref">S9 Supporting Information</xref>). Mean surface air temperature change (as a proxy for shallow water temperatures) and to a lesser extent sea-level rise were also important for species that were exposed to these factors (Coastal Fish and Diadromous Fish species). Exposure factors that were not as important in determining vulnerability scores exhibited a lower magnitude of change, particularly the variance of the exposure factors and mean changes in precipitation and ocean surface salinity.
