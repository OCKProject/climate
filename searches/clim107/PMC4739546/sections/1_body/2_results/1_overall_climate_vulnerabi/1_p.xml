<p class="p">The 82 species were nearly equally split among the different climate vulnerability ranks: very high (~27%), high (~23%), moderate (~24%) and low (~26%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Climate exposure scores for all 82 species were high or very high indicating the magnitude of climate change relative to the variability of past conditions is high. Biological sensitivity ranged from low to very high. The certainty in the score of the majority of species exceeded 90% based on the bootstrap analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Approximately 27% of species had certainty scores between 66â€“90%. Approximately 12% of species had certainty scores &lt;66%. For certainty scores less than 50%, a majority of bootstrapped climate vulnerability scores were different than the actual score. Species narratives provide species-specific summaries of the results (
