<p class="p">The results of this assessment indicate that a number of fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf are highly or very highly vulnerable to climate change and decadal scale variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Climate vulnerability here is defined as the extent to which abundance or productivity of a species could be impacted by climate change. This vulnerability results from the relatively large magnitude of climate change projected for the region over the next 35 years (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s011" class="xref">S9 Supporting Information</xref>), as well as attributes of individual species. Changes in population productivity have already been observed in the system [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] and the results presented here suggest that these changes are likely to continue in the future, possibly becoming widespread among species in the ecosystem. The results of this assessment also suggest a large number of species in the ecosystem have a high potential for a change in distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Distribution changes have already been observed in the system [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] and have been linked to climate variables and fishing [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Finally, this assessment suggests that approximately half of the species included will be affected negatively by climate impacts in the region (e.g., decreased productivity, distribution shifts out of the system). However, positive effects of climate change are expected for some fish and invertebrate species in the ecosystem.
