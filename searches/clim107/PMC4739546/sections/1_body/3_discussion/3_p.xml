<p class="p">The effects of ocean acidification on species biology and ecology are not as well understood [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. In recent years, a number of studies have started to fill this gap for species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf [

 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. However, it is often difficult to place the impacts identified in experimental studies into the context of the magnitude of projected change. In the Northeast U.S. Shelf, pH is projected to decrease by 0.08 to 0.12 units by 2055 (

Many of the studies however use treatments equivalent to ocean acidification conditions expected by 2100 or 2200. In addition, many studies use constant ocean acidification levels, but there is a large magnitude of daily, seasonal, interannual, and regional variability [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Research is needed that tests the impacts of ocean acidification at the levels expected over the next 20â€“40 years to support shorter term projections that can be used in management. One example is a recent study with Atlantic Sea Scallop where fishery yields are projected to decrease in the coming decades owing to the effects of ocean acidification [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Because a meta-analysis shows consistent negative impacts of ocean acidification on mollusc larvae [
 <xref rid="pone.0146756.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] this methodology scored molluscs as very sensitive to ocean acidification (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s003" class="xref">S1 Supporting Information</xref>). As these species also exhibit low adult mobility, molluscs were ranked with a high or very high vulnerability to climate change. This should be interpreted cautiously, and highlights the need for more research on species specific impacts of ocean acidification. It is imperative to experimentally examine the effect of ocean acidification on exploited species, incorporate this information into future climate vulnerability assessments, and include these effects in assessment models that evaluate the impact of acidification in the coming decades.
