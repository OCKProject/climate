<p class="p">In addition to the composite results that show the relative vulnerabilities across species, species specific vulnerability narratives were prepared (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s009" class="xref">S7 Supporting Information</xref>). These narratives provide the distribution of tallies and the data quality score for each exposure factor and sensitivity attribute, the overall climate vulnerability, potential for distribution change, directional effect scores, and the certainty in these scores. Additionally, a summary of identified climate effects on the species and a synopsis of the life history is given.
