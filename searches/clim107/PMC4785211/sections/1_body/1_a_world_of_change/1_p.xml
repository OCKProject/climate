<p class="p">The human footprint is ubiquitous on the planet such that many argue that we are now in the Anthropocene epoch (Steffen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2013</xref>). Recent temperatures are already extreme relative to the long-term record—the past 30 years likely represent the warmest period in the northern hemisphere, on average, of the past 1400 years (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2013</xref>). Over 80 % of U.S. National Park System areas with significant natural resources (235 out of 289 parks) are already at the extreme warm edge of historical conditions (Fig.

Climate and other global change stressors not only challenge land managers’ abilities to protect and foster natural areas but also demand that we re-think conservation concepts, goals, and objectives in a continuously changing world (Hobbs et al.
