<p class="p">‘Resilience,’ rather than gaining clarity with time, is increasingly confusing and ambiguous. Even before its use in the climate change lexicon, resilience as an ecological concept was becoming confusing due to multiple interpretations (Walker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2004</xref>). Despite initial understanding within the conservation community of climate change resilience as a limited stopgap strategy, its use and definition in conservation and policy has expanded widely (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), thus according “resilience” a very elastic quality, from “the amount of disturbance a system can absorb without changing states” (Holling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">1973</xref>) to “the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions,” (Exec. Order No. 13653). Departing from the early adaptation concept of resilience (Millar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2007</xref>) and borrowing from the social-ecological systems realm (Folke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2006</xref>), resilience now includes the full spectrum of climate change adaptation strategies, and encompasses the ability to
