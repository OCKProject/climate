<p class="p">Climate change adaptation is a new and rapidly evolving arena in conservation and management. Adaptation is an adjustment to actual or expected climate change and its effects that moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2014</xref>). Numerous adaptation strategies, decision frameworks, and methods exist to facilitate climate change adaptation (West et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2009</xref>; NFWPCAP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2012</xref>; Stein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" class="xref">2014</xref>), and adaptation practitioners often refer to adaptation strategies in three broad categories: resistance, resilience, and transformation (Millar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2007</xref>). Resistance strategies seek to prevent climate change impacts to high-value and irreplaceable resources, whereas transformation strategies guide resource responses towards desired new conditions. Borrowing from the ecological definition of resilience [the amount of disturbance a system can absorb without changing states (Holling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">1973</xref>; Gunderson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2000</xref>)], resilience strategies for climate change adaptation were initially described as supporting system recovery, and were “best exercised in projects that are short-term, have high amenity or commodity values, or under ecosystem conditions that are relatively insensitive to climate change effects” (Millar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2007</xref>).
