<p class="p">Multilevel modelling is recommended when there are two or more distinct, hierarchical levels of data 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Christ1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[51]</xref>. With the present data, geographic location is one level and individuals another: One would expect that individuals from a given area (within-group variance) would have more similar characteristics than individuals from different areas (between-group variance). Multilevel analysis allows researchers to model the area-level and individual-level variance independently and simultaneously. We therefore constructed a multilevel model assessing the association between distance to the coast and both belief about the reality of climate change and support for government regulation of carbon emissions. These two outcomes were modelled simultaneously, and their Level 1 and Level 2 residual covariances were also included to adjust for residual associations. The intercepts for both outcomes were modelled as random effects, thus allowing the mean level of each outcome to vary across meshblocks.
