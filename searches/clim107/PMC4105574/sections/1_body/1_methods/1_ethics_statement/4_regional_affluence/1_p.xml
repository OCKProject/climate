<p class="p">We also examined information about the net deprivation versus affluence of people residing in each meshblock. To measure deprivation we used the 2006 Deprivation Index, which provides detailed aggregate census information about the demographic characteristics of people residing in each area unit/neighborhood in New Zealand 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Salmond1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[50]</xref>. This index allocates a deprivation score to each meshblock based on the following nine variables in the census data (in weighted order): proportion of adults receiving a means-tested Government-supplied welfare benefit, household income, proportion not owning their own home, proportion of single-parent families, proportion unemployed, proportion lacking qualifications, proportion with household crowding, proportion with no telephone access, and proportion with no car access. The Deprivation Index thus reflects the average level of deprivation for neighborhoods (or small community areas) across the entire country. The Deprivation Index assigns a ranked decile score from 1 (most affluent) to 10 (most impoverished) to each geographical meshblock unit/neighborhood (
