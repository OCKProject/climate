<p class="p">Geographic and regional information was measured with 2006 New Zealand census data, based on the smallest geographical units (meshblock) in the census. Respondents provided their residential address, and this information was used to determine the meshblock boundaries within which each resided (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103180-g001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The geographic size of meshblocks is related to population density, but each unit tends to cover a region containing roughly 100 residents (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 103, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 72, range = 3-1,431), and the average New Zealand meshblock size is about 9.66 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (3.73 mi

 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 5,815) were nested within 5,199 meshblocks, with a little over one person on average sampled per unit (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 1.12, range 1–5).
