<p class="p">We estimated the distance to the coast by calculating the straight-line distance (in kilometers) between the centroid of each meshblock and the nearest point on the shoreline (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 9.87 km, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 17.01 km) using GIS analytic techniques. The distance was then assigned to all respondents living in the meshblock. Assigning respondents as if they all lived in the center of their meshblock is a reliable approximation because the majority of meshblocks are small 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Statistics1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[49]</xref>. We also estimated height above sea level for the centroid of each meshblock. To make the unstandardized slopes in our model more readily interpretable, distance to the coastline was scaled in 10 km units and height above sea level was scaled in meters.
