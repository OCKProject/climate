<p class="p">The strength of those feelings of psychological distance from climate change may be influenced by people's perceptions and beliefs about the levels of risk, as well as by actual exposure to hazards

 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Reser1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[32]</xref>. Even experiencing a warmer-than-usual day increases climate change concern
