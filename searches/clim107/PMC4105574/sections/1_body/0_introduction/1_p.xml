<p class="p">The vast majority of climate scientists (97–98%) agree with the reality and human causes of climate change 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Anderegg1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[1]</xref>. However, it is clear that climate change poses a unique and profoundly complex problem, one that is not easily communicated. A study found that only 53% of the New Zealand public believe climate change is real and caused by humans, while 10% do not believe in climate change, 7% believe it is real but not caused by humans, and a large proportion (31%) remain undecided 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Sibley1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[2]</xref>. Surveys conducted in the U.S. report similar results, with three showing that around 63–69% of Americans believe global warming is happening 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Borick1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[3]</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Pew1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[5]</xref> and another reporting that 82% of Americans believe climate change is happening 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Stanford1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[6]</xref>. Other Western countries also show relatively moderate levels of concern compared to climate scientists 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Ratter1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[7]</xref>. At the same time, support for action to reduce global warming is moderate to high: 64% of New Zealanders say that citizens should be exerting more effort toward combating climate change 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Horizon1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[8]</xref>, and, when they were shown 19 possible government policy options to reduce emissions, New Zealanders showed more support than opposition for all, with majority support for 17 of the policy options 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Scoop1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[9]</xref>. Again similarly, 68% of the U.S. public supports medium to large-scale efforts to tackle climate change 
 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Leiserowitz2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[10]</xref>. Altogether, New Zealanders, similarly to Americans, want action taken on climate change, but it is clear that the public is significantly less certain about the threat than the scientists.
