<p class="p">Our understanding of animal species' resilience to warming temperatures is a critical component of our ability to predict future range shifts and extirpations, and conserve biodiversity. Animals employ an array of behavioral strategies to avoid hyperthermia, such as changing body posture, seeking cooler microhabitats, reducing locomotion, and decreasing energy intake (Terrien etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Mammals in particular have the ability to regulate body temperature through fur properties, for example, by changing their seasonal molt timing. We examined some of these factors by presenting a coupled biophysical endotherm and microclimate model and comparing the results to empirical temperature and behavior data for a species, the American pika, whose ability to persist under future climate warming is unclear.
