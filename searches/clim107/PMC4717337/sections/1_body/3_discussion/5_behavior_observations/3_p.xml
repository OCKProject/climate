<p class="p">The seasonality of haying and breeding activities in pikas may have considerable impacts on observations of their behavior. Compared to higher elevations, pikas at lower elevations start and cease haying sooner, and breed up to 6 weeks sooner (Smith 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1974</xref>), which could be driven by elevational gradients in vegetation senescence (Smith

 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>). Additionally, pikas change their preferred forage throughout the season in response to changes in plant toxins and protein content, which may compel them to accelerate haying at different times (Dearing 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). We conducted our field observations during a 10‐day period to reduce behavioral changes due to seasonality. However, spatial differences in seasonality across sites may have contributed to the support for elevation, aspect, and elevation × aspect terms as predictors of pika activity (Fig.
