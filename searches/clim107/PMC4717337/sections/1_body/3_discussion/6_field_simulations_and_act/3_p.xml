<p class="p">Geographic variation in size and pelage can have substantial biophysical impacts on endotherms (Briscoe et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Range‐wide variation in pika body size is poorly documented, yet we demonstrated that body size could affect potential activity time under climate change. Smith and Weston (
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>) reported interpopulation variation in pika mean body mass ranging from 121 to 176 g, but their sample was relatively limited in size and geographic extent. In addition to limiting activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), animal size may interact with temperature to impact dispersal. Smith (
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1974</xref>) suggested that pikas at low elevations were limited primarily by low colonization success associated with higher temperatures, and that furthermore these pikas were forced to disperse during the hottest times of the season. However, smaller dispersing juveniles (Millar and Tapper 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1973</xref>) can dissipate heat more efficiently and remain active at higher temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). More range‐wide data on variation in fur properties, molt timing, and animal size, especially for at‐risk subpopulations, is critical to improve our understanding of pika thermoregulation and potential responses to future warming.
