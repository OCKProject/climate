<p class="p">The nocturnal activity of pikas warrants further investigation, especially at warmer low‐elevation sites (e.g., Beever et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Little is known about nocturnal activity in pikas; nocturnal activity may be restricted to certain regions and subpopulations, or may be a behavioral adaptation available to all pikas. While several occurrences of nocturnal activity and vocalizations have been documented in the Sierra Nevada and GNP (Smith

 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1965</xref>) observed no nocturnal activity during extensive observations in Colorado. The risk of depredation by efficient nocturnal predators such as owls and weasels could play a role in restricting pika nocturnal activity.
