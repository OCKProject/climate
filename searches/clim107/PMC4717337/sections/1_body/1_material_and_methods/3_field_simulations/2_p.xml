<p class="p">We simulated a conservative warming scenario for 2100 of +5.0°C for all elevations (McWethy et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31848-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). We used daily temperature ranges of 20°C, typical for summer months in GNP. The lowest temperature range (−10–10°C) is typical for June or September above 2500 m elevation. July and August temperature ranges at the lowest elevations in GNP (1500 m) are typically 4–22°C. We interpreted the ratio of the field metabolic rate over the BMR (FMR/BMR) to determine when pikas could be active above the talus. If an FMR/BMR ratio below 1.5 was required to remain below the animal's upper critical temperature, activity would probably be infeasible (Nagy
