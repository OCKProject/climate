<p class="p">The climatic suitability for the two structurally dominant grasses, 
 <italic class="italic">Poa labillardierei</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Themeda triandra</italic>, were modelled under current and future climate conditions to assess the extent to which the composition of the grassland communities might change under future climate conditions. Locality data for the Australian geographic extent of these species were downloaded from the online database Atlas of Living Australia (
