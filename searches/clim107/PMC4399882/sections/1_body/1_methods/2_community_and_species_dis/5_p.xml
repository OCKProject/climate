<p class="p">The Maxent model [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] was used to project the distribution of climate suitable for the grassland communities and species under current and future climate conditions. Maxent is a Species Distribution Model (SDM), or climate envelope model, which uses presence only data. SDMs are based on the statistical relationship between environmental or climatic variables and the current, observed distribution of a species or community. Assuming that this relationship remains unchanged, the future distribution of the species is then projected according to future climatic conditions. Other modelling approaches are available, including Boosted Regression Trees, Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models, and ensembles of these are sometimes used to represent the range in SDM outputs [

 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. We chose Maxent because it is has been shown to perform well in comparison to several other models when there are few presence records available [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. For each model run, ten replicate Maxent runs were calculated by cross-validation and using default values for all other parameters (e.g. regularisation). Relative occurrence probabilities above 0.5 were considered suitable, following Phillips &amp; Dudík [
