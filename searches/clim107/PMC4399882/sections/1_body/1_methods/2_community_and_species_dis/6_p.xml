 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. We use models based on climate variables to project changes to the communities and species’ potential climate domain. Our results therefore indicate relative climatic suitability rather than habitat suitability. In the absence of knowledge about the specific variables which determine grassland distributions in Tasmania, we used saturated models based on the full set of thirty five commonly used bioclimatic variables and allowed Maxent to perform variable selection. Maxent has been shown to be robust to correlated variables [
