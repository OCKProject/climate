<p class="p">6516 ha (87%) of GTL are currently considered to be in good condition (
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). All climate models agree that 99% of the good condition GTL grasslands will have unsuitable climate by 2080 (
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Three models suggest that no good condition GTL will remain within suitable climate, two models show between 23 and 25ha will remain suitable, and one model projects only 8ha will remain (multi-model mean 10ha). However, these small areas that are projected to become climatically suitable in the future occur outside the current geographic range of lowland native grassland.
