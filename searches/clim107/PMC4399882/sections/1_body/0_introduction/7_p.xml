<p class="p">There are several vegetation communities similar in composition and geographic extent that are likely to be important in the long-term conservation of the LNGT. Firstly, the Lowland Grassland Complex (GCL) includes grasslands that are not classified as LNGT because they have insufficient cover of 
 <italic class="italic">Poa labillardierei</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Themeda triandra</italic>. They have a significantly greater extent than LNGT, and may play an important functional role in maintaining grassland species across the landscape. GCL are mostly derived from prior clearing of native grassy, dry woodland and forest communities or from eucalypt dieback events [

 <italic class="italic">Bursaria-Acacia</italic> woodland and scrub community (NBA) grades with LNGT but is excluded from LNGT where 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">spinosa</italic> exceeds 30% cover. This community has an herb-rich grassy understorey dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Themeda triandra</italic> with emergent 
 <italic class="italic">Bursaria spinosa</italic> shrubs (up to 3â€“4 m). The structure of NBA is often an artefact of fire and grazing history, and increased frequency of burning can promote grassland vegetation and reduce shrub cover. Grasslands form a continuum with grassy woodlands dominated by various 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> species, which could be an important component of the management matrix if managed to maintain or favour grasslands.
