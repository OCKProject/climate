<p class="p">Limitations in the available tools for understanding potential change and our inability to predict the future need to be acknowledged when making conservation management decisions [

 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], it is important that the limitations of SDMs in general are understood, and the influence of particular modelling decisions are acknowledged and incorporated into conservation decision making. There are many factors that are known to be important determinants of species distributions that SDMs cannot consider, including dispersal, potential adaptation, species interactions, and potential responses to elevated carbon dioxide [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. With the cascading uncertainties inherent in predicting responses to future conditions, SDMs are just one tool among many that can inform decision making by highlighting the potential for change to occur [
