<p class="p">Managing for healthy ecosystem function, rather than primarily for species composition, fits well within a risk management framework because there will always be uncertainty associated with projections of future climate and in predictions of how animals and plants will respond to a changing climate [

The projections for the GTL community, for example, ranged from no suitable climate remaining, through to small areas remaining in different localities. These differences highlight the importance of considering results from a range of climate models to represent a range of plausible future climates and trajectories for a community or species.
