<p class="p">We have focussed on the potential for changes to species composition, but changes to the structure of grasslands may also occur. Existing scrub communities may become more widespread in response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide [

 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. On the other hand, vegetation with a grassland structure may establish where climate change leads to the transformation of other ecosystem types. For example, decline in canopy cover is projected for some areas of Tasmania (Williamson et al. 2014) and past tree decline events have resulted in the persistence of grassland communities where the original understorey was grassy.
