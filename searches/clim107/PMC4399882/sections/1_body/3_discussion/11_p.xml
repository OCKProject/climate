<p class="p">Future rates of greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions are another major source of uncertainty in projections of future climate suitability. We present results based on the high SRES emissions scenario (A2), which is a more likely scenario than lower emissions scenarios for the coming decades given current trajectories of global emissions [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. We are currently tracking at the higher end of the A2 scenario [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and even if drastic mitigation measures were achieved now, we will be dealing with the ‘committed warming’ that is now built in to the Earth’s climate system. However, while current emissions restrict the likelihood of the different scenarios in the short- to medium term, it does not necessarily mean that the scenario will be followed to the end of the century [
 <xref rid="pone.0124014.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. If emissions were mitigated the changes to the grassland communities for 2080 could be expected to be similar in nature but smaller in magnitude than those presented here for the high emissions scenario.
