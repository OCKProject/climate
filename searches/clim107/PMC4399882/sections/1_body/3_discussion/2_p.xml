<p class="p">Attempting to maintain the status quo by conserving the current structure and composition of the grassland communities may not be a viable management option in the long term. Climatic suitability for the communities comprising the Lowland Native Grasslands of Tasmania (LNGT), the Lowland Themeda grassland (GTL) and Lowland Poa grassland communities (GPL), is projected to contract strongly by the end of the century under the A2 SRES emissions scenario considered here. Of highest concern is GTL, with almost no current grassland projected to be within climatically suitable areas by 2080. The projected future of GPL is slightly better than for GTL, but with only very small areas of good-condition grasslands expected to remain within climatically suitable areas by the end of the century. Areas that are not grassland presently may become climatically suitable in the future, but the capacity for the grassland community as a whole to establish beyond their current extent is expected to be extremely low, because native vegetation is highly fragmented within the agricultural landscape and the fine-textured soils suitable for herbaceous grassland communities are not widespread in the areas projected to be suitable [

Geographic shifts to new areas will also be limited by the competitive ability of species at any future site, the influence of extreme events and by other threatening processes that affect grassland persistence.
