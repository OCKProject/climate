<p class="p">Our results highlight some fundamental questions about the conservation of threatened communities over the next few decades. While we know that substantial changes are likely, we do not know what will replace these communities as their climate envelope becomes unsuitable. We do not know whether the changes will be gradual and incremental or occur as a sudden threshold shift. We do not know exactly where grasslands of high conservation significance will remain. However, we do know that changes in species composition will occur, and the distribution and composition of ecological communities will shift. This suggests that the current focus on single-species conservation and maintenance of composition should be revised. Prioritising locations of high conservation significance, rather than species or communities defined by their species composition, might better conserve ecological processes and function into the future. The concept of the ecological community will remain useful in conservation if it is seen as a dynamic, rather than a static entity, in which ecological processes and functions are sustained and contribute to patterns of diversity across the landscape.</p>
