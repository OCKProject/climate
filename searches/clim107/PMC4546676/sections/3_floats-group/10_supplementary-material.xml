  <title class="title">Trends of Differences in Summer Biomass of Trout between Scenarios and Baseline.</title>
  <p class="p">Trends of differences in magnitude of total biomass (g) of trout in summer for forest harvest (FH), climate change (CC), and combined (FH + CC) scenarios compared to baseline in modeled streams, including Gus Creek, Pothole Creek, Rock Creek, and Upper Mainstem (UM). Annual trends in total biomass (g/decade) were averaged across five replicate simulations. They were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and p-values were corrected for serial correlation for 1
   <sup class="sup">st</sup> harvest, 2
   <sup class="sup">nd</sup> harvest, and the entire study period. Scenarios include manipulations of stream temperature and flow regimes (see 
   <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Methods</xref> for details). Significant p-values in bold (alpha â‰¤ 0.05) represent increasing or decreasing trends of magnitude in comparison to baseline. Magnitude is Sen slope (g/decade) over time.
