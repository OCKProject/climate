  <title class="title">Trends in Fry Emergence of Trout across Scenarios.</title>
  <p class="p">Median DOY of fry emergence of trout for forest harvest (FH), climate change (CC), and combined (FH + CC) scenarios in four modeled streams, including Gus Creek, Pothole Creek, Rock Creek, and Upper Mainstem (UM). Annual trends in fry emergence (days/decade) were averages of the five replicate simulations and were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and p-values were corrected for serial correlation for dates of the 1
   <sup class="sup">st</sup> harvest, 2
   <sup class="sup">nd</sup> harvest, and the entire study period. Scenarios include manipulations of stream temperature and flow regimes (see 
   <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Methods</xref> for details). Significant p-values in bold (alpha â‰¤ 0.05) represent increasing or decreasing trends. Magnitude is the Sen slope (days/decade) over time.
