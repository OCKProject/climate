<p class="p">Here we consider local variability in the vulnerability of stream-living trout to changes in temperature and flow linked to forest harvest and climate change. We used an individual-based model of Coastal Cutthroat Trout (

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] to model the separate and combined effects of stream temperature and flow under forest harvest and climate change scenarios on trout responses of biomass, survival, growth, and timing of fry emergence in four neighboring streams located within the same headwater catchment (
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). We parameterized the model with multi-year, daily measurements of stream temperature, flow, and turbidity (2007–2011), and field measurements of both instream habitat structure and three years of annual trout population estimates. The forest harvest scenario encompassed two harvests leading to increased stream temperature in summer [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], increased summer flows, and increased magnitudes of storm events [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] for 1–2 decades following each simulated harvest [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The climate change scenario involved increasing stream temperature year-round [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and decreasing flow during fall and winter [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The combined scenario captured the simultaneous effects of forest harvest and climate change, allowing us to evaluate the interactive effects of these changes on the dynamics of local populations.
