<p class="p">Our simulations show that local variability in stream conditions influences the idiosyncratic responses of trout to projections of forest harvest and climate change across streams (
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). For example, differences in total biomass of trout in summer between baseline and forest harvest and climate change scenarios indicated diminishing trends or no change over time depending on stream conditions (

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). In addition, when the effects of either temperature or flow were evaluated separately and compared to their combined effects, idiosyncratic responses of trout biomass were generally found across streams for each scenario (

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>). For example, under the climate change scenario, the separate effect of flow resulted in lower biomass than the separate effect of temperature in Gus Creek, but the opposite was seen in Pothole Creek, Rock Creek, and Upper Mainstem. Similar mixed responses were also seen under the forest harvest scenario, where the combined effect of temperature and flow after forest harvest resulted in lower biomass in Upper Mainstem when compared to separate effect of flow, whereas in Rock and Pothole Creeks their combined effect resulted in higher biomass and no difference in Gus Creek.
