<p class="p">Although our modeled streams are physically similar in many respects (e.g., similar mean summer flows for three of them, similar watershed area for three of them, similar summer velocities for three of them, 
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>), there are some notable differences among them that mediate the sensitivity of trout to forest harvest and climate change. Among our four study streams, trout in Gus Creek often showed unique responses indicating an overall resistance to change due to differences in physical habitat conditions compared to the other streams. Gus Creek, for its watershed area, supports a relatively larger wetted area and deeper pools in summer, a time period when stresses on fish are high [
