 <xref rid="pone.0135334.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). Under the climate change and combined scenarios, there were consistent trends toward earlier fry emergence for all streams over time. Over the entire study period, median timing of fry emergence was earlier by 4 to 7 days/decade for climate change, but it was earlier by only 4 to 5 days days/decade for the combined scenario due to the trend towards later emergence generally observed with forest harvest. Early fry emergence under the climate change scenario largely results from warmer stream temperature that accelerates the development of eggs across streams over time. Similarly, a lab study shows that fry emergence can be delayed due to increased temporal variance in temperature regimes [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Collectively, we highlight the importance of magnitude and variability of temperature regimes on emergence. Studies of salmonid fishes in other systems have shown that earlier emergence timing can negatively influence survival of subsequent life stages [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. In general, changes in phenology are a reliable indicator of climate change on diverse taxa [

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Although we find a coherent change in fry emergence across streams for the climate change scenario, this does not consistently translate into changes in trends of trout biomass or other demographic responses.
