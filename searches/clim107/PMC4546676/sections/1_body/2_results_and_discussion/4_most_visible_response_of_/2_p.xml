 <xref rid="pone.0135334.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). Most of the changes in trout demography occurred for climate change and combined scenarios, rather than for forest harvest in both summer and winter (

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5 Table</xref>). Overall, survival and growth of age-0 and age-1 trout frequently responded to changes linked to forest harvest and climate change more than older age classes. Age-0 trout exhibited increased survival over summer for all scenarios because earlier fry emergence (

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>) increased recruitment, with the exception of Upper Mainstem which is similar to an observational study [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Age-0 trout exhibited increased growth over summer in the climate change and combined scenarios compared to baseline (except for Upper Mainstem and Rock Creek). Age-0 trout showed increased biomass for climate change and combined scenarios compared to baseline (except Gus Creek under the combined scenario). During both seasons, age-1 trout showed mixed responses in growth and biomass for climate change and combined scenarios compared to baseline across streams. In contrast, biomass responded more uniformly across all age classes. Age-2 and age-3+ trout most consistently showed reductions in biomass for climate change and combined scenarios compared to baseline across streams. These idiosyncratic responses for demography may have been driven by the complex interplay of underlying factors, including density-dependence, specific requirements of environmental conditions at each age class (habitat), and variability in demography and the environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. In our simulations, we held most variables constant and equal across streams, except for local differences in physical habitat conditions and variability in environmental regimes among streams highlighting habitat (depth and area of available habitat) as the key driver [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The lack of coherence among responses of demography of trout has practical consequences because biological responses commonly quantified in field studies (survival, growth, and biomass) may not be able to consistently indicate the effects of land use and climate change [
