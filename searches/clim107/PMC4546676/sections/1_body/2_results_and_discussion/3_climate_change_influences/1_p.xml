<p class="p">Our modeled findings indicate that climate change alone influences trout more strongly and consistently across our study streams than forest harvest. Climate change led to earlier fry emergence (

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). Reductions in biomass of older trout come from both smaller-sized and reduced number of older individuals. Although other studies have similarly predicted a decrease in body size of individuals with increasing temperature from climate change, underlying mechanisms have been difficult to identify [

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Because it is not clear how climate change will influence the amount of drift or benthic food for trout, in our simulations, we assume that food availability does not change with temperature [

 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Increased temperature due to climate change leads to higher metabolism in trout, but because food intake does not change trout do not grow. Under such circumstances, they either starve or they choose riskier habitat with higher predation risk, both of which lead to lower abundances. We also noted increased biomass in young-of-year in most of the cases (see empirical evidence in [
 <xref rid="pone.0135334.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]) due to reduced intraspecific competition.
