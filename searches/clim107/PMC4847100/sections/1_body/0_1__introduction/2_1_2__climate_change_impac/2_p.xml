<p class="p">Urban populations are increasing in absolute numbers and are also relative to rural populations in every part of the world. According to the UN [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], 54% of the world population lives in urban areas. Because cities concentrate populations, extreme weather events (such as severe heatwaves or flooding) affect a much larger number of people. Cities also concentrate poor populations who are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change because of the conditions in which they live and the fact that they often lack adequate shelter or access to health services [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Another crucial factor is relating to the increasing proportion of the older population. This worldwide growing group is highly vulnerable (more than others) to health risks associated with extreme temperatures, infectious diseases and air pollution [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The population density in cities tends to lengthen the supply lines for essentials such as water, food, and energy sources. Extreme temperatures, storms or droughts that disrupt these urban lifelines can have serious consequences for the health of city residents [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In addition, the ways in which cities are constructed—reducing vegetation, covering large areas with impermeable surfaces, and obstructing natural drainage channels—make many city inhabitants more vulnerable to heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and other extreme weather events whose occurrence is found to be increasing [

   <p class="p" xmlns="">Extreme high air temperatures contribute directly to deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory disease, particularly among elderly people and those with chronic diseases. The impacts are worsened by the “urban heat island” effect, which results from greater heat retention of buildings and paved surfaces in urban areas.</p>
