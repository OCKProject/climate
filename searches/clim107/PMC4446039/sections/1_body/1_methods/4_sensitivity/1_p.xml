<p class="p">The extent to which intrinsic traits and environmental requirements render species sensitive to climate change was determined by collecting information on ten sensitivity factors (

 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], draft and approved species recovery plans, conservation and listing advice, state level species information profiles, and relevant scientific literature (
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Dataset</xref>). Recourse to the scientific literature was necessary primarily to derive scores for dispersal ability, reliance on pollinators and genetic variability (e.g. direct genetic variation estimates, or signs of a recent genetic bottleneck) which government databases and recovery plans often lacked.
