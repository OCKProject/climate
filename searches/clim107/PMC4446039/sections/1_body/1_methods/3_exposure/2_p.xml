<p class="p">Indirect exposure was assessed by estimating the extent to which each species’ current geographic distribution overlaps natural and anthropogenic barriers, or regions affected by sea level rise (
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). As some species are expected to track suitable climatic conditions beyond their current distribution through dispersal, it is anticipated that species surrounded by natural and anthropogenic barriers will have greater difficulty tracking a changing climate [

 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Natural barriers were major water bodies (oceans and inland lakes), areas devoid of vegetation, and highlands across the continent. We extracted features categorised as ‘water’ or ‘bare ground’ from the United States Geological Survey Global Land Cover 2000 dataset (v.1; [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]), and combined these with the distribution of land greater than 700m above sea level, based on a global digital elevation model at 30m spatial resolution from the National Geophysical Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Anthropogenic barriers were approximated by mapping the distribution of urban, cultivated and managed land uses from the Global Land Cover 2000 dataset [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. These features represent land converted in cities, urban areas and farmland, which will act as dispersal barriers for many threatened species. Proximity to natural and anthropogenic barriers was calculated by defining a 50km buffer [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] around each species’ current geographic distribution and overlaying this onto the distributions of the barriers to calculate the proportion of the buffer that overlaps with barriers (
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). Species for which anthropogenic barriers were unlikely to represent a dispersal barrier (e.g. many birds, such as the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle 
 <italic class="italic">Aquila audax fleayi</italic>) were scored as neutral (N) for this factor.
