<p class="p">We assessed vulnerability to climate change for a sample of species listed as threatened in Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPCB Act; [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]). All birds (n = 44), mammals (n = 43), amphibians (n = 19) and reptiles (n = 14) with known population trends [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] were selected from this list. We then randomly chose a species from each plant family to form a subset (n = 112) of plant species from the 705 listed plants with known population trends. Maps of the current distribution of the species were obtained from DSEWPaC [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. We considered only polygons that were identified as having known or likely species occurrences and removed from the analysis polygons where species “may occur”.
