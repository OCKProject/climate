<p class="p">In agreement with other studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], we found that amphibians were the most climate change vulnerable group, with heavy reliance on local moisture regimes and aquatic habitats that are likely to be negatively impacted by climate change. Altered interactions with chytrid fungus (
 <italic class="italic">Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic>) and cane toads (
 <italic class="italic">Bufo marinus</italic>) due to rising temperatures are listed as key threats to Australian amphibians, where cane toads may further expand their range and the distribution of chytrid fungus may shift to new areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Plants were the second most vulnerable taxon out of the sample of species we assessed, often constrained in their distribution by physiological factors such as a reliance on a particular soil type, relatively poor dispersal ability and low genetic variation through small population size [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Unlike plants, many birds are excellent dispersers and often with less restrictive habitat requirements, rendering them the least vulnerable taxonomic group in this analysis.
