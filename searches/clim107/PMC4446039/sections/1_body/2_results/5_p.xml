<p class="p">Five factors stood out as having a pervasive influence on the assessed threatened species across much of Australia (
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.g003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). These were reliance on a particular abiotic feature or derivative, reliance on a particular moisture regime or habitat, poor dispersal ability, reliance on a particular disturbance regime and low genetic variation (refer to 
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> for complete descriptions of factors). Reliance on other species for propagule dispersal was uncommon among our sample of species although prevalent in the south-west corner of Western Australia and Tasmania, where two 
 <italic class="italic">Daviesia</italic> species rely mainly on ants for seed dispersal [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Reliance on other species for pollination showed a similar pattern, affecting species along the eastern coastline, south-west Western Australia and northernmost Northern Territory. Reliance on cool temperatures, reliance on other species for diet and a reliance on species for other interactions (eg. mycorrhizal symbiosis) were all predominant factors in south-east Australia and Tasmania. A reliance of one species on other species for suitable habitat was the most prominent factor in western and north-west Queensland, while proximity to anthropogenic barriers mostly affected species along the south coast of the continent. Only the eight numerically most important factors are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.g003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. Factors not shown are exposure to rising sea levels and proximity to natural barriers which affected only coastal species and those on either side of the Great Dividing Range, and reliance on snow cover which is confined to the Alps bioregion.
