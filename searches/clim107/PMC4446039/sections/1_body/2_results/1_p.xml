<p class="p">Climate change vulnerability index values for the 213 threatened species assessed ranged from 11.3 (extremely vulnerable) for the mountain pygmy possum (

 <xref rid="pone.0124766.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>). By convention, a score above four indicates moderate or high climate change vulnerability, while a value below -2.0 indicates that the species might benefit from climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Mean vulnerability index across species was 3.6, and the median was 3.8, with most species showing intermediate levels of vulnerability and relatively few showing particularly low or high vulnerability (
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>). Indeed, the frequency distribution of index values was not significantly different from normal (Shapiro-Wilk test: W = 0.992, p = 0.275). Ninety-six species (45.1% of the total) had an index value exceeding 4.0, indicating that nearly half of Australiaâ€™s threatened species considered are moderately to highly vulnerable to climate change (
