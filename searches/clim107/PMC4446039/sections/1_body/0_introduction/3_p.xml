<p class="p">Assessments of species’ vulnerability to climate change have multiplied rapidly following the development of vulnerability assessment toolkits and frameworks (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]). Gardali et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] used exposure and sensitivity to assess 358 Californian birds, classifying 36% of them as vulnerable to climate change. A recent global assessment based on species traits concluded that 24% of birds, 22% of amphibians and 15% of corals are highly climate change vulnerable under an optimistic climate change scenario, rising to 50%, 44% and 32% respectively under a pessimistic climate change scenario [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The same study demonstrated relatively low spatial congruence between the distributions of species with high exposure, high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity, suggesting that different aspects of climate change vulnerability may be important in different places. Here we further expand on this work by mapping the distributions of species affected by individual climate change vulnerability factors.
