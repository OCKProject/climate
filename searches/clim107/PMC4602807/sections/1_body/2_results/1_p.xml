<p class="p">The intervals of distance and time of each dispatch are shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref> with the route-planning function of Google Map. For this project, 2 departure sites have been set: Xiaolin village and Jiasion elementary school (MEMC) but different destinations, ipso facto. Although the best suggested routes by Google Map (top-ranked routes) are usually preferred, sometimes different selections among the Google-suggested routes are more reasonable and efficient, due to factors such as the comparison between the time and the distance in real-life circumstances for such incidents in both methods. To minimize the discrepancy between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method, the scenarios analyzed in this project are based on the following conditions: same destinations, same ratios of casualty distribution, and same road-routing program. A scenario of conventional method is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>: Panel A depicts the casualties being transported directly to different lines of hospitals without any programmed retention; Panel B depicts that the survivors of the sequential-conveyance method are first transferred to an MEMC for triaging, stabilizing, care-giving, and sheltering. Additionally, a programmatic and a subsequent transferral for the serious casualties is indicated by physicians in an MEMC.
