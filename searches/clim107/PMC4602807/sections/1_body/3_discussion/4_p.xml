<p class="p">How to select an adequate MEMC by analyzing TE and DE? If the app. TEmax plot is closer to the TEmax plot and the app. TEmin plot has a positive shift from the TEmin plot, then these imply that the selected MEMC has time efficiency in the sequential-conveyance method, by keeping the advantage of the TEmax and by limiting the disadvantage of the TEmin. The same results are taken from a discussion either from the app. DEmax and the DEmax or the app. DEmin and the DEmin.</p>
