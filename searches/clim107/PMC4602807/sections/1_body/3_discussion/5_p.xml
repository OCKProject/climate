<p class="p">Aside all the positives, there is also a discussion about whether MEMCsâ€™ bypass could cause an adverse effect for the patients who require immediate resuscitation. Some similar case studies regarding hospital bypassing to trauma centers may preclude the link between the bypass time and the survival in the study of Level I trauma patients.

 </sup> Moreover, patients with severe multiple traumas in the rural areas are suggested for triage and stabilization in Level III EDs before they are transferred to Level I regional trauma centers.

 </sup> In Taiwan, a previous study shows that there are no significant differences in mortality of severe trauma patients between a direct transportation to the study ED and a bypass transfer from another hospital after stabilization.

 </sup> Therefore, the establishment of MEMCs for patient triage, first-aid care, and stabilization before a long journey to hospitals are highly recommended in this research.
