<p class="p">In an MCI, both EMS transportation time and distance have a high impact in a compressed window of emergency medical care when seconds and meters could mean life or death. Issues such as how to reduce the transportation time and distance will always be discussed for efficient solutions.

 </sup> In this research, a method of sequential-conveyance is conducted to promote the EMS transportation time and distance efficiency in 52.15% (app. TEmin) and 56.02% (app. DEmin), respectively, compared with the nonprogrammed conventional method. The findings also show that if all patients were retained in an MEMC, a value of app. TEmax and app. DEmax of 63.22% and 66.88%, respectively, would be obtained.
