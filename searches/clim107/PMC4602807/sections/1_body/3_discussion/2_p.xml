<p class="p">The app. TEmin and app. DEmin plots (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>) show the efficiency of time and distance in the condition of no casualty retention in an MEMC. Patients in this situation are first transported to an MEMC with triage and first-aid treatments and then to different lines of hospitals at once. The process without any patient retention in an MEMC is considered as redundant, regardless the triage and the basic treatment by the medical personnel. A conservative MEMC capacity is determined by a positive or zero value of app. TEmin and app. DEmin, despite the contribution of app. TEmax and app. DEmax. For this case study, the selection of Jiasion elementary school as an MEMC could obtain a negative app. TEmin beyond 128 of patients (
 <italic class="italic">PR</italic> ≅ 0.9481). The lowest value of app. TEmin of the 135 of patients (PR = 1) is –2.41%. This is just a slight negative descent compared with the TEmin plot. The data show that the broad spectrum of the positive app. TEmin in the sequential-conveyance method can result in selecting a good location of the MEMC. In other words, when choosing the Jiasion elementary school as an MEMC, the minimum time efficiency can be kept under a capacity of 128 patients, even if all the casualties may eventually be removed to the requested hospitals without any retention in situ. The additional saved time can be used for triage and first-aid assistance to more patients. For the value of app. DEmin, the negative value begins at 135 of patients wherein –0.34% has been defined. It implies that the selected MEMC has distance ascendancy under a capacity of 134 patients.
