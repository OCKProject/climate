<p class="p">Under the issue of the climate change, a catastrophic calamity of an extreme weather event will force the EMS to do some adjustments for adaptation. It is difficult with a traditional method to manage a large caseload of casualty smoothly and methodically. That is why a systematic adaptation for EMS transportation is suggested because this strategy not only succeeds in efficient emergency transportation, but also highly regulates the distribution of patients to release the overcrowding of the responsible hospitals. Hence, additional practical work should be launched to collect more precise quantitative data.</p>
