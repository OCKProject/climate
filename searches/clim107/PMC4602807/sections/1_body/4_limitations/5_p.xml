<p class="p">The EMS ground transportation is the major scheme for prehospital transferral in Taiwan. Nevertheless, some other disaster response actions may be operated, such as the aerotransportation when the roads are destroyed by weather phenomena such as the heavy rainfall, landslides, earthquakes, and other similar incidents. The concept of the sequential-conveyance method will not be affected by different EMS transportation vehicles because the MEMC will be treated as a relay station for ground and aerotransportation and the computation manners will be changed.</p>
