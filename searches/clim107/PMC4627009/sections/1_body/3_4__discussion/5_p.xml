<p class="p">However, inevitably there are limitations to the Delphi method such as issues with questionnaire design, the selection of experts, subject and researcher bias, and lack of representation, as well as challenges in managing larger groups [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Other methods of gaining consensus do exist including structured expert judgement [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The Delphi survey in this current study was chosen as the method of gaining consensus as its use is recommended when examining less explored topics and identifying/prioritizing issues [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. In addition, exposure to subject bias may be also seen as an advantage as its presence may change other subject’s views, hence generating consensus [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Additionally, Round 2 respondents were exposed to the yield of research questions and areas from Round 1, which would likely reduce promote congruence and reduce confusion.
