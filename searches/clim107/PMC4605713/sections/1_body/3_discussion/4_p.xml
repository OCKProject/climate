<p class="p">The large contrast between our mean estimates of climatic and biotic velocity demonstrates the contrast in magnitude that might be expected between estimates of the climatic tolerances of a species as a whole and estimates that assume a population is narrowly adapted to local climatic conditions. The magnitude of analog-based climatic velocity does depend in part on the parameter that defines how similar two climates must be to be considered as analogous (

In principle, use of a climate bin width as broad as the climatic niche width of the average species could reduce climatic velocity values to a level similar to biotic velocity. In practice, results from such an analysis would be uninformative due to the presence of large regions with zero velocity (
