<p class="p">Recent studies have used local climatic velocity to estimate the movement vectors or paths that would allow organisms to track climatic conditions over broader continental scales [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Such broader-scale context is important for identifying geographic barriers to connectivity under climate change. The nearest-neighbor search method used to develop analog-based climatic velocity does allow sources, destinations, and directional vectors to be identified [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. However, in the analog-based method, identification of the actual paths on the landscape that optimally connect sources and destinations requires additional analysis, for example using corridor delineation software [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Such connectivity analyses may incorporate barriers due to human land use as well as information on climatic gradients [
