<p class="p">Climatic velocity is often seen as a useful surrogate metric for assessment of climate exposure when species-specific information is lacking [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. For example, climatic velocity may be used to assess vulnerability of localized endemic species which have too few observations with which to successfully construct niche models. However, our results suggest that biotic and climatic velocity can serve complementary roles within a conservation planning process even when species-specific information is available. Consideration of climatic velocity can help address conservation of locally-adapted populations, a facet of the extinction crisis that is often ignored in conservation planning [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Comparison of the geographic patterns of biotic and climatic velocity also helps planners distinguish regions where climatic velocity may be an adequate surrogate for climatic threats to biodiversity from regions where biogeographic factors play a greater role in influencing species vulnerability.
