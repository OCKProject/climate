<p class="p">Plotting the hemisphereâ€™s protected areas in terms of the four velocity metrics (
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.g006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>) reveals that most equatorial protected areas are highly vulnerable from the perspective of both forward and backward biotic velocities as well as forward climatic velocity. In contrast, polar protected areas showed a wide range of vulnerability to both climatic velocity and forward biotic velocity, and thus appropriate adaptation strategies will differ more widely in this region. Similar quadrant plots of forward and backward biotic and climatic velocity can be applied at a finer scale to inform regional or local planning efforts.
