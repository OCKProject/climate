<p class="p">The distinction between local and analog-based velocity is also relevant for velocities based on projections from climatic niche models (a type of model based on correlations between species distributions and current climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]). A local metric, termed “bioclimatic” velocity [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], can be calculated based on the modeled probability of species occurrence (inferring habitat suitability). This habitat suitability metric is treated as equivalent to a climate variable in local climatic velocity, in that velocity is derived by dividing the rate of change over time in a continuous habitat suitability metric by the rate of change in that metric within the local neighborhood (
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1C</xref>). In contrast, an analog-based metric, termed “biotic velocity” [

 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], represents the distance between a site and the nearest site projected to be climatically suitable for the species under future projected climates (
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1D</xref>). The metric can be reported on a per-species basis or averaged across a taxa group. Because it is based on a binary classification of the landscape into suitable and unsuitable areas, biotic velocity sacrifices information on local habitat gradients in order to incorporate information on broad-scale patterns in range shifts.
