<p class="p">Previous studies have mapped local or neighborhood-based climatic velocity [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] and disappearing climates [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] at a global scale, as well as distance to future analogous climates in Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Analog-based biotic velocity has been assessed between current and paleoclimates for North American trees [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], and between current and future projected climates for Western Hemisphere mammals [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Local bioclimatic velocity has been analyzed for California tree species [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In this study, we provide the first comparison of analog-based climatic and biotic velocity between current and projected future climate over a broad taxonomic and geographic scope.
