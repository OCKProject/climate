<p class="p">Climatic niche models for the North and South American continents, at 50 km resolution, were drawn from a previously-published study [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], which assessed the potential effects of climate change on distribution of 2954 vertebrate species (1818 birds, 723 mammals, and 413 amphibians) in the Western Hemisphere. Species distribution data were taken from digital range maps for birds [

For birds, only breeding ranges were included. Range maps are scale-dependent abstractions of species distributions which overestimate species’ occurrences [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. However, they are useful in taxonomically comprehensive assessments where point locations of species’ occurrences are unavailable for a subset of the species considered [

 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The 50 km resolution was chosen to strike a balance between inaccuracies due to applying a fine-resolution grid to relatively coarse resolution digital-range maps and inaccuracies due to mapping climate at too coarse a resolution. Niche models were developed using the same 37 bioclimatic variables used in deriving climatic velocity (
