<p class="p">Mean forward and backward climatic velocities (3.58 and 3.52 km/year (SD 2.71 and 2.55 km/year) respectively) were an order of magnitude greater than mean forward and backward biotic velocities (0.433 and 0.480 km/year (SD 0.382 and 0.782 km/year), respectively for all species combined). Whereas mean forward biotic velocity for amphibian species (0.698 km/year (SD 0.710 km/year)) was greater than that for birds and mammals (0.427 and 0.343 km/year, (SD 0.392 and 0.320 km/year) respectively), the reverse was true of backward biotic velocity (0.170, 0.546, 0.495 km/year (SD 0.218, 0.961, and 0.764 km/year) for amphibian, bird, and mammal species, respectively). These standard deviations represent variation across space in mean velocities calculated on a per-cell basis.</p>
