<p class="p">When the standard deviation of species-specific velocities was calculated for each cell and averaged across space, mean values were 0.877 and 1.55 km/year, respectively, for forward and backward biotic velocities. The standard deviation between mean biotic velocities for different GCMs was lower at 0.323 and 0.248 km/year, respectively, for forward and backward biotic velocities.</p>
