<p class="p">Correlation between biotic and climatic velocity was greatest in equatorial regions (
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5 Fig</xref>). Both biotic and climatic velocities were greatest at equatorial latitudes (
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.g004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). Backward biotic velocity was high in both equatorial and polar regions. Forward and backward climatic velocity showed a similar pattern combining a peak in equatorial regions with moderately high velocities in north temperate and polar regions (
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.g004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Ecoregions showing high levels of both forward and backward velocity were concentrated in the northern Amazon Basin and Central America (
