<p class="p">Equation (

 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="" class="xref">2</xref>) arises from planetary rotation, and it makes the large-scale vertical velocity much less sensitive to deviations from a moist adiabatic stratification when compared to small-scale convective updrafts (see the “
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Theory</xref>” and “
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Duration of Precipitation Extremes</xref>” sections). We next turn to the tropics where the dynamical influence of planetary rotation is weaker and where convection is always a key factor for precipitation extremes.
