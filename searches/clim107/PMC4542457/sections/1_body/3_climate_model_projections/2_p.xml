<p class="p">Global models precipitate too frequently with too low a mean precipitation intensity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>], but this does not necessarily mean that they underestimate the intensity of precipitation extremes. For example, in an analysis of 30-year return values of daily precipitation over the conterminous USA, most global climate models were found to overestimate or roughly agree with observations that were conservatively interpolated to the model resolution for comparison [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. (Appropriate interpolation of precipitation is important because of mismatches in time and space scales between models and observations.) One exception was the Community Climate Model System 3 which underestimated the 30-year return values [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>], and increased horizontal resolution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">90</xref>] or use of superparameterization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>] has been shown to improve the representation of the intensity distribution of precipitation in the Community Atmosphere Model versions 2 and 3. The model bias of too-frequent precipitation mentioned above will affect percentiles calculated over only wet days rather than all days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>], even if the extreme events are properly simulated, which suggests that calculating extremes using all days (or all hours) is preferable for comparison of precipitation extremes between models and observations.
