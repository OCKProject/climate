<p class="p">The simplest configuration for which the contributions to changes in precipitation extremes have been analyzed is radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) in a doubly periodic domain [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>]. There are no large-scale dynamics in RCE, and cloud-system resolving models (CRMs) are used to resolve the convective-scale dynamics. Both the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the updraft velocities in the middle and upper troposphere increase with warming in RCE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]; as the atmosphere warms, the thermal stratification remains close to neutral to a strongly entraining plume, and this implies increases in CAPE (calculated based on a non-entraining parcel) and increases in updraft velocities for more weakly entraining plumes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>]. But, the increases in updraft velocities in the upper troposphere do not strongly affect the precipitation extremes, because the factor of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">T, p</italic>) in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1</xref>) gives more weight to the vertical velocities in the lower troposphere in determining the intensity of precipitation extremes. For surface temperatures near those of the present-day tropics, the precipitation extremes increase at close to the thermodynamic rate, and this is close to Clausius-Clapeyron scaling with the surface specific humidity, with relatively small contributions from changes in vertical velocities and precipitation efficiency [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>]. The same behavior is found when convection is organized in a squall line [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>•]. However, for temperatures below 295 K, the precipitation efficiency can change substantially with warming and the scaling of precipitation extremes then depends on the accumulation period considered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>], as discussed in the “
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Duration of Precipitation Extremes</xref>” section.
