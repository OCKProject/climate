<p class="p">According to Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1</xref>), changes in the precipitation rate in extreme events under climate change have a dynamical contribution from changes in 
 <italic class="italic">ω</italic>, a thermodynamic contribution from changes in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> (this is termed thermodynamic since 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> only depends on temperature and pressure), and a microphysical component from changes in the precipitation efficiency 
 <italic class="italic">ε</italic>. Relative humidity does not explicitly appear in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1</xref>), but it can affect precipitation extremes through the dynamics and by helping to set the duration of precipitation events. The fractional increase in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> with warming is influenced by changes in the moist adiabatic lapse rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>] and varies strongly depending on temperature and therefore altitude in the atmosphere. However, for a moist-adiabatic stratification and convergence confined to near the surface, the thermodynamic contribution can be shown to scale in a similar way to near surface specific humidities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>•, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. This scaling is often referred to as Clausius-Clapeyron scaling and gives a sensitivity of 6–7 % K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for typical surface temperatures. More generally, the thermodynamic contribution depends on the weighting of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> by the vertical velocity profile in the vertical integral in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1</xref>), and a range of higher and lower rates of change from the thermodynamic contribution have been found in different simulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>•, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>•]. It is sometimes stated that the dynamical contribution must be positive for a warming climate because of increases in latent heating, but this is not necessarily the case because other factors such as increases in dry static stability or reductions in meridional temperature gradients can counteract the increases in latent heating. Instead, the dynamical contribution is discussed here separately for different dynamical regimes. For example, increases in convective updraft velocities with warming are discussed in the next paragraph, and changes in large-scale vertical velocities in the extratropics are discussed in the “
 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Extratropical Precipitation Extremes</xref>” section using the omega equation.
