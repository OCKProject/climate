<p class="p">Idealized simulations have recently been used to study the response of orographic precipitation extremes to climate warming [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>•, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>•] (see also [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>] for a more general discussion). A striking result from these studies is that there are higher fractional changes in precipitation extremes on the climatological leeward slope of the mountain as compared to the windward slope. Orographic precipitation extremes must be treated as a special case for several reasons. The thermodynamic contribution is influenced by the vertical profile of the vertical velocity (see Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1</xref>), and the shape of this profile will generally be different over a sloped lower boundary than over a flat lower boundary [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>•]. Downstream transport of precipitation means that the local precipitation efficiency can vary strongly over the mountain, and the condensation that leads to leeward precipitation may occur relatively high in the atmosphere where sensitivities to temperature change are greater [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>•]. In addition, changes in vertical velocities are governed by mountain wave dynamics and have been found to be different for extreme precipitation events on the western and eastern slopes of an idealized midlatitude mountain [
