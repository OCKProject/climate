<p class="p">A weakening of orographic rain shadows related to changes in precipitation extremes has previously been noted in simulations of climate warming over North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>]. Further study is needed to assess the role played by the physical factors discussed above in determining changes in orographic precipitation extremes in comprehensive simulations and observations.
