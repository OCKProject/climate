<p class="p">This paper reviews and elaborates on some of the recent research on how climate change affects precipitation extremes, including observed changes in the historical record (“
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Observed Changes in Precipitation Extremes</xref>”), physical theory (“
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Theory</xref>”), climate-model projections (“
 <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Climate-Model Projections</xref>”), orographic precipitation extremes (“
 <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Orographic Precipitation Extremes</xref>”), snowfall extremes (“
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Snowfall Extremes</xref>”), and the duration of precipitation extremes (“
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Duration of Precipitation Extremes</xref>”). The primary focus is on the physical factors that control the intensity of precipitation extremes in different climates. Open questions are discussed throughout and in the “
 <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Conclusions and Open Questions</xref>” section.
