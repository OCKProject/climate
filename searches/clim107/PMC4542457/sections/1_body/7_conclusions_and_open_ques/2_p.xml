<p class="p">Contributions from changes in thermodynamics, dynamics, and precipitation efficiency have all been found to be important for changes in precipitation extremes in at least some situations in modeling studies. The thermodynamic contribution is the easiest to understand and always gives an intensification with warming. There is some basic understanding of dynamical contributions at the large scale from the omega equation (“

 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Duration of Precipitation Extremes</xref>”), but only a few studies have focussed on the role of mesoscale convective organization in precipitation extremes [
