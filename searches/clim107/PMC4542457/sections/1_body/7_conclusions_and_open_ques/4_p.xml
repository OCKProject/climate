<p class="p">Characterizing the dependence of changes in precipitation extremes on duration is of importance for impacts, and this is particularly challenging for subdaily durations. Much research has focussed on precipitation accumulated over fixed time periods as discussed in the “
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Duration of Precipitation Extremes</xref>” section. An alternative approach is to consider properties of contiguous precipitation events that are defined based on when non-zero precipitation begins and ends [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. Consideration of the amount of precipitation in a given event (the event depth) may be advantageous because observed distributions of event depths exhibit a power law range [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">81</xref>] and thus, their response to climate change may be relatively simple to characterize.
