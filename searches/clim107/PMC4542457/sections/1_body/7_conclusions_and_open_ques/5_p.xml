<p class="p">Daily precipitation extremes in the tropics seem to be more sensitive to climate warming than those in the extratropics, as suggested by results from both rain-gauge observations (“
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Observed Changes in Precipitation Extremes</xref>”) and climate-model projections constrained using satellite observations (“
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Tropical Precipitation Extremes</xref>”). One possible cause is a more positive dynamical contribution in the tropics than the extratropics. Changes in extratropical eddy kinetic energy are relatively modest and can be either positive or negative depending on the season and hemisphere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>], whereas increases in the frequency of the most intense tropical cyclones are expected as the climate warms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>], and tropical cyclones contribute substantially to off-equatorial precipitation extremes in the current climate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Furthermore, increases in the activity of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and convectively coupled equatorial Kelvin waves have been found in simulations with conventional and superparameterized climate models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. The influence of these potential dynamical changes on the aggregate statistics of tropical precipitation extremes remains to be assessed.
