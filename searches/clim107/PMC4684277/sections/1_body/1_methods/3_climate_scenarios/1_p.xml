<p class="p">A set of 77 simulations from global climatic models (GCM) was used for syrup production season projections [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], belonging to three greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Simulated daily data, necessary to compute changes in sap flow dates and total production, were obtained for three temporal horizons: 1971–2000 (reference), 2046–2065 (2050 horizon) and 2081–2100 (2090 horizon). To build local climatic scenarios adapted for the projection of future maple syrup production, a post-processing method (“daily translation”) was applied on the raw climate model data variables of daily min and max temperatures and daily precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The required reference database of daily observations needed for the post-processing procedure was obtained from the ~10km x 10km gridded daily data described in Hopkinson et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and Hutchinson et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>].
