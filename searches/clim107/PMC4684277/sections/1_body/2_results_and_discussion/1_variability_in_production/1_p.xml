<p class="p">The average day (Julian day) when the production of syrup started for the reference period ranged from 65 (VAL and STY) to 83 (BSL) between regions (

 <xref rid="pone.0144844.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). A similar range was also observed for the end of the production with average Julian days of 101 and 116 for the same regions, respectively. The average temperature for the period of January to April (T

 <xref rid="pone.0144844.g003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Although such a relationship may appear likely, this is the first time the temperature sensitivity (corresponding to the slope of the relationship shown on 
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.g003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>) of the “phenology” of maple syrup production is quantified. Based on the latter equation, the onset of syrup production is expected to advance by about four days for each degree of warming. This value is in good agreement with reported values of changes in the date of flowering and leafing for many plant species that fall within 2.5 to 5 days for a warming of 1°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Clearly, such a model based on average temperature cannot be used to predict the day at which the season will start for a given year but it can be used to predict the long term changes in the onset of the maple syrup production using only scenarios of annual temperature (see below).
