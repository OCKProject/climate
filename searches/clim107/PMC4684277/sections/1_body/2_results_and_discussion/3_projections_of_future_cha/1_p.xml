<p class="p">The logistic model (
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.e003" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">Eq 2</xref>) was used with the climatic data of 77 scenarios to project future dates of start and end of the season of syrup production, as well as its length. The absolute values as well as the delta (changes as compared to the reference period 1971–2000) are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Depending on the regions, the logistic model predicts that the start and end of the production season will occur 9–13 days, and 15–19 days earlier for the 2046–2065 and 2081–2100 periods respectively, as compared to the reference period (
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Given that changes in season start and end of production dates are nearly similar, the simulations predict no changes in season length for the 2046–2065 period and only a small (1–2 days) but insignificant increase for the 2081–2100 period. Overall the magnitude of the changes predicted here are coherent with the results of Skinner et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] who predicted shifts in the sap season in the order of 15 and 30 days for 2100 using only the B1 and A1fi climate change scenarios, respectively. The B1 scenario is more similar to the median scenario used in our simulations while the A1fi scenario is one of the most extreme in terms of increased temperature which explains the particularly strong changes (30 days) in season timing obtained with the latter scenario.
