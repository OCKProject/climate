The displacement in time of the first day of production (panel B) was also comparable in terms of dispersion (similar variability and range) and both models yielded identical average displacements of -17.5 ± 7 days (n = 847). A strong correlation between the numbers of days of displacement was not expected (as compared to day of start, panel A) since there is no major regional differences in the projection of displacement (

The large number of simulations as well as the very good agreement of the two models which are based on different and weakly interrelated variables, suggest a robust assessment of the projected changes in the future. The results mean that sugar maple trees, as well as syrup producers, must adapt to seasons that will start earlier than at present which appears plausible given that past observations included some very early and very late seasons.
