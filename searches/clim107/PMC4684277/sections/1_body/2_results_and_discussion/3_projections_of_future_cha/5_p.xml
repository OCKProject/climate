<p class="p">The data for the VAL region also show that a few simulations for the 2081–2100 period are projecting years with short seasons (1–3 weeks), or even no season at all (
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.g005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 5C</xref>; red lines crossing the Y axis—intercept = 0 means no season). These rare events will correspond to “extreme” years in a climate where the average start of the season for the VAL region will be displaced by 19 days (
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). These events will be more frequent for the southernmost regions (data not shown), where the climate is already warmer but since their absolute frequency is still projected to be small, no significant impacts on between year variability are projected. Interestingly, such effect (quasi-absence of a season resulting in a low syrup yield) was already observed in several US states [
