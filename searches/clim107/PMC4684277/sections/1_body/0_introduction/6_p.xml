<p class="p">This paper aims at investigating the impact of climate change on the timing and duration of the sap season. To date, the temporal variability of syrup yield has been studied mainly on an annual basis [

 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], or on finer temporal scales (days) but for only one specific site at a time for a one-year period [

 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. As a result, models capable of taking into account the variability in fine temporal scales and regional differences in timing of the sap season are still lacking. Here, we use a weekly data set of maple syrup production from 121 sugar maple producers located in 11 regions of Qu√©bec for a period of 13 years along with climate data to build models of maple syrup production timing. These models are then used to make projections of the impact of climate change on the timing (beginning and end) of maple syrup production based on 77 climate change scenarios issued from global climate models. We hypothesize that the period of syrup production will occur sooner in spring and that it will become more variable between years.
