<p class="p">Because of the close links between climate and maple syrup production, climatic change is likely to have a strong impact on the industry [

 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Predicted climate change effects for north eastern North-America include an increase in annual temperature and precipitation which will be particularly strong during winter, as well as a reduction in the duration of the snow cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Below freezing winter temperatures must last long enough for the tree to begin the dehardening process necessary for the beginning of sap production [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]; should this period become too short, tree physiology and vigor could be affected which would reduce sap production. Although no significant trends are projected in the number of freeze/thaw cycles [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], the period of the year where the frequency of those cycles is at its peak is expected to happen sooner in the season. The possible impacts of these changes on maple syrup production are many. Because of its dependence on freeze/thaw cycles, the production season should occur earlier in time [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Duchesne et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]suggested that the period of sugar maple production will have to be shifted 12 and 19 days earlier in 2050 and 2100 respectively, in order to capture the optimum climatic conditions necessary to maintain the syrup production at its current level.
