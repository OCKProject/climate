<p class="p">Finally, we classified initiatives as addressing health risks identified by the IPCC (see

 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. For documents to be included in our analysis, they had to be a governmental document or webpage and report planned, in progress or completed adaptation initiatives addressing the health impact of climate change on humans. We collected data in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and performed descriptive statistics. To examine whether health adaptation is jurisdictionally patterned, we compared adaptation between jurisdictions. We also compared adaptation of municipalities and regional health authorities (or equivalent) in encompassing provinces to explore the effect of provincial and territorial adaptation on municipal adaptation. Based on the information available in academic literature and in the vulnerability assessments conducted by Health Canada and Natural Resources Canada [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], we identified the projected health impacts of climate change in Canadian provinces and territories, outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-ijerph-12-00623" class="xref">Section 2</xref>. As part of our analysis we then examined what percentage of the identified projected health risks are addressed by provinces and territoriesin their adaptation initiatives available online.
