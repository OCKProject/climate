<p class="p">We documented details of discrete adaptation initiatives found in included documents, including year, implementing body, adaptation type, adaptation stage, health vulnerability addressed, completion status, and consideration of vulnerable groups. Adaptation type refers to the following six adaptation categories adapted from Biagini

 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>], adaptation 
 <italic class="italic">stage</italic> refers to either: groundwork actions which build adaptive capacity, prepare the conditions for adaptation, or enable adaptation actions; or adaptation actions which indicate action has actually been taken to reduce a populationâ€™s health vulnerability or increase resilience. Groundwork actions can be further classified as information and vulnerability assessment adaptation types, while adaptation actions are warning and observing systems, and practice and behaviour initiatives. Capacity building and management, planning and policy adaptation types could be classified as either groundwork or adaptation actions, depending on the characteristics of the discrete initiative.
