 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00623-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> shows the level of health adaptation in Canadian provinces and territories ranked qualitatively by number of initiatives found online, addressing identified regional health risks, having an adaptation plan with a health section, level of detail, and availability of climate change information on health department websites. A middle-pack of provinces and territories emerges, consisting of New Brunswick, Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, and Ontario. These provinces and territories each report implementing three to six health adaptation initiatives, but vary in levels of detail, comprehensiveness and risks addressed. Lastly, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, and Yukon have each reported three or fewer health adaptation initiatives independently (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have jointly implemented three initiatives), address few or none of the identified regional health risks, and provide limited detail.
