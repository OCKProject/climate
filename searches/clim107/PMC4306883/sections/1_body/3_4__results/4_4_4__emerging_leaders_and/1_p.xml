<p class="p">Based on our analysis of publically available information, Quebec emerged as the leader in provincial and territorial health adaptation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00623-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). The province has a comprehensive climate change adaptation plan with a detailed health section, addresses most regional health risks and has a diverse assortment of adaptation types.

Similar to the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Program (UKCIP), Ouranos functions as a boundary organization that seeks to bridge science and policy to increase engagement of decision-makers, build adaptive capacity and create a network of knowledge [
