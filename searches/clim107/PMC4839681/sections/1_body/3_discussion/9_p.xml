<p class="p">The identified growth-climate response shifts in our study, which occurred only within the past 40 to 50 years, most likely indicate impacts of the ongoing climate change on juniper growth in Central Asia. We therefore stress the importance of long-term conservation measures to counteract possible losses or reductions of the mountain juniper forest ecosystems in UZ and KG. Our findings also highlight the need of time-dependency analyses in paleo-climatological studies when using high elevation juniper trees, as well as the integration of growth-climate response shifts when assessing and predicting vegetation dynamics in Central Asia.</p>
