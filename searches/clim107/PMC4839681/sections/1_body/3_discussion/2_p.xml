<p class="p">It is important to note that the CRU grid points (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), might not fully represent local climate conditions. By comparing observations from the closest available meteorological stations (average linear distance of ~ 29 km from the sampling sites) in KG and UZ [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] for the baseline period 1961–1990, absolute annual temperatures derived from the CRU grid point data were on average lower (2.3°C) than those obtained from the stations. This is especially evident in winter where the temperature differences were up to 3.3°C, whereas summer temperatures differed only by 1.5°C. For precipitation, overall drier conditions were observed in the CRU data compared to the instrumental data, especially during summer, with an average of 40 mm less rainfall. However, it is also not expected that even meteorological station data might fully represent the climate condition at the sampling sites due to differences in elevation, as discussed by Seim 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Nevertheless, overall long-term trends in temperature and precipitation anomalies for the CRU and station data are in high agreement as shown by Harris
