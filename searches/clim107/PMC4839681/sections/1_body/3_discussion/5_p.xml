<p class="p">The observed changes in climate during the past ~80 years are in accordance with previous findings for Central Asia (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]). Our results confirm a spatially uniform temperature increase while trends in precipitation regimes are highly diverse across the study region. Shifts in climatic means are additionally enhanced by feedback mechanisms such as increased evaporation due to rising temperatures, changes in snow cover (depth and duration) and in glacier resources [

 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], the observed climatic trends and patterns across Central Asia are most likely attributed to 1) feedback mechanisms with the diverse topography and land use [

In the latter case, our 1982â€“2011 period concurs with an exceptionally strong positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation since the 1980s, which contributed to higher than normal winter temperatures, not only in northern Europe, but also in Central Asia [
