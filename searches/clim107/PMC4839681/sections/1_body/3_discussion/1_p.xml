<p class="p">Our sampling strategy was to include junipers from all age classes within the forest and at stands along different altitudinal gradients, resulting in a new and substantial TRW network for eastern UZ and the whole of KG. At some sites and regions, old and slow-grown trees were found such as at KS (Naryn, KG) or ZNP-JUSE (UZ) with chronologies extending back to AD 1269 and 1482 (un-truncated;

 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century. At both sites, single juniper individuals with ages of ~470 years (AE) and ~350 years (KM) were found. However, strong differences in growth variations between old and young trees hampered successful crossdating, and TRW measurements of those old trees were excluded in this study, restricting our common period to 1935â€“2011.
