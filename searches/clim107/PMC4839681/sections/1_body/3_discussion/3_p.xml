<p class="p">By choosing two climatological periods at each end of this time window, we detected changes in climate and in the climate sensitivity of the juniper trees. However, less distinct results were obtained when using variations in juniper growth since the trees respond not only to sudden changes in climate but also to human impacts, stand dynamics (i.e. competition) and other abiotic and biotic disturbance factors [
