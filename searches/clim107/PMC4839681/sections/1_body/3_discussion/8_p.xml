 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], are likely to increase the risk of forest decline, starting at lower elevations [

Moreover, upslope shifts of the juniper forests due to increased tree mortality can be expected, which can occur rapidly and over large areas, as observed for a semi-arid ecotone in northern New Mexico after a severe drought event [
