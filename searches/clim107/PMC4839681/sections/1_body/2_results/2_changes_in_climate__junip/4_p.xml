<p class="p">Regarding the spatial precipitation responses, all regions except Karakuldja (southern KG) showed increased positive correlations in 1982–2011 compared to 1935–1964 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g005" class="xref">Fig 5C</xref>), although this was manifested in different ways. Junipers in the east of our study area, e.g. in Chimgan (UZ), showed increases in the positive correlations with precipitation, i.e. at B1H from 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.14 to 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.56 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;0.01) or ML from 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.17 to 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.53 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;0.01). However, for junipers in Karakol (eastern KG), where growth was limited by high precipitation during 1935–1964, decreasing precipitation amounts led to improved growing conditions in recent decades. Significant changes in correlation values were found for all three sites but especially for AY (from 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = -0.36 to 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.18) and ADJ (from 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = -0.43 to 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = -0.08) (
