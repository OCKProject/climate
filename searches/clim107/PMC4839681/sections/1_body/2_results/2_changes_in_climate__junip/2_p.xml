<p class="p">Changes in annual tree growth using detrended TRW indices indicated slight but significant (

On the other hand, no changes or even slight decreases in annual growth were observed at the lower elevation sites in Zaamin (UZ) and at sites in Sari Chelek and Naryn (KG). However, considering the temporal variability among the individual TRW chronologies over the last decades (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s004" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>), those values might not be fully representative. Changes in growth patterns at interannual to decadal time scales, most likely related to anthropogenic impacts, were observed at B2H (Chimgan, UZ) and KAnw (Kyrgyz Ata, KG) (
