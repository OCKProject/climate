TRW in KAnw (Kyrgyz Ata, KG), TOH (Karakuldja, KG) and ADJ (Karakol, KG) was positively correlated with temperature, while TRW in SK (Chimgan, UZ), TLL (Karakuldja, KG), SH1 and ARN (both Naryn, KG) showed distinct precipitation associations at monthly to seasonal scales (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). The remaining 26 sites exhibited either a mixed climate response or changing responses over the course of the year. Strong responses to drought, expressed as negative/positive correlations with temperature/precipitation at the same time, were observed for ZNP-JUSE (Zaamin, UZ) and most of the sites in Naryn, central KG, especially in summer but also during the entire vegetation period (
