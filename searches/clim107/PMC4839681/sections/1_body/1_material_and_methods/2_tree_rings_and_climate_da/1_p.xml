<p class="p">From all 1069 trees, a minimum of two cores per tree were extracted and 1882 samples were annually dated following standard dendrochronological procedures [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], described in detail in Seim 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. For the development of the individual site TRW chronologies, we first eliminated biases caused by temporally uneven sample replication by applying a power transformation [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] to each raw TRW series. Dimensionless indices were computed as residuals and age-induced growth trends were removed by applying flexible age-dependent splines [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] using the software ARSTAN [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. This data-adaptive and, at the same time, deterministic standardization procedure uses splines that become progressively inflexible with increasing tree age [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The variance of each final site chronology was stabilized [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] based on the interseries correlation (Rbar) [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], and we used robust biweight means of the power transformed, variance stabilized, TRW indices, for which the pooled autoregressive properties of the sites were retained. We truncated each chronology at a replication of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) &lt; 5 series. The Expressed Population Signal (EPS) [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] as a measure for the common signal strength of a chronology is also provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref> for the overall common AD 1935â€“2011 period. It should be noted that for Zaamin (UZ), three composite chronologies for the three subspecies were developed from eight sites (see details in Seim 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]), which were subjected to the above mentioned procedure and used in this study.
