<p class="p">Based on the 1935–2011 period common to all TRW data, we compared climate, tree growth and the growth-climate relationship from the earliest, 1935–1964, to the most recent, 1982–2011 period. This was done to attempt to find a causal link between juniper growth and climate response to observed changes in climate during the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century. For the climate data, anomalies of temperature and precipitation from each CRU grid point were used to produce means for the most contrasting seasons: for winter (previous year December to current year February, pDJF) and summer (June–August, JJA). Changes in juniper growth were calculated by averaging the TRW indices over the two 30-year periods. We used Pearson correlation statistics to investigate the growth-climate relationships for the full 1935–2011 and the two shorter (1935–1964, 1982–2011) sub-periods. This was done using monthly climate values, as well as the seasonal temperature means and precipitation sums. Additionally, both TRW chronologies and climate data were high-pass filtered using a 10 year spline to investigate the growth-climate relationship during summer in the high-frequency domain.
