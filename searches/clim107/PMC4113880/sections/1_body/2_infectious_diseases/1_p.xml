<p class="p">Extreme weather events, such as heavy precipitation, are one of the hallmarks of global climate change. Runoff from such precipitation events can result in microbial transport and contamination of coastal water with implications to public health [

Extreme rain events occurring the previous day were significantly associated with beach closures but not with GI-related hospital admissions. Coastal areas are also at risk for importation of competent disease vectors through cargo shipment. Freight containers (containing used tires or ornamental plants) can harbour the Asian tiger mosquito (
 <italic class="italic">Aedes albopictus</italic>) which is a vector for dengue and chikungunya. A paper by Thomas 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., in this issue describes freight container imports into areas in Europe that are climatically suitable for the vector

 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The authors model the quantity of cargo imports from areas where the mosquito is endemic into harbours and further dissemination through inland waterways; current and future climatic suitability of the destination area are overlaid to model the long-term establishment of the mosquito.
