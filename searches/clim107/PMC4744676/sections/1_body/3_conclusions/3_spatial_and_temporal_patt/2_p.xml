<p class="p">We show observation biases concerning the regions where highly cited ocean change research is conducted and how this varies among disciplines. In particular, Southern Hemisphere ocean basins (e.g., the South Atlantic and Pacific, Indian, and Southern Ocean) were characterized by a general lack of ocean change research, especially relative to their large proportional surface area of the global ocean. Human development (which “remains a composite index that measures progress in three basic dimensions – health, knowledge and income”, 2014 UN Human Development Reports: 
 <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries" class="ext-link" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries</span>) and technological capacity are highest in Western Europe, North America, and Australia and may partially explain geographic biases of greater research focus (by nearly 3×) in the Northern Hemisphere. Greater human development in Australia and parts of South America (e.g., Chile) may contribute to the relatively high prevalence of benthic studies, focused on coral reefs and kelp forests, in the South Pacific. Additionally, we focused on the most frequently cited papers, which may impose geographic biases due to citation patterns. There may be higher citation potential in areas where there are more researchers, such as the North Atlantic or Mediterranean. However, similar geographic biases have been described elsewhere in the biological impacts literature, such as the predominance of biological change studies in more temperate (Wernberg

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) waters, especially the northeast Atlantic basin (Hoegh‐Guldberg

 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) note that a geographic bias in the Northern Hemisphere was not as prominent in a review of the marine compared to terrestrial range shift literature. Our study highlights finer regional and thematic biases than previous studies and also offers direct comparisons between studies with abiotic and biological focus. For example, we show that the proportion of studies from each discipline was more similar in the North and South Atlantic and Pacific basins than other regions. The more representative coverage among disciplines, in addition to an overall greater geographic focus, suggests that studies in the North Atlantic and Pacific basin may have more power for ecosystem‐wide or cross‐disciplinary investigations than elsewhere.
