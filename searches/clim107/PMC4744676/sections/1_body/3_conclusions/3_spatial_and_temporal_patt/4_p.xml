<p class="p">Studies covering physical/chemical signals of ocean change were typically the longest running and covered the largest study areas. A relatively small number of biological ocean change studies were conducted on similarly broad scales. The emerging field of ocean acidification (examining a suite of changes in OA including pH, aragonite saturation, and pCO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>) was often conducted on smaller scales and had a much shorter temporal record (median = 10.5 year) relative to other physical/chemical studies with median durations ranging from 2× (sea ice) to nearly 5× (SST) longer. Physical records like SST, sea level height, and sea ice are largely drawn from worldwide networks of autonomous sensors (e.g., Argo floats), interpolation of data from cruises, or derived from satellite measurements over particular geographic regions (global oceans in the former and polar regions in the latter). Such approaches allow data to be collected across wide areas and over extended durations. Long‐term physical and chemical records are essential to understanding climate variability, especially when detecting and attributing biological responses to climate change (Hoegh‐Guldberg
