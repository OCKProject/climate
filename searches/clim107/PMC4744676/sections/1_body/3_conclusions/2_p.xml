<p class="p">Our comprehensive review of highly cited literature revealed that current discourse on ocean change is shaped by potential research biases, disciplinary differences in research scope, and numerous research gaps. We identify several regions, taxa, physical and chemical stressors, types of biological responses, and scale issues warranting increased investigation and reporting to better inform ecosystem‐based and interdisciplinary research, and to improve interpretation of climate change in marine systems (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). Our synthesis suggests certain taxa are relatively understudied, such as archaea, bacteria, and viruses that serve critical roles in marine ecosystems and will likely be affected by climate change in unknown ways (Pörtner 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). While other studies have also diagnosed regional biases and mismatches in scales for marine biological responses (e.g., Poloczanska 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Hoegh‐Guldberg 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), our review is distinctive by simultaneously comparing and contrasting both abiotic and biotic ocean change studies. It is our intent that the findings of this review will be used to inform future directions of ocean change research. For example, our review and others (e.g., Hoegh‐Guldberg 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) illustrate that some geographic regions have been extensively studied by several disciplines (e.g., North Atlantic and North Pacific), often for extended durations. We suggest these regions are fertile grounds for integrative studies that extend beyond single‐species examinations of climate change and incorporate potential effects of multiple stressors (e.g., Large 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), ultimately improving our ability to understand climate‐related ecosystem‐level changes (Pörtner 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In the remainder of this section, we will discuss other ways in which our findings can be applied to future research efforts to support marine climate change research that can be compared across biotic and abiotic disciplines.
