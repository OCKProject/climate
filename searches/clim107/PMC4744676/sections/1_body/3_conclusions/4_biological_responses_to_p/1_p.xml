<p class="p">Our review indicates a strong reliance on laboratory experimentation to estimate biological responses to physical and chemical marine changes that occur in the field. This is particularly true for plankton and benthic invertebrates that are more easily cultivated and maintained in laboratory settings compared to large or highly mobile vertebrates. Laboratory studies typically are performed at small spatial and temporal scales and under controlled conditions that are not capable of mimicking the complexity of natural environments. For instance, over half of the biological papers considering OA effects on organisms were conducted in the laboratory because seawater chemistry can be manipulated more easily in a controlled environment. However, OA expresses complicated natural patterns of variability (Hofmann

Short‐term controlled studies of biological responses to chemical changes can provide direct measures of organismal responses; however, these studies are not easily scaled up or extrapolated to long‐term or ecosystem‐level effects (Wahl
