<p class="p">Social science disciplines also warrant focus in studies of ocean change and are highly relevant to considerations of current and future changes in the marine environment. Although beyond the scope of our review, marine climate change clearly affects social systems and how individuals and communities are responding to ocean change (e.g., McCay

 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). A growing body of literature is developing to assess the effects of ocean changes on social–ecological systems. Like the other papers reviewed here, this literature varies greatly in terms of temporal and spatial scales and themes addressed. A notable difference between the social–ecological literature and the papers reviewed in this study is that the former tends to focus on projected responses and how ocean change will influence human society in the future (e.g., Cooley &amp; Doney, 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Kelly 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011b</xref>), whereas the latter tends to address changes that have already occurred. Thus, these social–ecological studies introduce another set of spatial and temporal scales as well as levels of complexity, moving beyond climate change impacts to marine biodiversity but also to human societies associated with the ocean.
