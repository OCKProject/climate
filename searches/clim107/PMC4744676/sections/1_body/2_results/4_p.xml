<p class="p">Spatial and temporal scales of 377 highly cited ocean change studies were examined after laboratory studies were removed. Both spatial and temporal scales varied greatly among the physical/chemical discipline and biological subdisciplines, making it difficult to detect trends in the data beyond the predominance of physical and chemical studies at the largest spatial scales (Fig.

 <xref rid="gcb12978-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). Nonparametric analysis indicated a significant difference in the distributions of both spatial (Kruskal–Wallis test, 
 <italic class="italic">P </italic>&lt; 0.001) and temporal (Kruskal–Wallis test, 
 <italic class="italic">P </italic>&lt; 0.001) scales across disciplines. A cluster analysis revealed two distinct clusters based on both the temporal and spatial scale factors shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a. These two clusters were statistically different in terms of study area and duration (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, 
 <italic class="italic">P </italic>&lt; 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). The ‘small‐scale’ cluster (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 195) was primarily comprised of ocean change studies that occurred at smaller spatial scales (median = 100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and over shorter durations (median = 7 years). The ‘large‐scale’ cluster (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 163) was comprised of studies that occurred at larger spatial scales (median = 1.4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and over longer durations (median = 31 years). Nearly three quarters of studies in the large‐scale cluster were from the physical/chemical discipline, while the remaining one‐quarter was predominately comprised of vertebrate studies (18%). In contrast, 84% of the studies in the small‐scale cluster were from the biological subdisciplines: benthic communities (33%), vertebrates (31%), and plankton communities (20%).
