<p class="p">Considerable variation in both study duration and area was observed across the abiotic and biotic groups and among themes within each discipline or subdiscipline (Fig.

 <xref rid="gcb12978-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). Temporal scales ranged from studies lasting &lt;1 day (e.g., kelp, phytoplankton, and seagrass in Staehr &amp; Wernberg,

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Highly cited plankton studies were conducted over the shortest temporal scales with a median duration of approximately 1 year. While study durations were primarily ≤1 year for archaeo‐ and bacterioplankton, durations were often several years for phyto‐, virio‐ and zooplankton studies. For benthic communities, seagrass studies were of the shortest duration and coral reef studies were the longest, with nearly half of the coral reef studies lasting a decade or more. Vertebrate studies were typically of longer duration than studies of plankton or benthos and exhibited relatively less variation. The longest temporal scales occurred among the physical/chemical oceanography themes, with studies of oxygen, sea level height, and sea surface temperature (SST) often lasting several decades. Approximate study areas ranged from the smallest (0.002 km

 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) to global‐scale studies (~361 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), including two proxy studies of viral and phytoplankton abundance (i.e., Martinez

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and several studies of SST and sea level height (e.g., Willis

 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). For plankton communities, studies on archaea and bacteria were typically conducted under small spatial scales of around 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, but a few studies of viruses were conducted over the largest spatial scales (multiregional to global). Zooplankton studies incorporated large‐scale continuously sampled plankton studies. With the exception of coral reef and some kelp forest studies, benthic communities papers tended to cover the smallest study areas. Marine vertebrate studies were of intermediate spatial scales. Studies of mammals and fish were of similarly large spatial scales and averaged two orders of magnitude larger than studies on marine birds and turtles. Consistent with the temporal data, physical/chemical studies typically had the largest spatial scales, often spanning areas more than an order of magnitude larger than other studies in other subdisciplines.
