<p class="p">We reviewed a total of 461 ocean change peer‐reviewed papers, including 311 papers from biological subdisciplines (i.e., ‘benthic communities’, ‘vertebrates’, and ‘plankton communities’) and 150 from the physical/chemical oceanographic discipline. There were not always five papers available within each year for all designated themes, resulting in the review of fewer than 30 papers for some themes. In such instances, these papers were not only the most highly cited in that year, but also the only papers found. There was complete coverage (i.e., 30 papers per theme) of the physical/chemical discipline, but incomplete coverage of ocean change studies for all plankton themes, some benthic themes, and some vertebrate themes (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Number of citations per paper ranged among disciplines and themes, with the physical/chemical discipline attracting up to 1128 citations (i.e., for the ‘sea ice’ theme) compared to a maximum of 306 citations for the ‘zooplankton’ theme in the plankton communities subdiscipline (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>).
