<p class="p">Primary stressors associated with each biological theme varied considerably (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). Temperature was the main stressor examined in plankton communities (61%) and was commonly examined across all benthic communities (35%) and vertebrate (45%) themes. Within benthic communities, the mangrove theme was unique in largely focusing on the effects of sea level height. Moreover, mangroves were the only theme for which atmospheric carbon dioxide was considered; this could be because they are directly vulnerable to both marine and atmospheric stressors. With the exception of mangroves, OA was the main stressor examined in benthic communities (52%). In particular, more than 50% of the rocky/sandy bottom and coral reef studies examined biological responses to OA. In contrast, fish studies were the only vertebrate theme investigating OA, all of which were conducted in the laboratory. With the exception of sea turtles, all vertebrate themes examined sea ice as a stressor, with mammal studies in particular having a strong focus on sea ice impacts (88% of mammal studies).
