<p class="p">We identified 11 categories of primary physical and chemical stressors among the biological response studies: atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate indices (e.g., Pacific decadal oscillation), dissolved oxygen, ocean acidification (e.g., pH, alkalinity, pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), salinity, sea ice, sea level height, storms and precipitation, temperature (including SST, bottom temperature, or occasionally air temperature), upwelling processes, and secondary effects of physical changes (e.g., changes in physical habitat due to changes in temperature and chemistry). Most studies examined a response to a single stressor (59%; Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Two stressors were occasionally studied (30%), and three or more were rarely studied (11%). Vertebrate studies examined multiple stressors more frequently than the other two biological subdisciplines. There was no association between the number of stressors examined and year of publication (Fig.
