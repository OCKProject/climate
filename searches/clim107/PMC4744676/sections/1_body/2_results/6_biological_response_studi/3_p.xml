<p class="p">The most frequent primary stressor considered among all three biological subdisciplines was temperature (44%; Fig.

 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Ocean acidification (‘OA’) was the second most common primary stressor studied (36%). While the effects of OA were studied across all three biological subdisciplines, it was primarily examined in studies of benthic communities. Studies considering the effects of sea ice were largely focused on vertebrates. The other eight primary stressors constituted &lt;10% of the biological response studies with salinity, upwelling, and dissolved oxygen being the least studied stressors. Laboratory studies were used to examine the biological responses of a variety of stressors, including climate indices, dissolved oxygen, acidification, salinity, and temperature. Laboratory experiments involving OA were particularly common (65% of laboratory studies), followed by temperature (28%).
