<p class="p">Geographically, we identified biases in the global distribution of highly cited ocean change studies that were not proportional to regional ocean surface area (Eakins &amp; Sharman, 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). For example, the North and South Pacific basins cover the greatest proportion of the Earth's ocean surface (21% and 25%, respectively), yet did not represent the most frequently studied regions in our review (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Instead, the North Atlantic basin (12% of the global ocean surface) accounted for the greatest number (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 96, 21%) of highly cited ocean change studies, followed by the Arctic basin (area = 4.3%; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 67, 15%). The Mediterranean Sea, making up &lt;1% of the ocean surface, was also frequently studied (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 26, 6% of studies) relative to its total surface area. Arctic studies were dominated by physical (sea ice) and vertebrate (primarily marine mammal) studies, whereas there was a more equal representation of all physical/chemical and biological disciplines among highly cited studies performed in the North Atlantic. The dominance of benthic studies in the Mediterranean was due to the abundance of shallow, coastal volcanic carbon dioxide vents providing natural sites to study the effects of acidification on benthic communities (e.g., Hall‐Spencer

 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Rodolfo‐Metalpa 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Relative to their expansive spatial coverage, the Indian (20% surface area) and South Pacific basins (25% surface area) were studied less frequently (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 14, 3% and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 59, 13%, respectively) and studies in those regions were primarily focused on coastal benthic communities. The South Atlantic (11% surface area) and Southern Ocean (6% surface area) were also poorly represented among the papers we reviewed (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 11, 2% and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 20, 4%, respectively), but had more equal representation from the four physical/chemical and biological disciplines, with the exception of the benthic communities subdiscipline in the Southern Ocean. Benthic studies were nearly absent from the highly cited ocean change research in polar regions.
