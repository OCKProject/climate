<p class="p">This study examines the complex relationships between farmer beliefs about climate change, risk perceptions, trust in key institutions, and attitudes toward adaptive and mitigative actions. It does so through analysis of data from a state-wide survey of Iowa farmers to answer the following research questions: (1) Do farmers believe that climate change is occurring, and if so, to what do they attribute it?; (2) Does differential trust in agricultural and environmental interest groups influence those beliefs?; (3) Do variations in farmer understanding of climate change influence levels of perceived risk?; (4) Do levels of perceived risk predict support for adaptive and mitigative action?; and, (5) Do predictors of support for adaptive action differ from predictors of support for mitigation? We use structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess the relationships between trust, belief, perceived risk, and support for action.</p>
