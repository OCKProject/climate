<p class="p">Beliefs and risk perceptions regarding climate change are particularly unsettled. Whereas scientific understanding of climate change is firmly established—it is occurring, it is due primarily to human activities, and it poses potentially serious risks to human society and natural systems (
 <xref rid="bibr54-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">NRC, 2010b</xref>)—public understanding of the phenomenon varies widely (

 <xref rid="bibr51-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McCright &amp; Dunlap, 2011b</xref>) highlight a number of factors that explain variance in U.S. public perspectives on the issue. Climate change is difficult for a general public to understand because the causes (GHGs) are invisible and signals and impacts are diffuse and difficult to predict or interpret correctly, especially at local levels and human time scales (

 <italic class="italic">associative and affective models</italic> of cognition that are evolutionarily older and rooted more in feeling than in scientific facts (

 <xref rid="bibr75-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weber &amp; Stern, 2011</xref>). Finally, because climate change is difficult to understand based on personal experience, the public must rely on indirect sources of information on climate change, which can be manipulated by actors with disparate interests (

  <p class="p" xmlns="">public confronted with complex physical phenomena that cannot be understood without mediated knowledge, subject to normal cognitive and affective limitations, and surrounded by a politicized struggle to shape understanding that is amplified by polarized media that offer knowledge claims congenial to selected audiences’ goals, values, and worldviews.
