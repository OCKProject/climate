<p class="p">Given that erroneous public understanding of climate change has been proposed as an important roadblock to public action (
 <xref rid="bibr75-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weber &amp; Stern, 2011</xref>), it may be that inconsistencies in the measurement of public understanding of climate change is a barrier to better understanding of the relationships between beliefs and behavior/policy support. While use of straightforward measures of beliefs about climate change and its causes are common in public polling on the issue (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bibr44-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leiserowitz, Maibach, &amp; Roser-Renouf, 2011</xref>) or used as dependent variables (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bibr50-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McCright &amp; Dunlap, 2011a</xref>), they are rarely used as predictors of policy support or behavior. Thus, most attempts to improve our understanding of the links between beliefs about climate change and behavioral and policy responses have used indirect rather than direct measures of belief and attribution. In other words, measures such as knowledge that N

As noted above, direct measures of belief and attribution have been used in surveys: It is known that some people strongly believe that climate change is occurring and attribute it to human activity, others do not believe that it is happening, and still others are uncertain (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bibr46-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Maibach et al., 2009</xref>). Such direct measures of climate change belief are not, however, commonly employed as predictors in multivariate modeling of behavior, support for policy, or other social action.
