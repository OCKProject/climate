<p class="p">While the U.S. general public’s understanding of climate change has been studied in some depth, little research has examined farmer perceptions about climate change and accompanying risk (

However, farmer attitudes toward the actions that might be required to adapt agriculture to changes in climate as well as decrease agriculture’s GHG emissions are largely unknown. As 
 <xref rid="bibr32-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Howden et al. (2007)</xref> emphasize, if farmers do not believe that climate change is happening or do not perceive it as a threat, they will not likely undertake adaptive or mitigative actions. Given the evidence that belief in and perceived risks from hazards are necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for action, and the predicted threats that climate change poses to sustainable production of food and energy, an improved understanding of farmer beliefs and risk perceptions associated with climate change is urgently needed. In particular, it is critically important to understand what factors shape attitudes toward responses to climate change (
