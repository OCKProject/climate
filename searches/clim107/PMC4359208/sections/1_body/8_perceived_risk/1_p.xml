<p class="p">Perceived risk has been a central focus of research on response to climate change. Risk perception corresponds to beliefs about “adverse consequences for valued objects” (AC) and is central to the VBN framework (
 <xref rid="bibr65-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stern, 2000</xref>, p. 412). Risk perception has generally been measured as an individual’s assessment of the potential health, economic, and general environmental consequences of climate change at local, regional, and global levels (

Results of empirical research examining the relationships between perceived risk and public responses to climate change have been consistent in terms of significance and predictive power. Whether the dependent variable is mitigation policy preferences (
