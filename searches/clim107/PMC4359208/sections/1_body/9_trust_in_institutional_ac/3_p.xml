<p class="p">The recognition that public understanding of climate change is mediated by intermediary sources has led to the use of variables measuring trust in such entities as predictors of policy support. 
 <xref rid="bibr78-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zahran et al. (2006)</xref> found that confidence in the competence of the EPA, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the IPCC to “solve the problem of climate change” predicted support for climate change policy. 
 <xref rid="bibr17-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dietz et al. (2007)</xref> found that generalized trust in government agencies and scientists working for the government was a positive predictor of climate policy support, while trust in industry (oil companies, coal companies, and scientists working for industry) was negatively associated. 
 <xref rid="bibr57-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Connor et al. (1999)</xref> found the degree to which survey respondents believed that government is a “helpful” institution predicted higher levels of willingness to endorse climate change mitigation policy. Thus, research suggests that trust in entities that are working to address climate change is associated with support for climate change policy, while trust in actors that have historically opposed action on climate change (i.e., industry) is associated with negative attitudes toward such action.
