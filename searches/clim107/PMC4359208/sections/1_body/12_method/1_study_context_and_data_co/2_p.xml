<p class="p">Agriculture also emits a disproportionately high percentage of Iowa’s overall GHGs relative to other states. Whereas agriculture directly generates about 7% of US GHGs through activities such as enteric fermentation in ruminant livestock, manure management, and use of nitrogen fertilizers (
