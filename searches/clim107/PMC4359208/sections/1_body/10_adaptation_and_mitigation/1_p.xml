<p class="p">Climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture are related concepts, but have important biophysical, economic, and conceptual differences that may affect farmer attitudes toward action. Adaptation is defined as “initiatives and measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human systems against actual or expected climate change effects” (
 <xref rid="bibr33-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2007</xref>, p. 809). Adaptation has always been central to farming, and over millennia farmers have generally been adept at adapting agriculture to a changing environment (

Examples of adaptation of agriculture to the impacts of climate change might include adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility. In the U.S. Midwest, commonly recommended adaptive actions include increased use of practices such as minimization of tillage and use of cover crops to protect soils from erosion and build soil organic matter (
