<p class="p">Whereas adaptation has long been integral to agriculture, climate change mitigation is a relatively new attitude object. Mitigation is defined as “technological change and substitution that reduce resource inputs and emissions per unit of output” (
 <xref rid="bibr33-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2007</xref>, p. 818). In agriculture, mitigation is focused primarily on reducing GHG emissions and/or increasing carbon sequestration and storage (
 <xref rid="bibr33-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2007</xref>). In contrast to adaptation action, the potential benefits of mitigation action are uncertain, entail substantial lag time, and accrue globally rather than locally (
 <xref rid="bibr73-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Walthal et al., 2012</xref>). Because the benefits of mitigative action are diffuse, much of the public discussion related to GHG production and mitigation to reduce emissions has focused on

 <xref rid="bibr77-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">World Bank, 2012</xref>). In agriculture, too, major proposed strategies to induce GHG reduction have focused on collective, government-led responses including legislative mandates to reduce emissions, emissions taxes, and cap and trade regimes (
