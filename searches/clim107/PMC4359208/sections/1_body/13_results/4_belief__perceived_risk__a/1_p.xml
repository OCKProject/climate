<p class="p">Model 2â€™s response variable is support for government action to reduce GHG emissions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0013916513503832" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The coefficient measuring the relationship between climate change belief and support for mitigation is positive and significant. This suggests that belief in climate change and attribution to human activities is associated with stronger support for government mitigation policy. On the other hand, the coefficient measuring the indirect effect through perceived risk is not significant.
