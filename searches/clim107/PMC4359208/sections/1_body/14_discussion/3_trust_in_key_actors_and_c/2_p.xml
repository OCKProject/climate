As noted above, key agricultural interests have denied a connection between climate change and human activity; this study’s findings suggest that so-called “denial machine” tactics (

While this might be difficult given the reluctance of some actors to engage in discussion of climate change and potential responses, because these groups may influence farmer beliefs and attitudes, working with them is imperative.
