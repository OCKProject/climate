<p class="p">Our research suggests that farmers (and possibly the greater agricultural community) are more open to adaptation than mitigation. Farmers adapt for a living (

 <xref rid="bibr45-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lobell, Baldos, and Thomas (2013</xref>, p. 1) offer a solution to addressing agriculture’s contribution to GHG emissions in their findings that “broad-based efforts to adapt agriculture to climate change have mitigation co-benefits” and note that adaptation is often considerably less expensive than actions whose main purpose is mitigation. Many of the practices that reduce vulnerability of cropping systems most effectively—reductions in tillage, planting of a cover crop to hold soil during fallow periods, managing fertilizers more efficiently—can also have significant GHG-reducing properties (
 <xref rid="bibr41-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lal et al., 2011</xref>). By using outreach strategies that focus on adaptive practices that reduce risks and GHG emissions, the dual goals of adaptation and mitigation could be pursued while engaging the majority of farmers who do not believe in anthropogenic climate change.
