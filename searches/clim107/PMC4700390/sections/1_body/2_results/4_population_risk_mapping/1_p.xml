<p class="p">Our population risk map highlights hotspots where high population density overlaps with long season length with most transmission potential (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). Specifically, the current year-round most suitable and densely populated Ghana coast of western Africa was predicted to become more seasonal and less suitable for transmission, whereas this high-density, year-round, most suitable hotspot is predicted to shift to the Albertine Rift border of Western Uganda (
