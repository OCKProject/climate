<p class="p">By incorporating empirical findings that malaria transmission is optimal under moderate temperatures, and transmission potential declines at hot temperatures, our model generates nuanced predictions of current and future temperature suitability. For example, although the model predicts a small increase in the amount of geographic area with temperature suitable for any transmission by 2080, it also predicts a reduction in the area with temperature most suitable for transmission. Areas predicted to become newly suitable for transmission could face challenges to vector control and health infrastructure to mitigate increased transmission risk. Moreover, some of these predicted areas also coincide with centers of high population density, such as Western Uganda, suggesting large predicted geographic shifts in the number of people living where conditions are most suitable for transmission Africa.</p>
