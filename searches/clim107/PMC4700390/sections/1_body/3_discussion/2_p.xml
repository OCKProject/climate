<p class="p">Our map shows that most of Africa now has temperatures suitable for malaria transmission to some degree throughout the year. In fact, some regions are already beyond the thermal optimum for transmission, particularly just south of the Sahara (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">2b</xref>). Suitability also varies seasonally (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>)â€”in March through June, the total most suitable area (top quantile) is smaller (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, inset) because it is too hot in the north (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, red color in maps) and too cold in the south (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, blue color in maps). By contrast, much of the continent is most suitable from November through February. Furthermore, the new maps capture the current observed transmission in cooler regions where malaria is an ongoing concern, such as the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa (Kleinschmidt et al. 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>, Barnes et al. 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). A map based on previous linear thermal responses predicted that most regions of Africa are currently cooler than optimum for transmission, with transmissibility peaking in April (
