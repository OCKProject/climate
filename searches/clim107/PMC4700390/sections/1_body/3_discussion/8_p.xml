<p class="p">Our approach focuses on determining how temperature impacts broad geographic patterns of malaria transmission potential. Spatial regression models incorporating many other environmental and socioeconomic covariates, such as atmospheric humidity, rainfall, or bed-net availability, could further enhance predictions at a local scale. Our model assesses the direct influence of temperature on transmission mechanistically. Thus, our results complement statistical models derived from field data to inform why malaria is excluded in some regions and highly prevalent in others. It can also serve as a baseline for predicting future suitability, as mechanistic models are useful for predicting outside the range of current data than traditional regression-based approaches (Rogers and Randolph
