<p class="p">Control measures can interrupt malaria transmission where climate conditions are suitable (Gething et al. 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), making it difficult to predict climate suitability for transmission using statistical models of observed malaria transmission (human case data). An alternative is to use physiological (or process-based) models of transmission that explicitly link environmental drivers, in this case temperature, with transmission potential, to build maps of suitability. Mordecai et al. (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) proposed a physiological model to assess the range of temperatures most suitable for malaria transmission. Specifically, the model incorporated the thermal ecology of anopheline mosquitoes (particularly 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles gambiae</italic>, the major vector of malaria in Africa) and 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum,</italic> the major malaria parasite. This model included biologically relevant unimodal physiological responses of all entomological and parasite life history traits to temperature, derived from empirical data. Including these explicit thermal responses reduced the predicted optimal temperature for malaria transmission by 6°C from previous model estimates—from 31°C to 25°C. Additionally, the predicted lower bounds for transmission decreased from around 20°C to 17°C, and the upper bounds decreased from 40°C to 34°C (Mordecai et al. 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Model predictions aligned closely with climate-matched field observations of the entomological inoculation rate (EIR, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 122), over a period of 40 years (
