  <p class="p">Areas with mean monthly temperatures suitable for malaria transmission as predicted by the model of Mordecai et al. (
   <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Suitability is shown under the current climate (see 
   <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s002" class="xref">Materials and Methods</xref>), on a blue–red scale, from too cold for transmission (blue), through peak optimal transmission (white), to too hot for transmission (red). The aridity mask, where the area is unsuitable for mosquito development, is shown in grey and centered on the Sahara desert. (
