<p class="p">Climate has been suggested as a major driver of the distribution of BTV [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]; for example, the European outbreaks were thought to be a consequence of warming climates [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], and the virus expanded another ~800 north in 2005 [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Historically, the disease was found in a belt between 40°N and 35°S that included northern Australia, parts of the Indian Subcontinent, Middle East, Africa, Cyprus, and the Americas. Prior to that point, BTV was known only from South Africa and Cyprus [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], The origin of the disease thus has three possible explanations: (1) BTV was present in both Africa and Europe but was not documented owing to misidentification or poor diagnostic tools; (2) BTV originated in South Africa and dispersed to Europe; (3) BTV originated in Europe and dispersed to South Africa. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that strains responsible for the new BTV outbreaks are similar to those that circulated for decades in early epidemic sites [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. FAOSTAT data indicate results revealed continuous international trade between Europe and Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], which could allow viral infections in animals to move between the two continents. This observation also suggests that the virus will be able to spread to new sites that become suitable as climatic conditions change in coming decades.
