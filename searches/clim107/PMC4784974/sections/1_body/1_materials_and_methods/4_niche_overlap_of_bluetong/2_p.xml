<p class="p">The background similarity test assessed whether vector and BTV niches are less similar than expected given the “background” similarity manifested across the accessible areas of each [
 <xref rid="pone.0150489.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. We compared niche model similarity values based on actual occurrences of each species, with distributions of background similarity based on comparison of the niche of one species with “niche” models based on random points from across the
