<p class="p">BTV model transfers to future conditions indicated a pattern that was overall similar to that estimated for present-day conditions. However, the potential distribution of the virus under future conditions was broader, and included areas not identified as suitable under current conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150489.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). This potential for expansion was particularly notable in central Africa, the United States, and western Russia. Under all future climate scenarios, the virus was seen to have a broader potential geographic distribution than at present (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150489.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). We noted few differences between GCMs within each climate scenario, such that model predictions were consistent over much of the world, with exceptions in western Russia, northern Europe, western South America, and Indonesia, where future projections were less stable (
