<p class="p">We aligned length variable (i.e. ribosomal) sequences with MAFFT v. 7 and the Q-INS-i algorithm, which considers the secondary structure
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>. To obtain an ultrametric tree we used BEAST v.1.7
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref> with an uncorrelated lognormal clock and a Yule speciation process. We linked the evolutionary rates of the mitochondrial protein coding genes and the two nuclear ribosomal genes respectively to reduce the number of free parameters, and used a GTR + I + G model with unlinked parameters for each partition. Trees were rooted in the node separating a clade with 1 instar larval development from a clade with either 2- or 1-instar, according to the topology of a previous study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). For the calibration we used the estimates obtained in this same study, that were based on the tectonic separation of the Sardinian plate, 16.6 Ma for the clade of species with a 1-instar cycle and 13.7 Ma for the clade of uncertain life cycle type. Both were set up as priors with a normal distribution with the estimated age as mean and a standard deviation of 1 MY.
