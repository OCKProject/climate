<p class="p">There is, however, a system in which all these uncertainties are minimised: the deep subterranean environment. Contrary to what happens in epigean (surface) environments, the range of variables affecting species in this environment is minimal. The humidity in the deep parts of a cave is always near the saturation point and the temperature is highly constant through the day and the year. It is also possible to have a reliable estimate of this temperature, which is approximately equal to the mean annual temperature of the surface

Besides, environmental conditions are practically homogeneous through all possible microhabitats within a cave system, so small-scale spatial heterogeneity and the possibility of behavioural adjustments or phenotypic plasticity are greatly reduced. Caves harbour very simple biological communities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>, minimising the need to account for biological interactions. In sum, unlike in surface environments, here we know the environmental conditions that species experience. This, together with the availability of almost complete phylogenies for some lineages, allows tracing their geographical movements through several cladogenetic processes and estimating rates of evolution. Therefore, deep subterranean species are an ideal model group for ecological, evolutionary and biogeographical studies
