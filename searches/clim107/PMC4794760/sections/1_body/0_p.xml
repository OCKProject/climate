<p class="p">Climate change has become one of the main threats to global biodiversity
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. For management strategies in the context of global warming, accurate predictions of species response are mandatory. However, to date most assessments of speciesâ€™ vulnerability under climate change have been derived from niche (bioclimatic) models
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. These approaches relate observed geographic distribution of a species to current climate; resultant models are then applied to climate projections to infer potential climatically suitable areas for a given species in the future. This allows detecting populations likely to remain stable over coming decades, as compared with others that are likely to be lost

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. However, the application of these approaches has been debated as they present some important uncertainties
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. It is assumed that i) species are able to disperse freely without any constraint; ii) are perfectly adapted to the environmental conditions of their current distributions; iii) the variables determining species distribution are known; iv) environmental conditions (usually estimated for grid cells at different spatial resolution) are homogeneous through the habitat, ignoring both temporal (daily and often seasonal) and spatial (micro-habitat) heterogeneity

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>; and v) organisms have no control over the conditions to which they are exposed, ignoring both behavioural and phenological accommodation at different environmental conditions
