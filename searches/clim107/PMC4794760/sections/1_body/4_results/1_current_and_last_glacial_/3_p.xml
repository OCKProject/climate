<p class="p">The reconstruction of the minimum temperature change in the phylogeny using current or estimated LGM temperatures were almost indistinguishable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>), with a difference between 4.4–5.5 °C. This difference was not homogeneously distributed through the phylogeny, with the species under warmer current conditions having experienced a narrower historical range of temperature change (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Only 19 localities of 7 different species were estimated to have been at average below zero temperatures during the LGM (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). All but three of these 7 species are known from additional close localities estimated to have been above zero during the LGM.
