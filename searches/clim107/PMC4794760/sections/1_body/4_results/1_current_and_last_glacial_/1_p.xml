<p class="p">We could georeference 403 caves for 83 of the 85 species of the clade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), with a maximum number of 104 caves for the same species (
 <italic class="italic">Troglocharinus ferreri</italic> (Reitter)), and up to 3 species known from the same cave. The temperatures of the caves occupied by the species of the studied clade ranged from ca. 1–3 °C in some species of 
 <italic class="italic">Trapezodirus</italic> to just above 16 °C in 
 <italic class="italic">T. ferreri</italic>, with an estimated divergence between these two taxa and their most recent common ancestor of ca. 10MY (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). The average temperature range to which each of the studied cave species are currently exposed is ca. 3 °C, with a maximum value of 7.2 °C for 
 <italic class="italic">Trapezodirus bolivari</italic> (Escalera) (from 2.40–9.60 °C; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The estimated ranges for the reconstructed LGM temperatures of the same caves were very similar (maximum value, also with 
 <italic class="italic">T. bolivari</italic>, (from −2.50–4.7 °C; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref>).
