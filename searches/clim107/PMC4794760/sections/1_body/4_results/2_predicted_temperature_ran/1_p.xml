<p class="p">Under the A2 scenario of climate change (see Methods), in 2080 only 9% of the extant localities would remain at temperatures within the current range of their respective species; this percentage was raised to 26% under the B2 scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c</xref>,d; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). This translates into a maximum of either 26 or 48 species predicted to have at least one population with suitable temperatures for the A2 and B2 scenarios respectively, and only 8 or 16 species with more than 50% of their current populations predicted to have suitable temperatures in 2080.
