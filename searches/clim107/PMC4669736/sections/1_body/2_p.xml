<p class="p">Pacific island countries are confronted with a triple burden of noncommunicable diseases, infectious diseases and climate change impacts. In some Pacific island states, mortality rates from noncommunicable diseases are already among the highest in the world. Since 2012, there have been over 40 large infectious disease outbreaks in the region: most were caused by climate-sensitive diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus infections.

 </xref> There have also been several record-breaking extreme climate events in the Pacific recently. Extreme events often damage or destroy health facilities, disrupting essential health services when they are needed most urgently. For example, in Vanuatu, cyclone Pam seriously damaged many health facilities: two hospitals, 19 health centres and 50 dispensaries in 22 affected islands. In the most affected province, 21 of 24 health facilities were damaged. The economic impact was estimated to be more than 60% loss of gross domestic product.
