<p class="p">Firstly, resource sharing agreements have both existed and been discussed primarily in a localized context, such as a single river system [

Although such resources sharing agreements could aid in increasing First Nationsâ€™ participation in commercial harvests for manila clams and geoducks along the North and Central Coasts, where their abundances are projected to sufficiently increase under climate change so as to offset other regional losses, the cost of travelling to these regions may offset the prospective benefits. Similarly, FSC harvests hinge upon the feasibility of accessing resources locally, making trans-regional trips unlikely to prove viable or desirable.
