<p class="p">Lastly, the use of inputs from different GCMs can yield a key source of uncertainty for DBEMs due to the direct relationship between the initial climate simulation and the estimates derived [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>]. To incorporate this uncertainty, multi-model ensembles have been shown to improve projections by accounting for model-selection uncertainty and providing an ensemble of data that tends to agree better with observations [

Since this analysis evaluates scenarios generated from one coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate model (GFDLâ€™s ESM2M), the inclusion of additional SDM-GCM combinations would help to further elucidate areas of uncertainty in model outputs, and to explore inter-model variation [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The resolution of current GCMs is most suited to large-scale analyses due to the intricacies of representing fine-scale ocean dynamics. In particular, there has been a concerted effort towards resolving coastal mixing processes and mesoscale eddies within GCMs [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>]. While analyses at the scale of the EEZ can provide greater certainty with respect to regional impacts on fisheries, our understanding of impacts on coastal communities is therefore less certain due to both the complicated dynamics of coastal systems and the finer scale of the analysis.
