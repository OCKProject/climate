 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. The DBEM was selected for the purpose of this study due to the model’s capacity to predict large-scale scenarios of ecological change for numerous species given limited biological and ecological data. This global model integrates population and dispersal dynamics, which aid in determining the biogeography of marine systems under scenarios of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. Although this version of the DBEM does not explicitly incorporate additional factors such as the influence of trophic interactions, evolutionary change, or fishing pressure, the use of empirically obtained habitat preferences based on species’ current distributions indirectly accounts for a ‘realized’ niche that is constrained by trophic interactions [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. While the resulting shift in species’ distributions from inclusion of trophic interactions differed only modestly [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>], these interactions may play a larger role in coastal regions and at localized scales, potentially leading to greater variation in projected responses to changing environmental conditions.
