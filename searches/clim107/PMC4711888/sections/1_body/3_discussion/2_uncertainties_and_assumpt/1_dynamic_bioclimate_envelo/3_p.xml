 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>], and thereby accurately reflect preferred habitat and environmental tolerance limits. However, given anthropogenic disturbances, it has been argued that ranges used in SDMs do not fully capture species’ historical ranges, which could lead to biases in estimates of species’ current environmental tolerance limits [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. Within BC’s marine environment, such biases are likely less prominent as the majority of species included in this analysis have maintained their approximate historical range or occupy other areas with similar habitat, despite variations in abundance. Exceptions to this include invasive species, such as manila and varnish clams, and individual stocks of salmon and eulachon that have been extirpated.
