 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], recent studies have argued that focusing predominantly on unidirectional shifts may, in fact, underestimate the true impacts of climate change on species’ distributions due to the complexity of potential configurations of the variables that instigate the shifts [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. As climatic niches are not necessarily associated with a latitudinally-defined gradient, habitat situated nearby, or closer to the equator, may provide refuge for species seeking new climate niches. While likely having little effect on projections at the global scale, finer-scale analyses such as this must acknowledge this uncertainty surrounding projections [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>]. Likewise, while some pelagic species have exhibited much faster rates of poleward movement [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>], rates of range expansion are dependent on the contrast of local temperature gradients, with strong variations in ‘climate velocities,’ or the rates and directions that isotherms shift through space [
