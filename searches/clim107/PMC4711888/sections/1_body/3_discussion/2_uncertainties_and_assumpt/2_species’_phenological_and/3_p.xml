<p class="p">The rate at which different species can genetically and phenotypically evolve to accommodate environmental change is also an important area of uncertainty that has been explored through various studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>]. To date, scope for genetic adaptation to meet the observed rate of environmental change has only been studied for a few species through laboratory experiments [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">122</xref>]. If adaptation to climate change were possible for marine species, our projections may represent an over-estimation of declines in catch potential. However, given the observed widespread responses of species to ocean temperature changes through shifts in distribution and phenology, long-term adaptation of marine species to continued environmental change may be unlikely.
