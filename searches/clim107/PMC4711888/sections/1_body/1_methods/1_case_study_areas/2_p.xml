<p class="p">The biogeographical characteristics of coastal BC are characterized by considerable terrestrial and marine-based diversity due to a temperate climate and coastal upwelling system that generates nutrient-rich waters [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. These conditions yield highly productive environments with complex marine food webs and diverse coastal landscapes, from rocky intertidal zones, shallow rocky reefs, kelp forests, sandy nearshore areas, and estuarine ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. While these regions share similar species assemblages and are characterized by comparable environmental conditions (e.g., oceanic currents and wind-driven upwelling) [
