 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. The model determines distributions of marine fishes and invertebrates by employing a set of filters including: (i) presence in FAO area(s); (ii) latitudinal range; (iii) range-limiting polygons; (iv) depth range; (v) habitat preferences; and (vi) the effect of ‘equatorial submergence’ (for detailed methodology, please refer to [
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]). Data for these filters were primarily derived from FishBase [

For species with limited life history records, data for species within the same genus were used. Range-limiting polygons were produced using known latitudinal and longitudinal ranges and the resulting distributional maps were cross-checked with AquaMaps [
