<p class="p">Annual landed values by taxon or fishery (e.g., herring spawn-on-kelp) between 2001 and 2010 were obtained from the BC Ministry of Agriculture’s annual reports and averaged to provide mean annual landed revenue [

Projected changes in relative catch potential for each commercial fishery under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5 were subsequently used to derive an estimate of changes in mean annual landed revenue (in 2010 CAD) given the approximate proportion of licenses held by First Nations [

Data outlining landed revenue in the Heiltsuk commercial intertidal bivalve fishery and First Nations’ participation in the commercial green sea urchin fishery, tuna fishery, and groundfish trawl and hook and lines fisheries were not available, and were therefore not included in the estimates of changes in landed revenue in the EEZ.
