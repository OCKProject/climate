<p class="p">Relative changes in commercial catch potential (%) were calculated for each 0.5° longitudinal x 0.5° latitudinal grid-cell situated in BC’s waters within Canada’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) using 20-year average abundances for 2050 (2041–2060) relative to 2000 (1991–2010) obtained from the DBEM simulations. Species were aggregated by commercial fishery, noting the proportion of species included in the analysis relative to those included in each fishery’s quota (

Regional impacts on FSC fisheries were estimated by using First Nations’ DFAs as outlined by the SOI boundaries submitted to the BC Treaty Commission, with the change in relative catch potential calculated for each species within each DFA.
