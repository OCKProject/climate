<p class="p">Declines in relative abundance were projected by 2050 (relative to 2000) for the majority of sampled species (87 of 98 spp.) within British Columbia’s marine environment under both scenarios of climate change, with evidence of latitudinal and regional trends. In contrast, white sturgeon (
