<p class="p">A poleward range shift in mean abundance by 2050 was projected for all species examined, with an estimated total median rate of 10.3 to 18.0 km decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> under the lower and upper scenarios of climate change respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0145285.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). A median rate of 10.1 to 17.8 km decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> was projected for demersal species, while pelagic species were projected to move polewards at a median rate of 13.6 to 33.3 km decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Rates tended to increase under the upper scenario of climate change relative to the lower scenario (68 of 98 spp.). Most of the remaining species (30 spp.) exhibited similar rates of poleward movement under both scenarios (i.e., within 7 km decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for 26 of 98 spp.), while only a few (4 spp.) exhibited slower rates of poleward movement (
