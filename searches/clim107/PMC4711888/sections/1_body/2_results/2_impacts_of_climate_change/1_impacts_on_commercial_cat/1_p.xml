<p class="p">With two exceptions, modest to severe declines in catch potential were suggested for all commercial fisheries with known First Nation participation (15 out of 17 spp.) under both scenarios of carbon emissions (

Estimates placed the Pacific herring commercial fisheries, comprising roe herring, spawn-on-kelp, and food and bait fisheries, as likely to experience the greatest relative impact under both climate change scenarios, with declines in catch potential ranging between 28.1 and 49.2% across coastal BC. Collectively, salmon (
