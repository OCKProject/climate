<p class="p">Our study area was outside of the current endemic districts of malaria; still 295 self-reported cases of malaria were found in the non-endemic areas. This finding supports the prediction of the ‘Second National Communication of Bangladesh to the UNFCCC’ that the malaria-affected areas will increase in future and some new areas will be exposed to it (

 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>). During extreme weather events, such as floods and cyclones, the normal habitat of snakes are lost and they come out in the community which accounts for the increased number of snake bites. So, there is again an indirect relationship of the increased number of extreme events with that of the increased number of snakebites and drowning cases as well.
