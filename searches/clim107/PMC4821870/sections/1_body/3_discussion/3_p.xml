<p class="p">This survey has focused some light on the recent initiative of the Bangladesh government (2009) to decentralize health care facilities up to the village level through community clinics (for every 6,000 of the rural population). There are four tiers of health care service delivery in the government setup of Bangladesh: community clinics (6,000 rural population at the village level), Union Health and Family Welfare Centres (at the union level), Upazila health complex (50-bedded hospitals at the sub-district level), district hospitals (100â€“250 bedded) and tertiary-level hospitals (medical colleges and specialized hospitals).
