 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, but climatic variability over much shorter timescales, typically days, has also changed in recent decades, at least on a regional scale

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. For example, average diurnal temperature range (DTR), the difference between maximum and minimum temperature within one calendar day, has increased more than 2 °C since approximately the 1960’s in Mexico, Bolivia, Patagonia, Madagascar, Indonesia, central Russia and the Western Himalaya, while other areas have experienced up to equally large decreases, for example in north-eastern Canada, north and central Africa and the Eastern Himalaya

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. Climate change is thus also associated with changes in temperature variability on short time scales.
