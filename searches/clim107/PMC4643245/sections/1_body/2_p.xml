<p class="p">We used high-resolution (daily) mortality data to investigate the association between DTR and the survival of zebra finches (n = 476) housed in outdoor aviaries, and hence exposed to natural variation in temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2 A,B</xref>). Our population has resided in captivity for generations, but the species is originally widely distributed in Australia. The natural variation in DTR in our aviaries is entirely within the natural range
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. The minimum temperature (MinT) can be lower in the Netherlands than in Australia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>, but in various areas of Australia zebra finches regularly experience MinT below zero
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref> and our results were still supported when conditions outside the zebra finches natural range were excluded.
