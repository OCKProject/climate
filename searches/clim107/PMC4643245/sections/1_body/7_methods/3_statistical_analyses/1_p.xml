 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" class="xref">64</xref>, version 3.0.1 with the function ‘coxph’ of package survival
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" class="xref">65</xref>, version 2.37-4. The counting process formulation allows the coefficient to be estimated at each time point and thus time-dependent covariates, such as minimum temperature, DTR and age can be included. Time was portioned into daily intervals for all analyses.
