<p class="p">Associations between DTR and survival changed with age (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S3</xref>). The dependence of the DTR effect on age may be due to individual heterogeneity in combination with selective disappearance: individuals that are sensitive to large DTR die and thus only birds that are relatively DTR insensitive remain at old age. It is worth noting that in natural populations the majority of individuals are young
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" class="xref">53</xref> and hence natural populations are likely to be more susceptible to DTR effects than our relatively protected study population.
