 <p class="p">Chinese thuja (
  <italic class="italic">Platycladus orientalis</italic>) has a wide but fragmented distribution in China. It is an important conifer tree in reforestation and plays important roles in ecological restoration in the arid mountains of northern China. Based on high-resolution environmental data for current and future scenarios, we modeled the present and future suitable habitat for 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic>, evaluated the importance of environmental factors in shaping the species´ distribution, and identified regions of high risk under climate change scenarios. The niche models showed that 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> has suitable habitat of ca. 4.2×10
  <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> across most of eastern China and identified annual temperature, monthly minimum and maximum ultraviolet-B radiation and wet-day frequency as the critical factors shaping habitat availability for 
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic>. Under the low concentration greenhouse gas emissions scenario, the range of the species may increase as global warming intensifies; however, under the higher concentrations of emissions scenario, we predicted a slight expansion followed by contraction in distribution. Overall, the range shift to higher latitudes and elevations would become gradually more significant. The information gained from this study should be an useful reference for implementing long-term conservation and management strategies for the species.
