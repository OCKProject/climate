 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for the species under current climate conditions, in which the center areas are in mid-western Henan, the central and southern sectors of Shanxi and Shaanxi, eastern Gansu, northern Hubei, southwestern Jiangsu, central Shandong, southeastern Anhui, central Guangdong, and northern Yunnan. This model is in agreement with a previous study that located the most suitable areas of the species in typical sub-arid regions in western Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu [
