<p class="p">Seven sectors of high risk in the face of climate change have been identified in China: (i) northern semiarid, semihumid areas; (ii) the northwestern semiarid region; (iii) the North China Plain; (iv) Southern Hills; (v) the southwestern mountain region; (vi) the southwestern limestone mountain region; and (vii) the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau [

 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> under the future climate scenario/year combination RCP2.6–2050 matched susceptible regions previously identified. Under combination RCP2.6–2070, regions losing the most suitable habitat area were the susceptible sectors previously identified as (iv) and (vi) above, and the South Hills area. Large losses of suitable habitat also occurred in sectors (iv) and (vi) under scenario/year combination RCP8.5–2050 and RCP8.5–2070. The predictions of distribution change in the present study were performed based on two extreme greenhouse emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) from one General Circulation Model (GCM). The projections for future climate can be very different among GCMs. Nonetheless, we hope the extreme scenarios we molded will present a broadly forecast for the species´ range shift under future conditions. More modeling under a range of climate conditions are needed to reach a better resolution and a stronger recommendation for conservation operations.
