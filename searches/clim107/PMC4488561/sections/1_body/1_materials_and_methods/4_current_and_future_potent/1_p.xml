 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. A ROC curve shows the performance of a model whose output depends on a threshold parameter, it tests whether a model classifies species presence more accurately than random predictions. A perfect model has an AUC of 1, but performance is good when the AUC is &gt; 0.9 [
