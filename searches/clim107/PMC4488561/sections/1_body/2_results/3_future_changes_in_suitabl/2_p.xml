Losses of suitable habitat area were mostly concentrated in the central and southern sectors of Guangdong and Guangxi, western Chongqing, northeastern Guangxi, northeastern and central Fujian, and southern Zhejiang; losses amounted to ca. 0.29×10

In addition to overall losses, the predicted suitable habitat area became fragmented and discontinuous in southern China, while suitable habitat expansions were predicted toward northern areas.
