This species is able to endure drought and persist on barren soil, and consequently, it is commonly used for ecological restoration projects in arid mountain landscapes of northern China, where the species is used in protection forests for sand stabilization and soil erosion control. The species has unique abilities in the absorption and accumulation of atmospheric pollutants (SO
