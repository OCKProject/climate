<p class="p">Based on an extensive collection of geo-referenced occurrence records for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic> and large-scale, high-precision meteorological environmental data, this study aims (1) to identify the main impact factors for habitat suitability shift of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">orientalis</italic>, (2) to examine the properties and trends of shifts in the areal extent of suitable habitat under a variety of current and future climate scenarios, and (3) to project and quantify the spatial pattern of shifts in the areal extent of suitable habitat under future climate conditions, thereby providing a theoretical reference framework for global change biology, as well as for the plantation, management, and utilization of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>.
