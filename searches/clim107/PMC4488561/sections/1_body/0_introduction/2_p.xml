<p class="p">Climate shifts alter species’ geographic distributions, which in turn affect the patterns of climate change since surface vegetation has a major controlling effect on atmospheric properties. Consequently, a capacity for predicting the distribution patterns of species under future climate conditions will contribute substantially to the academic disciplines of biogeography and global change biology. Predicting the future impact of climate change on the areal extent of landscape containing appropriate habitat for particular species [

Predictions on critical habitat availability will also contribute to better understanding ecological system stability and the distribution patterns of genetic variation within species [
