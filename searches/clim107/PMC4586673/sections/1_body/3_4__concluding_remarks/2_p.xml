<p class="p">With the applied SRES A1B climate change scenario, the DEHM model predicts that Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> air concentrations is 4% higher, while RGM and TPM are 41% and 62% lower by the end of the 21st century compared to the end of the 20th century. This results in 18% lower Hg deposition to the Arctic. The reason for these differences is the smaller sea-ice coverage predicted in the 2090s than in the 1990s. This results in a lower oxidation of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> to HgO and therefore a higher concentration of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> and lower concentrations of RGM and TPM and thus lower deposition.
