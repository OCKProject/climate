<p class="p">Only one climate change scenario has been applied in this study, and the predicted changes in the deposition of Hg due to changes in climate input is a sensitivity study of the DEHM model system and this does not necessarily reflect a correct climate response in the real atmosphere. There are uncertainties in the applied parameterizations both in this and in other models due to the knowledge gaps in the biogeochemical cycle of Hg [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], and this indicates an opposite effect of climate change on deposition to the predictions from this study. Further studies using measurements, other models and other climate change and emission change scenarios are thus needed to resolve this matter. There is also a need for the scientific community to further study the physical and chemical processes that are the most uncertain and that could become more important in a future warmer climate, notably the influence of bromine chemistry on the Hg deposition as discussed in this study. Combining measurements and models can improve our understanding of these processes.
