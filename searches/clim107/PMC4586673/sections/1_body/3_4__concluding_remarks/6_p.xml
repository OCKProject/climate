<p class="p">This study indicates that the deposition of Hg to the Arctic decreases in a future warmer climate, although the changes are moderate. Furthermore, future climate mitigation measures are expected to reduce the atmospheric emissions of Hg further [

Lower atmospheric depositions in the future would lead to a lower uptake of Hg in the food webs and hence a lower exposure of the Arctic population to Hg if there were no other changes. However, climate change may alter other factors that influence the exposure, such as the air-surface exchange flux and release of Hg from reservoirs stored in glaciers and thawing permafrost, the inflow of riverine Hg to the Arctic Ocean, the methylation/demethylation in the Arctic Ocean and the fresh water systems, as well as the structure and dynamics of fresh water and marine food webs [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The results generated in this study indicate that climate change will reduce Hg depositions to the Arctic, although emission reductions appear to have a larger effect. This knowledge is valuable for decision makers when developing future emission reduction policies to protect the vulnerable ecosystems in the Arctic. However, the results are not very strong to form policies on alone due to the uncertainties. They could be applied in a broader understanding of the effects of Hg exposure to the Arctic population combining them with knowledge on bioaccumulation, human effects, and societal changes (e.g., diet) in a cross disciplinary study to form an integrated model system describing the cycling of Hg from source trough atmospheric transport, bioaccumulation in the food webs, exposure to top predators and humans and the caused effects.
