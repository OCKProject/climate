 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>, the total annual deposition of Hg north of the Arctic Circle (66.5
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> N) is shown. The total deposition is 18% lower in the 2090s than in the 1990s, and the difference is statistically significant. RGM is the major component of the deposition due to a high dry deposition velocity to the surface, and the lower RGM air concentrations in the 2090s result in lower depositions.
