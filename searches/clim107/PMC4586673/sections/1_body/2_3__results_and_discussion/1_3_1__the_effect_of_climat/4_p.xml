<p class="p">The spatial distribution of the average total annual deposition in the 1990s is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> together with the difference in percent between the average total annual deposition in the 1990s and the 2090s. The deposition to the continents is significantly higher in the 2090s than in the 1990s due to significantly higher ozone concentrations in the troposphere, which is one of the main oxidant paths of mercury in the DEHM model. The deposition to the Arctic Ocean is significantly lower in the 2090s than in the 1990s due the reduction in sea ice coverage.
