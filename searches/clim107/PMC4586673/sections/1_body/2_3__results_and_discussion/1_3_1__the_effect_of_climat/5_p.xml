<p class="p">There are several processes not accounted for in the DEHM model that potentially can affect the estimate of the importance of climate change for the Hg deposition within the Arctic. One process is re-volatilization from the surface. This is partly accounted for by the background concentration as described in section 2.1. It has been speculated that a reduction in sea-ice cover will lead to an enhanced re-volatilization from the Arctic Ocean, while another effect is that TPM deposited on the ice free water is less likely to re-volatilize immediately than when deposited on sea ice and snow and the combination of these two effects may be nearly neutral [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. On the other hand, the volatilization is dependent on the gradient between the concentrations in air and water, and a higher concentration of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> in air in the 2090s combined with a larger ice-free part of the Arctic Ocean will lead to a lower re-volatilization of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> from the surface. If re-volatilization was accounted for in the DEHM model this would have reduced the Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> concentrations in air (corresponding to a lower background concentration in the model), which would lead to lower estimated depositions to the surface. However, we estimate that this effect on the reduced oxidation to RGM and subsequent lower deposition is negligible compared to the effect of changes in sea-ice coverage.
