<p class="p">The relative change in Hg deposition to the Arctic between the 1990s and the 2090s is 18% for all five emissions scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>). The changes in deposition for the future climate scenario are thus not influenced by the differences in emissions just as for the major source areas.
