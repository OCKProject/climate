<p class="p">We have performed five sets of simulations. The first set of simulations is with the global Mercury inventory for 2005, three sets of simulations were with each of the 2020 emission scenarios (SQ, EXEC and MFTR), and the last set was with no anthropogenic emissions, called “zero emission”. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>, the total deposition to the Arctic (a) and the relative changes compared to the 2005 basic simulation for the 1990s (b) are shown for all 10 model simulations. The MFTR results in 20% lower, the EXEC in 16% lower, while the SQ scenario results in a 6% higher total deposition in the 1990s compared to the 2005 basic emissions simulation. If the anthropogenic emissions are removed the deposition to the Arctic will be 37% lower for the 1990s. The decrease in depositions is in excellent accordance with previous model estimates using the same emission scenarios, with predictions of an increase in deposition in the Canadian part of the Arctic of approximately 5% for the SQ emission scenario and decreases in deposition of 15%–17% for the EXEC and 18%–20% for the MFTR emission scenarios [
