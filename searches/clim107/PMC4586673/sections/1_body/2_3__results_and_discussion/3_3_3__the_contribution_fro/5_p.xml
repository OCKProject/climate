<p class="p">The change of Hg deposition in Arctic due to emission change over time should be even larger, because the amount of global biologically available Hg in soil and ocean will change slowly due to the changed atmospheric fluxes and the removal of biologically available Hg, e.g., by transport of Hg to the deep ocean or by sedimentation, and this will change the remissions and the global atmospheric background further.</p>
