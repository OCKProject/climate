<p class="p">The climate has changed in recent decades with the main sign being an increase in global mean temperature. The multi-model ensembles in both the 4th and the recent 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report (AR4 and AR5) project an increase in the global mean temperature in the range of 1–6 °C by the end of the 21st century, relative to pre-industrial temperature levels [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The broad range in the projected temperature increase is linked to the various greenhouse gas emission scenarios used as input to the climate simulations. The changes are projected to be larger in the Arctic than elsewhere. The average temperature increase in the Arctic exceeds 9 °C by the end of the 21st century compared to the 1990s according to one of the intermediate emission scenarios applied in AR4, the SRES A1B scenario. The increasing temperature leads to enhanced seasonal melting of the Arctic Ocean sea ice, retreating of glaciers and melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Changes are also projected for precipitation patterns as well as in weather patterns in general.
