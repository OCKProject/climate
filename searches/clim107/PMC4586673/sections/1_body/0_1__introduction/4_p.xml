<p class="p">The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of climate change on the atmospheric transport of Hg to the Arctic and the deposition within the Arctic by making a sensitivity study to see how the ACTM Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) reacts to climate change forcing. We have furthermore studied the contribution from the major source areas (Asia, Europe and North America) and finally we have investigated how changes in emissions affect the deposition in the Arctic compared to changes in climate.</p>
