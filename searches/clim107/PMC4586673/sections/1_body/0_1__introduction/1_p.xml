<p class="p">Mercury (Hg) is a widespread pollutant that can lead to neurological and behavioural effects in infants and higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases for people with elevated exposures [

 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Hg exists in various forms and occurs naturally in the environment with sources from volcanic eruptions and weathering of naturally enriched rocks. The natural cycling of mercury has been perturbed by emissions from human activities, with small-scale gold mining and coal burning being the largest sources. This has led to at least a two-fold increase in atmospheric emissions since the industrial revolution in the 18th century [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Hg is distributed globally and is transported to the Arctic via ocean currents and rivers as well as via the atmosphere, which is assessed to be the largest transport pathway [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Hg is deposited in the Arctic depending on climatic parameters such as temperature, precipitation and sea-ice coverage as well as complex chemical reactions. The atmospheric transport to and deposition within the Arctic has been studied using advanced atmospheric chemistry-transport models (ACTM) [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Once at the surface, Hg enters the food webs where it bioaccumulates and biomagnifies. Levels of Hg in Arctic top predators, such as tooth whales and polar bears, exceed thresholds for adverse effects [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The Arctic indigenous people are exposed to high concentrations of Hg through the traditional diet rich on fish and marine mammals. Blood levels of Hg in parts of the Arctic population are higher than the safety limit [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], although declining trends are found in recent years probably associated with a change in diet [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. High exposure is especially critical for children during development and can result in neurological disabilities such as language, learning and attention deficits [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. There is also evidence for higher risk of cardiovascular diseases [
