<p class="p">There are no re-emissions after AMDE in the Arctic in DEHM, which means that the calculated total deposition of Hg can be considered to be a model estimate of the maximum possible Hg deposition in the Arctic. Furthermore, the model does not have Hg re-emissions from ocean and soil, which are also important sources of atmospheric Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup>. The contributions from these sources are assumed to be included in the global background concentration of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> of 1.5 ng/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>, which is used as initial and boundary conditions in all the simulations. This background concentration represents the current background concentration depending on the current anthropogenic and natural emissions as well as re-emissions. However, it is possible to estimate the influence of the anthropogenic emissions on the background concentration via post processing if the contribution from the global background concentration is known. This is done by assuming that only anthropogenic emissions of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> contribute to the global background concentration and that the natural emissions and re-emissions are assumed to be constant with 4200 tons Hg based on estimates from AMAP [
