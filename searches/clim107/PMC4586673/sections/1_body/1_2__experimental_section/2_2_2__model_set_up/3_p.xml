<p class="p">Each set of simulations in both model experiments consists of two ten-year time slices representing present (1990–2000) and future (2090–2100) climates. A 30-year period is usually applied as a climate normal in climate studies, however, the ten-year time slices were chosen in this study to reduce the computation time and this approach has proven to be successful in several studies [

 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. We have applied the same emissions to the atmosphere in each of the sets of simulations. With this set-up, the difference in predicted concentrations and depositions for each set of simulations arises only from the effect the difference in climate input has on the transport and deposition processes, and it is possible to investigate the response of DEHM to a changed climate forcing.
