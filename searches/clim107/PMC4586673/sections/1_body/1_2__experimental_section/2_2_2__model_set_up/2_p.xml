<p class="p">For the second model experiment, we performed five sets of simulations with different future emission scenarios for the year 2020 [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], one assuming status quo emissions (SQ), one with extended emissions control (EXEC), one assuming the maximum feasible technological reduction (MFTR) and one without anthropogenic emissions (zero emission).
