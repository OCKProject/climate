 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The SRES A1B scenario projects the global average temperature to increase by ~3 °C by the end of the 21st century with large seasonal and regional differences in the warming. The average sea ice extent in the Arctic is estimated to retreat by approximately 40%, and over the Barents Sea, the sea ice is predicted to vanish completely by the end of the 21st century. The globally averaged precipitation changes only slightly, although there are large regional and seasonal differences. The winter precipitation over the temperate and arctic regions is projected to increase by 10%–50%. The global temperature change related to the SRES A1B scenario from AR4 is quite similar to the RCP6 scenario used in the IPCC AR5 [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The SRES A1B is only one of several climate change scenarios and represents an intermediate development of the climate. This is a sensitivity analysis to investigate the response of the model system to changed climate input. One thing that should be kept in mind with the interpretation of such sensitivity analyses is that the DEHM model, as many other models, has parameterizations of processes which are tuned to the current climate in order to improve the present day model performance. The processes may change with climate conditions and the model may thus not have a reliable response to a changed climate input.
