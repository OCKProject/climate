<p class="p">We only applied this equation to the cells of the MODIS raster grid that encompassed the retained water bodies. Other features (i.e., land, snow, and clouds) were assigned a null value. This equation generated values ranging between −1.0 (i.e., open water) and 1.0 (i.e., completely frozen). We plotted this index across years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and used the Julian days at the x-intercepts as our reference points to study temporal trends between 2000 and 2014. These reference points represented dates when water bodies in our study area went from mostly frozen to mostly thawed (i.e., from a negative to a positive index value), and 
 <italic class="italic">vice versa</italic>. We modeled lake thawing and freezing date trends during the 2000–2014 period using linear regressions in R 3.1.1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. We also explored historical thawing and freezing trends in our region using data collected on Lake Nichicun (Northern Québec, Canada) from 1947 to 1985 (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Finally, we assessed the relationship between annual breakup or freeze dates of the largest water bodies used by caribou (2000–2014) or of Lake Nichicun (1947–1985) and monthly values of broad-scale climatic oscillations, i.e., the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO; see Additional file
