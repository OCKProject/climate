<p class="p">To assess the fine-scale availability of ice for caribou, we generated 1- and 2.5-km buffer zones around each location and evaluated the proportion of ice and water surrounding each location using the Geospatial Modelling Environment software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. These buffer zone sizes encompassed frequently reported zones of influence for 
 <italic class="italic">Rangifer</italic> (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]). We then compared the composition of buffer zones using Welch 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> tests for crossings on ice, in water, and detours separately. Similar results were obtained using the 1- and 2.5-km buffer zones; thus, we only discuss results obtained using the 1-km buffer zone.
