<p class="p">To evaluate the selection of ice and water by caribou, we performed a step selection function (SSF) using the 
 <italic class="italic">survival</italic> package in R [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. SSFs compare observed steps to random steps originating from the same location in a conditional regression framework [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. We chose this method because the availability of ice and water needed to be measured in areas immediately available to individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. We paired observed steps to 10 random steps drawn from the frequency distributions of lengths and turning angles of each individual at each location frequency. Prior to estimating frequency distributions of step lengths, we removed the highest 5Â % outlier distances to prevent generating overly long random steps [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. The conditional regression evaluated the probability of observing a real step with varying proportions of ice and water along each step. Although many environmental variables other than water and ice availability drive fine-scale movements of ungulates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>], we refrained from complexifying models to specifically test our hypothesis that caribou avoided water and selected ice during step selection.
