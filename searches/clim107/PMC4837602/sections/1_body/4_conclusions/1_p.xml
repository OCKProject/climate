 <italic class="italic">R.t. platyrhynchus</italic>) increased their displacement distances following rain-on-snow events, which are predicted to occur more frequently during warm winters. In Northern Qu√©bec, we revealed a link between caribou movements and inter-annual variations in ice availability. Caribou avoided water and selected ice in years with long and short ice-availability periods, respectively, suggesting that caribou were able to respond to ice availability and, indirectly, prevailing climatic conditions. Ice availability could thus be one of many drivers explaining the distribution of caribou following climate change. Predicting future migration routes of caribou, however, remains challenging [
