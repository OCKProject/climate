<p class="p">Between 2000 and 2014, the largest water bodies used by caribou went from mostly frozen to mostly thawed as early as May 13
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> (2010) and as late as June 13
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> (2004), with an average thawing date of May 28
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> (±8.8 days standard deviation, SD). Water bodies began freezing as early as November 9
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> (2002) and as late as November 26
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> (2005), with an average freezing date of November 19
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> (±5.1 days SD). Windows of opportunity during which ice was available for caribou ranged from a maximum of 201 days in 2009 to a minimum of 168 days in 2010. There was no statistically significant trend in thawing and freezing dates during this 15-year period (thawing: F = 0.50, df = 13, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.49; freezing: F = 0.13, df = 13, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.72; Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Breakup dates of the largest lakes used by migratory caribou and Lake Nichicun were related to the NAO in May, whereas their freeze dates were related to the NAO in October and the AO in September (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>).
