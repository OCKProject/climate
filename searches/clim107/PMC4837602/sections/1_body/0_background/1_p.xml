<p class="p">Climate is changing rapidly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>], and the regional distribution of many plant and animal taxa has begun to shift spatially in response to the changing environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Much research has focused in recent years on the ecological impacts of climate change on species or communities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], and although changes in the distribution of species are likely the mirror of individual responses to climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>], studies linking fine-scale individual behaviour with broad-scale climatic trends are slow to follow (but see, e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]). Studying individual responses to climate may help understand how species will react, and potentially adapt to climate change; this knowledge would be of paramount scientific, conservation, and management value [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>].
