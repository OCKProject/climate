  <span class="italic">s</span>-values 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5 and 10) and four management regimes (
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.1, 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.2, 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.4 and open access). The fleet dynamics is in all simulations controlled as described above, inducing a total fleet capacity (number of vessels that may participate in the fishery,

 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though the 2 years captured in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> is just prior to the occurrence of a striking shift in the development in the A1B carrying capacity anomaly (as seen in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> this happened about 2034), the A1B scenario biomasses shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> are significantly higher than the corresponding biomasses representing the zero scenario. To a large degree, however, the two scenarios overlap each other and both describe seasonal paths in close accordance with the expected seasonal profile.
 </p>
 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The shift suggested to occur around 2034 is also visible in Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>, showing the biomass and catch developments for all the simulations. These figures unmask several interesting features. The seasonal profiles of the two scenarios follow to a large degree the same pattern up to the mid-thirties after which a significantly higher stock biomass appears in the cases of an exploitation rate based on a fishing mortality rate (
  <span class="italic">F</span>) equal 0.2 and 0.4. This effect is however not apparent in the case of 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.1 in which available stock biomass already is stabilised on a quite high level (around 3 million tons according to Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>) in both scenarios. The effect of the shift in environmental carrying capacity is however reflected in increased monthly catches also in the case of 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.1, though significantly less than the increases seen in the cases of 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.2 and

 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unregulated fishery differs from the other three in Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>, particularly after the shift in carrying capacity where stock biomasses, catches and seasonal peaks clearly are lower in open access fishery. At high smartness levels and open access fishery, monthly available biomasses and obtained catches in peak season even reach higher levels in the zero scenario than that in the A1B scenario.
 </p>
 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The years after the environmental shift in the mid-thirties provides however the fleets with considerably higher profits in the A1B scenario than what is obtained in the zero scenario (Fig. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S1</span> of the Electronic Supplementary Material). When comparing the profit surfaces of the two scenarios for all the years (top left in Fig. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S1</span>) with the last 25 years of the simulation (top right in Fig. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S1</span> of the Electronic Supplementary Material), it becomes visible how the environmental effect contributes in lifting the whole profit surface of the A1B scenario.
 </p>
 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Open access fishery combined with high smartness levels results in higher profits in the zero scenario than in the A1B scenario throughout the simulation period. At lower smartness levels, however, the profit surface area within the open access area reaches surprisingly high levels as seen in the lower-right table in Fig. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S1</span>, where the profit obtained the last 25 years in open access when 
  <span class="italic">s</span> = 2 is close to the maximum overall profit (at 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.2 and 
  <span class="italic">s</span> = 5). In general, the A1B scenario seems to give relatively larger benefits to higher smartness levels than the zero scenario does. In both cases, highest profits are found at the fishing mortality rate (
  <span class="italic">F</span>) 0.2 but while the smartness level in A1B scenario maximum is 5 it is 1.5 in the zero scenario.

 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure

The exception is for the last 25 years of the simulation period, when also higher exploitation levels contribute in large profits in the A1B scenario.

 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eide (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2016</a>) introduces a fleet diversity index based on the Shannon Function H (Spellerberg and Fedor 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2003</a>) which is utilised in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a> and Fig. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S2</span> of the Electronic Supplementary Material, differing between vessels belonging to the coastal and high sea fishing fleets. As higher values of the diversity index indicate higher diversity, clearly the coastal fleet exhibits the highest diversity at low exploitation levels and for low smartness values at all levels of exploitation. The two scenarios follow the same pattern in this respect and also regarding the trends while increasing smartness levels. As higher smartness levels seem to contribute in increased fleet diversity for the high sea vessels (for exploitation rates at 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.2 and above), the opposite is the case for the coastal fleet, though not so pronounced at 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.2 as for the highest exploitation levels. Although the fleet diversity for high smartness levels and open access seems to drop below the corresponding levels of the zero scenario and the opposite for 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.4, the general impression is that the fleet diversity in the A1B scenario corresponds very closely to the fleet diversities found in the zero scenario simulations.

 </p>
 <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The declining diversity for small-scale vessels at higher smartness values and exploitation rates is also clearly visible in Fig. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S2</span>. Each graphical plot in Fig.

In Fig. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S2</span>, for the zero scenario as well as for the A1B scenario, at high exploitation rates (open access and when 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 04) and for s-values higher than 1.5, all points lay above the diagonal and hence indicate that the high sea fleet is more diverse than the coastal fleet.
 </p>
 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact that the high sea fleet has a wider range than the coastal fleet may be the simple explanation of the higher diversity at high levels of exploitation. The advantage of a higher mobility combined with a minimum level of fishing aptitude becomes relatively a more important advantage as the exploitation level increases. As seen in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>, however, also the diversity of the high sea fleet may decrease at sufficiently high smartness levels when the exploitation level is high, while the decline in fleet diversity occurs at lower exploitation levels in the coastal fleet. It should however be noted that this picture may be completely reversed when including alternative fisheries which first of all provide the coastal fleet with different options that could contribute to a higher fleet diversity.
 </p>
 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At low s-values in open access, the fleet diversities of the two scenarios are virtually identical. Overall, the highest fleet diversities are found at low exploitation levels and high smartness levels. The fleet diversities of the two scenarios follow each other closely but from the zero to the A1B scenario, the tendency is increasing diversity in the coastal fleet at low smartness while it is the high sea vessel diversity which increases at high smartness levels.</p>
 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S3</span> of the Electronic Supplementary Material shows the vertical and horizontal distributional ranges of the gravity centres of stock biomass and fishing effort distributions over the 45 simulated years. The stock distribution in terms of centres of gravity turns out to be very stable, almost not affected of fishing intensity and levels of smartness. A slight North-eastern movement is indicated for the A1B scenario compared with the zero scenario but the main impression is that the stock biomass distribution does not change. In the case of open access, the two scenarios are practically equal in terms of stock biomass distribution.
 </p>
 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Significantly larger changes are seen in the distribution of fishing effort, also reflecting the changing fleet compositions due to stock properties, exploitation levels and smartness. At increasing levels of smartness, there is a light tendency towards a more South-western distribution of fishing effort in both scenarios, even for the A1B scenario where the stock distribution slightly moves in the opposite direction. This indicates that the effect of reducing cost related to distance from port may be a more important factor than the possibly more North-eastern stock distribution.</p>
 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some details of the information embedded in Fig. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S3</span> come out in Fig. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S4</span> of the Electronic Supplementary Material, showing how the stock biomass distribution clusters for the two scenarios and their different combinations of fishing intensity and smartness levels. The two scenarios come out as independent clusters for all smartness levels at the lowest exploitation rate (
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0.1), while a more mixed picture is seen at higher exploitation levels. At the higher exploitation levels, the differences between the different scenarios and combinations are smaller but still a distinct clustering between scenarios are visible.
 </p>
 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is however not the case for the distribution of catch and effort (Fig. 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0955-1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S5</span> and

In these cases, the lowest exploitation level and low smartness levels cluster independent of climate scenario. It seems also to be a combined clustering tendency for both scenarios at higher exploitation levels and higher smartness levels, suggesting that the distribution of effort and hence catches is more depending on smartness levels and fishing intensities than marginal changes in the distribution of stock biomasses.
