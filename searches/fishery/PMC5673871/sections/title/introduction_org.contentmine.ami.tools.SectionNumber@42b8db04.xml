 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is difficult to predict future development of Arctic marine ecosystems and, even more so, how these are affected by human interactions. Immediate effects of such interactions are not only functions of the level and profile of the human activity but also of current state and dynamics of the natural system. Spatial and temporal distributions of prey and predator species vary, depending both on external drivers (e.g. climate and fisheries; Murawski 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">1993</a>) and internal dynamics (e.g. spawning migrations; Rose 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">1993</a>; Carvalho 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">1993</a>). Long-term effects are by nature more difficult to predict than short-term perturbations, being functions of previous interactions and poorly known dynamics causing variations in spatial and temporal distributions of the system.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This describes the complexity of a marine ecosystem in its natural state, including the environmental variation which may occur within the natural sample space of the system (often referred to as natural variation). Climate change could cause system perturbations, redistributing some, or large, parts of the systems sample space. A dramatic change in the sample space of the system may be referred to as an ecosystem shift (Scheffer et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2001</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, Arctic marine ecosystems are highly specialised to cope with significant environmental fluctuations, between seasons within years and annual variations. The resilience of the system may be regarded as the evolutionary solution of significant natural system variations, where only those species capable of adapting and coping in the long run have survived. This may suggest that system exposed to highly fluctuating environmental conditions, as the boreal marine ecosystems, is less vulnerable than others toward changes caused by climate change.</p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When looking at the exploitation of the cod (
  <span class="italic">Gadus morhua</span>) stock in the Barents Sea, the resilience of the Northern cod fishery is confirmed by archaeological fishbone analyses (Barrett et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2008</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2011</a>) showing that dried cod continuously has been exported from the remote sub-Arctic region to other European countries over a period of more than thousand years. This period includes both the Medieval Warm Period (about 900–1400, Stocker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2013</a>), with significantly warmer climate than today, and the Little Ice Age (1450–1850, Stocker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2013</a>), which we temperature wise still are recovering from (Bianchi and McCave 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">1999</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While it may seem like a paradox that the fishery holding the longest documented trade history is found within the extreme naturally fluctuating environment in the sub-Arctic, the reasoning above indicates rather that the sub-Arctic is a place where we could expect to find resilient marine ecosystem. Both the human system as well as the marine ecosystems in this area are highly adapted to cope with extreme natural fluctuations.</p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper focuses the Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod fishery, the most important fishery in the Barents Sea. The NEA cod stock employs a variety of different coping strategies to adapt to a fluctuating physical and biological environment such as spawning and feeding migratory patterns, cannibalism, maturation dynamics and opportunistic feeding strategies (Sætersdal and Loeng 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">1987</a>; Brown et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">1989</a>; Jørgensen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2008</a>; Kjesbu et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2014</a>). The study employs a simulation model emphasising the migratory patterns (spawning and feeding migrations) constituting the most important spatial and temporal model variables. The aim of the study is to compare model results when assuming the current conditions to prevail (zero scenario) versus corresponding results under climate change conditions (climate change scenario).
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the difficulties of fully understanding the system dynamics in its natural state, the difficulties of predicting the effects of a possible system perturbation caused by climate change become even more challenging. But more so, also observing the actual configurations of a marine ecosystem or mapping its recent history in all details is virtually impossible. The aim of this paper therefore is not to predict or forecast the NEA cod fishery under the two scenarios but rather to present possible outcomes within the sample spaces of the two scenarios (which certainly turn out to also have large overlapping areas, though not being the focus of this study). The climate scenario is based on the IPCC AR4 SRES A1B scenario (Anon. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2007</a>) which at that time (2007) was considered being reasonably realistic. The A1 storyline assumes political focus on economics rather than environmental issues and a globalised economy. Among the different scenarios within the A1 family, the A1B scenario assumes a balanced development of energy technologies. The recent assessment report indicates that the A1B scenario may be too optimistic and less realistic than first anticipated (Stocker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The focus on spatial distributions and fleet diversity is motivated from the widespread expectation that northern fish species will shift to a more northern distribution caused by increased water temperatures (Perry et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2005</a>). The modelling approach utilised in this study has been developed and presented in two previous papers (Eide 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2014</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2016</a>). While the previous studies focused on the problems of identifying impacts climate change may have on the Barents Sea cod fishery, this paper provides a comparative study of a selected climate scenario and a zero scenario where no climate effects are considered.
