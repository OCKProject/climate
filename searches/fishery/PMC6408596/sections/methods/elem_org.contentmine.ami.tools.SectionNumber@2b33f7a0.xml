   <a rid="RSPB20182544C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C19">19</a>]. The study builds on data from more than 1000 forereef habitat sampling locations (i.e. reef slope habitat exposed to the open ocean) across the region that were recently classified into five reef regimes using model-based clustering of 10 fish and benthic functional groups (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Each cluster is a mixture of multivariate distributions composed of the densities of each component (i.e. fish and benthic functional groups), and each observation is assigned to a cluster based on the probability of membership given the observation [

   <a rid="RSPB20182544C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C12">12</a>] identified one as a highly variable and transitional state (i.e. regime 4). Given the ambition to accurately associate predictors to the spatial occurrence of distinct regimes, we removed the sites classified into regime 4 to reduce noise in the data and optimize predictive performance. We also excluded the 25% most uncertain classifications (i.e. sites with the lowest probability of being classified again into the same regime), thereby retaining 620 sites most representative of four distinct reef regimes (

   <a rid="RSPB20182544C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C21">21</a>]. It includes catch from commercial and non-commercial fisheries, land-based stressors (effluent, sedimentation, new development), habitat modification and invasive species [
   <a rid="RSPB20182544C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C20">20</a>]. Non-commercial fisheries were further characterized by platform (boat- versus shore-based) and gear types (line, net, spear). Gear types were combined for non-commercial boat-based fisheries to account for collinearity.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biophysical predictors were derived from time series of variables known to be major drivers of coral reef ecosystems: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-
   <span class="italic">a</span> (as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and thus primary production), irradiance and wave power. Five climatological metrics were available for each predictor: long-term mean, standard deviation of the long-term mean, maximum monthly climatological mean, maximum anomaly and frequency of anomalies [
   <a rid="RSPB20182544C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C18">18</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20182544C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C20">20</a>]. Choices were made to eliminate highly correlated metrics (electronic supplementary material, figure S2), while ensuring for each predictor that both the actual forcing and its variability were represented. We used the maximum monthly climatological mean (i.e. the largest value of the 12 monthly climatological values averaged over more than 10 years) to represent the actual forcing since spatial variations in ecological communities are largely defined by their climatological envelope as communities tend to adapt to the extremes in the seasonal cycle [
   <a rid="RSPB20182544C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C18">18</a>]. Depending on collinearity (electronic supplementary material, figure S2), either the standard deviation of the long-term mean or the frequency of anomalous events (i.e. the percentage of time above the maximum monthly climatological mean) was used to capture environmental stability, or lack thereof. The depth and topographical complexity of the seafloor, derived from high-resolution bathymetry of the region, were also included owing to their well-known importance in structuring reef communities (electronic supplementary material, table S3).

For instance, while many of the anthropogenic predictor rasters were available at a fine spatial grain (less than 500 m), most of the biophysical ones were generated at a coarser grain size (e.g. 4000 m). To control for the influence of different grain sizes on the outcome of the model, we extracted all predictor raster datasets at multiple standardized grain sizes (500, 1000, 1500, 2500 and 4000 m), before re-running the BRTs on regimes aggregated following a two-thirds majority within each cell resolution (electronic supplementary material, figure S3).
