 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The selection of anthropogenic predictors expanded on a human dimensions framework that identified the primary human impacts mediating coral reef condition [
  <a rid="RSPB20182544C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C21">21</a>]. It includes catch from commercial and non-commercial fisheries, land-based stressors (effluent, sedimentation, new development), habitat modification and invasive species [
  <a rid="RSPB20182544C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C20">20</a>]. Non-commercial fisheries were further characterized by platform (boat- versus shore-based) and gear types (line, net, spear). Gear types were combined for non-commercial boat-based fisheries to account for collinearity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biophysical predictors were derived from time series of variables known to be major drivers of coral reef ecosystems: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-
  <span class="italic">a</span> (as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and thus primary production), irradiance and wave power. Five climatological metrics were available for each predictor: long-term mean, standard deviation of the long-term mean, maximum monthly climatological mean, maximum anomaly and frequency of anomalies [
  <a rid="RSPB20182544C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C18">18</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182544C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C20">20</a>]. Choices were made to eliminate highly correlated metrics (electronic supplementary material, figure S2), while ensuring for each predictor that both the actual forcing and its variability were represented. We used the maximum monthly climatological mean (i.e. the largest value of the 12 monthly climatological values averaged over more than 10 years) to represent the actual forcing since spatial variations in ecological communities are largely defined by their climatological envelope as communities tend to adapt to the extremes in the seasonal cycle [
  <a rid="RSPB20182544C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C18">18</a>]. Depending on collinearity (electronic supplementary material, figure S2), either the standard deviation of the long-term mean or the frequency of anomalous events (i.e. the percentage of time above the maximum monthly climatological mean) was used to capture environmental stability, or lack thereof. The depth and topographical complexity of the seafloor, derived from high-resolution bathymetry of the region, were also included owing to their well-known importance in structuring reef communities (electronic supplementary material, table S3).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For a majority of the datasets, the temporal range represented approximately a 10 year average, which matched the temporal spread of the biological surveys used to identify regimes [
  <a rid="RSPB20182544C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C12">12</a>] and provided an estimate of long-term trends in spatial gradients rather than a single snapshot in time. For detailed methodology on each anthropogenic and biophysical predictor raster, see Wedding
