 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Repeating the analysis at multiple standardized grain sizes (i.e. 500, 1000, 1500, 2500 and 4000 m) yielded largely similar results to the ones described above for all four regimes in terms of influential predictors and shape of the relationships. There was no significant difference across grain sizes with regard to model performance, or relative contribution of anthropogenic versus biophysical variables (electronic supplementary material, figure S5).</p>
