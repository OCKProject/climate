 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BRT models performed well for all four regimes (electronic supplementary material, table S5), with deviance explained from 37% to 41%, high predictive performance (AUC scores between 0.88–0.91) and minimal spatial autocorrelation (Moran's 
  <span class="italic">I</span> between 0.02 and 0.04). The pattern of predictors' contributions differed among regimes, with regimes 1 and 2 displaying a few strongly influential predictors, while regimes 3 and 5 were best explained by a broader, but less influential, set of variables (

  <span class="italic">a</span>). This was also reflected by the number of predictors having a relative influence above what could be expected by chance: five for regime 1, six for regime 2 and nine for regimes 3 and 5 (

  <span class="italic">b</span>), with an overwhelming contribution of biophysical variables in predicting the occurrence of regimes 3, 2 and 5 (92%, 91% and 77% biophysical relative influence, respectively). Regime 1, on the other hand, was most effectively predicted by anthropogenic variables (57%).
