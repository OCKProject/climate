 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each regime, the relationships of the five most influential predictors (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182544F3" href="#RSPB20182544F3">figure 3</a>) and two strongest pairwise interactions (
  <a rid="RSPB20182544TB2" ref-type="table" href="#RSPB20182544TB2">table 2</a>; electronic supplementary material, figure S4) are described below. The probability of occurrence of regime 1 was higher as both non-commercial boat fishing catch (21.5% relative influence) and commercial fishing catch (11.6%) increased (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182544F3" href="#RSPB20182544F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">a</span>). Topographical complexity of the seafloor was the second strongest predictor (20.1%), suggesting regime 1 is more likely to occur in areas with low structural complexity. Depth (8.8%) and effluent (5.5%) both displayed positive relationships. Interaction patterns reflected the influence of the most important predictors with the probability of regime 1 occurring being greatest when fishing catch was high and structural complexity was low (
  <a rid="RSPB20182544TB2" ref-type="table" href="#RSPB20182544TB2">table 2</a>; electronic supplementary material, figure S4a). The model explained 41% of the deviance and had an AUC score of 0.90.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regime 2 was best predicted by a strong positive relationship with maximum monthly climatological mean of wave power (36.5%), indicating a higher occurrence of this regime in wave-exposed sites (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182544F3" href="#RSPB20182544F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">b</span>). Cooler maximum monthly climatological sea surface temperature (9.3%), higher complexity (8.5%) and high variation of temperature (7.8%) all increased the probability for regime 2 to occur, while depth (8.7%) showed a slightly negative relationship. The two most important interactions (
  <a rid="RSPB20182544TB2" ref-type="table" href="#RSPB20182544TB2">table 2</a>) revealed a higher probability of occurrence as both wave power and temperature variation increased, and a weakening of the impact of waves at deeper depths (electronic supplementary material, figure S4b). The model explained 37% of the deviance and had an AUC score of 0.88.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biophysical variables were also the most influential predictors of regime 3 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182544F3" href="#RSPB20182544F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">c</span>). Occurrence probability was higher in places with low maximum monthly climatological chlorophyll-
  <span class="italic">a</span> concentration (13.6%)—but positively correlated with a higher frequency of anomalous chlorophyll-
  <span class="italic">a</span> events (7.7%). Regime 3 was more likely at depths shallower than 25 m (8.9%) and in wave-sheltered environments (8.2%). The interactions were weak, with no clear interaction pattern apparent (
  <a rid="RSPB20182544TB2" ref-type="table" href="#RSPB20182544TB2">table 2</a>; electronic supplementary material, figure S4c). The model explained 39% of the deviance and had an AUC score of 0.90.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regime 5 was best predicted by depth (10.5%, peaked at mid-depth), increased topographical complexity of the seafloor (10.1%) and lower variation of irradiance (9.5%) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182544F3" href="#RSPB20182544F3">figure 3</a>
  <span class="italic">d</span>). It was also associated with higher levels of new development along the coastline (9%) and, to a lesser extent, increased catch from non-commercial shore spearfishing (6.9%). The most important interaction involved variation of irradiance and observed presence of invasive algae (
  <a rid="RSPB20182544TB2" ref-type="table" href="#RSPB20182544TB2">table 2</a>). However, this result should be treated with caution owing to the scarcity of data and binary nature (i.e. presence only) of the invasive algae predictor. The second interaction was weaker and displayed a greater effect of recreational boat fishing with increasing depth (
  <a rid="RSPB20182544TB2" ref-type="table" href="#RSPB20182544TB2">table 2</a>; electronic supplementary material, figure S4d). The model explained 41% of the deviance and had an AUC score of 0.91.
