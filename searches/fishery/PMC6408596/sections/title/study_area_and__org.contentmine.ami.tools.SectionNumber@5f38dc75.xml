The study builds on data from more than 1000 forereef habitat sampling locations (i.e. reef slope habitat exposed to the open ocean) across the region that were recently classified into five reef regimes using model-based clustering of 10 fish and benthic functional groups (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Each cluster is a mixture of multivariate distributions composed of the densities of each component (i.e. fish and benthic functional groups), and each observation is assigned to a cluster based on the probability of membership given the observation [

  <a rid="RSPB20182544C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182544C12">12</a>] identified one as a highly variable and transitional state (i.e. regime 4). Given the ambition to accurately associate predictors to the spatial occurrence of distinct regimes, we removed the sites classified into regime 4 to reduce noise in the data and optimize predictive performance. We also excluded the 25% most uncertain classifications (i.e. sites with the lowest probability of being classified again into the same regime), thereby retaining 620 sites most representative of four distinct reef regimes (

Regime 2 is characterized by rugose habitat with high fish biomass (e.g. browsers such as 
  <span class="italic">Kyphosus hawaiiensis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Naso unicornis</span>), high turf and macroalgae cover, and low hard coral cover. Regime 3 exhibits high fish biomass and turf algae cover, no macroalgae and moderate hard coral cover. Regime 5 displays moderate fish biomass, less turf algae and higher hard coral cover, commonly comprised of the coral
