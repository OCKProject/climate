 <div class="caption">
  <p>Partial dependency plots with 95% confidence intervals for the five most influential variables predicting the occurrence of four distinct reef regimes (
   <span class="italic">a</span>â€“
   <span class="italic">d</span>). The graphs show the effect of a given predictor on the probability of occurrence of the regime while keeping all other variables at their mean. Relative influence of each predictor is reported between parentheses. Grey tick marks across the top of each plot indicate observed data points. SST, sea surface temperature; max, maximum monthly climatological mean; STD, standard deviation of the long-term mean; anomaly, frequency of anomalies. (Online version in colour.)
