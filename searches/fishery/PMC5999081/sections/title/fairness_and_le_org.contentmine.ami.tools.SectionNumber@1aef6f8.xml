 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The majority of respondents who received compensation (60%) said it was insufficient to compensate for costs incurred by the fishing bans. Although the potential for strategic bias in this response should be taken into account, the result is not surprising. In poor, resource-dependent communities where resource supply is at risk, perceived opportunity costs of behavioural change tend to be very high [
  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref070">70</a>]. Moreover, other studies of the compensation scheme in Bangladesh have found that households tend not to receive their full 40 kg allocation, largely due to shortfalls in distribution costs that local government officials cover by withholding a share of the rice from each allocation [
  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref026">26</a>]. Taking the shortfalls into account, these studies suggest that an increase to 50 kg of rice per month should be adequate compensation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As well as adequately compensating for opportunity costs, a more transparent and precisely targeted scheme may go some way to improving perceptions of legitimacy and fairness. These perceptions are currently poor (64% reporting unfairness) and may be undermining its potential to incentivise compliance with the fishing bans [
  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref071">71</a>]. Although the majority of respondents said that they think the most dependent and poorest fishers receive compensation, three-quarters said that the well-connected are also favoured. Procedural legitimacy (deriving from an open and transparent process of decision-making and an explanation of the choices made) is closely linked to perceptions of fairness, and both play an important role in compliance with regulations [
  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref016">16</a>]. Currently, there is none of this legitimacy in the study site.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aside from the expected association between perceiving unfairness and not receiving compensation, the strongest pattern in perceptions of fairness was between villages. This could be related to the differences in governance that are inferred from the spatial pattern in compensation distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref017">17</a>], but the strong effect of district on compensation distribution was much weaker in the model for fairness. No evidence of order bias or other observer effects was found. It should be noted, however, that there may always be perceptions of unfairness when there are winners and losers involved and attitudes are not always strong predictors of actual behaviour [
  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref072">72</a>]. The shift in importance of fishing dependence and jatka fishing after excluding Chandpur households from model runs could be a reflection of the higher proportion of self-identified jatka fishers in other households sampled.
