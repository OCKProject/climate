 <div class="title">Map of study area, showing study site districts in relation to sanctuary sites.</div>
 <p>Each study site represents the approximate location of a cluster of surveyed villages, denoted by the relevant district name (precise village coordinates were not available). In Barisal and Bhola districts two village clusters were sampled and can be distinguished by the sub-district names (in brackets); in the other districts just one village cluster was sampled.</p>
