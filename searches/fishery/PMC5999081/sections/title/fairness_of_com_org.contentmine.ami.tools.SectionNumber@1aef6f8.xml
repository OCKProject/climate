 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceived fairness is a critical determinant of the acceptability of benefit distribution [

  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref060">60</a>]. We asked respondents whether they perceived the distribution of compensation to be fair (yes or no). In order to explore these perceptions of fairness or unfairness, we followed the above methods to fit binomial random intercept GLMMs with the probability of perceiving fairness as a binary response variable (1 = fair, 0 = unfair). Explanatory variables and expectations are presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197809.t002" href="#pone.0197809.t002">Table 2</a>. We expected households with a high level of awareness of hilsa management interventions (defined as ‘aware of all three interventions discussed in the questionnaire’) to be more likely to feel the scheme was fair, assuming that their understanding of the rationale behind compensation distribution was also greater [
  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref061">61</a>]. Research on fairness in payment systems has found it to depend on the quality of local governance and to be higher among local association members [
  <a rid="pone.0197809.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0197809.ref017">17</a>]. We therefore expected fisher association members to perceive fair distribution, and to see variation in perceptions between villages and between districts due to differences in local governance. We expected compensation recipients to perceive fair distribution, but expectations for high fishing dependence, jatka fishers and sanctuary fishers were less clear.
