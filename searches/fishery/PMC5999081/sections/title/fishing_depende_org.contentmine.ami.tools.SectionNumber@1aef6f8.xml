 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">99.7% of respondents reported hilsa fishing to be their main income-generating activity, but local knowledge indicates that the proportion is nearer 70% (BH, personal observation). It is possible that some respondents overstated their involvement in hilsa fishing because of their awareness of the compensation scheme and purpose of the survey, but it could also be due to different interpretations of the term ‘main’ activity (e.g., as more than half of all income, or largest single source of income). 53% of respondents said that they target jatka, and there was no significant association between targeting jatka and receiving compensation (

  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.01; df = 1; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.91). In fact, 52% of non-recipients said they target jatka, compared to 53% of recipients). 76% had livelihoods other than fishing, though only 8% had more than one alternative (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197809.s004" href="#pone.0197809.s004">S4 Appendix</a>). The mean proportion of income from fishing was 82% (estimated based on reported average monthly income from fishing and reported annual income from other sources, see questions 17 and 18, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197809.s001" href="#pone.0197809.s001">S1 Appendix</a>), showing a widespread high level of income dependency.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">40% of respondents stated that their main coping strategy during fishing bans is to fish anyway, rather than to take another job or adopt a food-based or monetary coping strategy. It is not possible to conclude from this result why they keep fishing, but, since this particular response was not offered as an option by the enumerators, the high level of response supports its importance, and so justifies its use as an indicator of dependence. This result also indicates widespread non-compliance with the fishing bans.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When hilsa fishers were asked directly about compliance with fishing bans, the majority said that few fishers comply and none said that all fishers comply. Levels of compliance by compensation recipients were perceived to be significantly higher than those by non-recipients; 66% of respondents said that few or no recipients comply, while 78% said that few or no non-recipients comply (χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 26.5, df = 3, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). Supporting this perception, there was a significant negative association between fishing as a main coping strategy during the fishing bans and receiving compensation; 36% of compensation recipients said that they fish anyway as their main coping strategy during fishing bans, compared to 45% of non-recipients (
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 8.06; df = 1; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01). This could indicate that people who fish during the ban periods are less likely to be compensated, but, given the poor monitoring and enforcement it is more likely an indication that people who are compensated are less likely to fish during the ban periods.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Households who said they fished in ban periods had significantly higher proportions of income from fishing than others (Wilcoxon rank sum test 
  <span class="italic">W</span> = 31244.5; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) and there was a significant negative association between having other livelihoods and fishing as a main coping strategy (
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 129.54; df = 1; 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). This indicates that households tend to fish as a coping strategy because they have few or no other livelihoods, rather than that households tend to seek other livelihoods so that they don’t have to fish. Fishing has long been a way of life for Hindus in coastal areas of Bangladesh, and now there are increasing numbers of poor and landless Muslims engaging in fishing [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The index of fishing dependence primarily contrasted households with a high dependence on fishing (who own boats, use multiple fishing gears, fish illegally, have higher proportions of income from fishing, and have no agricultural land or other livelihoods) with households who are less dependent on fishing (who have agricultural land and other livelihoods, do not own boats, use a single gear type, do not fish illegally, and have lower proportions of income from fishing) [
