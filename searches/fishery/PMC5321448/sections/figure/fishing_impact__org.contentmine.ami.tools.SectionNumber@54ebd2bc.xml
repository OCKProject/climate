  <div class="title">Fishing impact on the marine environment.</div>
  <p>Average fishing captures (in metric tons) for the 2000–2013 period are represented per country and MFA (top). Trends in fishing captures (slope of the linear trend for the 1950–2013 period) are also represented per country and MFA (middle). Those countries contributing the most to fishing captures at those MFA that overlap to a large extent with marine biodiversity hot spots are highlighted in dark gray (bottom). All of them have sovereign EEZs overlapping marine hot spots, with the exception of Spain.</p>
