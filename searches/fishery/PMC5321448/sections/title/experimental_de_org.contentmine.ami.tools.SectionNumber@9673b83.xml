 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the longest time series of remote-sensing records—annual composites—on SST (1980–2014), CHL (1979–2014), and marine currents (1980–2014) available to provide finest-scale measurements of the impacts of climate change on the marine environment globally (table S1). We then observed and described these environmental changes within hot spots of marine biodiversity determined from the world distributions of more than 2000 species of seabirds, marine mammals, and fish.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the overall picture of human-related impacts on the marine environment would be incomplete without consideration of industrial fisheries. Using FAO data over the last 60 years, we investigated spatiotemporal variation in fishing captures. FAO is the only institution that maintains and provides long-term global fisheries statistics from the 1950s onward. On the basis of a modeled disaggregation of fish landing information from FAO (

Although these modeled data may provide a better description of the local to regional impacts of human fisheries on marine biodiversity hot spots, here we used the raw data on fish landings from FAO to identify those countries that contribute the most to overall fishing pressure particularly within areas that overlap with marine biodiversity hot spots.
