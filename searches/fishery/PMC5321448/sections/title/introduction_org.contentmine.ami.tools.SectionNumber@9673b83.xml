 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The exponential rise of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations over the past 30 years has increased the average global temperature by 0.2°C per decade (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). Most of this extra heat is being absorbed by the world’s oceans, particularly by their upper layers (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>), with the mean global sea surface temperature (SST) increasing by approximately 0.4°C since the 1950s (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). The warming of the oceans drives greater stratification of the water column, thereby reducing mixing in some parts of the ocean, which affects oxygen (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>) and nutrient availability (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>) and, hence, primary production (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>) and the ecophysiology of water-breathing organisms (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>). The increase in water temperatures is, however, unevenly distributed spatially (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>) and, together with increased meltwater and discharged ice from terrestrial glaciers and ice sheets, influences the behavior of ocean currents, which play critical roles in the dynamics, local climates, and biology of the ocean (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). Coincidentally with these environmental changes, industrial fisheries have resulted in the overexploitation and decimation of about 70% of world fish stocks (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>), resulting in changes to fish communities and marine ecosystems since the Second World War (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). Both climatic and human pressures can lead to shifts in the size, structure, spatial range, and seasonal abundance of populations (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>), which, in turn, may alter trophic pathways from primary producers to upper-trophic levels, propagating changes throughout ecosystems in both bottom-up and top-down directions (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>). Accordingly, climate and fishing impacts should not be treated in isolation from each other when it comes to conservation of marine biodiversity (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the scale of these perturbations, our understanding of how environmental variability—driven by climate change and human activities—affects marine ecosystems has lagged far behind our knowledge of their impacts in terrestrial ecosystems (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>). In part, this is because there is considerable uncertainty regarding the spatial and temporal details of these impacts in marine environments (
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>). Satellite remote-sensing records have emerged as important tools for studying the most recent (up to three decades) and striking trends and patterns in both environmental (for example, SST or ocean currents) and biological (marine productivity) variables in the world’s oceans at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). Additionally, worldwide fishing records (for example, annual landings) are available from the 1950s onward (see 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fao.org/fishery/en" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.fao.org/fishery/en</span>), albeit at a poorer spatial resolution [but see the study by Watson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>) and 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.seaaroundus.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.seaaroundus.org</span> for spatial disaggregation of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) fishery data], providing important information to assist in a global assessment of the major human harvest that affects marine ecosystems (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>,

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). Analyzed together, these data provide the most detailed insights, to date, into the spatiotemporal distribution of environmental and human stressors threatening marine communities. However, few studies to date have analyzed the data on a fine-enough scale to identify the specific marine areas that, globally, are most at risk from climate change (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>) and exploitation from fisheries (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>); none of them have combined these measurements of climate and human impacts with those for species distribution globally to identify hot spots of marine diversity that can be targeted for conservation at the local, regional, and global scale.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By overlaying the most spatially explicit measurements of marine biodiversity available globally with the finest-scale measurements for the cumulative impacts from climate change and the FAO data on fishing pressure, we aimed to identify the areas of highest conservation priority within our planet’s marine environment. In particular, (i) we compiled a species-level database recording the global distribution of 2183 marine species to identify hot spots of marine biodiversity; (ii) we derived spatially explicit information on the cumulative impact of climate change by combining more than three decades’ worth of information on SST, oceans currents, and marine productivity [that is, chlorophyll a concentration (CHL)]; (iii) we evaluated changes in fishing captures over the last 60 years to examine temporal trends in the exploitation of marine resources worldwide. We also identified countries that have contributed the most to fishing pressure at marine hot spots over the last decade, highlighting those fishing outside their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</p>
