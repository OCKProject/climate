In fish, it is particularly relevant studying the interplay of resource abundance and size-selection. These are two environmental stressors affecting fish in natural conditions, but also associated with human-induced environmental change. For instance, fishing, one of the most important threats for freshwater and marine populations, results in both higher mortality on large-sized fish and reduced population density.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Medaka, <italic>Oryzias latipes,</italic> from lines selected for large or small size over ten generations, were exposed individually to high or low food availability from birth to adulthood. Maturation schedules, reproductive investment, growth, boldness and feeding were assessed to evaluate the effect of size-selection on the pace of life, and whether it differed between food contexts (high and low). Different food abundance and size-selection resulted in diverse life histories associated with different feeding and boldness behaviour, thus showing different pace-of-life-syndromes. High availability of food favoured faster growth, earlier maturation and increased shyness. Selection for small size led to slower growth in both males and females. But, the life-history trajectory to reach such growth was sex- and food-specific. Under low food conditions, females selected for small size showed earlier maturation, which led to slower adult growth and subsequent low willingness to feed, compared to females selected for large size. No line differences were found in females at high food conditions. In contrast, males exposed to selection for small size grew slower both as juvenile and adult, and were bolder under both feeding regimes. Therefore, the response to size-selection was more sensitive to food availability in females than in males.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">We showed that size-selection (over ten generations) and resource abundance (over developmental time) led to changes in life history and behaviour. However, the effect of size-selection was sex- and context-specific, calling for precaution when drawing general conclusions on the population-level effects (or lack of them) of size-selective fishing. Conservation and management plans should consider this sex- and context-specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12862-019-1460-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Age at maturation</kwd><kwd>Investment in reproduction</kwd><kwd>Growth</kwd><kwd>Boldness</kwd><kwd>Feeding behaviour</kwd><kwd>Resource availability</kwd><kwd>Size-selective mortality</kwd><kwd>Fisheries-induced evolution</kwd><kwd>Pace-of-life syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Norges Forskningsr&#x000e5;d (NO)</institution></funding-source><award-id>268218/MO</award-id><award-id>255601/E40</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz Pauli</surname><given-names>Beatriz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par17">Variation in life histories arises from different trajectories of survival, growth and fecundity that maximises fitness in different environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Somatic growth, time of maturation and reproductive investment are key factors in an individual&#x02019;s life cycle and hence represent a life-history strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Numerous environmental factors (e.g., resource abundance, temperature, inter- and intraspecific interactions) can affect growth and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Studying how these factors affect variation in life-history strategies is particularly relevant to better understand the potential evolutionary adaptation of wild populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">In the particular case of fish, size-selective mortality and resource availability are two environmental stressors of interest. Selection on body size in fish can result from natural mortality, as predators normally target small individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or from fishing-induced mortality that is commonly higher on large individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Food abundance is affected by many factors such as intraspecific competition, climate change and predation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Increased predation (by predators or fishing) not only leads to selection on size, but further results in lower abundance in the population and thus increases food availability for the survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This interplay between size-selection and resource availability on life-history traits is still poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Size-selective mortality on large individuals, as that induced by fishing, leads to decreased life span. And hence, according to life-history theory, fast life histories are favoured &#x02013; i.e., earlier maturation and increased reproductive investment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, how size-selective fishing affects juvenile and adult growth remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Most empirical evidence shows no direct effect of size-selective fishing on growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], or an indirect effect resulting in reduced growth only after maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Yet, such a response may not appear if resource availability is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, populations exposed to fishing would experience fast or slow growth, depending on the selectivity of the gear and the minimum size imposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Life-history diversity often entails co-variation with behaviour, as behaviour and physiology are the basis for the trade-off between current and future reproduction (referred as pace-of-life syndrome) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Fast life history is expected to be linked with behaviours that favour energy acquisition (e.g., foraging behaviour) and reproduction over survival (e.g., boldness), resulting in a fast pace of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, the few studies that have evaluated how behaviour was affected by size-selective mortality showed that fish exposed to positive size selection were less bold and less eager to forage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Behavioural and life-history co-variation are often sex- and context-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Thus, knowledge on how the suit of life-history and behavioural traits changes due to size-selective mortality is still limited. Particularly, little is known about whether such changes are affected by the release from density-dependent food limitation following the reduction in abundance in harvested populations, and whether both sexes despite their different investment in reproduction are responding in a similar way.</p><p id="Par21">Here we tested how two different size-selective mortality regimes (on large or small size) affected the pace-of-life syndrome in medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>). In addition, we evaluated whether the result of size-selection differed under different food availability conditions. Wild medaka were used to produce two laboratory-reared lineages over ten generations with selection for either large or small standard body length at 75&#x02009;days post-hatching (dph); here referred to as large-selected and small-selected lines, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The line selected for small size mimics the size-selective pressure induced by fishing, where large individuals are harvested and mainly the smaller individuals can reproduce. The large-selected line mimics natural size-selection, where predators feed on small individuals. Lines were selected under common-garden conditions with abundant food supply. Individuals from the 11th generation were reared in isolation under two different feeding regimes (high and low food availability). We fitted data on age and length to a biphasic (juvenile and adult) growth model that allowed studying trade-offs in energy allocation between growth, maturation and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Females were measured every 2 weeks, while males every three, thus models were fitted separately for each sex. Once fish became mature, we assessed the feeding behaviour and boldness of each individual. Both behaviours have ecological validity, as they are respectively linked to foraging rate and risk of predation and hence related to fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">We expected individuals from the small-selected line to express 1) fast life histories (i.e., early maturation and high investment in reproduction), with growth only slowing down after maturation, and 2) behaviours associated with a fast pace of life, i.e., higher boldness and feeding rate compared to large-selected line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We also predicted that 3) individuals under low food availability would present slower pace of life relative to under high food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The effects of size-selection on behavioural and life-history traits would hold true at differing food abundances and for both sexes if food availability did not play a role in the selection process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], as expected under controlled equal and abundant food availability in the selection experiment. However, different reproductive investments between sexes may affect this expectation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Life-history traits</title><p id="Par23">Both male and female medaka showed large inter-individual variation in growth and life-history parameters (age at maturation and maximal potential growth; Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and b). Life-history traits differed between the two laboratory-reared lines (i.e., small-selected vs. large-selected) and the two food availability conditions applied during development (high vs. low; see Methods for details). Both low food availability and selection for small size led to smaller size, but the life-history trajectory leading there was context-specific (different between treatments) and different between sexes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Growth trajectories from raw data (grey lines) and growth rates estimated by the growth models (coloured lines) for a) females and b) males.

In addition, fish from the large-selected line were larger at 180 dph compared to those originating from the small-selected line, although this was food-dependent in females (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Overall, the effect of size-selection in females was absent in the juvenile phase of the growth curve (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). It was only observable in adult growth under low food conditions, when the earlier age at maturation of small-selected females resulted in a slower adult growth and hence smaller length at 180 dph (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Thus, the effect of line on female growth only occurred indirectly through its effect on maturation. The effect of size-selective mortality in males was evident, with juvenile and adult growth always being slower for small-selected males, and direct, as it was not affected through any other parameter.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Female growth model structure and estimates (standard errors, SE) for <italic>a</italic><sub>mat</sub>, <italic>r</italic>, and &#x003b2;</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="3">Parameter estimates (SE)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Treatment</td><td><italic>a</italic><sub>mat</sub> (day)</td><td>

It was affected by the interaction of food and line in females, but not in males. As expected, females delayed maturation under low food conditions, but the delay differed between small- and large-selected females (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

These traits were also affected by exposure to different food availabilities during development of each fish to a somewhat larger extent. Both the selection for small size (experienced by the parental generation) of fish and exposure to low food availability during development, led to shorter length at adulthood. However, the life-history traits (age at maturation, maximal potential growth and investment in reproduction) that led to such outcome were context-specific and differed between food availability and size-selection. Moreover, the effect of size-selection, but not the effect of food availability, was sex-specific.</p><p id="Par31">It should be noted that comparisons between the two drivers evaluated here (i.e. size-selection and food availability) are challenging, as they were acting on different ecological processes (i.e. plasticity vs. evolution). Specifically, food availability affected the environment of the studied fish during their development from juvenile to adulthood, while size-selection was the stressor experienced by ten ancestral generations. Food availability and size-selection can lead also to evolutionary and plastic changes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], but here the experimental design limited those effects. Indeed, food availability was a proximate driver of plastic change in life-history traits, while size-selection could affect life history through genetic change (evolution), as it was performed under common garden conditions over ten generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Epigenetic inheritance cannot be ruled out, but it is likely not related to size-selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. We warrant this simplification to better disentangle the effect of each treatment, before more complex interactions between treatments, through intraspecific competition should be assessed. In addition, sex differences could be due to differences in handling the sexes during the experiment due to time and space limitations. Males were measured every 3 weeks and water quality was maintained with partial water changes (for half of the males) and constant flow-through (on the other half), while females were measured every 2 weeks and water quality was maintained by constant flow-through of water. Even though these differences should not affect the effect of experimental treatments, but the statistical power, its effect cannot be completely ruled out.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Effect of food</title><p id="Par32">As expected, low food availability led to smaller size at adulthood and slower growth relative to high food availability in both sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] . Low food availability led to higher willingness to feed and increased boldness (less freezing time) compared to high food availability, although the latter only happened in females. Thus, the hunger level might be the driver of increased boldness and increased willingness to eat, as seen elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Specifically, Magnuson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] found that under limited food medaka became more aggressive to ensure access to food and maximal growth rate. Fast growth is generally associated with boldness and willingness to forage through evolutionary trade-offs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but these links often depend on environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In the present study, fast-growing fish at high food condition might have been feeding at a maximum ratio. Indeed, they showed lower immediate willingness or need to feed (no hunger and low appetite) during our observational assays, and lower boldness (at least in females). The links here between growth and behaviour are driven by hunger levels and are thus probably plastic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Effect of size-selection</title><p id="Par33">Fish selected for small body size grew slower relative to those selected for large body size, as normally observed in other size-selective experiments on fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, the overall shorter length at adulthood in small-selected fish, were achieved through different growth trajectories between sexes. Here, growth depended on the combination of the exponent of the maximal potential growth rate (related to &#x003b2;) and age at maturation.</p><p id="Par34">Size-selection affected growth rates in males throughout their lives, but only during adulthood in females &#x02013; this was due to size-selection effects on different parameters. Males experienced a direct effect of size-selection on growth, affecting only &#x003b2; &#x02013; males selected for small size had lower values of &#x003b2; and thus grew slower. This, together with the lack of differences in maturation and reproductive investment between lines, led to different growth curves throughout the life of the fish. Females experienced a direct effect of size-selection on age at maturation under low food conditions. This led to an indirect effect of size-selection on growth, which resulted in equal juvenile growth between lines followed by a slowed down adult growth in small-selected females reared at low food. At high food conditions, females of both lines presented equal growth curves. Reduced age at maturation after selection for small size is expected from theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and observed in laboratory experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], but only occurred for females reared under low food conditions in our experiment.</p><p id="Par35">The interaction between size-selection and food suggests that food availability played a role during the selection process in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The higher investment in reproduction in females relative to in males may have resulted in females perceiving their food environment, during the selection process, as quantitatively low. This higher sensitivity to food in females also became apparent in our results on behaviour &#x02013; the feeding and boldness of females were affected more by food than those of males. This is in concordance with earlier studies in medaka showing that females are more sensitive to fasting than males, resulting in reduced gonadosomatic index and fecundity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Thus, it seems that females were only selected for small size under low food availability, and hence the response to selection is stronger under conditions similar to those experienced under the selection process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Similar resource-dependent response to size-selection has been seen in other fish species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In the case of the killifish, <italic>Rivulus hartii</italic><bold><italic>,</italic></bold> the females response to size-selection were also more sensitive to food availability than the males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

This was evident at least in males, which showed reduced juvenile and adult growth. Medaka females fed less when selected for small size, which presented early maturation and slow adult growth. Size-selection experiments with Atlantic silversides<italic>, Menidia menidia</italic>, have shown a reduced food consumption in fish selected for small size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, similar selection experiments have indicated reduced boldness in fish selected for small size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As noted earlier, the evolutionary link between fast growth and boldness is common mainly when predation is high and resources are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. For instance, in medaka exposed to low food, higher aggression (commonly correlated with boldness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]) was linked with higher growth rate, but this link disappeared when food supply was high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. When resources are abundant, low activity and boldness leads to higher growth as predicted by the allocation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Overall, we observed that changes in life-history parameters due to size-selection also led to changes in behaviour, which were consistent over time and among context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Medaka do not present drastic morphological sexual dimorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], but males and females present behavioural and physiological differences.

Moreover, external factors (e.g., food, temperature, pollutants) seem to alter reproductive investment in females (but not behaviour) and aggressiveness in males (but not reproduction or to a lower extent) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Overall, this sexual dimorphism in sensitivity to external stressors could explain the sexual differences observed in the present study. Moreover, our results highlight the need of assessing sexual differences while evaluating life-history and behavioural traits.</p><p id="Par38">Here we show that the effect of size-selection, such as the one induced by fishing, on life history can entail behavioural changes. Boldness and foraging are at the core of predator-prey interactions, as they determine the effects of consumers on their prey and are affected by the presence of predators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Therefore, changes in behaviour due to human-induced size-selection can in turn affect the resource community and ecosystem processes through different pathways, such as alteration of the strength of the trophic cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Moreover, the links between life history and behaviour are more complex than often assumed and dependent on sex and environmental conditions. A better understanding on how size-selective mortality affects this suit of traits is not only relevant for management and conservation of exploited species, but allow us to predict further ecosystem consequences. We suggest that future mesocosm-based experiments should assess whether differences in these size-dependent correlated traits can translate to changes in the trophic cascade to better evaluate the ecosystem impacts of size-dependent mortality. Moreover, such experiments could allow the interplay of food availability and size-selection and hence assess the context-dependency of such ecological variations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">In the present study, both sexes displayed smaller size and slower growth when exposed to selection for small size, similar to the size-selection induced by fishing.

Thus, here we aimed at studying the effect of size-selection on growth in both sexes without directly comparing sexes.

Each fish was exposed to the three conditions inside their tank in a randomized order, each exposition replicated twice. Only one condition was tested per day and the second replicate took place 1 week after the first one. The six measurements (three conditions repeated twice) of each behaviour (i.e. feeding and boldness; see details below) ensured that we considered consistent intrinsic individual variation in behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, the effect of time and experimental condition was not the main focus of the study, thus details on the experimental set up and across-context repeatability can be found in the supplementary material (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S1&#x02013;S3).</p><p id="Par54">During 5&#x02009;min of observations we counted 1) number of bites to the supplied food (<italic>Artemia</italic> or pellets) as a measurement of willingness to feed, and thus is associated with foraging on prey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and 2) total time frozen at the bottom of the tank, as a proxy of boldness, which is related to predation risk and survival in natural conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A fish that spends more time immobile is considered less bold than one that spends little time immobile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Both behaviours are ecologically relevant, as they are linked to interactions with prey and predators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].

Full models contained size-selection (Large-selected vs. Small-selected), food (High food vs. Low food) and their interaction as fixed effects. The analyses of number of bites and freezing time (measured as an integer count of seconds) were performed following negative binomial distribution and allowing for zero inflation, as 33 and 49% of the data for number of bites were zeros for females and males respectively, and 52% of the values for freezing time were zeros for both males and females. Negative binomial distribution was used due to overdispersion observed with Poisson distribution. The final model was the one ranked with the lowest AIC. The residuals from all the final models were evaluated following [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and fulfilled all the requirements. In addition, simulations showed that the zero-inflated models represented well the data; particularly the models estimated an equivalent number of zeros as in the original data on average in 40% of the simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. It should be noted that the analyses with negative binomial distribution and zero inflation evaluate each behaviour in two ways: 1) total amount of bites or seconds frozen, and 2) probability of zero bites or zero seconds frozen. Thus, the effects of size-selection and food are evaluated for both cases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
