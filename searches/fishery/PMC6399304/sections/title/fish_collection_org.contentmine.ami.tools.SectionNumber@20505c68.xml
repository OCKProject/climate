 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Commercial (140 mm mesh) and multi-mesh subsistence (5 or 8 panels of 38–140 mm) fishing nets were set during December-June (freshwater lakes under thick ice) and August-September (at open water river estuaries during sea-ice formation and char migration) at distinct geographic sites over a period of 3 years. After setting for several hours, nets were retrieved, and fish were pulled from the nets with nitrile gloves. Using either sterile cotton swabs or an ethanol-sterilized scalpel, the surface mucosal layer of each fish was sampled once per fish with the swabs, or skin scrapings, taken from above the lateral line. The fish were then photographed, weighed, and measured, followed by dissection in an on-site mobile lab. Full intestines were removed using sterile technique, and both skin and intestinal samples were placed in sterile sample tubes or bags, respectively, and frozen at −20°C in a freezer on-site. Samples were shipped frozen and subsequently stored at −20°C until further processing. In addition to the skin and intestine samples, water samples were also taken at each fishing site, in which up to 2 L of water was filtered through sterile 0.22 μm PALL filters in triplicate. The filters were then frozen at −20°C and were subsequently transported and stored at −80°C until further processing.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fish were sampled in accordance with issued licenses to fish for scientific purposes in the waters of the Northwest Territories, Yukon north slope, and Nunavut (in accordance with section 52 of the general fishery regulations of the fisheries act, Fisheries and Oceans, Canada) along with an associated animal care permit issued by the Fresh Water Institute Animal Care Committee of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (current permit numbers S-18/19-1045-NU and FWI-ACC AUP-2018-63).</p>
