 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sequence reads were demultiplexed using Illumina MiSeq Reporter software version 2.5.0.5. Reads were assembled using the paired-end assembler for Illumina sequences (PANDAseq version 2.8, Masella et al., 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">2012</a>) with a quality threshold of 0.9, an 8 nucleotide minimum overlap, and 32 nucleotide minimum assembled read length. Assembled reads were analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME version 1.9.0, Caporaso et al., 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">2010</a>). Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using UPARSE algorithm USEARCH version 7.0.1090 (Edgar, 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">2013</a>) at 97% identity and aligned with the Python Nearest Alignment Space Termination tool (PyNAST version 1.2.2, Caporaso et al., 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">2010</a>). All representative sequences were classified using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP version 2.2, Wang et al., 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">2007</a>) with a stringent confidence threshold (0.8) and the Greengenes database (McDonald et al., 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">2012</a>) was used to assign taxonomy. Chimeric sequences were filtered with UCHIME (Edgar et al., 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">2011</a>). Before performing statistical analysis, OTUs observed in no-template PCR controls for a sample type were filtered from all samples of that type. OTUs with three or fewer reads within negative PCR controls were retained within the samples, since their low representation in the negative controls rendered them viable representatives in the samples. The OTUs were then rarefied to ~2,000 reads for skin and intestinal microbiome samples. Alpha and beta diversity for samples were analyzed based on rarified OTU tables generated using QIIME with principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Additional visualizations were done using EMPeror (VÃ¡zquez-Baeza et al., 
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">2013</a>). Primer 7 software version 7.0.13 was used for analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and similarity percentages (SIMPER) analyses (Clarke et al., 
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">2014</a>). Clustering analysis was performed using Statistica 13.0 Academic software.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hypothesis that skin microbial community composition was linked to salinity was tested by performing hierarchical Ward's linkage clustering (Dillner et al., 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2005</a>). Tree cluster analysis was carried out using Ward's method as the amalgamation rule and the distance measured as Euclidean units (Dillner et al., 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2005</a>). Using K-means clustering, the samples were divided into K clusters by selecting the number of iterations as 10, and the initial cluster centers chosen to maximize initial between-cluster distances. The output of this step is the list of fish samples that are present in each cluster. The sequence data is publicly available in the European Nucleotide Archive within the European Bioinformatics Institute, under the study: Characterization and Analysis of Skin- and Intestine-associated Microbiomes in the Lower Northwest Passage (Nunavut, Canada) with the following accession number,
