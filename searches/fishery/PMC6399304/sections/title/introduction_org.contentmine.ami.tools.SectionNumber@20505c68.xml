 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fish carry a mucous layer on their epithelial surfaces that consists of mucins, immunoglobulins, antimicrobial peptides, and commensal bacteria, which serve roles in friction reduction, waste removal, osmoregulation, as well as an early line of defense against pathogens (Esteban and Cerezuela, 
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">2015</a>). In addition, variations in mucous layer microbiome composition occur across different life stages, among different species, and across distinct geographies in amphibians and marine mammals, which are known to share certain microbial species with the surrounding water (Boutin et al., 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2013</a>; Apprill et al., 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2014</a>; Kueneman et al., 
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2014</a>; Chiarello et al., 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">2015</a>). Indeed, in farmed Atlantic salmon (
  <span class="italic">Salmo salar</span>), the abundance of certain bacterial phyla in skin- and intestine-associated microbiomes changed depending on the water source (Lokesh and Kiron, 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2016</a>; Dehler et al., 
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">2017</a>). Structural changes to the microbiota, however, have not been well-described in wild fish populations. This research is noteworthy because it indicates that deliberate shifts in community structure could potentially hinder the development of dysbiosis.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arctic char (
  <span class="italic">Salvelinus alpinus</span>), a salmonid species, is of particular interest given the increased popularity of the farmed product in temperate regions. Wild 
  <span class="italic">S. alpinus</span> stocks from high latitude waters with an anadromous life history, such that they spend the winter in freshwater lakes to avoid freezing and subsequently migrate to the more nutrient-rich Arctic sea in the summer, could provide insight into the purported turnover in char microbiomes and be of interest to aquaculture biotechnologists.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although relatively unexploited commercially, Arctic char stocks in the lower Northwest Passage of the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut, Canada represent an essential subsistence fishery to indigenous Inuit communities. With recent altered sea ice patterns as a consequence of climate change, and the potential for increasing stress of pollutants associated with future industrialization, we considered it important to undertake genomic, demographic, physiological and microbial analyses on these fish populations. At present, the stocks are considered healthy due a general lack of commercial fisheries in this region, as well as the relatively long-life span of individual fish, which has been reported as up to 33 years in our samples. As part of this effort, an assessment of the mucosa-associated microbiomes of the skin and intestines of 
  <span class="italic">S. alpinus</span> from the area in, and surrounding, King William Island Nunavut, has been undertaken. We further explored whether this increased understanding of the microbial communities could inform future biotechnological applications in the management of commercially farmed fish, in addition to other biotechnologies.
