 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After initial optimization experimentation to determine the selection of appropriate DNA extraction kits for each sample type, DNA from the skin samples was extracted using a NucleoSpin Soil Extraction Kit (Machery-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA), with modifications following the procedures of Kueneman et al. (
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">2014</a>) in which samples were incubated at 65°C for 10 min before mechanical lysis. In order to maximize yield, the initial lysis step was conducted twice, and double-distilled sterile water was left on the filter for 5 min prior to elution. Extracted DNA concentrations were assessed using an Invitrogen Qubit 4 Fluorometer and a QuantiFluor ONE dsDNA system (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), followed by qualitative analysis with agarose gel electrophoresis and a NanoDrop One Microvolume spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) set to A
  <sub>260/280</sub> absorbance. High concentration samples were diluted to 50 ng μL
  <span class="sup">−1</span> prior to PCR amplification, in which starting material for PCR templates ranged from 1 to 50 ng μL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. These skin-associated microbiome samples underwent a pre-amplification PCR step using primers 8F and 1406R (Lane, 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">1991</a>; Coolen et al., 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">2005</a>) to amplify the variable V1–V9 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The PCR mix for each reaction (50 μL total volume) contained 1X ThermoFisher DreamTaq Buffer (with 2 mM MgCl
  <sub>2</sub>), 0.4 μM forward and reverse primers, 200 μM dNTPs, 400 ng BSA, 2.5 U ThermoFisher DreamTaq DNA Polymerase, and 2 μL of template. The PCR was performed as follows: 95°C for 5 min, 25 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 52°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension of 72°C for 7 min.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intestinal samples were partially thawed to excise three slices within the distal intestine (~2 cm from the vent), comprising a total of 5–100 mg epithelial tissue, avoiding feces and connective tissue. The slices were pooled and DNA was extracted using MOBIO UltraClean Tissue and Cells DNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Toronto, ON) following the manufacturer's instructions, except that elution was achieved with double-distilled sterile water rather than EDTA. The DNA concentrations for the intestine-associated microbiome samples were estimated as described for the skin-associated microbiome preparations, but adjusted to 30 ng μL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Pre-amplified PCR products were also prepared as described above.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified on an Illumina sequence platform from DNA isolated from the triplicate water filters using primers 515F and 806R (Caporaso et al., 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">2011</a>).
