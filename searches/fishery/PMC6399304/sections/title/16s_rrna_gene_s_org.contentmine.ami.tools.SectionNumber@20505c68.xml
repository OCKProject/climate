 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from each of the skin and intestinal amplification products using primers 515F-Y (Parada et al., 
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">2016</a>) and 926R (Quince et al., 
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">2011</a>). Each primer contained a 6-base index sequence for sample multiplexing as well as Illumina flow cell binding and sequencing sites (Bartram et al., 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">2011</a>). The PCR mix (25 μL total volume) contained 1X ThermoPol Buffer, 0.2 μM forward and reverse primers, 200 μM dNTPs, 15 μg BSA, 0.625 U Hot Start 
  <span class="italic">Taq</span> DNA polymerase, and 1 μL of template. The PCR was performed as follows: 95°C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, 68°C for 1 min, and a final extension of 68°C for 7 min. Each amplification reaction was done in triplicate. Equal quantities of each amplicon were pooled. Samples that did not yield a PCR product were not included. No-template controls were added to the Illumina sequencing pool (5 μL), even when amplicons were not detected. Pooled 16S rRNA gene amplicons were subsequently excised from an agarose gel and purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, WI, USA). A 5 pM library containing 15% PhiX Control v3 (Illumina Canada Inc, NB, Canada) was sequenced on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina Inc, CA, USA) using a 2 × 250 cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (Illumina Canada Inc., BC, Canada).
