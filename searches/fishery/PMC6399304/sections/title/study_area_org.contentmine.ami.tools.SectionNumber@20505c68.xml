 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishing was done within the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut, Canada in the Western Arctic, at seven distinct sites within 200 km of King William Island, located along the lower Northwest Passage (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>; 
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Fishing sites were chosen based on Traditional Ecological Knowledge shared by local Inuit elders and in association with the Hunters and Trappers Association of Gjoa Haven, NU, as part of a large-scale fisheries project (Towards; 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arcticfishery.ca" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.arcticfishery.ca</span>). At each fishing site, specific conductance of surface water was obtained with a conductivity meter (Traceable Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific) to record conductivity and determine our site designations as either freshwater or saline sites (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The southern region of the study area is unique due to large freshwater influence from major river systems, including Murchison River, Legendary River, Back River, and Hayes River. Therefore, the major sea-water bodies within the region, namely Rasmussen Basin and Chantrey Inlet, are characterized by brackish salinities as defined by Watling (

  <span class="sup">−1</span>, diverging from sea salinities more characteristic of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Carmack, 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2007</a>). Fishing sites within these locations are referred to as “saline” sites.
