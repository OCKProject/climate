 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 202 intestinal microbiome samples were tested by hierarchical Ward's linkage clustering (Dillner et al., 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2005</a>) to investigate the link between salinity and intestine-associated microbiota. The amalgamation schedule graph again showed seven major fusion steps, resulting in eight distinct clusters (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Figure 5B</a>) with Euclidean distances between clusters showing their distinctive nature (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5" href="#SM5">Table S5</a>). Of the 59 intestinal microbiome samples from freshwater and 143 from saline sites, two clusters (#6 and #8) were dominated by samples from saline water sites whereas another two clusters (#2 and #5) only showed samples from freshwater (
  <a rid="T3" ref-type="table" href="#T3">Table 3B</a>). Therefore, these clusters provide further support to the PCoA analysis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3</a>) that salinity is a statistically significant variable defining the Arctic char intestine-associated microbiome. The ANOVA results indicate that of the 507 taxa used in the clustering analysis, 50 have a 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-value below 0.05. The phylum Proteobacteria accounted for 25 of these taxa (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6" href="#SM6">Table S6</a>). Members defined as belonging to an “unidentified kingdom” represented over 6% of the microbial community in two clusters (#4 and #5). Overall, the intestinal core microbiome appears more diverse than that of the skin, with 14 taxa present in all eight clusters (
  <a rid="T4" ref-type="table" href="#T4">Table 4B</a>). Clusters (#1–#7) included taxa that represented ~8% or more of the community, with 4 and 8 clusters with a single genus occupying over 50% of the entire intestinal microbiome. The taxa included unidentified genera from families Fusobacteriaceae, Comamonadaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Vibrionaceae. Other members of the intestinal-associated microbiome include 
  <span class="italic">Streptococcus, Sphingomonas, Shewanella, Pseudomonas, Aliivibrio, Photobacterium</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Mycoplasma</span> (
  <a rid="T4" ref-type="table" href="#T4">Table 4B</a>). Again, no correlation was obtained between the presence of any of the microbial genus species and the sex, age, or size of the Arctic char (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05; not shown). Additionally, since hierarchical Ward's linkage clustering was implemented on skin and intestine samples without regard to fishing site, we postulate that the following results provide further evidence that the changes in microbiome between fish caught in saline and freshwater environments are strongly linked to salinity.
