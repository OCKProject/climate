 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Knowledge of the loss that has occurred, and its severity, is increasingly motivating restoration works through small to medium-scale on-ground works and research and development trials. Projects are planned in all states (except the Northern Territory) and several have already been implemented with the assistance of private, government and non-government funding. A national network of practitioners, The Shellfish Reef Restoration Network, has been established to help support protection and restoration efforts. Their website (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Below we outline three key actions than can help convert knowledge of loss into on-ground restoration and long-term recovery:</p>
 <div list-type="order" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Raise the profile of shellfish ecosystems by increasing education and communication on their function and value 
    <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
     <div class="list-item">
      <p>Governments and coastal managers can recognise shellfish ecosystems as a discreet marine ecosystem, which should be included in coastal ecosystem classification, mapping and management processes</p>
     </div>
     <div class="list-item">
      <p>Educators and community groups can develop communication materials and learning activities such as citizen science, traditional ecological knowledge and oral histories for students, community groups, fishers and Indigenous groups which improve knowledge of shellfish ecosystems</p>
     </div>
     <div class="list-item">
      <p>Researchers can measure the ecosystem service benefits of Australian shellfish ecosystems to help quantify the benefits of protection and recovery [e.g.

  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Support protection of remaining shellfish ecosystems and eliminate current and future threats by determining eligibility for protection under Commonwealth and State Government threatened ecological community, flora and fauna and fisheries policies and legislation 
    <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
     <div class="list-item">
      <p>Governments can prioritise and allocate resources for baseline mapping to determine the location, extent and vulnerability of remaining shellfish ecosystems and review the eligibility of shellfish ecosystems under Commonwealth and State Government protection mechanisms</p>
     </div>
     <div class="list-item">
      <p>Researchers can identify the current extent and biological attributes of remaining shellfish ecosystems to better understand their ecological communities and their vulnerability to threatening processes</p>
     </div>
     <div class="list-item">
      <p>The community can advocate for greater protection of shellfish ecosystems by recognising their value and supporting government initiatives to protect existing and future shellfish ecosystems</p>
     </div>
    </div>
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Invest in the development of early restoration projects to build momentum, expertise and capacity in Australiaâ€™s marine restoration community</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historically-harvested locations could be good candidate sites for restoration efforts, and further research in this area is warranted. However, changes in substrate, water quality and salinity may render historical sites no longer suitable for shellfish ecosystems, and new areas, without historical ecosystems, may now be suitable and could be considered.</p>
 <div list-type="bullet" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>The public and private sector can allocate resources to and partner with shellfish ecosystem restoration projects to facilitate the development of local restoration methods for recovering shellfish ecosystems</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>The shellfish aquaculture and commercial fisheries industries can partner with researchers and restoration practitioners to share information and help optimize local restoration methods</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Governments, researchers, communities and the conservation sector can partner with experienced international practitioners and projects to effectively apply best practice shellfish ecosystem restoration methods to Australian projects</p>
