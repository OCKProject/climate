 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">James Cook provided the first European account of extensive oyster reefs in Botany Bay in 1777 [
  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref068">68</a>]. Several other early explorers also documented extensive reefs in locations such as Port Phillip Bay, Victoria [

  <span class="italic">O</span>. 
  <span class="italic">angasi</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">glomerata</span> were commercially harvested by dredge and hand methods from first European settlement in Sydney in 1788 [
  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref072">72</a>] and at the same time or shortly after the establishment of Australia’s other major colonies of Hobart (

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref072">72</a>]), Melbourne (

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref074">74</a>]) and Adelaide (

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref037">37</a>]). These fisheries expanded to bays and estuaries located farther away from Australia’s first colonies as local resources became depleted and demand increased [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref037">37</a>], resulting in a valuable commercial harvest fishery for 
  <span class="italic">O</span>. 
  <span class="italic">angasi</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S</span>. 
  <span class="italic">glomerata</span>, which spanned much of their distributions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At its peak the commercial harvest industry provided hundreds of direct jobs in fishing, fish mongering and restaurants (e.g. oyster bars), lime production and boat building [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref075">75</a>], whilst also providing a cheap and accessible food source that sustained early Australian coastal and inland colonial expansion for nearly 100 years and coastal Aboriginal communities for thousands of years prior to European colonisation.
