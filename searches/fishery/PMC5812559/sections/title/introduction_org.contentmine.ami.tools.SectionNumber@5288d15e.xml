  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref001">1</a>] that create, modify and maintain habitat for a range of other species at a system-wide scale [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref003">3</a>]. When occurring in dense aggregations they form reef and bed structures comprised of both living assemblages and/or dead shell accumulations. These bivalve created ecosystems contain unique biological communities and vary in physical nature from consolidated structures with a high vertical profile (often termed reefs) to low profile structures with little differentiation in relief from their surrounds (aggregations or beds) and also include shell-rich muddy bottoms (accumulations) [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref005">5</a>]. For the purpose of this study, we define shellfish ecosystems as: intertidal or subtidal three-dimensional biogenic structures, formed primarily by high densities of oysters and/or mussels and their associated biological communities. We include shellfish ecosystems with high or low vertical profiles (i.e., reefs and beds) created on otherwise soft sediments or rocky areas. Shellfish ecosystems provide a range of ecosystem services such as food provision [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref013">13</a>], fish production [
  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref014">14</a>] and shoreline protection [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref016">16</a>]. Formally covering vast areas of coastal waters in both temperate and tropical regions, shellfish ecosystems have been decimated globally, with over 85% lost or severely degraded through a combination of actions including overfishing, destructive fishing practices (e.g., dredging), water pollution and disease [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The loss of shellfish ecosystems, in addition to the loss and degradation of other important marine ecosystems such as seagrass meadows [
  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref018">18</a>], kelp forests [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref022">22</a>], is a key driver in the long-term degradation of estuarine and coastal waterways, contributing to declines in water quality, fish production, blue carbon and coastal protection [
  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref023">23</a>]. These losses may negatively affect the economic and social wellbeing of coastal human populations reducing the productivity of wild harvest fisheries, increasing pollution risks to coastal communities and industries (e.g. aquaculture) and by increasing the cost of protecting coastal assets with non-natural (‘built’) infrastructure [
  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref024">24</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref026">26</a>]. The degradation of coastal ecosystems also contributes to the release of stored carbon, further exacerbating climate change and increasing coastal risks associated with more frequent and intense storms, sea level rise and ocean acidification [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite recent efforts to improve the protection of coastal ecosystems through international conventions and treaties (e.g. Convention on Biological Diversity and the Ramsar Convention), there is growing recognition that protection as a means to conserve coastal ecosystems and their ecosystem services is not enough and that active repair and restoration is required for many marine ecosystems [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref029">29</a>]. Efforts to restore shellfish ecosystems and their ecological function are most advanced in the United States, where hundreds of oyster reefs have been restored over the last 15–20 years [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref032">32</a>]. These efforts have led to the return of ecological functions and social and economic benefits such as job creation and fish production [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref034">34</a>]. Shellfish ecosystem restoration has been suggested as a mechanism for bringing back lost ecological functions in Australian estuaries and coastal waters [

  <a rid="pone.0190914.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0190914.ref036">36</a>]. However, ecological knowledge and examples of shellfish ecosystem restoration and the underpinning science relating to the ecology, structure and distribution of shellfish ecosystems are rare outside of the United States and particularly so in the Southern Hemisphere, where only a handful of studies have documented their distribution and decline [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we analyse the available evidence on Australian shellfish ecosystems and synthesize current knowledge, with the objectives of: 1) identify common ecosystem-forming species 2) quantify their past and present distributions, 3) review causes for shellfish ecosystem decline and 4) identify the current state of scientific knowledge including Indigenous use for Australian shellfish ecosystem-forming species. From this body of knowledge, we also highlight knowledge gaps and propose several recommendations which, if enacted, could help improve the future management of shellfish ecosystems. Our study can also serve as an example of a potential starting point for other regions where information on shellfish ecosystems may currently be scarce or unknown.</p>
