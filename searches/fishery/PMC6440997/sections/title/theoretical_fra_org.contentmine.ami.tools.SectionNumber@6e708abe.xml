  <span class="italic">ε</span> units of the other goods, where 0 ≤

  <span class="italic">μ</span> does not affect the value given to future goods, and therefore, it does not affect the policy and/or the management decisions; rather,

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">A10</a> (Methods and Supplementary Note 1). Specifically, the discount rate and the prices depend on the substitutability of the natural resource and the other goods, which is incorporated in the social welfare function. In Supplementary Note 2, we derive specific expressions for the discount rate and for the prices in two cases, one in which the natural resource and the other goods are non-substitutable (Eqs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B5</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B9</a>), and one in which they are partially substitutable (Eqs.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In turn, the novel part of this study comes from endogenizing the dynamics of 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) by modeling how they depend on the harvest methods used globally (see Methods). This allows us to examine how the discount factor and the prices depend on changes in harvest methods. We assume that, if the harvest methods do not change, then 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) increase exponentially at fixed rates, 
  <span class="italic">g</span>
  <sub>c</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">g</span>
  <sub>f</sub>, respectively, due to exogenous factors such as technological developments and exogenous environmental changes; however, changes in the patterns of harvest may affect 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>), thereby affecting the discount rate over time (see Methods). This approach builds on and generalizes previous studies that considered 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) that grows exponentially irrespective of the harvest

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. Specifically, note that 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) characterize the total provision of the goods at the global scale, and accordingly, we consider a large ecosystem that comprises a large number of distinct regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). This ecosystem may be, for example, the entire planet’s aquatic ecosystem, where each region is some local fishery providing fish; the forest area on a given continent, where each region is a single forest providing timber; or the area that can be used for agriculture worldwide, where each region is a local geographic area comprised of agricultural fields. We are interested in the long-lasting effects of harvesting on the provision of the natural resource, and therefore, we focus on irreversible degradations of the ecosystem, rather than on temporary fluctuations of the resource stock. These degradations may occur, for example, if some ecosystem services are permanently lost
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> or if the ecosystem that provides the renewable resource collapses or undergoes an irreversible regime shift in some of its regions, such as occurs in eutrophication and deforestation

  </span>. We assume that higher rates of non-sustainable harvest (higher 
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>n</sub>) result in a greater provision of the natural resource at the time of harvest but also result in a higher degradation of the ecosystem (Eq. 
  <a rid="Equ6" ref-type="" href="#Equ6">6</a>, see Methods). Specifically, we assume that a given portion of the global ecosystem, 
  <span class="italic">H</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>), is being harvested in year 
  <span class="italic">t</span>, while some portion of the ecosystem, 
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>n</sub>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>), becomes degraded during that year due to non-sustainable harvest, and cannot be used for harvest thereafter (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). For example, 
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>n</sub>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) may characterize the portion of the global fish or timber stock that is lost due to the collapse of fisheries or the irreversible degradation of forests worldwide in year

  <span class="sup">

  <span class="italic">H</span>

    <p>Schematic illustration of the model. Demonstrated is the state of the system at the global scale (e.g., the entire planet’s marine area, forest area, or agricultural area) in a given year. The dark-gray area characterizes the part of the system that is degraded due to former non-sustainable harvesting. The light gray area with the arrows characterizes the part of the system that is being harvested non-sustainably and will be degraded starting next year (total dark-gray area is given by 
     <span class="italic">H</span>
     <sub>n</sub>). The green area with the fishing vessels characterizes the part of the system that is being harvested sustainably and will remain non-degraded next year (total green area is given by 
     <span class="italic">H</span>

We assume that the spatial scale of the system is very large, and therefore, the recovery of the degraded areas due to migrating biota from other regions is negligible and the total degraded area increases over time. Each year,

We assume that managers may be subject to different externalities in distinct regions, e.g., some regions are managed by a single manager that dictates the harvest method, while some regions are shared (open-access), and all managers are free to harvest in them (rightmost region).

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine the effect of over-harvesting on the natural resource and on the discount rate, we compare scenarios in which over-harvesting occurs to scenarios in which it does not. We consider two approaches. First, we consider a competitive market approach in which we compare the optimal solution that maximizes social welfare with the solution that emerges in a model of a perfectly competitive market with externalities (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Specifically, the competitive market includes managed regions that have a single manager (e.g., landowner, government), and shared regions in which multiple managers are free to harvest (e.g., open-access) (see Methods). Second, we consider a more general approach in which we compare the dynamics that emerge when the harvest is entirely sustainable with the dynamics that emerge following various ad hoc choices of non-sustainable harvest functions (Theorem and Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>).

    <p>Over-harvesting extends the period during which the discount rate is high, but it is followed by sharp declines in the discount rate and the cumulative discount. Panels 
     <span class="bold">a</span> and 
     <span class="bold">b</span> demonstrate the optimal harvest of the natural resource from a social planner’s perspective, where the natural resource and the other goods are either non-substitutable (
     <span class="bold">a</span>, Eq. 
     <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B2</a>) or partially substitutable (
     <span class="bold">b</span>, Eq. 
     <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B10</a>). In the early stages, harvesting activity increases exponentially and the discount rate is high. Approximately at time

     <span class="bold">c</span> and 
     <span class="bold">d</span> demonstrate harvesting in a competitive market in which some of the regions are shared. The parameters and utility functions used in panels 
     <span class="bold">c</span> and

     <span class="bold">a</span> and

     <span class="bold">b</span> with panel

     <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B5</a> (non-substitutable goods) in panels 
     <span class="bold">a</span> and

     <sub>n</sub>(

     <span class="italic">x</span>
     <sub>2</sub>(
     <span class="italic">t</span>) for all 
     <span class="italic">t</span>. The parameter values used are within their realistic ranges (Methods). Parameter values and Source data are provided as a Source Data file
