 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the optimal solution in which the harvest functions maximize social welfare, two phases emerge along the time axis (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a, b</a>). In the first phase (
  <span class="italic">t</span> &lt; 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>0</sub>), 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) is initially small, and the harvest rates are limited due to the direct cost of harvesting (Methods, Eq. 
  <a rid="Equ10" ref-type="" href="#Equ10">9</a>). Over time, as 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) increases, the direct cost plays a less significant role, and the harvest rates increase. Consequently, 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) increases at a rate that is greater than 
  <span class="italic">g</span>
  <sub>f</sub>, and the discount rate approximately follows Ramsey’s formula. In the second phase (
  <span class="italic">t</span> &gt; 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>0</sub>), the entire ecosystem is under harvest (either sustainable or non-sustainable). Therefore, the society cannot increase 
  <span class="italic">f</span> via harvesting without increasing the non-sustainable harvest (i.e., increasing 
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>n</sub>), which would negatively affect the resource’s future provision. Consequently, the non-sustainable harvest decreases exponentially and 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) increase at approximately the rates of their technological developments, namely,

  </div>. This implies that, if 
  <span class="italic">g</span>
  <sub>f</sub> &lt; 
  <span class="italic">g</span>
  <sub>c</sub>, the discount rate in the second phase is lower than it was in the first phase (Eqs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B6</a>, 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B13</a>, Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Note that the optimal solution comprises non-sustainable harvest (
  <span class="italic">H</span>
  <sub>n</sub> &gt; 0) because an increase in 
  <span class="italic">f</span> at a given time has a greater effect on welfare than the same increase at a later time; the lower the discount rate, the lower the rate of non-sustainable harvest.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In turn, in the competitive market solution (see Methods), the rate of non-sustainable harvest is higher than the socially optimal rate, namely, the solution exhibits over-harvesting (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c, d</a>). Specifically, the harvest is still primarily sustainable in the managed regions but is non-sustainable in the shared regions. The total area under (non-sustainable) harvest in the shared regions increases over time, and consequently, 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) continues to increase over an extended period of time, which postpones the decline in the discount rate. Eventually, however, at time 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>1</sub> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), the shared regions become entirely degraded and the total rate of non-sustainable harvest declines. In turn, the period during which managers over-harvest (
  <span class="italic">t</span> &lt; 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>1</sub>) is followed by declines in the discount rate, the cumulative discount (Δ), total production (Eq. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">A11</a>), and the price of manufactured goods (Eq. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">A10</a>). These declines are greater if the magnitude and/or duration of the over-harvesting are greater (e.g., if more regions are shared), and also if the natural and the manufactured goods are non-substitutable. Note that the optimal solution exhibits no declines in economic growth or in Δ because the social planner plans for the forthcoming constraints on the harvest by avoiding over-harvesting in the early stages (
  <span class="italic">t</span> &lt; 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>0</sub>); in the market solution, managers also take into account the forthcoming decline in 
  <span class="italic">f</span> and avoid non-sustainable harvesting in the managed regions prior to time 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 
  <span class="italic">t</span>
  <sub>1</sub>, but they still over-harvest in the shared regions. Also note that, in both the optimal and the market solutions, the harvest functions, as well as 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>), do not depend on 
  <span class="italic">μ</span> (only the discount and the prices do).
