 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After over-harvesting for decades, many societies around the world are beginning to transition to sustainable environmental management practices and sustainable harvest methods
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Our study shows that the transition to sustainable harvest methods after a period of over-harvesting is expected to result in a decline in social welfare, economic growth, and the discount rate. In particular, we show that the discount rate, or the social rate of discount, does not decline gradually to its sustainable asymptotic rate; rather, the transition to sustainable harvest may include a period during which the discount rate is far below its asymptotic level (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>–
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and Theorem). Note that several studies suggested that policymakers need to consider discount rates that decline gradually over time due to various mechanisms, including uncertainty in technological growth

  </span>, slowdown in technological development due to environmental degradation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>, and declining production due to decline in the exploitation of natural resources
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. In contrast, we showed here that the transition to sustainable harvest imposes a sharper, non-gradual decline in the cumulative discount (Figs. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>–
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The mechanism underlying this sharper decline is that the rate of increase in the provision of natural resources not only slows down, but must at some point become lower than it would be if over-harvesting had never occurred. In turn, social welfare depends on the provision of natural resources, and therefore, a decline in their provision implies a lower discount rate.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results also suggest that the calculations of the discount factor in the long run should not rely on simple extrapolations of the discount rates in the short run. Specifically, over-harvesting might continue for a couple of decades, which may keep the provision of natural resources high in the short run, but will ultimately result in an even lower provision of these resources. Therefore, continued over-harvesting may justify considering higher discount rates in the short run, but it also necessitates discounting the long run less (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). Ignoring the harvest-induced decline in the discount rate not only falsifies cost-benefit analyses, it also creates a bias: Over-harvesting increases the discount rate in the short run, which might unjustifiably bias the expectations of policymakers to anticipate higher future discount rates, which, in turn, is used to justify further exploitation. (This may also explain why policymakers should consider lower discount rates in the long run although there is no clear evidence that the rate of return on capital will decline during the next 30–40 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>.)
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To correct for this bias and account for the future decline in the cumulative discount, we developed a new discount formula (Eqs. 
  <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="Equ3" ref-type="" href="#Equ3">3</a>), which provides a simple way to estimate the increase in the present value of future goods due to the transition to sustainable harvest methods. Specifically, policymakers need to consider a cumulative discount, Δ(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) (Eq. 
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>), that is lower in the long run due to its decline during the transition to sustainable harvest. Although further over-harvesting may postpone the timing of the decline, we prove in the theorem that the decline eventually comes with a rebound as Δ(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) decreases even further: The more our society over-harvests, the lower Δ(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) ultimately becomes. Therefore, the expected decline in the cumulative discount must be at least as large as its former increase due to over-harvesting (Eq. 
  <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">2</a>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In turn, this former increase is given by Eq. 
  <a rid="Equ3" ref-type="" href="#Equ3">3</a>. The correction to discounting suggested by our formula is significant (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), where adjustments of the order of magnitude implied by the formula suggest significant changes in climate policy, including significant emission cuts

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that the effect of harvest on discounting should be considered in addition to (not instead of) changes dictated by various other mechanisms and considerations. In particular, there is a controversy over the value of the rate of pure time preference, 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span>, that should be used in environmental policies; some authors argue that policymakers should determine 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span> based on individual’s preferences (
  <span class="italic">ρ</span> ≈ 3% year
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), but others argue that policymakers should use 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span> ≈ 0 based on considerations of intergenerational equity

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. The value of 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>
  <sub>τ</sub>, however, does not depend on the value of 
  <span class="italic">ρ</span> and should be subtracted from Δ regardless of that choice. Similarly, uncertainty about technological development may imply that policymakers need to consider 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>
  <sub>sus</sub> that declines over time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>, which implies another decline in the cumulative discount on top of the one suggested here. Also, note that the future values of natural resources do not depend on the proportion given to their consumption in the currency unit, 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>. Specifically, their future values do not depend on whether they are accounted for as market or as non-market goods. Nevertheless, 
  <span class="italic">μ</span> does affect the relative weights given to the discount factor and to the prices of natural resources in determining the resources’ future values

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. Specifically, ignoring the role of non-market natural resources in economic growth (considering a small 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>) would imply that a change in the provision of these resources has a larger effect on their prices but a smaller effect on the discount factor (Supplementary Note 1). Therefore, focusing on the inevitable increase in the price of natural resources following their over-harvesting would result in the same conclusions and present an alternative approach to the one presented here. In particular, the adjustment exp(
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>
  <sub>τ</sub>) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>) is due to the change in the discount factor, while the complementary change in the price (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) introduces another adjustment to the future value of natural resources
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. The total adjustment due to changes in both discount and prices does not depend on the choice of 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>, and would be ≥exp(
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>
  <sub>τ</sub>). The significant effect that the global transition to sustainable harvest has on the future value of natural resources suggests that climate policies should be determined jointly with other environmental policies.
