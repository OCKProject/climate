 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We begin with describing a well-established framework
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>,

  </span> that specifies how social welfare and the discount rate depend on the provision of the natural resource over time, 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>), and on the consumption of other goods over time, 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>). Next, we specify how harvest at the global scale affects the dynamics of 
  <span class="italic">f</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span>) (which would grow exponentially if the harvest functions are fixed). We complete the model by describing how the harvest strategies are determined by the various managers in a competitive market.
