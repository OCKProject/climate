 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CMSY stock assessment method used here was in agreement with other published assessments on these stocks that biomass levels are above those potentially supporting MSY level catches and fishing mortalities are below MSY levels [
  <a rid="pone.0207768.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207768.ref047">47</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0207768.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207768.ref048">48</a>]. These results of potentially higher landings for MSY must be qualified as they are based on a single stock and do not consider the important ecosystem implications of menhaden [
  <a rid="pone.0207768.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207768.ref047">47</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0207768.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207768.ref048">48</a>]. Thus, current fisheries pressures on these stocks should be considered more precautionary and in-line with ecosystem considerations in fisheries than any attempts to maximize landings and economic returns via fishing at MSY.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For Gulf menhaden, the responsible fisheries management agency (Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, GSMFC) increased the catch target reference point by over 70% to 829,737 t·year
  <span class="sup">-1</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0207768.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207768.ref072">72</a>], even after accounting for the important ecosystem role of menhaden under ecosystem-based fisheries management [
  <a rid="pone.0207768.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207768.ref048">48</a>]. However, only around 436,000 t are expected to be caught [
  <a rid="pone.0207768.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207768.ref073">73</a>]. There are four likely explanations for the continuing lower actual fishing levels: i) the demand for menhaden fishmeal is not high enough to encourage heavier fishing; ii) the increases in fishing costs past a certain level of catch makes it less profitable to continue fishing, iii) the price negatively responds to an increased supply, which makes it more profitable to stop fishing early, or iv) a conservative rate of exploitation given broader ecosystem concerns. We demonstrated that increased supply does cause the ex-vessel price to decrease, but it was highly inelastic (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207768.s006" href="#pone.0207768.s006">S1 Appendix</a>). If the total of the catch reference point proposed by the management agency were to be realized, Omega Protein’s theoretical unrealized maximized proportion could reach over 400,000 t·year
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, and Daybrook Fisheries’ over 330,000 t·year
  <span class="sup">-1</span>. These increased catches are above our estimates generated by the CMSY method (
  <a rid="pone.0207768.t007" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0207768.t007">Table 7</a>), and the difference in catches is attributed to a lower estimate of MSY from our model that could be driven by differences in input parameters.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While our results suggest that landings could be increased to achieve higher yields (i.e., to theoretical MSY levels), this may negatively affect profitability because of increased fishing costs. In addition, the importance of precautionary ecosystem-based management should limit future catches of menhaden in both ecosystems to ensure enough biomass remains for higher level predators. This is especially important if the current baseline data being used is not truly reflective of long-term historical baselines, which have largely been forgotten [
  <a rid="pone.0207768.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207768.ref074">74</a>]. In addition, there are other important fisheries in the ecosystem, and there is evidence that previous fishing of menhaden has negatively impacted other species and their fisheries, including the striped bass recreational fishery [
