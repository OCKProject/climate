 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We present a method for relating a companyâ€™s fisheries quotas and landings from the stocks they exploit to potential unrealized revenues and profits due to sub-optimal stock biomass and landings. We believe this approach can be used both at an aggregate level and at a micro level to analyze the state of fisheries stocks and the effects on balance sheets of fishing companies. This method imposes traceability on companies by piecing together these disparate parts, rather than wait for voluntary measures to be adopted. This is an important step to be taken to advance transparency in seafood supply chains.</p>
