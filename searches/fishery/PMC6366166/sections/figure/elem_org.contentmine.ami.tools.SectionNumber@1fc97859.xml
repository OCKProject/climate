  <p>Outputs of the species distribution models for adults (
   <span class="italic">a</span>) and juveniles (
   <span class="italic">b</span>) of Scopoli's shearwaters during the first three months of wintering migration. Black points show tracked filtered-locations registered by Argos PTT devices. Horizontal colour jumps show the temporal ranges of environmental variables used in this study. The white dot shows colony location (Chafarinas Islands). Bar charts show the relative contribution of explanatory variables considered in the Maxent model. Average and s.d. over replicate runs for the importance of each habitat variable as estimated by the Jackknife test. For each variable, white bar indicates the explanatory power of the model when the single environmental variable is omitted, and lower grey bar indicates the explanatory power (in terms of regularized training gain) of the model when the environmental variable is used in isolation. Variables: BAT—bathymetry, CHL—chlorophyll a, U—zonal wind component, V—meridional wind component.
