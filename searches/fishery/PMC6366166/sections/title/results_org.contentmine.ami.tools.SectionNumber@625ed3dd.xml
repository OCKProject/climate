 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We successfully recovered 2691 at-sea locations (2108 for adults and 583 for juveniles), distributed between 7 October 2014 and 22 January 2015. Adults were tracked for 52–103 days, whereas the tracking period for juvenile birds was much shorter (0–57 days, 
  <a rid="RSOS181151TB1" ref-type="table" href="#RSOS181151TB1">table 1</a>). Only two of the ten tracked juveniles transmitted more than one week and reached the Atlantic Ocean. The PTT of a juvenile lost during the first day of emission near the colony where most individuals disappeared, was detected after one week of silence near an Algerian harbour, 150 km away (see electronic supplementary material, figure S1). Based on the Coll

  <a rid="RSOS181151C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C11">11</a>] index, high cumulative threats to seabird species were concentrated in their foraging areas within a 50 km radius of the colony, where seven juveniles stopped transmitting (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181151F1" href="#RSOS181151F1">figure 1</a>). PTT-equipped juveniles that failed to emit in the vicinity of the colony showed higher values of the cumulative threat index (mean ± s.d., 0.67 ± 0.2) than survivors (0.42 ± 0.35) and adults (0.43 ± 0.12). Significant differences (

  <span class="sup">2</span> = 11.43, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.003, d.f. = 2) were found among the three categories of age (adults, juveniles that stopped transmitting and juvenile survivors). Nevertheless, differences between groups were only significant for adults and dead juveniles.

The only two surviving juveniles left the Mediterranean Sea, crossing into the Atlantic, between 21 and 23 October. Total distance travelled per day was slightly higher in juveniles than in adults in the Atlantic (164.3 ± 18.6 km in juveniles and 142.0 ± 22.9 km in adults), but markedly lower in the Mediterranean (31.4 ± 17.3 km in juveniles versus 88.2 ± 38.9 km in adults). The migration routes of the five adults and of one juvenile were similar, flying parallel to the African coast. In contrast, the second juvenile travelled almost constantly west of the continental shelf (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Habitat models showed good ability to predict shearwater distributions during migration (AUC = 0.8 for both juveniles and adults). Bathymetry was the variable with the highest contribution to distribution of shearwaters during migration. Probability of occurrence of juveniles and adults increased in shallow waters. Chlorophyll-a showed a higher explanatory power for adults (37.0%) than juveniles (12.9%). In relation to wind effect, juveniles were more affected by the meridional (north–south direction) component of winds than adults (
