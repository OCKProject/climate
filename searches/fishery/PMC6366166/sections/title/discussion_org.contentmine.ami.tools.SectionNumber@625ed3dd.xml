 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study is one of the few describing foraging and migration movements of a marine predator during the first weeks of its life at sea [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C24">24</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181151C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C25">25</a>]. One of the main results is the unexpected loss of communication with 80% of shearwater juveniles within a few days after leaving the nest. Although based on a small sample size (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 10), juvenile tracking failure exceeded those of previous investigations on this species at other Mediterranean colonies. Péron &amp; Grémillet [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C26">26</a>] reported that 40% of the juveniles and 34% of the adults tagged (total individuals tagged, 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 12 juveniles and 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3 adults) on the Italian Mediterranean coast stopped communicating before crossing into the Atlantic Ocean. Further, Raine 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C27">27</a>] reported that 66.6% of tracked juveniles (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3) vanished in the Mediterranean Sea. Since the deployment period and attachment methodology were the same for adults and juveniles and only juveniles were affected, we consider that high PTT communication failure showed in the present study was associated to events affecting mainly juvenile shearwaters.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although different stressors could explain these observations, such as strong storms [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C28">28</a>] or light-induced mortality [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C29">29</a>], we argue that mortality associated to fishing activity was one of the potential causes of observed juvenile disappearance [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C30">30</a>]. Indeed, no storm was recorded in the area within which juveniles vanished (based on the wind data downloaded from NOAA database, see Material and methods). Also, artificial lights associated to a nearby tourist resort may have attracted satellite-tracked juveniles towards land, with likely casualties [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C29">29</a>]; however, this resort was still under construction during the study period, with very limited night-time activities, and we did not record any position on land within this area [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C31">31</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, juvenile tracking failures occurred all at once while birds were displaying intensive foraging behaviour in an area of high cumulative threats for seabirds, mainly from fisheries [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C11">11</a>]. Although there is no conclusive evidence, we therefore suggest that juveniles probably could die accidentally in long-line fishing gears, one of the main reported causes of shearwater mortality in the Mediterranean Sea [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C32">32</a>]. It is noteworthy that this hazardous area north of the colony has been reported as an illegal swordfish fishing area [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C33">33</a>], where the Moroccan and Algerian fleets operate year-round. Furthermore, Morocco has the lowest level of compliance with international fisheries regulation within countries bordering the North Atlantic [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C34">34</a>]. Also, one PTT-equipped juvenile that stopped transmission in this area, sent the last two positions close to the Algerian harbour of Bouzedjar, after 6 days without reporting tracking locations (see electronic supplementary material, figure S1). This harbour holds small-scale artisanal fisheries, a type of fishing activity also linked with high seabird bycatch probabilities [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C30">30</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181151C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C35">35</a>], thus we suspect that bird was caught during fishing activities and transmitter released from bird and saved until arrival at the harbour. All of these circumstantial elements point to fisheries exploitation as one of the main potential causes of juvenile loss. When fledging from their natal colony, juvenile seabirds have reduced foraging skills, and face a long period of learning. These first few months are critical in terms of survival [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C7">7</a>]. We therefore speculate that, because of their relative handicap, juvenile shearwaters fledging from our study colony initially gathered within a nearby high-productivity area, which should ensure their efficient foraging, but was unfortunately also a potential ‘death zone’ in terms of fisheries bycatch.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along with threats caused by illegal fishery practices, juvenile behaviour could contribute to high mortality. During their first two weeks in the Mediterranean Sea, juveniles registered more intensive searching behaviour than adults. The breeding colony of Chafarinas Islands is in the vicinity of fishing harbours and intense (mostly illegal) fishing activities [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C33">33</a>]. Those generate visual and olfactory cues, which may attract juvenile shearwaters towards fishing vessels, and to an early death. Travelling behaviour gained in importance once juveniles reached the Atlantic, where space use by Scopoli's shearwaters from Chafarinas Islands off West Africa was similar to that of individuals from other Mediterranean colonies [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C36">36</a>]. Juvenile tracks were more affected by winds than adults, moving them away from productive shelf waters selected by adults [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C26">26</a>]. Such exploitation of different regions could also lead to age-biased exposure to bycatch [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C37">37</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, our study suggests that mortality affected juveniles more severely than adults. Illegal fisheries and inefficiency in juvenile foraging skills might be the main causes of juvenile death, but the exact magnitude of each forcing factor remains unknown. From a precautionary point of view, and as highlighted by other studies [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C38">38</a>], it seems extremely urgent to detect and control illegal seabird incidental bycatch and intentional harvest, as those illegal practices weigh heavily on the persistence of vulnerable seabird populations at the scale of northwest Africa and of the western Mediterranean.
