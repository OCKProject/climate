Default parameters were used. Only linear relationships between estimated probabilities of presence and environmental variables were fitted. Model performance was assessed by randomly dividing species occurrence data into training (70%) and test (30%) datasets, by using the option ‘random test percentage’ in Maxent. A given model was calibrated on the training data and evaluated on the test data using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) as a threshold-independent assessment measure. To reduce uncertainty caused by sampling artefacts (generated during the random resampling of presence occurrence localities), we conducted 15 replicate models for each of the four environmental variables (bathymetry, chlorophyll-a, and zonal and meridional components of sea surface winds). We evaluated their contribution to the Maxent model with a jackknife procedure.
