 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was conducted at the Chafarinas Islands in the southwestern Mediterranean Sea (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181151F1" href="#RSOS181151F1">figure 1</a>). This small archipelago holds 800 breeding pairs of Scopoli's shearwaters in a highly productive zone supporting a high volume of fisheries [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C12">12</a>], mostly artisanal or illegal and not tracked through the Automatic Identification System (AIS) or Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) for monitoring fishing vessels activities. The Scopoli's shearwater is a long-lived seabird with delayed maturity [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C13">13</a>]. Immatures only return to the colony when 5 or 6 years old, and the maximum probability of first breeding is reached at the age of seven [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C14">14</a>]. Previous studies at Chafarinas Islands showed a diet composed mainly of small pelagic fish and demersal resources present in the bycatch discarded by fisheries into the sea [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tracking devices were solar-powered satellite transmitters (PTTs, platform terminal transmitters, Argos PTT-100, Microwave Telemetry Inc., Columbia, USA). These tags allow seabird positioning through the Argos satellite system. They are an ideal way to follow long-distance migration movements in nearly real time. Since animals are tracked over large spatial scales, devices are difficult to recover [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C16">16</a>]. PTTs were deployed during October 2014 (late chick rearing period) on 10 juveniles born during June 2014 and on five breeding adults. Adults and juveniles were captured during the night in their nests. PTTs weighed 18 g (less than 3% of bird body mass of adults = 706 ± 75 g and of juveniles = 785 ± 114 g). PTTs were attached to back feathers using Tesa® tape and Nural92® glue and programmed with a duty cycle of 10 h ON/24 h OFF. PTT data were processed to remove erroneous Argos locations, by using a speed, distance and angle filter procedure with the Argosfilter R package [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C17">17</a>], using a maximum threshold speed at 80 km h
  <span class="sup">−1</span> [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C18">18</a>]. For each individual, we calculated total distance covered in the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic waters. Distance travelled by day was calculated as total distance (the sum of the distances between each transmission) divided by the range of days between first and last location.
