 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seabirds are impacted by breeding habitat destruction, invasive terrestrial species feeding on adults and juveniles, and by interactions with fisheries [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C1" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C1">1</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181151C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C2">2</a>]. Fisheries affect seabird populations indirectly through competition for marine prey [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C3" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C3">3</a>], and directly through incidental mortality on fishing gear [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C4">4</a>]. Many of these incidental captures remain undetected, especially in illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C5">5</a>] operating in remote areas visited by seabirds during their feeding and migratory journeys. Notwithstanding this paucity of data, several studies have converged in highlighting seabird bycatch as an important factor in many population declines [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C6">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incidental mortality is especially relevant for long-lived pelagic seabirds, such as Procellariforms [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C2">2</a>]. Mortality associated with fishing affects all age classes; however, juveniles are considered more vulnerable. Juvenile mortality has been associated with inferior foraging skills compared to adults, and with lower levels of individual experience in navigation strategies [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C7">7</a>,
  <a rid="RSOS181151C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C8">8</a>]. Differences in foraging grounds could thereby increase juvenile susceptibility to fishing gear [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C9">9</a>]. Consequently, the first months of independence are particularly challenging for their survival [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C10">10</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite major recent advances, studying at-sea movements of juvenile pelagic seabirds remains particularly challenging due to logistical constraints because they are distributed remotely in the open ocean during several years [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C7">7</a>]. Specifically, no study has compared at-sea movements and fates of adult and juvenile seabirds while assessing the magnitude of fishing operations within their home ranges. Here we examine the spatial movements of ‘naive’ juvenile Scopoli's shearwater (
  <span class="italic">Calonectris diomedea</span>) during their first months at sea using miniaturized satellite-tracking devices. We also fitted tags onto adult birds from the same breeding locality. We then modelled the at-sea habitat selection of adults and juveniles in relation to environmental data, as well as information concerning fishing activities. We addressed two main questions: (i) Do individuals of different age classes show similar migration routes and habitat preferences? and (ii) Are there differences in apparent survival between shearwater age classes?
