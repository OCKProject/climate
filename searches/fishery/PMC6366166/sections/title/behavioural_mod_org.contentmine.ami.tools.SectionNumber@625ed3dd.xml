 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behavioural modes in adult and juvenile individuals were classified with an expectation maximization binary clustering (EMbC) algorithm [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C19">19</a>] performed using the EMbC R package [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C20">20</a>]. EMbC identifies behavioural modes in movement trajectories based on the velocity and turning angle of a bird between each location in an unsupervised manner. Based on local measures of velocity and turning angle of a bird between each location, locations were classified in four behaviours: (i) resting (low velocity/low turning angle), (ii) intensive search (low velocity/high turning), (iii) extensive search (high velocity/high turning angle) and (iv) travelling (high velocity/low turning angle).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behavioural modes were compared for each age class among the first days of independence (locations in the Mediterranean Sea) and for the rest of migration time (Atlantic Ocean), by a two-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction for small samples.</p>
