 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The oceanic habitat used by juveniles and adults during their at-sea movements was modelled with habitat suitability models through a maximum entropy approach [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C22">22</a>] using chlorophyll-a, oceanic winds and bathymetry to describe the oceanographic habitat. Chlorophyll-a concentration (mg m
  <span class="sup">−3</span>), was used as a proxy for primary productivity. Oceanic winds are one of the most important factors affecting migratory behaviour of seabirds, particularly in birds performing dynamic soaring such as shearwaters [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C23" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C23">23</a>], and bathymetry was used as a proxy of coastal versus pelagic domains. In order to model environmental data consistent with the seabird tracking time period (four months), we divided the latitudinal range of shearwater migratory habitat into different tiles (two time periods for chlorophyll-a data and three time periods for winds data). Chlorophyll-a and wind data were sourced for each tile covering the time range of tracking data within the tile. Tiles were merged into a single raster as input for the species distribution model. To facilitate comparisons across months, we normalized the images to the scale of 0–1, based on the lowest and highest values of any pixel in any of the tiles [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C2">2</a>]. Chlorophyll-a (mg m
  <span class="sup">−3</span>) data were obtained from aqua MODIS sensor (
  <span xlink:href="https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/</span>), at a spatial resolution of 0.08333° (approx. 9 km). We downloaded autumn 2014 seasonal composite data for the first temporal tile (which covers tracking data from the first departure, 8 October 2014 until 15 November 2014) and the 2014 wintering seasonal composite for the second temporal tile (time range from 15 November 2014 until 22 January 2015). Bathymetry was downloaded from the Gridded Global Relief Data ETOPO2v2 database (

  <span xlink:href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/marineocean-data/blended-global/blended-sea-winds" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/marineocean-data/blended-global/blended-sea-winds</span>), which contain globally gridded, high resolution ocean surface vector winds and wind stresses on a global 0.25° grid. Wind data were disaggregated into their zonal (east–west) and meridional (north–south) components. Data were downloaded daily for the October 2014–January 2015 period, and merged in three temporal tiles according to tracking data (from 8 October 2014 until 24 October 2014, second tile from this date until 2 November 2014 and third tile until the last transmission recovered on 22 January 2015). All data were resampled to 0.25°, the coarser resolution supplied by wind data.
