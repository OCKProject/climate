 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify the hazard level of oceanic areas used by Scopoli's shearwaters in the Mediterranean Sea, we used the spatially explicit information of cumulative threats with potential impact on seabirds published by Coll

  <a rid="RSOS181151C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C11">11</a>]. In particular, this index is a weighted sum of each of the following anthropogenic threats affecting seabirds: coastal-based impacts (0.08), marine pollution (0.31), exploitation of resources (0.38), maritime activities (0.08) and climate change (0.15). Vulnerability weights (annotated in parenthesis) applied to seabirds species were estimated using published data on specific taxa and expert opinions (see [
  <a rid="RSOS181151C11" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS181151C11">11</a>] for details). The index value was then extracted for each foraging location of the individuals in the Mediterranean Sea. Kruskalâ€“Wallis tests were conducted to examine differences in index values at each location associated with differences in age and survival (adults, juveniles that stopped transmitting data, and juveniles that transmitted as far as the Atlantic Ocean). Analyses were performed in R v. 3.4.1 [
