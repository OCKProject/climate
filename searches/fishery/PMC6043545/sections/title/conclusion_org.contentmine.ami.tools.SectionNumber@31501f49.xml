 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tuna represent an iconic aquatic species that are important to many nations worldwide, not only for employment or economic returns from fishing, but are socially and culturally integral to local coastal communities as well as for the ecosystem. Our analysis has demonstrated how correlated social, economic and environmental variables can be combined in a simple model that can help to assess vulnerability to overexloitation and thus allow time for preventable management action.</p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fisheries management has progressed over the course of the 20th century, but given the large proportion of stocks that are depleted or over-exploited

  <sub>MSY</sub>). Future work could aim to address these influences in more depth by integrating environmental variables into dynamic population models.
