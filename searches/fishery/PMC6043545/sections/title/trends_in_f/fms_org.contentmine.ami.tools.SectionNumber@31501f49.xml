  <sub>MSY</sub> and HDI
 </div>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results show that low-HDI countries such as those in the Indian and Pacific oceans are vulnerable to overfishing e.g. western Pacific bigeye tuna and Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Countries within these regions are some of the poorest in the world and rely on tuna for their diet and poverty reduction. Over time these regions have realised the potential of their resource i.e. an increase in human development has coincided with an increase in the ratio of F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> for tuna. In high HDI countries (e.g. in the Atlantic) the opposite observation can be seen, whereby in early years the stocks were subject to overfishing (e.g. North and South Atlantic albacore (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>)). These finding are consistent with recent work showing that stocks with management in place were less likely to be over exploited

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. In these countries over time F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> has declined in line with increases in HDI and possibly with socio-economic responsibilities towards overfishing. In high HDI countries, fishers have other livelihood opportunities and/or subsidies
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Controlling and managing fisheries in low HDI regions will therefore be crucial especially with rising fuel costs, fluctuating stock levels, changeable market conditions and poor international regulations which are a driver for illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing
