  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> represents a different predictor effect on F
  <sub>MSY</sub> for a particular tuna stock, a 25% increase or decrease, and the magnitude (size of the sphere) can be interpreted as the % change in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub>. For example, when observing South Pacific albacore, a 25% increase in frozen price results in a 12% change in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub>. Sensitivity to frozen price dominates, and appears to prominently affect the western central Pacific skipjack fleets with over a 13% change in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub>. A 25% increase in HDI showed a notable change in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> especially for the poorer regions of the world, up to 8%. This coincides with the findings in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and the “Trends in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> and HDI” section (see above). As an approximate indication of the resulting changes of F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> on potential changes in % yields, our findings (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>) depict that a 10% increase/decrease in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> results in between a 3.7 and 8.8% increase/decrease in yield across all stocks. However, much larger reductions in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> could lead to greater reductions in yield in the long term.

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fuel price was also dominant predictor of F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> across all stocks, with a 25% change in fuel price resulting in a 1.6% max change in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub>, providing a positive link between the money spent and invested by a fleet, and the quantity of fish landed. Although this is a small increase and probably the offset effect of favourable frozen tuna prices and increases in technical efficiency, this can, however, have positive or negative effects on the stocks, i.e. such an increase in fuel price could have a large effect on the stock by reducing fishing mortality but quite the opposite effect from a drop in fuel price if not properly regulated. Either way, this substantial effect could be detrimental to the industry and the resource, or both. Many small-scale operators (e.g. the pole and line fleets) perhaps would have less opportunities for social change i.e. potentially a decline in fleet size or diversity (in terms of fishing areas and/or species) that could in turn have lasting effects in terms of food security for some coastal communities
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. Longlining for tuna is on average up-to four times more fuel intensive per ton of catch than purse seining
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span> but the difference is very much smaller than that in specific fuel consumption per ton of catch, because of increases in fish prices for the better quality product. With much of the industry worldwide supported by government’s subsidies for fuel (in the western central Pacific alone worth in excess of US$335 million) (see 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>), a price drop in fuel costs could lead to harmful and wasteful fishing practices. Therefore controlling fishing effort levels in the future via competitive fuel pricing and/or controlled market incentives such as encouraging the use of fuel-efficient technologies will be of great importance to global tuna fleets. In contrast, the species price effect resulted in a negative coefficient (both fresh (4%) and frozen (13%)), which is counter-intuitive to the expected behavior of fishers. Production sensitivities are usually positive; a higher price (
  <span class="italic">Ceterus paribus</span>) will lead to increased production. Although an elastic price effect of demand may occur whereby a moderate increase in catch will result in a substantial decrease in price
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. However, in the case of purse seine fishers, it may be that the fishers target a higher abundance of fish even if the price is lower, therefore with overall higher total benefit. Fresh and frozen prices were included in this model to capture the dynamics of the sashimi and cannery markets, but maybe at the time of fisher decision-making the difference in price between fresh and frozen may not be relevant and therefore a composite measure of price would have been more appropriate proxy. Further, the quantity of frozen tuna can potentially be controlled in deep freeze and the quantity adjusted to market demand. It is also important to note that the fishing mortality on most tunas has increased
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, which could also explain the negative effect.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climatic effect, El Niño (SOI) had a large effect on F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub>, a 25% increase in the index resulted in a 5–6% increase in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> for skipjack in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean which approximately equates to 53000t (8.3% yield change) and ~145000t (8.5% yield change) increase respectively. Previous studies have shown that tuna catches increase during the warmer periods of El Niño in the western Pacific
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span> and Indian Ocean
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. Greater tuna biomass in these years is thought to supported by warmer water masses, which are their preferred habitats, perhaps also contributing their higher catch rates. For example
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>, showed that the western central Pacific purse seine fleet based their short-term decision-making by tracking sea surface temperature
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. The Indian Ocean dipole index (DMI) also showed positive effects; with a positive index there was a significant increase in exploitation status for skipjack (4%) and yellowfin (1.5%), it is thought that some positive events coincide with El Niño events
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. The NAO index, however, appears to show that it affects the exploitation of eastern and western Atlantic bluefin tuna, Northern Atlantic Albacore and western Atlantic skipjack (a 2–3% change in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> from a 25% increase in NAO index). A positive anomaly in the NAO leads to a higher exploitation ratio. A positive NAO is the result of an Azores high and an Icelandic low, which results in an increased pressure gradient that causes westerlies to intensify and cold air to drain off the North American continent. Bluefin prefer cooler sea surface temperatures and frontal zones that give rise to food availability and survival for larvae

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the Shannon Wiener index variables to investigate the diversity of the tuna fleet’s operations and as a proxy for communication and fishing efficiency, and this showed significant effects on F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub>. A positive coefficient reflects an increase in the spatial extent of operations and would be expected to result in an increase in mortality on the stock. Several authors have documented the dramatic changes in technology associated with the global tuna fishing fleets
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>, and how the use of new technologies by fishers (i.e. communication with other fishers) promotes information sharing leading to the most productive fishing grounds
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span> especially as stocks decline in size. Sophisticated FADs used during purse seine fishing determine the position and biomass of tunas below. Therefore the fishing operations may appear more spread out hence the positive coefficient. A 25% change in Shannon Weiner diversity indices resulted in a 2% increase in F/F
  <sub>MSY</sub> for the western central Pacific fleet fishing on skipjack tuna.
