Of course, it is impossible to account for all sources of uncertainty, but each process needs to be understood better e.g. how stocks and ecosystems fluctuate along with variable fish prices that affect fishers’ income in the short and long term in response to management and natural variation

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the vulnerability of tuna stocks to short-term drivers of change we examined the effects of key economic, social and environmental variables using ridge regression to account for multi-collinearity of these variables. Correlations of note were found among variables, which were both positive and negative based on Pearson’s correlation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). The majority of the tuna species prices were positively correlated (blue line) with some groups clustered together (bluefin and yellowfin tuna), while yellowfin, skipjack and albacore, for the most part were in individual clusters. On the other hand fuel price was not significantly correlated with any of the prices besides a significant negative correlation between fuel price and fresh skipjack price (SKJ_fresh), fresh bluefin (BFT_fresh).

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of correlation between fuel price and fish prices is perhaps due to de-trending of the inflation bias effect before conducting the analysis, as
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span> shows that both fuel and fish prices indices depict upward trends. The negative relationships between the fresh fish prices and fuel price is interesting because falling fresh fish prices (generally from near inshore coastal domestic fleets) could be related to the balance of demand, production and competition (see
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>). In terms of environmental indices, the El Niño Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) was negatively correlated with East North Pacific index (EP_NP) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO), and clustered with a positive correlation with the Tropical South Atlantic index (TSA). In contrast NAO was negatively correlated with both TSA and Tropical North Atlantic index (TNA).

  </div> to simultaneously explain the greatest fraction of deviance and reduce the effects of collinearity (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d,e</a>). Caution is required if future conditions have not been seen in the historic observations (which is the case here) as this will limit the predictive skill of any model. As an example consider fuel prices, which have continued to increase at the same time as current management is aiming to recover stocks to levels that will support MSY (a level which has not been seen in the past). Therefore future costs and catch rates will be different than those used to fit the regression hence why de-trending the economic variables was of the utmost importance. Results from the 10-fold cross-validation produced a minimum
