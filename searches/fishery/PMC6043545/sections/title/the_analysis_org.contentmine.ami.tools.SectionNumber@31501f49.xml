 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ridge regression conducted for this study included 6 core continuous feature variables (i.e. fuel cost (“realfuel”), climate (“SOI” and “NAO”), spatial effects (“SW”), fresh and frozen price of the core tuna species (“realfresp” and “realfrozp”)). Categorical variables (i.e. stock, species, and gear (stock/region specific – i.e. No ‘TRAP’ gears for any other region apart from East Atlantic bluefin)) are encoded as dummy variables 1 or 0. There were 1107 rows and 35 columns in the dataset including the response variable. These data were split into a separate datasets of regressor and response matrices and each randomly further split into training (2/3) and test sets (1/3). A ridge regression model was fit to the training set in order to determine a value of the tuning parameter
