 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global tuna catch and effort databases from tuna RFMOs (which contains aggregated commercial logbook data of catch and effort by fishing gear) were used to develop a time-series of commercial purse seine, baitboat, longline, gillnet, troll and trap (area/stock specific – see Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>) effort estimates for fleets operating between 1990 and 2014. The data collected for each country included an effort variable and in most cases for purse seine/baitboat/trap/gillnet was represented by the approximated fishing duration as number of trips/days/hours fished (or at sea) per one-degree cell. For longlines/trol this was a mixture of number of sets, hours and hooks per five-degree cell (longlines), year. The longline and purse seine fishing activity was converted to number of days at a scale of 1° (purse seine) or 5° (longline) cell by applying different conversions factors to the different effort types in order to produce a common variable, days fished (although days fished for purse seine and number hooks for longline could have been used, however, these data were available and formatted as part of on-going research in tandem and thus was considered practical) (see Table

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial expansion of fisheries are known to occur as fisheries develop, as well as contracting at low population densities thus could provide a useful proxy for exploitation status. Shannon Wiener indices of fleet spatial behaviour by gear were used to estimate the spatial spread of fishing effort as has been previously used for tuna fleets
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. This index is derived from information theory (knowledge transfer and represents the social variable) and measures the amount of order/disorder within a system; it is widely used in ecological research to study species diversity

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. An index of zero indicates that only one area (1° or 5° cell) was visited within a specific fishing year. Unlike the study mentioned above, these data sets did not contain any information on vessel characteristics, trip ID or fleet composition in terms of numbers of vessels. Therefore the effort data were aggregated by year (

  <span class="italic">g</span>) (longline or purse seine), organisation (
  <span class="italic">o</span>) (tRFMO) and stock (

  </div>Economic theory suggests that fishers make their strategic choices based on changing stock biomass levels, management regulations (effort controls), market prices, and fuel costs. Ideally individual vessel cost data would be necessary to conduct a full bio-economic model; however much of these data are not available. As a result, several variables were used as surrogates, e.g. value as a proxy for economic viability and fuel price as a proxy for cost. US gulf prices (US$) per barrel were obtained from the US energy information administration (

Fisher skills, knowledge, and experience are expected to relate to the annual revenues of the target species of the fleet. Fresh and frozen prices were included to account for changes in the markets and hence targeting, i.e. when there is a shortage of fresh/frozen tuna the price increases. Price per metric kg data (Yen ¥) of the main target species, skipjack, yellowfin, albacore, bluefin and bigeye tuna fresh and frozen was acquired from Tsujiki market ex vessel prices from
