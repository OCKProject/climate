 <div class="title">Map of the study area from Port Stephens to Seal Rocks on the east coast of Australia.</div>
 <p>The area that has been mapped using a swath acoustic sounder is indicated by the rainbow shaded area, while the 50m and 100m contours are represented by a differing shade of grey (source: GeoScience Australia). The brown shapes represent hand digitised reef with profile. Shallow stereo-BRUV deployments are delineated by the green circles and mesophotic stereo-BRUVs deployments are delineated by the blue circlers. Circles with a cross are stereo-BRUV deployments within a no-take area. Inset: Study location on the east coast of Australia.</p>
