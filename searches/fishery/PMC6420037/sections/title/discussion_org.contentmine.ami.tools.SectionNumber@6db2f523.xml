 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fish assemblages on rocky reefs at lower-mesophotic depths (80–110 m) were found to be distinct from those associated with adjacent shallow rocky reefs (20–40 m). Despite the large differences in species richness and relative abundance of all fishes, 30 species (i.e. 31% all species recorded during this study) occurred across the depth categories that were sampled. This is one of the first studies to compare rocky reef fish assemblages across the 80–90 m range in depths at these latitudes, and there are few comparable temperate studies. The vast majority of mesophotic reef research has occurred in tropical systems in Australia, the USA and Caribbean [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref018">18</a>]. There are even fewer studies (~1%) using BRUVs, particularly stereo-BRUVs, to sample fish and habitats at mesophotic depths [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref018">18</a>]. The species richness that we recorded from stereo-BRUVs on these temperate mesophotic reefs is approximately half of what has been recorded using stereo-BRUVs in tropical systems [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref051">51</a>]. However, the species richness to depth gradient relationship is consistent across both tropical and temperate systems as noted in previous studies [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref069">69</a>], as well as the current study.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The transition zone between the shallow and mesophotic species assemblages is unclear in this study as we did not sample between depths of 40–80 m. The mesophotic reef that was sampled during this study is disconnected from rocky reefs found in shallow waters as it is separated by large expanses of soft sediment habitats [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref061">61</a>]. The current referenced global definition for the transition to mesophotic ecosystems is 40 m [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref070">70</a>], but this will be regionally specific and dependent on factors such as light, temperature and habitat [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref018">18</a>]. The connectivity across the depth gradient is also a significant unknown. An understanding of depth connectivity is needed to determine if mesophotic reefs can provide refuge from short-term pressures such as storms or heatwaves or long-term pressures such as fishing. There is evidence that mesophotic reefs can provide ‘refuge’ habitat for fishery-targeted species [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref039">39</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref040">40</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref071">71</a>]. Some caution is needed when making generalisations of connectivity across depths ranges, however, as there is evidence of differing life histories and intraspecific variability in demographic traits of fishes using reefs at mesophotic depths [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref072">72</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study found strong depth related patterns that could be coupled with depth related reef and habitat complexity [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref006">6</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref026">26</a>]. In all but two models (Species richness and Labridae), the factor habitat was selected, highlighting the importance of habitat in describing the distribution of fishes. The correlation between increasing depth and decreasing light equates to a change in habitat structure, with the shallower reefs dominated by macroalgae [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref073">73</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref074">74</a>], and at depths &gt;30m sessile invertebrates, such as sponges and octocorals. As the shallow reefs surveyed in this study were in 20–40 m depth range, a transition between algae and sessile invertebrate dominated habitats was observed. Therefore, herbivorous and omnivorous fishes are more likely to inhabit shallow reefs where algae is present, thus increasing species richness and abundance. In comparison, at mesophotic depths it is expected that carnivorous, planktivorous, and scavenger fish and species with greater tolerances to ocean currents and thermoclines would occur. These finding are consistent with many tropical mesophotic coral ecosystem studies particularly in the Caribbean and the Indo-Pacific region [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref041">41</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref052">52</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apart from light availability and habitat, ocean currents and temperature gradients or thermoclines further separate mesophotic reefs from adjacent shallow reefs [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref004">4</a>]. In temperate Eastern Australia, the EAC has the greatest influence on the oceanography and connectivity of deeper reefs [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref075">75</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref076">76</a>]. This is particularly relevant as the strength and the seasonality of the EAC has recently changed with warmer water pushing further south and for longer periods of time [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref077">77</a>]. As the EAC is at its strongest (fastest flowing and warmer temperatures) across these mesophotic reefs, the EAC has the potential to influence range extension or a change in the distribution of fishes. However, the majority of knowledge on the changing EAC is based on surface waters and there is a knowledge gap of how currents and water temperatures are changing at depth in the EAC off the NSW coastline. Therefore, the EAC has the potential to influence biodiversity, abundance of fishery targeted species and species of conservation significance [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref069">69</a>]. Further seasonal sampling is required to test hypotheses about the effects of seasonality and the EAC, i.e. differences between warm and cold water periods.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The physical structure of the reefs (rugosity, slope and relief) is likely to have the greatest influence on the spatial distribution of fishes on rocky reefs. The swath acoustic data were beneficial in selecting reefs to sample, but they can also be used to derive metrics that can possibly predict the spatial distribution of species richness, species of interest and all fishery target species pooled together. The derivation of habitat metrics from swath acoustic data can provide various levels of explanatory or predictive ability relating to fish assemblage composition and distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref027">27</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref031">31</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref079">79</a>]. In this study, rugosity, slope or relief were selected in the ‘best’ models explaining the variability in many aspects of the fish assemblages that were sampled. While many studies focus on explaining or predicting the spatial distribution of individual species, a more relevant application for spatial planning would be to use reef metrics to explain or predict at higher levels such as species richness or pooled fishery targeted species. For this study, a combination of depth, substrate type, habitat type and rugosity best described species richness and fishery targeted species. These two variables could provide managers with information on areas of high fish diversity or fishery significance.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At a species level, the explanatory factors varied among the four species that were selected a priori for analysis. 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. auratus is arguably the most important recreational and commercial fishery in this region [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref055">55</a>]. While 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">auratus</span> were twice as abundant on shallow reef, on average 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">auratus</span> were larger around mesophotic reefs. In proportion, there were more 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">auratus</span> above the MLL for retention and thus considered sexually mature [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref080">80</a>] on mesophotic reefs. This supports the hypothesis that shallow inshore reefs provide important habitat for juvenile 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">auratus</span>, while deeper mesophotic reef provide additional habitat for larger mature 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">auratus</span>. This is possibly due to either or both ontogenetic movement of larger fish to deeper waters or localised fishing pressure removing larger fish from shallow waters [

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref083">83</a>]. Larger fish are often more tolerant to colder water and change their diets to organisms that are more abundant at deeper depths [

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref084">84</a>]. Unfortunately, data on fishing pressure in this area are limited and it is difficult to make inferences about the effects of fishing pressure on the size structure. A recent study did find that 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">auratus</span> are larger in no-take zones indicating fishing pressure does have some impact on the size structure of a localised population [

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref056">56</a>]. In general, 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">auratus</span> are known to have relatively small home ranges, but some individuals move hundreds of kilometres [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref085">85</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref087">87</a>]. This has been demonstrated in the PSGLMP where tagged 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">auratus</span> demonstrated small home ranges with strong site fidelity on shallow reefs [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref085">85</a>], but their movements and use of deeper reef habitats is unknown and warrants further investigation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">N</span>. 
  <span class="italic">douglassi</span> was more influenced by latitude than by depth. They do occur across a range of habitats including soft sediment and rocky reef and mainly feed on soft sediment associated molluscs and crustaceans [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref088">88</a>,

  <span class="italic">N</span>. 
  <span class="italic">douglassi</span> are medium to large bodied fish that are targeted by recreational and commercial fishers. On average, the 
  <span class="italic">N</span>. 
  <span class="italic">douglassi</span> recorded during this study were above the MLL for retention and could be considered sexually mature [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref089">89</a>]. On this section of coastline the relative abundance and lengths of 
  <span class="italic">N</span>. 
  <span class="italic">douglassi</span> are fairly constant across the depth gradient. Similarly, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">dentex</span> was commonly observed on both types of reef, but they were patchier in their distribution. They were often observed in large schools on stereo-BRUV deployments positioned on the edge of reef or over adjacent soft-sediments. They too are targeted and retained by recreational and commercial fishers [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref089">89</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">scaber</span> is the most numerically abundant monacanthid species in eastern Australia and New Zealand, but very little is known of its ecology and biology [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref090">90</a>]. They are known to inhabit a wide range of depths, but in this study there appears to be a preference for deeper mesophotic reefs. Feeding exclusively on sessile invertebrates such as sponges, ascidians, polyzoans, hydroids and barnacles, 
  <span class="italic">M</span>. 
  <span class="italic">scaber</span> is well suited to these mesophotic reefs [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref090">90</a>]. For 
  <span class="italic">N</span>. 
  <span class="italic">douglassi</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">dentex</span> there doesn’t appear to be any preference for a particular depth of reef and nor is there any clear ecological rationale for one.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study demonstrated that the fish assemblages of rocky reef at mesophotic depths are statistically different to the adjacent shallow reef systems. Despite more than double the total abundances, there were similar relative abundances of fishery target species across both shallow and mesophotic reefs suggesting that, from a fisheries management perspective, these reef systems have the potential for similar social and economic values. Increased knowledge and access to improved technology is now allowing boat-based recreational fishers to target deeper reefs. Swath acoustic data contributed to explaining the spatial distribution of each aspect of the fish assemblage. There is still a research need to investigate seasonal patterns and fine-scale intra-reef variability in fish assemblages on these temperate mesophotic reefs. The use of a complementary method, such as remotely operate vehicle or towed video that passively samples the fish assemblages would provide valuable information on the species not captured through the use of stereo-BRUV sampling [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref091">91</a>]. Notwithstanding this limitation, this study has clearly demonstrated that reefs at mesophotic depths are important and should be taken more into consideration by both fishery managers and when zoning marine parks.
