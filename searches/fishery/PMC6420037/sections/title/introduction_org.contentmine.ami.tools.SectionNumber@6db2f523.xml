 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial distribution of a species assemblage is strongly determined by habitat and physical conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref002">2</a>], and in the marine environment depth is an important factor [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref003">3</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref005">5</a>]. On the inner continental shelf the decreased light conditions with increasing water depth results in a change from macroalgal to sessile invertebrate dominated habitat composition [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref006">6</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref007">7</a>]. In temperate waters this change occurs at depths of around 20–30 m, although variations occur reflecting localised conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref008">8</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref010">10</a>]. To date, much of the research on rocky reefs on the inner shelf has been focussed on reefs in depths less than 20 m reflecting the widespread use of scuba to conduct such surveys. There are few standardised tools to quantitatively survey fish at greater depths. This is despite the significant range of pressures on deeper rocky reefs across the continental shelf, such as commercial and recreational fishing that target reef-associated species [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref011">11</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref013">13</a>]. In recent decades there has been anecdotal evidence that recreational fishers have an increased technical capacity such as side-scan or multibeam sonar and electric reels and are therefore, able to target deeper reefs. Previously these reefs may have provided refuge for older, mature individuals [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref015">15</a>]. Thus, with increasing recreational fishing activity at these depths it is important that we gain a better understand on the abundance and diversity of fishes at depths &gt;30m.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mesophotic reefs are those characterised by the presence of light-dependent corals and associated communities often between the depths of 30–40 and 150 m in tropical and subtropical regions of the world [

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref019">19</a>]. Furthermore, there is now a broad understanding that this zone can be divided into the upper and lower mesophotic zone with a transition zone at ~60 m depending on water clarity and temperature [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref019">19</a>]. The recent worldwide expansion of multibeam acoustic surveys of continental shelf waters has revealed that they form extensive areas of habitat in many regions [

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref021">21</a>]. Mesophotic reefs are often continuous with shallow reefs, resulting in potentially strong connectivity across a large depth gradient, a feature common in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, north eastern Brazil and the Hawaiian Archipelago [

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref023">23</a>]. They can also form discontinuous areas that are interspersed among areas of unconsolidated habitat, such as in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref017">17</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref024">24</a>]. While the number of studies on mesophotic reef has increased significantly over the past decade [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref018">18</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref019">19</a>], the majority of this research is focussed in the tropics where such reefs usually contain scleractinian corals [

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref018">18</a>]. Conversely, temperate mesophotic ecosystems tend to be dominated by sponges and octocorals [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref020">20</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref025">25</a>]. In comparison to the tropical mesophotic coral ecosystems, little is known about temperate mesophotic ecosystems, particularly the link between fish assemblages, habitat structure, and connectivity with shallower reefs [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref013">13</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperate mesophotic reefs have important biodiversity, social and economic values [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref025">25</a>], so understanding the characteristics of their associated fish assemblages is fundamental to effectively managing them. Habitat type (coral, sponge, bare) and complexity (relief, rugosity, curvature) are known to be important in structuring fish assemblages [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref026">26</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref031">31</a>]. Habitat complexity is considered as the variance in surface structure of the reef and can be defined in terms of relief, slope, rugosity, surface area, and other factors [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref028">28</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref032">32</a>]. The link between habitat complexity and fish assemblages has been well researched, with many studies showing positive relationships between complexity and fish abundance, biomass and diversity [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref027">27</a>,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mesophotic reefs often occur adjacent to inshore shallow reefs, some connectivity across the depth gradient might be expected. It was hypothesised in the late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, that mesophotic reefs provide refuge for some fish species [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref014">14</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref040">40</a>]. This hypothesis assumed that mesophotic reefs were isolated from most of the stressors that impact inshore shallow reefs such as coral bleaching, pollution, habitat loss and some forms of fishing [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref040">40</a>]. For temperate reef systems, there are insufficient data over sufficient temporal scales to make generalised conclusions about the extent or nature of any habitat connectivity between shallow and deep components. There is empirical evidence based on genetics and observations that connectivity between mesophotic and shallow reefs occurs, and this has been observed for over-exploited fishery target species [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref019">19</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref040">40</a>]. On the other hand, there is also some evidence that mesophotic reefs are not merely extensions of shallow reefs, but host a unique species assemblage and would benefit from increased conservation management [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surveys of mesophotic reefs have historically been logistically difficult and expensive due to the need for large offshore vessels and the lack of detailed information on their distribution and structure [

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref043">43</a>]. Earlier studies used coarse scale maps generated through the aggregation of information from commercial fishers, historical hydrographic data and targeted single beam acoustic surveys [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref044">44</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref046">46</a>]. More recently, the expansion of swath acoustic surveys has resulted in high resolution maps of continental shelf rocky reefs based on the interpretation of bathymetry and backscatter [

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref048">48</a>]. The recent development of cost effective and easy to deploy underwater video equipment has also meant a move away from destructive survey methods such as gillnets, droplines and traps, which are also often not suitable for use in sensitive or protected areas. Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) is now commonly used to survey fish assemblages, and advances in camera housings, lights and study designs have enabled the deployment of cameras onto deeper habitats enabling non-destructive sampling of fishes across continental shelf waters [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref036">36</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref051">51</a>]. Furthermore, there is evidence that BRUVs provide similar data when used at different depth and when compared to diver surveys [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While there has been some assessment of fish assemblages on shallow reefs in temperate eastern Australia [
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref053">53</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206778.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206778.ref056">56</a>], there has been no comparable assessment done on mesophotic reefs. The lack of knowledge on fish assemblages and habitat composition of mesophotic reefs in this region increases the uncertainties associated with marine spatial planning and evaluation of management effectiveness. This is particularly important in the case of marine parks that usually have specific objectives about conserving the biological diversity of a representative range of habitats and associated assemblages. Our study focussed on an area of the inner continental shelf within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park (PSGLMP) and the adjacent Hunter Marine Park (HMP). The PSGLMP extends from the tidal limit to the 3 nm extent of State coastal waters, with the HMP extending from this boundary to 25 nm offshore. Specifically, the aim of our study was to quantify and compare the spatial distribution of fish assemblages on shallow (20–40 m) and lower-mesophotic (80–110 m) temperate rocky reefs, and relate these to habitat composition. This study will extend knowledge of temperate mesophotic reefs generally, but will also inform future decision-making in these two marine parks to improve effective management of these reefs and to design better targeted monitoring programs.
