Stereo-BRUVs that landed on top of rocky reef had the highest species richness, with a significant positive relationship with rugosity. The total relative abundance (total MaxN) of all fishes followed a similar pattern, with more than double the number of fishes recorded on shallow reefs compared with mesophotic reefs (

   <a rid="pone.0206778.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206778.t003">Table 3</a>). Habitats dominated by a high abundance of sessile invertebrates had the highest relative abundance of monacanthids.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of fishery targeted species across the two depth categories was highly variable and species dependent. The spatial distribution of the most targeted species (
   <span class="italic">C</span>. 
   <span class="italic">auratus</span>) was related to depth, latitude and habitat type (
   <a rid="pone.0206778.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206778.t003">Table 3</a>). On average, the relative abundance of 
   <span class="italic">C</span>. 
   <span class="italic">auratus</span> on shallow reefs was six times greater than on mesophotic reefs (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206778.g003" href="#pone.0206778.g003">Fig 3</a>), although, there was greater variability between stereo-BRUV deployments on shallow reefs (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206778.g003" href="#pone.0206778.g003">Fig 3</a>). The positive effect of latitude showed that abundances of 
   <span class="italic">C</span>. 
   <span class="italic">auratus</span> were highest at the Seal Rocks sites, the most northern survey site (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206778.g003" href="#pone.0206778.g003">Fig 3</a>). Also, 
   <span class="italic">C</span>. 
   <span class="italic">auratus</span> occurred in greater abundance on stereo-BRUV deployments that were located on the edge of reefs that were dominated by invertebrate/sediment or sediment habitats. 
   <span class="italic">N</span>. 
   <span class="italic">douglasii</span>, also a highly targeted species, was more evenly distributed across reef type, with latitude and habitat type providing the best model to describe the spatial distribution of this species (
   <a rid="pone.0206778.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206778.t003">Table 3</a>). The positive relationship between latitude and relative abundance of

   <span class="italic">douglasii</span> showed greater abundance at Seal Rocks sites (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206778.g003" href="#pone.0206778.g003">Fig 3</a>). The spatial distribution of the carangid 
   <span class="italic">P</span>. 
   <span class="italic">georgianus</span> was far more variable than 
   <span class="italic">C</span>. 
   <span class="italic">auratus</span> and

   <span class="italic">douglasii</span>. However, on average the relative distribution was similar across the two depth categories (

   <span class="italic">P</span>. 
   <span class="italic">georgianus</span> tend to be observed in small schools on low rugosity reef edges. The most parsimonious model that best described the spatial distribution of 
   <span class="italic">P</span>. 
   <span class="italic">georgianus</span> included the factors slope, rugosity and habitat (
   <a rid="pone.0206778.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206778.t003">Table 3</a>). The spatial distribution of the monacanthid 
   <span class="italic">M</span>. 
   <span class="italic">scaber</span> was highly variable, but on average higher relative abundances were observed on mesophotic reefs (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206778.g003" href="#pone.0206778.g003">Fig 3</a>). The most parsimonious model best described the spatial distribution of 
   <span class="italic">M</span>. 
   <span class="italic">scaber</span> included the factors depth, habitat and latitude (
   <a rid="pone.0206778.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206778.t003">Table 3</a>). It was sites within the mid latitudes of this study that had the highest relative abundances and the higher relative abundances tended to be on low relief reef (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206778.g003" href="#pone.0206778.g003">Fig 3</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species that are actively targeted and highly retained by both recreational and commercial fishers showed a relatively equal distribution across both shallow and mesophotic reefs (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206778.g004" href="#pone.0206778.g004">Fig 4</a>). Habitat, rugosity and slope best described the variability between sites (
   <a rid="pone.0206778.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206778.t003">Table 3</a>). Reef dominated by algae and reef edge habitats had the highest abundance of fishery-targeted species. While there was a strong positive relationship between fishery-targeted species and reef rugosity, there was a weak negative relationship with slope.
