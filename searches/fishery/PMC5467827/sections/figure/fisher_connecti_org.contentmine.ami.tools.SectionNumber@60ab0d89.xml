  <p>Arc diagram depicting fishersâ€™ (n = 8,576) connections to state and federal fisheries based on the portfolio of licenses that individuals hold. Fisheries are connected by arcs in instances where at least one fisher has access to both fisheries. Intensity and thickness of arcs are based on the number of links (i.e., number of harvesters). Node size reflects overall connectedness of each fishery. Note: (1) greater connectivity within federal fisheries (orange nodes); (2) high overall connectivity to the state and federal lobster fisheries; and (3) relatively weak links between state and federal fisheries. In cases where multiple license types exist for a single species: (D) = drag gear; (H) = hand harvesting; (S) = state license; (F) = federal license.</p>
