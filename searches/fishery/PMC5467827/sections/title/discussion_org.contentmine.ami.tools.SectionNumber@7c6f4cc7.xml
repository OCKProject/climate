 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fisheries are largely managed on a species by species basis, as is corresponding research about their human dimensions. Inattention to the diverse connections that fishers have to fisheries, however, obscures meaningful differences that influence how individuals interact with the marine environment and respond to change. In this paper, we bring explicit attention to the heterogeneity of fishing strategies employed in Maine and evaluate the adaptive capacity afforded by each, finding that fishers’ ability to respond to change is highly variable due to differences in the stability of markets, value of species, status of stocks, and underlying governance structure. Understanding cross-fishery connectivity is critical to devising effective management strategies that support fishers and healthy fisheries in a changing seascape worldwide.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each combination affords fishers access to a different set of opportunities that contributes to different levels of adaptive capacity. Of the groups in the typology that include lobster licenses, for example, the mean adaptability scores ranged from 0 to 94. Such variability is seldom acknowledged, but has important implications in terms of how individuals will (or can) respond to change. The differences in adaptive capacity correspond to differences in market stability, economic value, and stock status of individual fisheries as well as the geographic and gear diversity that fishers maintain across fisheries. For example, 167 (1.9%) fishers hold a state lobster license and a shellfish license and 38 (0.4%) hold a state lobster license and an elver license exclusively. In both instances, these fishers have access to two relatively valuable species. These fishers also benefit from being diversified in terms of geography and gear because the lobster fishery occurs in the ocean and requires a boat and traps, whereas the other two fisheries take place on the coast and in rivers and require a rake and dip net or fyke net (which are fairly inexpensive to construct or obtain). Fishers participating in these fisheries also gain access to social capital derived from local management and fishing associations, such as the Maine Elver Association, that have been created to support these fisheries. This stands in contrast to less commercially valuable fisheries and those that are not well organized, such as the marine worm fishery (n = 609 (7.1%)), which has had a stable market, but is not managed at a local level and is not organized. Such differences have a direct impact on the range of possibilities available to fishers when negotiating various challenges, whereby affecting their adaptive capacity. Delimiting these differences brings explicit attention to the multiplicity of connections that fishers have to different fisheries and begins to make apparent that these differences, which cannot be seen by taking a narrow single-species approach to studying fisheries, have real implications for if and how industry members interact with marine resources and adapt to future change.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results presented in this paper serve to highlight the uneven capacity of the fishing fleet in Maine to adapt based on the criteria used in our assessment. To a certain extent, these data give reason for anxiety about the future of the commercial fishing sector. Based on our evaluation of the license typology, 88% of fishers (n = 7,550) have low (≤50) to medium (≤82) adaptive capacity given their existing licensing portfolios. However, it is important that these results are understood within the broader context in which many commercial fishers operate. Fishers’ ability to adapt to change is dependent upon a multitude of factors of which access to licenses is only one. These additional factors include but are not limited to opportunities for employment outside of the fishing sector, individual knowledge and expertise, community connections, personal and family finances, and general open-mindedness. Further research is needed to more fully understand how these factors influence adaptability, as it is likely that they also play an important role. In some instances, these factors will likely further reduce individuals’ ability to anticipate and respond to changes, while in other cases they will increase individuals’ capacity, whereby mitigating some of the negative implications of our results based solely on license portfolios.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is also important to acknowledge that fishers are often extremely adept at problem solving. Therefore, we should not necessarily assume that having moderate or even low adaptive capacity will necessarily prevent adaptation altogether. An alternative hypothesis is that it could foster innovation and catalyze fishers’ willingness to adapt. This hypothesis is based on the logic that change is often driven by necessity and it is at these moments of uncertainty, increased vulnerability, and elevated risk perception when individuals are compelled to take risks, experiment, and pursue new ways of doing business (even if they are not well positioned to try) [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref028">28</a>]. If this alternate scenario is correct, then the current state of the fishing sector in Maine could present the conditions necessary for experimentation and risk taking. In practical terms, this may mean the formation of new alliances between sectors of the fishing community and external stakeholders, adoption of different marketing strategies, willingness to try new governance structures, or testing of alternative ways to making a living off the water. Signs of these types of innovation may already be starting to become visible. In recent years, there have been a wave of fishers experimenting with direct marketing arrangements [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref029">29</a>], there is an increasing number of people entering the aquaculture sector, and fisheries managers at the state level are working with fishers to implement new management regimes and utilize new technologies to improve monitoring and accountability. Fisheries managers and policymakers will need to play a critical role in facilitating and ultimately institutionalizing innovation and therefore should be mindful that those who may be most willing to experiment and innovate may also have the least capacity. This will likely include individuals who are poorly diversified in terms of geography and gear and/or dependent on fisheries that are low value or have unstable stocks and markets. It will also include fishers that do not have a mechanism to participate in the management process formally or lack industry groups that actively advocate for their needs. Accordingly, these individuals are apt not to be the “usual suspects” who have existing relationships with managers or policymakers. Therefore managers and policymakers will need to find creative ways to identify, listen to, and engage with these fishers to better understand the complex needs of the industry.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ultimately, while the exact responses that fishers will have to future changes remain unknown, more explicit attention to the diverse and complex connections fishers have to fisheries is vital to understanding the vulnerability of the fishing industry. In this paper, we focus on fisheries in Maine, yet complex fisher-fisheries connections are ubiquitous in fisheries in the United States and more broadly. Understanding these linkages will contribute to our collective understanding of fisher behavior and social-ecological dynamics in marine systems.</p>
