 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure the connectivity of fishers to different assemblages of fisheries we created an association network based on the state and federal licenses that fishers held in Maine during 2014. Data used in this study belong to the Maine Department of Marine Resources and the National Marine Fisheries Service. These data can be requested from the Maine Department of Marine Resources' Licensing Division (

Federal permit data is available online and can be obtained through the National Marine Fisheries Service Greater Atlantic Region Permit Office (

This analysis excluded licenses for aquaculture leases, tribal fisheries, scientific sample collecting, transporting or distributing seafood, and recreational fishing. Edges in the network (i.e., links) represent linkages between pairs of fisheries in which a minimum of one fisher holds both licenses. Freemanâ€™s degree centrality was calculated as a proxy for the relative importance of fisheries in the network [
