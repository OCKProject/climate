 <p>Illustration of the hierarchical typology of fisheries based on the assemblages of state and federal licenses commercial fishers in Maine held during 2014. Typology includes five levels starting with Level 1 in the center and moving outwards to Level 5. Each level (moving away from the center) is progressively more narrowly defined and therefore more homogenous. Numbers in the illustration correspond to the ID numbers in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0178266.t002" href="#pone.0178266.t002">Table 2</a>, which provides a description of each portfolio type with at least 10 individuals. The illustration does not include groups with fewer than 5 individuals although the results reported in this paper include data from all groups (n = 620).
