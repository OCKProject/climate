 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to populate a matrix of Euclidean distances between license types. These data were used to conduct an agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) using the R package FactoMineR. Using this approach, clusters were parsed apart to maximize the difference in the total variance within and between groups as described by Husson et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref023">23</a>]. We first performed this analysis using all the licensing data to form first order clusters in the typology that provided the basis for a second HCA, which in turn resulted in second order clusters that were then used for third, fourth, and fifth order clusters. In taking this approach, we were able to create a set of nested clusters that became progressively more homogenous as they were further subdivided with each subsequent HCA.
