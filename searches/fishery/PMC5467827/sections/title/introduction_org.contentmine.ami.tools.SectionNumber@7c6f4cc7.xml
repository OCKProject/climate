 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Change is often considered the only unconditional constant in natural resource based sectors, including commercial fisheries. This perpetual flux is influenced by the biophysical and ecological characteristics of the environment [

  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref002">2</a>]. Each of these many forces interact at multiple and simultaneous scales making it difficult to anticipate the direction, pace, or implications of change—only that it will happen [

  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref005">5</a>]. Those who are nimble and can leverage the resources necessary to adapt their strategies are generally thought to be better suited to withstand change than those who are locked into narrowly defined arrangements [

  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref007">7</a>]. While acknowledgement of the role that adaptive capacity plays in sustaining both fishers and fisheries has increased over time [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref008">8</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref011">11</a>], attentiveness to the complex and diverse connections that fishers have to different fisheries, often across multiple jurisdictions, has been largely missing. In this article we bring explicit attention to the heterogeneity of fishing strategies employed by fishers by characterizing the different assemblages of fisheries that fishers harvest and evaluating the extent to which individuals’ ability to navigate change differs as a result.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishers worldwide employ a wide range of strategies to ameliorate the potential impacts caused by socioeconomic and ecological changes. One of the commonly referenced approaches involves maintaining access to diverse fishing portfolios of uncorrelated or disassociated species [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref013">13</a>]. Being able to fish for diverse sets of fisheries is typically achieved by holding access privileges to multiple species through permits, licenses, quota, or territorial use rights that are acquired from various governing bodies or purchased or leased from private firms. This diversification gives fishers the ability to shift between fisheries based on what is most convenient, abundant, or valuable at a particular moment in time. The advantage of this strategy is that fishers have multiple pathways through which they can maintain their livelihoods, whereby reducing income variability over time that might be caused by regulatory closures, over harvesting, or market shifts. Having this mobility also allows fishers to temporarily reduce fishing pressure on a species in a particular area to accelerate recovery and rebuilding [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref014">14</a>] and it can help fishers accumulate wealth by enabling them to capitalize on valuable fisheries during periods of abundance [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref015">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though diversification represents an important adaptation strategy, in practice, fishers’ ability to broaden their fishing opportunities is becoming increasingly difficult. In many places, fishers are becoming more reliant on an ever narrower suite of fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref017">17</a>]. This trend can be attributed, in part, to the nature of the rules and regulations that are being implemented to curb overfishing and sustain fish stocks. These rules not only act to constrain the types of gear used, where and when fish are targeted, and the size of fish that can be taken, but they also act to constrain who and how many people can participate by way of limiting entry. In Maine, for instance, many of the most valuable fisheries have become limited entry, including those for elver, lobster, sea cucumber, alewife, and softshell clam. These restrictions afford fishers a level of security around which they can plan their businesses and make decisions about how and when to invest in these fisheries, but they also reduce flexibility, so that fishers that do not already hold the prerequisite permits or quota cannot easily shift to different fisheries or expand their fishing portfolios.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The risk associated with being over-reliant on a particular fishery or set of fisheries is not new. However, it is arguably exacerbated by the rapid pace of change that is underway. From an ecological perspective, changing global conditions are catalyzing unprecedented shifts in ocean and coastal conditions. In the Gulf of Maine, sea surface temperatures have been increasing rapidly over the past three decades, impacting many of the most economically important commercial fisheries in the region, including cod and lobster [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref018">18</a>]. Major socioeconomic change is also taking place as seafood trade becomes increasingly globalized. One of the most apparent changes is the recent rapid expansion of seafood trade to China [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref019">19</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref020">20</a>]. In 2015, $90.1 million worth of lobster alone was exported to China [
  <a rid="pone.0178266.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0178266.ref021">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The magnitude of this change combined with increasing regulatory inflexibility raises important questions and also concern about the capacity of fishers to adapt. This perspective is reflected in numerous policy documents that specifically call for management actions that facilitate flexibility, mobility, and adaptation such as the US National Ocean Policy and the NOAA Fisheries Climate Science Strategy. To begin to understand the adaptive capacity of fishers in earnest requires greater attention to the numerous and diverse connections that marine resource harvesters have to different fisheries and how this diversity affects their business decisions and the resulting and pressure on fisheries. These differences will directly affect individuals’ ability to sustain their livelihoods and respond to changing conditions. Focusing on these connections at the level of the individual is especially critical (but uncommon) because ultimately adaptation occurs at this scale and not at the level of the community in the short-term.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we use the case of Maine to describe the uneven capacity of the commercial fishing sector to adapt to changing socioeconomic and environmental conditions based on fishers’ different connections to state and federal fisheries. Maine is among the most fisheries dependent states in the US and can thus be considered an interesting example and microcosm for the study of fishers-fisheries relations, which presumably exist in fisheries worldwide, but are seldom explicitly acknowledged. In demonstrating the link between the diversity of individual fishing portfolios and adaptive capacity in Maine we aim to highlight a dynamic that is relevant to fisheries across the globe. We start by (1) identifying the connections that fishers have to different state and federal fisheries. We then (2) characterize the commercial fishing fleet in Maine by creating a typology of fishers based on the fishing licenses that individuals hold. Lastly, we (3) evaluate the adaptive capacity of each type of fisher in the typology. This final assessment is based on a set of attributes and associated criteria identified by fisheries experts with extensive knowledge of Maine’s commercial fishing sector, including fishermen themselves. Our analysis reveals significant heterogeneity among fishers in their adaptive capacity based on their fishing portfolios, suggesting that the impacts of impending change in the Gulf of Maine will be highly uneven. Lack of attention to this heterogeneity at the individual level may result in overly blunt policy strategies that produce ineffective policies and subsequent management responses.</p>
