Possible future trajectories under climate change for capture fisheries (Eide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>) and for Arctic aquaculture (Hermansen and Troell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>) anticipate the movement of aquatic species into new waters, changes in dynamics of existing species, changes in management regimes and new regulations for novel commercial fisheries and aquaculture. Negative consequences are expected for traditional hunting of marine mammals, but for fish populations like Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>) in the Barents Sea environmental carrying capacity may instead increase (Perry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2005</xref>; Eide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>). Arctic aquaculture is an economically important business and makes up more than 50% of European Union volumes. The vast majority of this is Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) farmed in Norway. The sector may face many challenges in a warmer future and some of these, being directly related to temperature increase, are already a reality for the industry. Other more indirect impacts will have more uncertain influence on the economic conditions of Arctic aquaculture production (Hermansen and Troell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Climate change affects food production and food security in the Arctic in complex ways. It encompasses many different dimensions, including health, pollution and globalisation through integrated markets. To date, there exists no pan-Arctic assessment that provides an overall picture (Arctic Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>). Box <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents a snapshot of the broader picture, but this paper limits its aims to reviewing and discussing possible impacts from climate change on Arctic industrial capture fisheries and aquaculture production. These are some of the most important industries in the Arctic and together they constitute relatively large shares of the gross domestic product (GDP) in some countries (e.g. 15% in Greenland and 10% in Iceland).</p><p id="Par9">In the absence of standard definition (CAFF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>), we define Arctic capture fisheries to include all catches in marine areas in all Arctic and sub-Arctic waters that lie north of the Arctic Circle (i.e. north of 66&#x000b0;33&#x02032;N, blue circle in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, due to reporting structure we also combine FAO statistics (FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>) with this definition, and relevant FAO fishing areas in the Arctic include the Arctic Sea (Area 18), the Northeast Atlantic (Area 27) and the Northwest Atlantic (Area 21). Not all fishing within these areas is included as it stretches outside the defined Arctic boundary. The Arctic Sea (Area 18) includes Beaufort and Chukchi seas, Hudson Bay, Kara Sea, East Siberian and Laptev seas. The Northeast Atlantic area above the Arctic Circle (subareas I, II, V and XIV of Area 27, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) includes the Barents Sea, the Norwegian Sea, Svalbard, the Bear Island, Northeast Greenland, Iceland and the Faroese Grounds, while the Northwest Atlantic area above the Arctic Circle (subareas 0A, 1A and 1B of FAO area 21, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) includes part of Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. The Bering Strait being south of the Arctic Circle, we exclude fisheries in Northeast and Northwest Pacific (FAO area 67). In this respect, our definition of the Arctic fisheries area deviates from, for instance, Christensen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>) in that we exclude the Bering Sea and the Hudson Bay Complex.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Different areal definitions of the Arctic and FAO major Fishing areas (Source: Young and Einarsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2004</xref>; IPPC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13280_2017_954_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

</p><p id="Par10">This paper only to some extent discusses areas situated just outside of the defined Arctic boundary. To predict possible expansions or relocation of current activity or species migration into the Arctic under climatic change, a more careful consideration of such dynamic would be needed. Aquaculture is strictly limited in the Arctic and focus is here only on marine industrial farming and dominating production nations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Global seafood portfolio: the role of the arctic</title><p id="Par11">When narrowing Arctic fisheries to the area above the Arctic Circle, the Barents Sea becomes the most important area regarding catch size. This is one of the most productive ocean areas worldwide. Capture fisheries in the FAO Areas 18, 21 and 27 constituted about 13% of the total world catch in 2014 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The Northeast Atlantic is by far the most important area&#x02014;representing over 10% of global catches. However, both Areas 21 and 27 expand far south of the Arctic Circle. Detailed figures from 2012 show that the share of world marine catches caught in Arctic waters&#x02014;following our definition&#x02014;constituted about 6% (4.5 million tonnes), of which 96% were caught in the Northeast Atlantic (Isaksen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2015</xref>).

</p><p id="Par12">The dominating Arctic fishing areas are the Norwegian Sea, the Icelandic Grounds and the Barents Sea (FAO Area 27, Divisions II, Va and I, respectively). Catches from East and West of Greenland (including the Arctic Sea) are marginal in comparison; however, fishing in these areas constitutes important livelihoods for many small-scale operators. North-eastern Pacific fisheries take place south of the Arctic Circle and their numbers are included just as a reference as important Alaska Pollock (<italic>Theragra chalcogramma</italic>) fishery takes place in this area (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">Fishery is one of the most important industries in the Arctic representing large shares of gross domestic product (GDP) in some countries. For local communities fishing, fish processing and/or fish farming can be even more important. Thus, local communities, regions and nations&#x02019; degree of dependency on the fishing or associated activities are important, and since fish production volumes are the most available (and reliable) data at hand, this is usually used as a proxy for importance.</p><p id="Par14">Fisheries have historically been the main reason for settlement in many peripheral Arctic coastal areas. Arctic aquaculture has the last two decades grown significantly and is today dominated by Norwegian Atlantic salmon farming. Arctic aquaculture only constitutes a small share of world aquaculture production volumes (~&#x000a0;2%) but its specific contribution to global marine aquaculture production is important (ca. 25%) (FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>) and its economic contribution is even higher. In Norway, fisheries and aquaculture industries contribute only 1% of GDP and 1% of employment. However, fish is the second most important export product (after oil) with nearly 7800 million &#x020ac; in 2014&#x02014;where more than half the value stems from farmed salmon (Statistics Norway 2015; Norwegian Seafood Council 2015) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Modern salmon farming cages from the coast of Norway, Photo: R.

The capelin stock was not exploited in 2014 while it represented the largest catch 2&#x000a0;years before (FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>). This large variation illustrates the combined effects of a fluctuating ecosystem and the management system in place. When the capelin stock is below a critical level, the management system prioritises leaving the capelin in the sea as prey for cod instead of catching it (Eide et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">The International Council for Exploration of the Seas (ICES) advises on total allowable catch (TAC), which are then set by governments. The TAC advice for Norwegian spring spawning herring (in areas I, II, V, IVa and XIVa) in 2015 was 283 000 tonnes compared to 1 687 000 tonnes in 2009 (ICES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2016</xref>). The Northeast Atlantic mackerel (<italic>Scomber scombrus</italic>) has a larger (and increasing) distribution area, and coastal states have not reached a final agreement on the allocation of quotas since 2007. For that stock, the advice went from 349 000&#x02013;456 000 tonnes in 2008 to 927 000&#x02013;1 011 000 tonnes in 2014.

The industry is rather dynamic; for example, in 2013 a new fishery developed along the Eastern Greenland coast targeting mackerel that had recently reached further north in this region and all the way to the Spitsbergen fjords (Jansen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2016</xref>). Also, quotas for Northeast Atlantic cod peaked in 2013 (and subsequent years) to the highest catch levels in 40&#x000a0;years (estimated to 966 000 tonnes in 2013). Atlantic herring biomass is decreasing in this area, while mackerel landings have been increasing since 2005. However, inter-year climate variations are large. For example, the joint Norwegian Russian Ecosystem survey in the Barents Sea could not survey the Spitsbergen region from August to October 2014 due to increased ice coverage compared to 2013 (Eriksen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">The Barents Sea is one of the most productive oceans in the world; the economically most important species are the Northeast Arctic cod, haddock and capelin, the latter being the main prey species of cod. Russia and Norway share these fish stocks. Occasionally large numbers of juveniles of the spring spawning herring (essentially a Norwegian Sea stock) flow into the Barents Sea basin, significantly affecting cod&#x02013;capelin interaction (Huse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2002</xref>). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows catches of the main targeted species during the period in the Barents Sea. The figure reveals some correlation between these stocks. After the spring spawning herring collapsed at the end of the 1960s, a large capelin fishery took off in the Barents Sea. When the herring stock recovered, large quantities of young herring entered the Barents Sea in the mid-1980s. They preyed upon pelagic capelin larvae, thus causing a collapse in the capelin stock with a following starvation in the cod stock (Hamre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1994</xref>; Tjelmeland and Bogstad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1998</xref>; Gj&#x000f8;s&#x000e6;ter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>).

Trawlers and large decked vessels target both demersal and pelagic species. However, they may increasingly target pelagic species as prices for pelagic fish increase, due to increased demand for human consumption instead of fishmeal and fish oil. Pelagic catches already dominate the volume (64%) and constitute about 30% of catch value, while demersal species amount to one third of the volume but 61% of value. The dominant species in Icelandic fisheries are (with share of landings in brackets) capelin (32%), cod (17%), herring (12%) and blue whiting (8%).

Ongoing and emerging climate change also poses a threat to existing food systems and food security by affecting indigenous peoples&#x02019; access to wildlife (Gunn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2006</xref>; Tesar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2007</xref>; Heleniak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2014</xref>). For example, climate change alters migratory patterns of Arctic animals and i.e. Inuit hunters are struggling to adapt. Thus, the implications for traditional hunting, fishing, and gathering activities will have crucial local economic and dietary importance, and impact on social and cultural identities (Nuttall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2005</xref>). Imported foods have increasingly replaced local foods (Kuhnlein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">1992</xref>; Wein and Freeman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">1992</xref>) resulting in higher frequency of obesity, diabetes and heart diseases from increased intake of carbohydrates and saturated fats (Blanchet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2000</xref>; Kuhnlein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2000</xref>; Van Oost dam et al. 2005). In addition, marine mammals such as beluga and seals contain higher levels of contaminants, which impacts severely on indigenous peoples&#x02019; health. The relation with climate change is uncertain (NCP 2013). Warming may also increase opportunities for local food production in some regions as growing periods becomes more favourable. This means that conditions for crops and livestock farming will improve. A longer open-water season will make transportation more viable throughout the year, something that may reduce costs for local agriculture production inputs like e.g. seeds, fertilizers, fuel, etc. (IPCC 2001). Poor soil, unpredictable climate, and supply costs will still remain a challenge for the growth of the Arctic agricultural sector. In addition, although climate change resulted in warmer summers, they are also drier with potential negative implications for growth. Emergence of new shipping routes resulting from changed ice conditions may also influence Arctic people in multiple ways, however, resulting impacts on e.g. the fishing sector is difficult to foresee.<break/>

Depth may be a constraining factor for benthic species, preventing a further northern expansion north and west of Svalbard (Eide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>; Fossheim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>). However, it is not necessarily a constraining factor for pelagic species. Spatial distribution of capelin tends to follow environmental changes, and a spread northward in the Barents Sea area is probably a response to recent increase in temperature and reduced ice cover (Ingvaldsen and Gj&#x000f8;s&#x000e6;ter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>). Changes in the spatial distribution of capelin may change its condition and fat content due to distributional patterns of zooplankton communities (Orlova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2010</xref>). The overall ecosystem consequences from this are complex and difficult to predict at large scale.</p><p id="Par44">Christiansen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2014</xref>) point to the potential degradation of Arctic species and ecosystems due to inevitable bycatch and bottom trawling harming the seabed, as the ice retracts and commercial fish and fisheries displace polewards. These understudied species are particularly dependent on a precautionary approach in fisheries management practices, since uncertainty levels are high and so also the risk for stocks to collapse. However, according to V&#x000ed;lhj&#x000e1;lmsson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2005</xref>) it is likely that a moderate warming will improve the conditions for the most important fish stocks in the Arctic, like cod and herring, but it will also contribute to a very different species composition in some ecosystems. Hence, commercial fisheries must be adjusted, which might call for renewed fisheries negotiations for fishing rights and TACs (total allowable catch) among coastal states. As a consequence, the effect of climate change on fish stocks might originate to a larger extent from policies and their enforcements than from climate warming itself if it is moderate.</p><p id="Par45">Temperatures may not be the main explanatory factor for changes in the distribution of pelagic fish populations in the Arctic (Pacariz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2016</xref>). A case study of the North-eastern Atlantic mackerel stock concludes that seafloor topography, ocean currents and nutrient limitations are other important explanatory factors for pelagic species. Ocean currents and nutrient densities are closely connected to the topography of the seafloor, which is not affected by climate change. Hence, climate-induced spatial changes of fish stocks and ecosystem may be less than expected when focusing only on temperature. For benthic species like the Northeast Arctic cod stock, centres of gravity of monthly spatial distributions of biomasses do not seem to change significantly due to climate change in the next 50&#x000a0;years (Eide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Acidification, sea level rise and storms</title><p id="Par46">The world oceans have absorbed approximately 30% of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> deriving from human activities, leading to reduced pH values in ocean water but regional differences are substantial (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>). Acidification therefore represents a concern but knowledge about biological and environmental impacts is poor at this stage (Bates and Mathis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>). Climate change is expected to increase intensity and frequency of storms in some ocean areas.

Studies of the Icelandic cod fishery (Mazzi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2005</xref>) indicate that fisheries management indeed affects the prediction value of climate processes in explaining changes in recruitment and growth. Harvest control rules and precautionary approaches to management could represent more useful stock management strategies compared to using complex ecosystem models including climate variables. Indeed, the complexity of the climate system and lack of knowledge regarding model specification and parameterization effectively hinder improving management decisions (Punt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2014</xref>; Kvamsdal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">Management of many shared sub-Arctic fish stock builds on agreed shares of the TAC. Redistribution of common stocks due to climate change or other reasons potentially threaten existing agreements and also include new stakeholders and nations that previously were not exploiting these stocks. For example, in the North-eastern mackerel fishery, the emergence of an Icelandic mackerel fishery undermined previous agreements (Jansen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2016</xref>). The risk of management collapse was not enough to bring the partners together. However, despite the lack of formal agreements, the expected serious overfishing did not occur. Instead, quasi-cooperation contributed to hinder overfishing (Hannesson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>). Although falling somewhat short compared with full management cooperation, the partners shared the basic principles of fisheries management and eventually acted according to their ideas about responsible fisheries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Markets (factor markets and consumer markets)</title><p id="Par49">Climate change may also indirectly influence demand for fish products, factor markets for production of fishing effort and the processing industry. Increased public awareness about climate change could put a price premium on products with less negative climate impact, i.e. products in which the production process generates less greenhouse gas emissions compared to others. Hence, demand for seafood could skew towards products that are harvested, processed and distributed in a more climate-friendly manner unless more responsible fisheries preventing bycatch also happen to be more energy intensive creating conflicting environmental objectives. Consumer power is organised to some degree through organisations that certify seafood based on sustainability and/or lesser climate impact (like ecolabelling and seafood sustainability standards such as Marine Stewardship Council, Aquaculture Stewardship Council, Friends of the Sea, WWF, Seafood Watch, KRAV and others). Price premiums have been observed on labelled seafood (Roheim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2011</xref>) but it is also criticised for being a necessary market signal in business-to-business marketing, not necessarily towards the customers (Roheim and Sutinen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2006</xref>; Washington and Ababouch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2011</xref>; N&#x000f8;stvold et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2013</xref>). Other studies have observed price premiums for long-line caught seafood in the UK market (Sogn-Grundv&#x000e5;g et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2013</xref>), but the price premium can just as well come from the extra quality delivered by this fishing gear rather than the environmental concern.</p><p id="Par50">Fishing industries worldwide, including all major fishing fleets in the Northeast Atlantic, benefit from heavily subsidised fuel prices (Tyedmers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2005</xref>; Martini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2012</xref>; Isaksen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>; Waldo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2016</xref>). The fleets&#x02019; shares of national emissions are relatively modest (except for Greenland); however, abolishing fuel subsidy schemes could reduce emissions and potentially alter operations and fleet composition. However, since high-water fisheries in these areas often take place in international waters, international cooperation is necessary to avoid leakage (i.e. fuel bunkering abroad or in international waters, with the potential landings going the same way). It is, however, important to compare environmental performance (e.g. GHG emission) of fishing with production of animal proteins from land systems.

Most studies of climatic effects on aquaculture discard indirect effects that potentially can impact aquaculture, e.g. changes in agriculture production, financial markets, demographic structures and capture fisheries (Handisyde et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>; Cochrane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2009</xref>). However, the impacts of environmental changes on aquaculture often result from a chain of effects, hence making it difficult to identify clear causative links (De Silva and Soto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2009</xref>). The impacts of temperature and increase in extreme weather events on fish growth are examples of direct effects. Indirect effects include increased risks for diseases or pathogen infections due to higher temperature and changes in input factors, especially those linked to resources from capture fisheries and agriculture through feeds (Troell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2014</xref>; Cao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>) and energy inputs.</p><p id="Par52">Air and water temperature, sea level change, water current, wind and waves, ice and salinity are the climatic drivers most likely to impact on aquaculture (Handisyde et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>). Changes in extremes, like storms and temperature extremes, can influence physiology (growth, reproduction and disease outbreaks), ecology (organic cycles and parasites) and farm operation (sites and technology).</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Growth and productivity</title><p id="Par53">Sea temperature directly influences metabolism and growth. Most fish have an optimal temperature for growth so deviation from this optimum will restrict growth. Salmonid have a relatively narrow range of temperature for optimal growth (Ficke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2007</xref>). Hence, present optimal conditions for open sea cage salmon farming in Norway lie between 62&#x000b0; and 64&#x000b0;N latitude. Further south, summer temperatures are higher than optimum, and further north, temperatures are too low throughout the year. Increased sea temperatures will generally move this optimum zone further north. For fish farms in colder locations than optimal, production can increase with 11&#x02013;15% per degree increase in temperature (Lorentzen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2008</xref>). For farms at optimum or higher temperatures, production will decrease. Salmon farms in the Arctic generally experience lower than optimum temperatures and will likely experience improved productivity. Species like cod and halibut have narrower temperature ranges (Imsland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2000</xref>; Levesque et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2005</xref>) but should respond in a similar way. The temperature optimum also decreases with increasing size of the fish, which further complicates the predictions of actual impacts from changes in temperature. Farmers currently operating in areas that will experience significant temperature changes can mitigate adverse effects through re-siting/re-establishing their farms in areas with temperature range closer to optimal. Production loss due to temperature changes, relocation costs, property rights, permits and existing infrastructure will influence to what extent relocations occur.</p><p id="Par54">The decrease in oxygen solubility, combined with the higher metabolic rates and oxygen consumption associated with higher temperature, may impact the carrying capacity of a site. However, the farmers plan their stocking densities according to oxygen availability at any time. Hence, locations with insufficient water exchange may have to reduce the density of fish to avoid oxygen depletion that could hamper fish growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sea level rise</title><p id="Par55">Several direct and indirect effects of climate change could result in a net sea level rise due to increased water volume at higher temperatures and melting of ice caps in, e.g., Greenland (Parry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">2007</xref>). Sea level may change between &#x02212; 20 and + 30 centimetres along the Norwegian coast although these estimates are uncertain (Simpson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2012</xref>). Sea level rise within this range is unlikely to significantly impact sea-based aquaculture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Storms</title><p id="Par56">Models predict more frequent and more intense storms in the northeast Atlantic (Leckebusch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2006</xref>; Frost et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2012</xref>), although this shift is suggested to take long time to evolve (Weisse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2005</xref>) and is uncertain. Storms can severely impact sea-based farms, while land-based facilities are less exposed. For cage farms at sea, most breakdowns occur during storms due to strong waves and icing. These damage structures and result in fish dying or escaping. Fish escaping to the wild and breeding with native populations can cause hybridization and loss of genetic diversity (Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2006</xref>). Storm patterns will likely change slowly providing sufficient time for the industry to adapt by strengthening structures (optimising for offshore farming) or moving to less exposed sites. These measures increase costs and moving may be difficult due to lack of optimal or even available sites, thus reducing productivity and profits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Diseases and parasites</title><p id="Par57">Climate predictions indicate longer and more frequent periods of extreme temperatures (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). Higher sea temperatures influence fish growth and disease. Diseases occur in most living organisms and increasingly so in farmed animals because the high biomass concentration in farms provides attractive breeding grounds for pathogens. Temperature extremes close to the fishes&#x02019; tolerance levels, combined with oxygen depletion, result in physiological stress and increased vulnerability to diseases. Changes in temperature can also change disease occurrence and spreading patterns in rather unpredictable ways (Gubbins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2006</xref>). Pathogens have often shorter generation times at higher temperatures (Duguid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">1978</xref>). Common diseases in salmon and cod aquaculture include fransicellosis, vibriosis and furunculosis, all associated with high water temperatures (Lillehaug et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2003</xref>; Samuelsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2006</xref>). These are expected to become more abundant with increased temperature and occur more frequently throughout the year. However, diseases such as winter ulcers and cold-water vibriosis are associated with low temperatures and should become less frequent with higher temperature. In addition, some parts of the immune system may function more effectively at higher temperatures and better resist infections (Le Morvan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">1996</xref>; Eggset et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">1997</xref>). Most disease outbreaks occur at extreme temperature events. The increased incidence of periods with high temperature will increase the risk of disease (Bergh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2007</xref>). Climate change may also shift the distribution of particular pathogens adapted to specific temperature ranges. Some exotic diseases may appear and others disappear.</p><p id="Par58">The occurrence and growth of parasites common in aquaculture also depend on temperature. Higher temperatures lead to a shorter generation time, higher production of parasites, and subsequent production losses and increasing mitigation costs. However, many parasites have complex life cycles, hence making it difficult to predict the actual effect from increased temperature. Different species also have different temperature ranges that they thrive within. Increasing temperature could hence result in redistributions of parasite populations. Sea lice (<italic>Lepeophtheirus salmonis</italic>), the most common salmon parasite (Boxaspen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">1997</xref>), is currently more problematic in the southern, warmer areas than in the Arctic. Sea lice spread depends on current patterns and larval stage. These are influenced by increased temperature and expected increase in freshwater runoff. The combined effects of sea lice are difficult to predict. However, infections will probably increase, resulting in higher costs for treatment, reduced productivity of farmed fish and higher infection rates among wild salmon (Bergh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Algal blooms and precipitation</title><p id="Par59">Increased precipitations will probably lower coastal water salinity, strengthen the stratification and influence nutrient concentrations. Changing zooplankton communities that graze on phytoplankton further increase system complexity and make predictions difficult (Gubbins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2006</xref>). Changes in temperature may shift algal community towards flagellates and dinoflagellates, some of which could harm farmed fish and shellfish (S&#x000e6;tre et al. 2003). Other algal groups could also grow but the resulting algal community and their dynamics are difficult to foresee.</p><p id="Par60">Increased precipitation in Norway (Bergh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2007</xref>) and the resulting increased river discharges could strengthen stratification in the fjords. The stronger freshwater stratification will result in higher temperatures in the fjords and the increased runoff will increase surface currents. Increased land runoffs will trigger higher nutrient discharges. However, direct impacts from changes in precipitation are likely to be small: smolt production may benefit from increased rainfall, which improves freshwater supply from rivers in May/June. The indirect effect on water temperature will exacerbate the effects described earlier. Overall the farms should directly benefit from the provision of oxygenated water and waste product removal from the cages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ocean acidification</title><p id="Par61">The rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide content is expected to lower oceanic pH by 0.3 to 0.5 and carbonate saturation by about 45% (IPCC 2007; Andersson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2008</xref>). Fish are well adapted to changes in ocean acidity, so direct impacts will be small for this species group, while indirect ecosystem impacts could affect fish food (see below, Callaway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). Lower pH will mainly impact on organisms with calcium shells or skeleton, hence all farmed shellfish species particularly during their early life stages (Allison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>; Callaway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). Shellfish culture is a marginal share of current Arctic aquaculture so the socioeconomic impacts should be small, except for future potential expansion of shellfish farming&#x02014;in the Arctic and elsewhere (Allison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Feed resources</title><p id="Par62">Aquaculture is increasingly connected to global resource systems through feed resources: smaller pelagic species are major ingredients to produce fishmeal and fish oil for fish feed (Klinger and Naylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2012</xref>; Cao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>). Arctic fishing fleets increasingly target Arctic pelagic species for human consumption instead of fish meal and oil production, for example, the Norwegian spring spawning herring, the capelin in the Barents Sea and in Icelandic and Greenland waters. Climate change could indirectly influence aquaculture if it affects important inputs for aquafeeds like the Peruvian anchoveta (<italic>Engraulis ringens</italic>) that dominates global fishmeal and fish oil production. Most aquaculture species (fish and crustaceans) increasingly feed on terrestrial crops instead of feed from the sea (Troell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2014</xref>), which further increases the vulnerability to climatic effects on land far away from the actual farming areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Management, opportunities and adaptation</title><p id="Par63">In the Arctic, the minimum water temperature for economically sustainable farming may limit the available area for farming.

Along the southern coast of Alaska, shellfish and aquatic plants dominate farming but with limited production (sales value of about 400 000 USD in 2010).

Both these species have a higher temperature preference than salmon and are likely to be farmed in the Arctic in the future.

Most economic models have focused on the impacts on aquaculture related to increased temperature.

Alternative development scenarios for Norwegian salmonid culture with and without warming highlight a positive effect on fish growth from increased water temperature. Sales prices could, however, decrease due to an expected increase in overall Norwegian salmon production (Lorentzen and Hanneson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2005</xref>). Increased temperature resulted, in all modelled cases, in higher slaughter weight and more frequent optimal harvest timing (Lorentzen and Hannesson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2006</xref>; Steinshamn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2009</xref>). Legal requirement currently limits potential production sites in Norway and thus forces adaptation on site to climate change effects. A license is typically granted for one region and cannot be transferred to any of the other four regions in place for aquaculture management. Model predictions also show a significant improvement in productivity for the northern farms and vice versa for the farms furthest south and a corresponding northward shift in production if the restrictions are lifted (Hermansen and Heen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions: an outlook for future arctic seafood production</title><p id="Par67">Current Arctic fisheries mainly operate in the Northeast Atlantic, with some fishing, whaling and sealing activities in the Northwest Atlantic.

The management regimes for fisheries seem relatively robust, despite some tensions in the wake of re-distributed fish stocks. These tensions can, however, put great pressure on existing regulatory regimes, especially when quota distribution depends on historical rights and the fish distribution turns out differently in the fishing right zones of the coastal nations. Norway is by far the dominant aquaculture producer in the Arctic. Salmon production in this region provides important employment opportunities even though the emergent farming structure relies less on local employments.</p><p id="Par68">The climate-induced temperature rise on the Norwegian coasts is likely to range between 0.5&#x000b0; and 2.5&#x000b0; and play out differently during different seasons. Despite large uncertainties, and just a few detailed studies that specifically target climate change impacts on Arctic aquaculture, the direct effects of a temperature change on the aquaculture industry can be modelled with fairly good accuracy, including effects on fish growth and impacts on the whole industry. These models indicate positive effects from warming water temperatures on Arctic aquaculture. Direct effects related to storm frequencies and intensities can be relatively well anticipated, but with high uncertainty. Other indirect effects, such as diseases and pest species and freshwater runoff, are much harder to predict. However, it is certain that the environmental conditions will change and that the industry will have to adapt to these changes. For enabling the industry to do so, there is a need to look over existing regulatory frameworks and start a multi-stakeholder dialogue to find out where and how aquaculture operations can move or change their operations. As the Arctic Region is undergoing multiple changes, involving changes in economic conditions and large-scale environmental changes, the different ways that aquaculture in the Arctic can adapt will be linked to the overall changes occurring in the region.
