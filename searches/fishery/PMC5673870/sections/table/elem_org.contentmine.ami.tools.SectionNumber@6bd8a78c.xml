    <td align="left" colspan="2">Food production and food security in the Arctic is complex and does not only encompass production and local people’s access to nutrition (The Alaskan Inuit Food Security Conceptual Framework, Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska (ICC-AK) 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" href="#CR109">2015</a>). Ongoing and emerging climate change also poses a threat to existing food systems and food security by affecting indigenous peoples’ access to wildlife (Gunn et al. 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110" href="#CR110">2006</a>; Tesar 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111" href="#CR111">2007</a>; Heleniak 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2014</a>). For example, climate change alters migratory patterns of Arctic animals and i.e. Inuit hunters are struggling to adapt. Thus, the implications for traditional hunting, fishing, and gathering activities will have crucial local economic and dietary importance, and impact on social and cultural identities (Nuttall et al. 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112" href="#CR112">2005</a>). Imported foods have increasingly replaced local foods (Kuhnlein 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113" href="#CR113">1992</a>; Wein and Freeman 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114" href="#CR114">1992</a>) resulting in higher frequency of obesity, diabetes and heart diseases from increased intake of carbohydrates and saturated fats (Blanchet et al. 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" href="#CR115">2000</a>; Kuhnlein et al. 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116" href="#CR116">2000</a>; Van Oost dam et al. 2005). In addition, marine mammals such as beluga and seals contain higher levels of contaminants, which impacts severely on indigenous peoples’ health. The relation with climate change is uncertain (NCP 2013). Warming may also increase opportunities for local food production in some regions as growing periods becomes more favourable. This means that conditions for crops and livestock farming will improve. A longer open-water season will make transportation more viable throughout the year, something that may reduce costs for local agriculture production inputs like e.g. seeds, fertilizers, fuel, etc. (IPCC 2001). Poor soil, unpredictable climate, and supply costs will still remain a challenge for the growth of the Arctic agricultural sector. In addition, although climate change resulted in warmer summers, they are also drier with potential negative implications for growth. Emergence of new shipping routes resulting from changed ice conditions may also influence Arctic people in multiple ways, however, resulting impacts on e.g. the fishing sector is difficult to foresee.

     <span class="break"/>Photo: Hunting and gathering have historically been the primary methods of supplying food for many local coastal communities in the Arctic. Climate change has influenced migratory patterns of Arctic animals forcing Inuit hunters to adapt. This adaptation has costs in the form of time, money and increased risks.
