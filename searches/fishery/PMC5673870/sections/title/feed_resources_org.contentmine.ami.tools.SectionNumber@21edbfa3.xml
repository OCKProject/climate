 <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aquaculture is increasingly connected to global resource systems through feed resources: smaller pelagic species are major ingredients to produce fishmeal and fish oil for fish feed (Klinger and Naylor

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2015</a>). Arctic fishing fleets increasingly target Arctic pelagic species for human consumption instead of fish meal and oil production, for example, the Norwegian spring spawning herring, the capelin in the Barents Sea and in Icelandic and Greenland waters. Climate change could indirectly influence aquaculture if it affects important inputs for aquafeeds like the Peruvian anchoveta (

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2014</a>), which further increases the vulnerability to climatic effects on land far away from the actual farming areas.
