 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several direct and indirect effects of climate change could result in a net sea level rise due to increased water volume at higher temperatures and melting of ice caps in, e.g., Greenland (Parry et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" href="#CR200">2007</a>). Sea level may change between âˆ’ 20 and + 30 centimetres along the Norwegian coast although these estimates are uncertain (Simpson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">2012</a>). Sea level rise within this range is unlikely to significantly impact sea-based aquaculture.
