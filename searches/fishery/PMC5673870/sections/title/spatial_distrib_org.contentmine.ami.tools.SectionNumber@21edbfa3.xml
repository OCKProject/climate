 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change can affect the main drivers causing distributional changes in the productivity of an ecosystem (Brander 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2010</a>). Natural fluctuations in the physical and biological environment strongly affect sub-Arctic marine fish populations (Dippner and Ottersen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2001</a>; Godø 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2003</a>). However, since today’s climate models do not include scenarios on ocean temperatures, water mass mixing and upwelling, which fisheries typically depend upon (through primary and secondary production), predictions regarding future fisheries’ response to climate change are of tentative nature (Vílhjálmsson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historically (17th and 18th century) claimed increased catches were associated with increased temperatures (Lajus et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2005</a>). More specifically, ocean temperature seems correlated with cod stock recruitment and growth (Dippner and Ottersen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2001</a>), suggesting that large-scale atmospheric variability seems to affect recruitment and growth in the Barents Sea ecosystem (Ottersen and Stenseth 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">2001</a>). Warmer periods seem to favour northern cod populations but at the same time stress southern populations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While increased temperatures may lead to more northern distribution of cod stocks in the sub-Arctic (Drinkwater 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2005</a>), fishing activities have earlier also affected the distribution of cod stocks (Engelhard et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2013</a>). Depth may be a constraining factor for benthic species, preventing a further northern expansion north and west of Svalbard (Eide 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2014</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2016</a>; Fossheim et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2015</a>). However, it is not necessarily a constraining factor for pelagic species. Spatial distribution of capelin tends to follow environmental changes, and a spread northward in the Barents Sea area is probably a response to recent increase in temperature and reduced ice cover (Ingvaldsen and Gjøsæter 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2013</a>). Changes in the spatial distribution of capelin may change its condition and fat content due to distributional patterns of zooplankton communities (Orlova et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2010</a>). The overall ecosystem consequences from this are complex and difficult to predict at large scale.
 </p>
 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Christiansen et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2014</a>) point to the potential degradation of Arctic species and ecosystems due to inevitable bycatch and bottom trawling harming the seabed, as the ice retracts and commercial fish and fisheries displace polewards. These understudied species are particularly dependent on a precautionary approach in fisheries management practices, since uncertainty levels are high and so also the risk for stocks to collapse. However, according to Vílhjálmsson et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2005</a>) it is likely that a moderate warming will improve the conditions for the most important fish stocks in the Arctic, like cod and herring, but it will also contribute to a very different species composition in some ecosystems. Hence, commercial fisheries must be adjusted, which might call for renewed fisheries negotiations for fishing rights and TACs (total allowable catch) among coastal states. As a consequence, the effect of climate change on fish stocks might originate to a larger extent from policies and their enforcements than from climate warming itself if it is moderate.
 </p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperatures may not be the main explanatory factor for changes in the distribution of pelagic fish populations in the Arctic (Pacariz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2016</a>). A case study of the North-eastern Atlantic mackerel stock concludes that seafloor topography, ocean currents and nutrient limitations are other important explanatory factors for pelagic species. Ocean currents and nutrient densities are closely connected to the topography of the seafloor, which is not affected by climate change. Hence, climate-induced spatial changes of fish stocks and ecosystem may be less than expected when focusing only on temperature. For benthic species like the Northeast Arctic cod stock, centres of gravity of monthly spatial distributions of biomasses do not seem to change significantly due to climate change in the next 50 years (Eide 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2016</a>).
