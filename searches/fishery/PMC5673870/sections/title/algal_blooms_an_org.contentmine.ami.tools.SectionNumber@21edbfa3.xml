 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increased precipitations will probably lower coastal water salinity, strengthen the stratification and influence nutrient concentrations. Changing zooplankton communities that graze on phytoplankton further increase system complexity and make predictions difficult (Gubbins 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2006</a>). Changes in temperature may shift algal community towards flagellates and dinoflagellates, some of which could harm farmed fish and shellfish (SÃ¦tre et al. 2003). Other algal groups could also grow but the resulting algal community and their dynamics are difficult to foresee.

 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increased precipitation in Norway (Bergh et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">2007</a>) and the resulting increased river discharges could strengthen stratification in the fjords. The stronger freshwater stratification will result in higher temperatures in the fjords and the increased runoff will increase surface currents. Increased land runoffs will trigger higher nutrient discharges. However, direct impacts from changes in precipitation are likely to be small: smolt production may benefit from increased rainfall, which improves freshwater supply from rivers in May/June. The indirect effect on water temperature will exacerbate the effects described earlier. Overall the farms should directly benefit from the provision of oxygenated water and waste product removal from the cages.
