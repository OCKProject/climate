 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The world oceans have absorbed approximately 30% of the atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> deriving from human activities, leading to reduced pH values in ocean water but regional differences are substantial (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2014</a>). Acidification therefore represents a concern but knowledge about biological and environmental impacts is poor at this stage (Bates and Mathis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2009</a>; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2014</a>). Climate change is expected to increase intensity and frequency of storms in some ocean areas. It is however not certain that this represents a significant change or may be explained within the long-term patterns of variability (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2014</a>).
