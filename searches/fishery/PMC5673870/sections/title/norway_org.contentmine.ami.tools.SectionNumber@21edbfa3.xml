 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Norway is the world’s largest producer of Atlantic salmon and also has a significant production of rainbow trout and a smaller production of several other marine and freshwater species. A considerable part of this production takes place in the Arctic region. Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> illustrates production data from the northernmost three counties. In 2014, salmon constituted 98% of the total value (2200 million USD) and trout constituted 1.5%. The southernmost county of the three, Nordland, is the dominating producer.

 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salmon farming was introduced in the Norwegian Arctic around 1970 and grew rapidly after 1994. Salmon dominated during the whole period and the value of production accelerated after 2000. Other species were introduced, but have not experienced the same growth as salmon despite considerable research and development investments for farming halibut and cod for example. Halibut was primarily in focus during the early 1990s and cod in focus during the latest part of 1990s. Arctic charr was early in 1900 a pioneering aquaculture species in Norway, but farming north of the Arctic Circle developed first during the 1980s (Sæther et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">2016</a>). Farming of blue mussels was rather unsuccessful too due to toxic algae, among other reasons (Winther et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2010</a>).
