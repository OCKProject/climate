 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Arctic, the minimum water temperature for economically sustainable farming may limit the available area for farming. Temperature increase will increase this area for species not reaching the upper temperature bound. Higher water temperature would make more ice-free sites available, a necessity for cage farming. With increased water temperature, new species with higher temperature optima could be introduced. Species farmed in sub-Arctic areas could indicate possible future Arctic farming species and volumes. Along the southern coast of Alaska, shellfish and aquatic plants dominate farming but with limited production (sales value of about 400 000 USD in 2010). Small farming volumes could expand into the current Arctic. However, Alaska has banned finfish farming. Lifting this ban could trigger the introduction of fish farms in the current farming areas and into the Arctic.</p>
 <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Canada, Atlantic salmon is the main species at USD 192 million in 2014 (FAO 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2016</a>), but some shellfish culture occurs in the northern parts of Quebec and Newfoundland. The industry will likely expand northwards. However, reaching as far as the current Arctic requires relatively large increases in temperature.

 <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Iceland has no close “neighbours” that can inform future potential aquaculture species expansion. The Norwegian and Russian Arctic are likely to follow the current activities in the remaining part of Norway, focusing mainly on salmon. Norway hosts a considerably higher production of rainbow trout in the south and more Atlantic halibut (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Both these species have a higher temperature preference than salmon and are likely to be farmed in the Arctic in the future. Oysters like the European oyster (
  <span class="italic">Ostrea edulis</span>) and scallops (
  <span class="italic">Pecten maximus</span>) are primarily grown in warmer waters and the anticipated warming may not be sufficient to bring temperatures in the Arctic to comparable levels.
