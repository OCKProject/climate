 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Abiotic environmental conditions like water temperature, salinity, oxygen content and water quality (Mydlarz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2006</a>) and physical processes associated with waves, currents, tides, ice and river (Troell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">2009</a>; Callaway et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2012</a>) influence aquaculture conditions. Most studies of climatic effects on aquaculture discard indirect effects that potentially can impact aquaculture, e.g. changes in agriculture production, financial markets, demographic structures and capture fisheries (Handisyde et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2006</a>; Cochrane et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2009</a>). However, the impacts of environmental changes on aquaculture often result from a chain of effects, hence making it difficult to identify clear causative links (De Silva and Soto 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2009</a>). The impacts of temperature and increase in extreme weather events on fish growth are examples of direct effects. Indirect effects include increased risks for diseases or pathogen infections due to higher temperature and changes in input factors, especially those linked to resources from capture fisheries and agriculture through feeds (Troell et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2014</a>; Cao et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2015</a>) and energy inputs.
 </p>
 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air and water temperature, sea level change, water current, wind and waves, ice and salinity are the climatic drivers most likely to impact on aquaculture (Handisyde et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2006</a>). Changes in extremes, like storms and temperature extremes, can influence physiology (growth, reproduction and disease outbreaks), ecology (organic cycles and parasites) and farm operation (sites and technology).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Growth and productivity</div>
  <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea temperature directly influences metabolism and growth. Most fish have an optimal temperature for growth so deviation from this optimum will restrict growth. Salmonid have a relatively narrow range of temperature for optimal growth (Ficke et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2007</a>). Hence, present optimal conditions for open sea cage salmon farming in Norway lie between 62° and 64°N latitude. Further south, summer temperatures are higher than optimum, and further north, temperatures are too low throughout the year. Increased sea temperatures will generally move this optimum zone further north. For fish farms in colder locations than optimal, production can increase with 11–15% per degree increase in temperature (Lorentzen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">2008</a>). For farms at optimum or higher temperatures, production will decrease. Salmon farms in the Arctic generally experience lower than optimum temperatures and will likely experience improved productivity. Species like cod and halibut have narrower temperature ranges (Imsland et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2000</a>; Levesque et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">2005</a>) but should respond in a similar way. The temperature optimum also decreases with increasing size of the fish, which further complicates the predictions of actual impacts from changes in temperature. Farmers currently operating in areas that will experience significant temperature changes can mitigate adverse effects through re-siting/re-establishing their farms in areas with temperature range closer to optimal. Production loss due to temperature changes, relocation costs, property rights, permits and existing infrastructure will influence to what extent relocations occur.
  </p>
  <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The decrease in oxygen solubility, combined with the higher metabolic rates and oxygen consumption associated with higher temperature, may impact the carrying capacity of a site. However, the farmers plan their stocking densities according to oxygen availability at any time. Hence, locations with insufficient water exchange may have to reduce the density of fish to avoid oxygen depletion that could hamper fish growth.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea level rise</div>
  <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several direct and indirect effects of climate change could result in a net sea level rise due to increased water volume at higher temperatures and melting of ice caps in, e.g., Greenland (Parry et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" href="#CR200">2007</a>). Sea level may change between − 20 and + 30 centimetres along the Norwegian coast although these estimates are uncertain (Simpson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">2012</a>). Sea level rise within this range is unlikely to significantly impact sea-based aquaculture.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Storms</div>
  <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Models predict more frequent and more intense storms in the northeast Atlantic (Leckebusch et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2006</a>; Frost et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">2012</a>), although this shift is suggested to take long time to evolve (Weisse et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">2005</a>) and is uncertain. Storms can severely impact sea-based farms, while land-based facilities are less exposed. For cage farms at sea, most breakdowns occur during storms due to strong waves and icing. These damage structures and result in fish dying or escaping. Fish escaping to the wild and breeding with native populations can cause hybridization and loss of genetic diversity (Walker et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">2006</a>). Storm patterns will likely change slowly providing sufficient time for the industry to adapt by strengthening structures (optimising for offshore farming) or moving to less exposed sites. These measures increase costs and moving may be difficult due to lack of optimal or even available sites, thus reducing productivity and profits.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diseases and parasites</div>
  <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate predictions indicate longer and more frequent periods of extreme temperatures (IPCC 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2013</a>). Higher sea temperatures influence fish growth and disease. Diseases occur in most living organisms and increasingly so in farmed animals because the high biomass concentration in farms provides attractive breeding grounds for pathogens. Temperature extremes close to the fishes’ tolerance levels, combined with oxygen depletion, result in physiological stress and increased vulnerability to diseases. Changes in temperature can also change disease occurrence and spreading patterns in rather unpredictable ways (Gubbins 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2006</a>). Pathogens have often shorter generation times at higher temperatures (Duguid et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">1978</a>). Common diseases in salmon and cod aquaculture include fransicellosis, vibriosis and furunculosis, all associated with high water temperatures (Lillehaug et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">2003</a>; Samuelsen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">2006</a>). These are expected to become more abundant with increased temperature and occur more frequently throughout the year. However, diseases such as winter ulcers and cold-water vibriosis are associated with low temperatures and should become less frequent with higher temperature. In addition, some parts of the immune system may function more effectively at higher temperatures and better resist infections (Le Morvan et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">1996</a>; Eggset et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">1997</a>). Most disease outbreaks occur at extreme temperature events. The increased incidence of periods with high temperature will increase the risk of disease (Bergh et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">2007</a>). Climate change may also shift the distribution of particular pathogens adapted to specific temperature ranges. Some exotic diseases may appear and others disappear.
  </p>
  <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The occurrence and growth of parasites common in aquaculture also depend on temperature. Higher temperatures lead to a shorter generation time, higher production of parasites, and subsequent production losses and increasing mitigation costs. However, many parasites have complex life cycles, hence making it difficult to predict the actual effect from increased temperature. Different species also have different temperature ranges that they thrive within. Increasing temperature could hence result in redistributions of parasite populations. Sea lice (
   <span class="italic">Lepeophtheirus salmonis</span>), the most common salmon parasite (Boxaspen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">1997</a>), is currently more problematic in the southern, warmer areas than in the Arctic. Sea lice spread depends on current patterns and larval stage. These are influenced by increased temperature and expected increase in freshwater runoff. The combined effects of sea lice are difficult to predict. However, infections will probably increase, resulting in higher costs for treatment, reduced productivity of farmed fish and higher infection rates among wild salmon (Bergh et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">2007</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Algal blooms and precipitation</div>
  <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increased precipitations will probably lower coastal water salinity, strengthen the stratification and influence nutrient concentrations. Changing zooplankton communities that graze on phytoplankton further increase system complexity and make predictions difficult (Gubbins 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2006</a>). Changes in temperature may shift algal community towards flagellates and dinoflagellates, some of which could harm farmed fish and shellfish (Sætre et al. 2003). Other algal groups could also grow but the resulting algal community and their dynamics are difficult to foresee.
  </p>
  <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increased precipitation in Norway (Bergh et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">2007</a>) and the resulting increased river discharges could strengthen stratification in the fjords. The stronger freshwater stratification will result in higher temperatures in the fjords and the increased runoff will increase surface currents. Increased land runoffs will trigger higher nutrient discharges. However, direct impacts from changes in precipitation are likely to be small: smolt production may benefit from increased rainfall, which improves freshwater supply from rivers in May/June. The indirect effect on water temperature will exacerbate the effects described earlier. Overall the farms should directly benefit from the provision of oxygenated water and waste product removal from the cages.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean acidification</div>
  <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide content is expected to lower oceanic pH by 0.3 to 0.5 and carbonate saturation by about 45% (IPCC 2007; Andersson et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">2008</a>). Fish are well adapted to changes in ocean acidity, so direct impacts will be small for this species group, while indirect ecosystem impacts could affect fish food (see below, Callaway et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2012</a>). Lower pH will mainly impact on organisms with calcium shells or skeleton, hence all farmed shellfish species particularly during their early life stages (Allison et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2011</a>; Callaway et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2012</a>). Shellfish culture is a marginal share of current Arctic aquaculture so the socioeconomic impacts should be small, except for future potential expansion of shellfish farming—in the Arctic and elsewhere (Allison et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2011</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feed resources</div>
  <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aquaculture is increasingly connected to global resource systems through feed resources: smaller pelagic species are major ingredients to produce fishmeal and fish oil for fish feed (Klinger and Naylor 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2012</a>; Cao et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2015</a>). Arctic fishing fleets increasingly target Arctic pelagic species for human consumption instead of fish meal and oil production, for example, the Norwegian spring spawning herring, the capelin in the Barents Sea and in Icelandic and Greenland waters. Climate change could indirectly influence aquaculture if it affects important inputs for aquafeeds like the Peruvian anchoveta (
   <span class="italic">Engraulis ringens</span>) that dominates global fishmeal and fish oil production. Most aquaculture species (fish and crustaceans) increasingly feed on terrestrial crops instead of feed from the sea (Troell et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2014</a>), which further increases the vulnerability to climatic effects on land far away from the actual farming areas.

  <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Arctic, the minimum water temperature for economically sustainable farming may limit the available area for farming. Temperature increase will increase this area for species not reaching the upper temperature bound. Higher water temperature would make more ice-free sites available, a necessity for cage farming. With increased water temperature, new species with higher temperature optima could be introduced. Species farmed in sub-Arctic areas could indicate possible future Arctic farming species and volumes. Along the southern coast of Alaska, shellfish and aquatic plants dominate farming but with limited production (sales value of about 400 000 USD in 2010). Small farming volumes could expand into the current Arctic. However, Alaska has banned finfish farming. Lifting this ban could trigger the introduction of fish farms in the current farming areas and into the Arctic.</p>
  <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Canada, Atlantic salmon is the main species at USD 192 million in 2014 (FAO 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2016</a>), but some shellfish culture occurs in the northern parts of Quebec and Newfoundland. The industry will likely expand northwards. However, reaching as far as the current Arctic requires relatively large increases in temperature.
  </p>
  <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Iceland has no close “neighbours” that can inform future potential aquaculture species expansion. The Norwegian and Russian Arctic are likely to follow the current activities in the remaining part of Norway, focusing mainly on salmon. Norway hosts a considerably higher production of rainbow trout in the south and more Atlantic halibut (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Both these species have a higher temperature preference than salmon and are likely to be farmed in the Arctic in the future. Oysters like the European oyster (
   <span class="italic">Ostrea edulis</span>) and scallops (
   <span class="italic">Pecten maximus</span>) are primarily grown in warmer waters and the anticipated warming may not be sufficient to bring temperatures in the Arctic to comparable levels.

  <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Socioeconomic impacts from climate change could be significant for the aquaculture sector. However, these effects are also linked with changes in other economic sectors in the Arctic, and in the rest of the world so it is difficult to foresee how the overall effects will play out (Crépin et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2017</a>). Most economic models have focused on the impacts on aquaculture related to increased temperature. Some advanced models target salmon aquaculture in Norway (Lorentzen and Hanneson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">2005</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">2006</a>; Lorentzen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">2008</a> and Steinshamn 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">2009</a>). Alternative development scenarios for Norwegian salmonid culture with and without warming highlight a positive effect on fish growth from increased water temperature. Sales prices could, however, decrease due to an expected increase in overall Norwegian salmon production (Lorentzen and Hanneson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">2005</a>). Increased temperature resulted, in all modelled cases, in higher slaughter weight and more frequent optimal harvest timing (Lorentzen and Hannesson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">2006</a>; Steinshamn 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">2009</a>). Legal requirement currently limits potential production sites in Norway and thus forces adaptation on site to climate change effects. A license is typically granted for one region and cannot be transferred to any of the other four regions in place for aquaculture management. Model predictions also show a significant improvement in productivity for the northern farms and vice versa for the farms furthest south and a corresponding northward shift in production if the restrictions are lifted (Hermansen and Heen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" href="#CR108">2012</a>).
