 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide content is expected to lower oceanic pH by 0.3 to 0.5 and carbonate saturation by about 45% (IPCC 2007; Andersson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">2008</a>). Fish are well adapted to changes in ocean acidity, so direct impacts will be small for this species group, while indirect ecosystem impacts could affect fish food (see below, Callaway et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2012</a>). Lower pH will mainly impact on organisms with calcium shells or skeleton, hence all farmed shellfish species particularly during their early life stages (Allison et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2011</a>; Callaway et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2012</a>). Shellfish culture is a marginal share of current Arctic aquaculture so the socioeconomic impacts should be small, except for future potential expansion of shellfish farmingâ€”in the Arctic and elsewhere (Allison et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2011</a>).
