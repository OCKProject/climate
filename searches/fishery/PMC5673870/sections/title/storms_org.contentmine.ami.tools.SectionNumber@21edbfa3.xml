 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Models predict more frequent and more intense storms in the northeast Atlantic (Leckebusch et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2006</a>; Frost et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">2012</a>), although this shift is suggested to take long time to evolve (Weisse et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">2005</a>) and is uncertain. Storms can severely impact sea-based farms, while land-based facilities are less exposed. For cage farms at sea, most breakdowns occur during storms due to strong waves and icing. These damage structures and result in fish dying or escaping. Fish escaping to the wild and breeding with native populations can cause hybridization and loss of genetic diversity (Walker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">2006</a>). Storm patterns will likely change slowly providing sufficient time for the industry to adapt by strengthening structures (optimising for offshore farming) or moving to less exposed sites. These measures increase costs and moving may be difficult due to lack of optimal or even available sites, thus reducing productivity and profits.
