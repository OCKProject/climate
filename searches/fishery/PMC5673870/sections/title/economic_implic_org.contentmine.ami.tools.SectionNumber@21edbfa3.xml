 <p id="Par66" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Socioeconomic impacts from climate change could be significant for the aquaculture sector. However, these effects are also linked with changes in other economic sectors in the Arctic, and in the rest of the world so it is difficult to foresee how the overall effects will play out (Cr√©pin et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2017</a>). Most economic models have focused on the impacts on aquaculture related to increased temperature. Some advanced models target salmon aquaculture in Norway (Lorentzen and Hanneson

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">2006</a>; Lorentzen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">2008</a> and Steinshamn 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">2009</a>). Alternative development scenarios for Norwegian salmonid culture with and without warming highlight a positive effect on fish growth from increased water temperature. Sales prices could, however, decrease due to an expected increase in overall Norwegian salmon production (Lorentzen and Hanneson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" href="#CR105">2005</a>). Increased temperature resulted, in all modelled cases, in higher slaughter weight and more frequent optimal harvest timing (Lorentzen and Hannesson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" href="#CR106">2006</a>; Steinshamn 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" href="#CR107">2009</a>). Legal requirement currently limits potential production sites in Norway and thus forces adaptation on site to climate change effects. A license is typically granted for one region and cannot be transferred to any of the other four regions in place for aquaculture management. Model predictions also show a significant improvement in productivity for the northern farms and vice versa for the farms furthest south and a corresponding northward shift in production if the restrictions are lifted (Hermansen and Heen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" href="#CR108">2012</a>).
