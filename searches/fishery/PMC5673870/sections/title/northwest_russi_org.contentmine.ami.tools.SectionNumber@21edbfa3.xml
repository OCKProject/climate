 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Northwest Russian fishing fleet is more homogeneous than other Arctic fishery nations. Under the Soviet era, industrialisation and large-scale operations led to a focus on large trawlers supplying large seafood processing units on land. Also, with limited fish resources near the coast, a coastal fleet never developed in Northwest Russia (like it did in Norway, Iceland and Greenland). The industrial fleet is located mainly in the Murmansk and also in Arkhangelsk Oblast. Murmansk Regional Government (MRG 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2015</a>) reports the Murmansk industrial fishing fleet to have 207 vessels, including 11 extra-large vessels, 11 large vessels, 117 medium-sized vessels and 68 small vessels.
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4" href="#Fn4">4</a> In addition, there are about 100 vessels of different types active in coastal fisheries
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5" href="#Fn5">5</a> responsible for landing about 22 000 tonnes of seafood—about 3% of total landings in Murmansk region in 2013 (i.e. 700 000 tonnes; MRG 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2015</a>) compared to approximately 450 vessels 10 years ago (Vilhjálmsson and Hoel 2004).

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Russian official catch statistics
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6" href="#Fn6">6</a> report a total Russian marine capture of 4 million tonnes in 2013, of which 25% (1 million tonnes) were caught in the Northeast Atlantic, 83% of which were caught in Arctic areas (834 000 tonnes).
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7" href="#Fn7">7</a> Cod was the most important species (41% of landings from Arctic areas), and other species were haddock (18%), herring (14%), mackerel (9%) and capelin (8%). Russian landings to Russian ports peaked after 2009 after a decision to remove excessive formalities on documentation of landing operations and stop treating them as taxed imports (FAO 2012). Still today, large shares of Russian Northeast Atlantic catches are landed abroad even though the seafood processing industry in the Murmansk region processes roughly 550 000 tonnes of fish on an annual basis (Moran 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2013</a>).

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Murmansk fishery sector’s share of regional GDP is 7%, and the sector employs roughly 7800 persons (MRG 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2015</a>). Murmansk was the port in Russia with the largest catch value in 2013 (shipped fish production, with approximately 732 million €). The number of fisheries employees was 6200 in 2012, 41% less than in 2005 (Boboedova 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2014</a>). Employment in the fishery sector in the whole Russia was 59 200 in 2013.
