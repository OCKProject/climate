 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The models gave consistent advice on how to change exploitation levels to achieve certain goals for a subset of the alternative management scenarios. The models agreed that fishing mortalities on herring and sprat could be increased compared to their 2011–2013 values to achieve high profits of the pelagic fishery (‘Forage Fish Exploitation’ scenario) and the total fishery (‘Portfolio Fishery’ scenario). The latter scenario result is also in agreement with the study of [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref063">63</a>], whose reported optimal fishing mortality values of sprat and herring to achieve maximum profits of the Baltic fisheries would also represent an increase compared to 2011–2013 values. In the ‘Portfolio Fishery’ scenario, our models provided contradictory advice on the fishing mortality of cod, indicating high uncertainty in the trade-offs between the cod and clupeid fisheries. Overall model uncertainty was smallest for the ‘Forage Fish Exploitation’ scenario, as models mostly agreed that reducing the piscivore predator, cod, is necessary to maximise profits of the fisheries exploiting its prey, sprat and herring. This is consistent with what is expected from multispecies models based on first principles, as it was shown already by [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref071">71</a>]. However, [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref072">72</a>] showed that the specification of trophic relationships between a predator and its fished prey strongly influence the predator’s biomass response to both its own and its prey’s exploitation rates. In agreement with this result, the ‘Piscivore Exploitation’ scenario was the most sensitive, among the scenarios that we tested to the modelling approach used.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The expected general behavior in a multispecies system is that decreased fishing on prey contributes to maximizing profits of fleets targeting predators [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref071">71</a>]. However, there are several instances when this rule does not hold. The first mechanism is the competitive interaction among several prey species or between predator and prey. For example, in the ‘Piscivore Exploitation’ scenario, the EwE model suggests to slightly increase, instead of decrease the F of herring, related to competition between herring and sprat for pelagic food or between herring and cod for benthic food. A second mechanism, not implemented in any of the models presented here, is the predation of prey on predator’s eggs, as is, to some extent, the case in the Baltic Sea [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref073">73</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref074">74</a>]. If sprat and herring predation on cod eggs was considered, then fishing mortality rates of clupeids in the ‘Piscivore Exploitation’ scenario would need to ensure enough food for cod, while keeping predation on cod eggs low. Third, growth rate of the predator may not be impacted by the availability of forage fish, e.g. if alternative food sources are present [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref075">75</a>]. In this case the exploitation level of forage fish is not influential on predator yields and profits, as implied by the Gadget model here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The example of the ‘Piscivore Exploitation’ scenario shows that analysing model advice for extreme management scenarios before using them to evaluate and advise on more realistic and complex scenarios, could help in identifying the sources of major differences among models. Conducting such an analysis would also indicate the scenarios for which simpler models could reliably provide ecosystem advice without the need to involve more complex models that are more data-hungry, costly, and time-consuming to run and validate.</p>
