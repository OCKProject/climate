 <div class="title">Required increases (upward arrows, red tiles), decreases (downward arrows, blue tiles) by 10–20% (small arrows) or more (large arrows), or no change (hyphen, beige tiles) compared to Status Quo Fs to achieve objectives of each management scenario according to each model (A-C) and combined (D).</div>
 <p>Lighter tiles indicate uncertainty in advice. In (A) they indicate cases when the advice provided by EwE on F was sensitive to the environmental scenario. In (D) light tiles indicate model differences in the combined information from (A)-(C). White tiles (question mark) represent cases when the model does not inform about Fs maximizing scenario objectives (B) or completely contradictory information from the model ensemble (D). BSAP indicates ‘Baltic Sea Action Plan’, BAU ‘Business-As-Usual’, HSE ‘high seal growth’ and LSE ‘low seal growth’ scenarios. ‘Other’ in (A) refers to all other scenario combinations except of BAU-LSE.</p>
