 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There has been an increasing interest in ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) in recent years. EBFM is defined as a set of principles for managing fisheries as parts of complex socio-ecological systems [

  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref002">2</a>]. It is recognized within the scientific community that ecosystem models, which describe a broader ecological context than single-species models, have a potential role to support EBFM [

  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref012">12</a>]. Several suggestions on the operational use of ecosystem models in fisheries management have been made. For example, to test environmental harvest control rules under a range of environmental conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref013">13</a>], to contribute to Integrated Ecosystem Assessments by developing performance metrics in line with management objectives [

  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref015">15</a>], to identify tipping points [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref016">16</a>] and to provide input for decision support tools, such as quantitative estimates of the expected costs and benefits of alternative management actions [

  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref017">17</a>]. Ecosystem models have already been used for management in some cases, e.g. for the evaluation of the North Sea multi-annual management plan for demersal stocks ([

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fisheries-focused ecosystem models are simplifications of very complex socio-ecological systems. Many types of modelling approaches (e.g. statistical multispecies models, process-based food web models) emphasize diverse ecological characteristics of the system and populations (biomass, size distribution, age distribution) and vary in the level of detail in the representation of the socio-economic elements [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref020">20</a>]. Thus, the models often include different mathematical formulations, assumptions and a varying number of components [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref008">8</a>]. The sensitivity of model projections to the modelling approach used (model uncertainty) has been acknowledged in ecosystem modeling for decades [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref022">22</a>]. However, the methodology to tackle model uncertainty in association with management advice is not as established as the methods for other sources of uncertainty such as sampling error, natural variability, parameter uncertainty and varying functional formulations or model resolution within a particular modelling approach [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref023">23</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref030">30</a>]. In this study we focus on quantifying discrepancies in model outputs of hypothetical medium- term management scenario simulations and on deliberating on their impact on management conclusions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use simulations of the major commercial fisheries in the Baltic Sea to evaluate model agreement on management advice among three modelling approaches: Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE, [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref006">6</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref033">33</a>]) and a multispecies stock production model (MSPM, [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref034">34</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref035">35</a>]). They represent a sample of a broad array of approaches listed by [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref020">20</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref036">36</a>] to be potentially useful for EBFM for evaluating consequences of management actions and understanding ecosystem dynamics. They differ in modeling method (process-based vs. statistical), number of included components (few species to whole-ecosystem), detail in representing internal population structure (adults and juveniles to fully age-length structured) and in temporal resolution (annual to seasonal). The advantages and disadvantages of the approaches are described by [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref020">20</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref036">36</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref037">37</a>]. Evaluating model uncertainty is the attempt to understand the role of model structure in the outcome of model projections. It is an important emerging need in the application of ecosystem models for EBFM [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref038">38</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref039">39</a>] and is necessary to maximise the complementary strengths of different approaches to answer specific management questions on complex systems. Comparison of outputs produced by conceptually different models such as those applied in our study represents a challenge. For this purpose model agreement is evaluated using two indices measuring the deviation among 1) qualitative and 2) quantitative model outputs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We argue that under an EBFM context, models could be used for strategic management advice in at least two different ways. First, models can provide insight on the level of fishing pressure required to achieve certain management goals and in the case of ecosystem models this can expand to multiple species and goals beyond maximum yields (i.e., ecosystem functions and socio-economic objectives, [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref040">40</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, models may aid strategic planning by highlighting the expected long- or medium- term consequences of alternative management strategies on a large number of ecosystem features that may go beyond the traditional fishery management metrics such as fishing mortality and biomass of target fish stocks. There are a few previous studies focused on comparing the consistency of structurally different models in ranking different management scenarios. For example, [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref041">41</a>] found that model predictions were more consistent on the consequences of some management scenarios than others which is interpreted as a measure of how robust different strategies are to model uncertainty. [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref042">42</a>] simulated a set of scenarios involving the depletion of certain fish groups from their unfished biomasses using two ecosystem models and compared the predicted biomass responses of other functional groups in the food web. Similarly, [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref043">43</a>] compared the ranking of management scenarios by two ecosystem models. Scenarios in their study were defined as the fishing efforts achieving economic or ecological objectives and ranked according to catch-based and biomass-based indicators. Both studies highlighted the importance of assumed trophic structure of the ecosystem on general model behavior.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the impact of model uncertainty on the management advice (as described above) using five management scenarios, corresponding to five alternative management strategies. The strategies differed in their objectives including economic and conservation objectives. Three of the strategies tested included maximizing the profit of different fisheries compartments (i.e., pelagic versus demersal fisheries) and one of the strategies aimed at the recovery of a depleted predatory fish population. Subsequently, we investigated the medium-term performances of the alternative management scenarios in terms of indicators describing relative changes in spawning stock biomass (SSB), catch and profit compared to current levels. The design of fisheries management alternatives and the selection of indicators that describe to which extent the objectives had been achieved was carried out iteratively with stakeholders (e.g. managers, industry representatives) from Baltic Sea countries to ensure the relevance of the tested management alternatives and indicators. We recognize that changing environmental factors may modify the outcomes of fisheries management scenarios [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref005">5</a>]. Thus, we simulate the alternative fisheries management scenarios across a few distinct environmental scenarios.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To summarise, we compare ecosystem model outputs from several perspectives. First, we investigate how the F-yield relationship varies across the models. Second, we compare the multispecies Fs that maximize the objectives of alternative fishery management strategies according to each model…. Third, we quantify model agreement on the simulated outcomes of those alternative strategies and examine the reasons for disagreements among models.</p>
