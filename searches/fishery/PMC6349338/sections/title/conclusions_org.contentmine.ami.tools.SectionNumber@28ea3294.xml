 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results showcase the necessity of careful consideration when interpreting ecosystem models to inform management. An 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> selection of one model, without an understanding of its associated biases and limitations, may result in misleading conclusions. Therefore, comparison of multiple modelling approaches, as done by the climate change research community, using several Global Climate Models to generate future scenarios [

  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref089">89</a>] and conservation biologists using multiple Species Distribution Models to support conservation planning [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref090">90</a>], is necessary. There are several large-scale fisheries model intercomparison studies underway (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref091">91</a>]), mostly focusing on climate change impacts on marine ecosystems, often applying a limited range of fisheries forcing. Based on our results, we suggest that it is useful to compare model behavior under a large range of fishing pressures on each stock and their combinations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EBFM is lagging in implementation partly because of institutional inertia [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref092">92</a>], that is, institutions have historically been adjusted to provide advice that seeks to reach narrowly defined targets, such as maximum yield. When various alternative scenarios are presented, it may encourage out-of-the-box thinking, which is important for ecosystem-based scenario planning. Multimodel simulations of alternative scenarios can help to indicate which of those scenarios are robust to the choice of modelling strategy used.
