 <div class="title">Comparison of model estimates to historical data.</div>
 <p>Model estimates of spawning stock biomass (A-C) and catches (D-F) from EwE (orange squares), Gadget (blue circles) and MSPM (purple triangles) in relation to the ensemble mean spawning stock biomass (A-C) and observed catches (D-F) of cod (A, D), herring (B, E) and sprat (C, F). The solid black line of slope = 1 and intercept = 0 represents perfect correspondence. Please note that model hindcast period was different among the models (see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">Methods</a>) and therefore EwE is represented by less data points. Catches in the Gadget model are set to be equivalent to data in case of herring and sprat and for all years &lt;2004 in the case of cod (Table D in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0211320.s001" href="#pone.0211320.s001">S1 Appendix</a>, chapter 4).
