 <p>Shaded areas indicate the effect of varying the Fs of other stocks on the yield of the focal stock. Purple areas indicate the range of cumulative yields under the Business-As-Usual (BAU) and brown ones those under Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) scenario (EwE, MSPM). Light blue areas indicate the range of cumulative yields under the high seal growth rate (HSE) scenario, and orange ones those under the low seal growth (LSE) scenario (seal effect visible in Gadget but not in EwE).</p>
