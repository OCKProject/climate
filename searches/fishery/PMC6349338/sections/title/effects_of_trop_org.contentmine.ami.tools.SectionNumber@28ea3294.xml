 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interaction parameters [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref076">76</a>] and different representation of environmental influences [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref010">10</a>] are likely the most important model components causing deviations among model predictions. Although seal predation on fish stocks is represented both in EwE and Gadget, impacts of the seal population are much more pronounced in Gadget. This is probably related to thelinear positive function between and prey mortality in Gadget, while in EwE prey mortality saturates at high seal biomass (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accounting only for top-down effects of predators on prey, but not for bottom-up feedbacks, was considered sufficient by [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref077">77</a>] for the classic tactical management of most fish stocks, i.e. to define annual catch quotas. EBFM requires holistic models to highlight long term trade-offs that are relevant for strategic management advice, which may trigger bottom-up effects becoming equally relevant as top-down effects [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref078">78</a>]. The evaluated models differed in the strength of bottom-up effects of clupeids on cod. This is partly because the empirical evidence on the importance and direction of those effects at the population level is inconclusive, despite several studies investigating the issue (reviewed by [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref079">79</a>]). The clarification of this trophic link would have major implications for cod fishery management scenarios in the central Baltic Sea. In the European context, where the CFP aims at the MSY exploitation of all targeted fish in an ecosystem, we highlight the importance of model choices on the impacts of forage fish on predators. The sensitivity of predatory fish dynamics to prey exploitation levels increases with the strength of the bottom-up effects [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref080">80</a>]. Thus, our results suggest that it is necessary to couple ecological theories with empirical efforts to increase knowledge on effects of seal predation on fish stock dynamics and bottom-up effects of prey on predators to be able to provide more robust advice for EBFM.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of abiotic environmental scenarios, EwE and MSPM agreed that nutrient loads have a comparable impact on cod biomass and catches to fishing. This result is supported by the multimodel study of [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref081">81</a>] where a strong effect of nutrient management on cod was shown as well. In EwE, nutrient management also strongly affected sprat biomass, mostly via increased primary productivity in the BAU scenario. This is similar to the pattern described by [
  <a rid="pone.0211320.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211320.ref082">82</a>] based on historical data. EwE is the only model where the magnitude of abiotic effects is comparable to that of fishing on the biomass dynamics of several stocks. Thus, EwE was the only model where the required change of direction in Fs to achieve management objectives were dependent on environmental scenarios, especially in the ‘Piscivore Recovery’ management scenario. This result highlights the usefulness of complex ecosystem models, including indirect effects of various abiotic environmental pressures, to point out when advice may need to consider such effects.
