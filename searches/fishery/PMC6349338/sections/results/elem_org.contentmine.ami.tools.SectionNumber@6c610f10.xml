The models generally agree in the trends and there are no systematic large deviations between the model output and historical catch or biomass data, except the consistent underestimation of herring catches by EwE and underestimation of cod biomass by Gadget in the lower biomass range compared to the other two models.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between F and cumulative (2014–2032) yield is saturating or dome-shaped for all stocks and all models, although herring yields in EwE and sprat yields in Gadget saturate only at unrealistically high values. In most cases there is a variation in yield at a given combination of F and environmental scenario. This is due to the fact that each of these were simulated in combination with a range of F of other stocks. In EwE such variation is high for all three stocks (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211320.g004" href="#pone.0211320.g004">Fig 4A–4C</a>), which points to a large effect of food web interactions in that model. In the other two models, trophic interactions modify the yield of clupeids, but not that of cod, as there is no (Gadget) or only limited (MSPM) feedback from clupeid biomass to the cod dynamics (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selected fishing mortalities (Fs)</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a mixture of agreement and disagreement among models regarding selected Fs in the different management scenarios (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211320.g005" href="#pone.0211320.g005">Fig 5</a>). We found the largest model disagreement on the ‘Piscivore Exploitation’ scenario (
   <a rid="pone.0211320.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0211320.t002">Table 2</a>), aiming to maximize profits of the cod fishery. Although all three models agreed that under this scenario cod F needs to be decreased (except in EwE under the BSAP scenario, when it stays close to current levels), they differed in their selected Fs for clupeids. EwE suggests that the maximum profit in the cod fisheries could be achieved by decreasing F on sprat, a prey of cod which is though less preferred than herring, but more vulnerable to cod predation in the model. The EwE simulation also suggests to slightly increase herring F, which is either related to the competition between herring and cod for benthic food or between herring and sprat for pelagic food. Gadget, since it does not include any feedback of prey on predator (
   <a rid="pone.0211320.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0211320.t001">Table 1</a>), does not provide any information on which clupeid Fs are maximizing cod profits. In MSPM there is no competition between clupeids, so both prey F is decreased to increase both clupeids’ biomass, which gives more available food for cod and thus leads to reduction of cod cannibalism.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the ‘Forage Fish Exploitation’ scenario all stocks were fished at high levels in all three models. High fishing on the predator cod enabled most clupeid production to serve the fisheries. The ‘Portfolio Fishery’, a scenario aiming to maximize total fishery profits, only differs from the previous scenario in cod fishing: in EwE fishing on cod is lowered, in Gadget kept around the current level and in MSPM just slightly increased. This indicates that increasing cod Fs substantially, as in the ‘Forage Fish Exploitation’ scenario, would decrease total profits of the fishing sector overall. The ‘Piscivore Recovery’ scenario aimed at increasing the ratio of cod compared to clupeids while maintaining the latter above safe biological limits. This was generally achieved by low overall fishing levels of cod and increased fishing on clupeids. However, selected clupeid Fs were strongly dependent on environmental scenarios in EwE. Compared to the other two models the output of EwE was more sensitive to the environmental variation, as in this model relative population growth conditions of the three stocks are strongly influenced by e.g. primary productivity, hypoxia and temperature in interaction with seal predation (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211320.g006" href="#pone.0211320.g006">Fig 6A</a>) and increasing profits for pelagic trawlers (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211320.g006" href="#pone.0211320.g006">Fig 6B</a>) in all scenarios, with a few exceptions. These trends resulted in total profits of the fishery staying around the reference (average 2011–2013) values, except the ‘Portfolio Fishery’ scenario where total profits of the fishery increased (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211320.g006" href="#pone.0211320.g006">Fig 6C</a>). This is not surprising as in this scenario Fs were chosen to maximize total profits. Variability among model projections in terms of SSB’s was larger than for profits, as in some cases individual models predicted much higher SSB’s than the other two models (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211320.g006" href="#pone.0211320.g006">Fig 6D–6F</a>). Nevertheless, general trends were similar among models. Cod biomass was highest in the ‘Piscivore Recovery’ scenario, when it was fished at a low level and lowest in the ‘Forage Fish Exploitation’ scenario (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211320.g006" href="#pone.0211320.g006">Fig 6D</a>), as it was depleted to minimize its predation on herring and sprat. The ‘Status Quo’ and ‘Piscivore Exploitation’ scenarios resulted in the highest biomasses of herring (
