 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three major types of fishing gear were employed to capture blue swimming crabs in Pangkajene Kepulauan, i.e., gillnets, traps and mini trawlers. Seeing as the productivity of the gillnets was highest in contrast to the other fishing gears, the fishing gears were standardised to gillnets. On average, the CPUE for blue swimming crabs in 2013 (3.33 kg/trips) was at its highest in contrast to other years (

Meanwhile, the lowest CPUE occurred in 2014. During 2014, the CPUE fluctuated between 1.93kg/trips (January) – 4.63kg/trips (July). The average monthly CPUE for blue swimming crabs fluctuated seasonally. In total, the average monthly CPUE for blue swimming crabs was 3.27±0.79 kg/trips/month. The CPUE reached its lowest value (2.02 kg/trips) in January, whereas productivity increased and achieved its highest value (4.72 kg/trips) in July. After attaining the highest value (in July), productivity decreased until it reached its lowest value (in January).
