 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The blue swimming crab (
  <span class="italic">Portunnes pelagicus</span>) is one of the major commodities for export with regards to the Indonesian fisheries sector. In 2012, the export value of the blue swimming crab reached USD329.724 and was the third largest fisheries export product (excluding other fish) in total value, in Indonesia (

  </a>). Increases in the type, number, size and efficiency of gears have significantly increased the fishing pressure on available stocks. Additionally, stocks of the blue swimming crab have drastically reduced and the average catch size is becoming smaller, whilst fishing grounds are becoming more distant from fishing bases. Conversely, fishermen are finding it increasingly difficult to catch blue swimming crabs. In 2010, the Indonesia Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) reported that the number of fishermen at 2,1 million and the number of fishing boats at 588,390. Due to increasing in size and number of fishing boat, number of fisherman in 2014 increased to 2.74 million to operate 625,633 fishing boats (
  <a rid="b13-tlsr-29-1-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13-tlsr-29-1-1">MMAF Indonesia 2015</a>). MMAF also reported that 26% of fishing boats in 2014 were ‘unmotorised’, down from 30% in 2010. Conversely, fishing boat with inboard machine increased from 26% in 2010, to 30% in 2014.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A number of the warnings mentioned above indicate that stocks of the blue swimming crab in Indonesian waters have several problems concerning overfishing and an excess of effort capacity. In order to stop the decline, it is important to take action by implementing appropriate management mechanisms. Seeing as the environment can vary substantially over time, the population dynamics of fish populations are also dynamic seasonally. Growth rates, recruitment, natural mortality rates vary from season to season and affect the availability of fish resources (
  <a rid="b2-tlsr-29-1-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2-tlsr-29-1-1">Cochrane 2002</a>). Besides being characterised by great spatio-temporal variation, diversity of gears, diversity of target species and the scattering of fishing activity along coasts, small scale fisheries in tropical areas also consist of high uncertainty in relation to catch landings (

   <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2002
  </a>). Hence, fisheries managers require management measures to consider the impact of the seasonal variation of the population dynamics regarding fishing activity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this research, we studied the abundance and seasonal fishing seasons in the waters of Pangkajene Kepulauan, South Sulawesi. Statistics issued by the Indonesian Fisheries (
  <a rid="b11-tlsr-29-1-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11-tlsr-29-1-1">Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries 2011</a>) reported that the waters of South Sulawesi make a significant contribution (9.3%) to national blue swimming crab production and moreover, that Pangkajene Kepulauan contributes in the region of 20% to South Sulawesi. The blue swimming crabs fisheries sector is typically small scale and operates gillnets, traps and mini trawler nets in shallow waters. In 2010, from 2317 fishing boats which operated fisherman, gillnets were dominated about 48% of total fishing gear, while traps and mini trawler nets contributed 3% and 2,8%, respectively. As respons to the annual dynamic and decreasing catch, proportion of gillnets to total fishing gears (3,767 units) were decreased (about 26%) of total fishing gear in 2014, while traps and mini trawler nets were increased 7.2% and 3.0%, respectively.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this study is to define the fishing season and the abundance of blue swimming crabs in the waters of Pangkajene Kepulauan, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. More precisely, the objective is to study 1) the annual dynamics of effort, fish catch and fish productivity; 2) the seasonal dynamics related to the seasonal pattern of fishing; and 3) stocks of blue swimming crabs. We subsequently use these results to recommend management strategies for the reduction of excessive fishing efforts.</p>
