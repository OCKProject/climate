 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total fishing effort which was already standardised into gillnets showed that the allocation of fishing efforts was dynamic annually. During the 2009–2011 periods, the fishing effort increased and attained its peak number in 2011 (2826 trips/year). However, after the increasing effort did not respond with significant catches, the fishing effort tended to decrease from 2010–2015 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5-tlsr-29-1-1" href="#f5-tlsr-29-1-1">Fig. 5</a>). Conversely, catches during 2009–2015 were stable and had a tendency to decrease. The increase in catches in 2011 was expected, as a response to a dramatic increase in effort, which indicated a rise in the number of catches (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In view of the fact that the effort and catches were dynamic, productivity (CPUE) was also dynamic. Furthermore, from 2009–2015, productivity was dynamics although was inclined to decrease (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5-tlsr-29-1-1" href="#f5-tlsr-29-1-1">Fig. 5</a>). In 2009, the fishermen were able to catch roughly 1,520 ton/trips/year of fish; however, productivity decreased to 0,971 ton/trips/year in 2015.
