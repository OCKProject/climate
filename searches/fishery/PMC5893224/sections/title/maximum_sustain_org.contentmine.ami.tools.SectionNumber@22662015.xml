 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, in order to understand fish stocks, two models were selected. As a result, it was determined that the Schaefer model provides the best fit for the data. According to the Schaefer model the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is 2,099,155 kg, whereas the effort level (f
  <sub>MSY</sub>) is 2179 standard efforts. In addition, based on the MSY and f
  <sub>MSY</sub> values, using the precautionary principle (80% of MSY) the total allowable catch (TAC) for blue swimming crabs was 1.679.324 kg and the level of effort was 1.743 trips/year.
