 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The result of this study demonstrated that monthly catch and abundance (CPUE) of blue swimming crab were dynamic seasonally. The catch and abundance of blue swimming crab increased from May–July and coincided with the dry season (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1-tlsr-29-1-1" href="#t1-tlsr-29-1-1">Table 1</a>). After reaching its peak (in June) catches were inclined to decrease, until reaching the lowest amount in December. The dynamic related to catches in tropical small scale fisheries were as expected, influenced by the weather (

  </a>). Both values for catches and abundance (CPUE), which were higher in the dry season than the rainy season indicated that catches were more abundant in the dry season. During the dry season, the mixed layers of the seas surface near the coast become shallower and caused the fishing grounds to be scattered in several locations (

   <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2006
  </a>). Conversely, during the rainy season, when rainfall increases, the mixed layers of the seas surface near the coast become deeper and cause both species landing and abundance to decrease.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the result of the seasonal index analysis indicated that the fishing season, with regards to blue swimming crabs is seasonal. The fishing season for blue swimming crabs reaches its peak from May–June (during the dry season), coinciding with peak catches and abundance. Additionally, changes to the salinity of the water and temperature drives the abundance of blue swimming crab (

  <a rid="b6-tlsr-29-1-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6-tlsr-29-1-1">Juwana (2002)</a> stated that blue swimming crabs live in salinity of 11–53 ppt. Given that the monsoon season is believed to influence water circulation seasonally, the water salinity and temperature influence and drive the abundance of blue swimming crabs (

   <span class="italic">et al.</span> 1998
  </a>). During the rainy season, when the water run-off increases, salinity in the coastal water reduces; therefore, the crabs are expected to migrate to the open ocean, which consequently causes the fishing activity of the fishermen who operate small scale fishing boats to face several challenges. Conversely, during the dry season, when the water run-off decreases, the salinity of the coastal waters becomes normal, and the crabs migrate to the coastal zone. This provides fishermen with plenty of opportunities to capture the crabs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, although fish catches and fish abundance were influenced seasonally, fisherman continued their fishing strategy by operating their fishing gear throughout the year (
  <a rid="b23-tlsr-29-1-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23-tlsr-29-1-1">Wiyono 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2006
  </a>). Less variation in fishing effort allocation during the year indicates that most fishers tended to operate their fishing gears at practically the same intensity throughout the year. It is believed that the primary reason as to why fishermen operate their fishing gear throughout the year is the responsibility to meet the needs of their families (
  <a rid="b4-tlsr-29-1-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4-tlsr-29-1-1">Hilborn &amp; Walters 1992</a>; 
  <a rid="b16-tlsr-29-1-1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16-tlsr-29-1-1">Pope 2002</a>). Regarding to catch landing, depending on the fleet types, the fishermen response to the landing dynamics by different way. In short-term periods, besides reducing fishing trip during low season, the less variability of monthly fishing effort indicated that fishermen tend to change fishing ground temporally. In wet season, when fish catch reach low season, gillnet and traps fisherman waiting the good weather to operate their fishing gear by migrate to other fishing ground, while mini trawler change their fish target to capture shrimps. In long-term periods case, fisherman tend to increased their fishing boat capacity by changing their small scale fishing boat to inboard motorized medium size boats.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the Schaefer model, the result of the analysis revealed that the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level is 2,099,155 kg/year, while the effort level (f
  <sub>MSY</sub>) is 2179 standard efforts/year. By using the precautionary principle (80% 0f MSY), the total allowable catch (TAC) for blue swimming crabs was 1,679,324 kg/year and the level of effort was 1.743 trips/year. Since the fishing pressure on blue swimming crabs has increased, catch and effort were indicated by the critical point in relation to total allowable catch (TAC). It is worth noting that over the last 7 years, fishing activity exceeded the sustainable catch on 3 separate occasions (in 2009, 2011 and 2013). This appeared to be for the reason that they want to increase the amount of catches and make more money. In 2015, the fisheries sector was in a better condition; consequently, actual catches (1,676,488 kg/year) and effort (1,726 trips/year) were under the MSY. However, if compared to TAC, the catch and effort practically exceeded the TAC value (
