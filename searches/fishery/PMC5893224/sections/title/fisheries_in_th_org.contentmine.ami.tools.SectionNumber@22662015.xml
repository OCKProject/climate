 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data used in this paper are from the fisheries statistical data for Pangkajene Kepulauan from 2009–2015 and moreover, from record collector’s books from 2013–2015. The abundance of fish and annual fisheries dynamics were analysed based on fisheries statistical data, which contains reports regarding catches and effort by trips for gears annually. Prior to data analysis, the data were already separated into blue swimming crab fisheries and others. The seasonal fishing season and monthly dynamics related to the fisheries were analysed based on record collector’s books. Generally, fishermen in Pangkajene Kepulauan sell their catches to the collectors every day. Due to social relationship reasons, fishermen sell their catches to certain collectors, which provide them with an advantage.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fishing gear was a one day fishing trip operated around the Pangkajene Kepulauan coast (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1-tlsr-29-1-1" href="#f1-tlsr-29-1-1">Fig. 1</a>). The vessel’s trips and data on catches were used as the basis for the data. Data was collected from the fisherman every day, and subsequently aggregated into total catch per day. Furthermore, based on the total catch per day, data was aggregated to a monthly amount.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beside fisheries data, the study also collected data on the climatic variables as potential external factors that may influence monthly fish abundance and fishing activities by fishermen. The data were obtained from the Pangkajene dan Kepulauan Regency Statistics Office.</p>
