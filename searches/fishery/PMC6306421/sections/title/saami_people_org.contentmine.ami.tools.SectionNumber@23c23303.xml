 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The traditional settlement area is called 
  <span class="italic">Sápmi</span> (land of the Saami) in the North Saami language. The population of Saami people is estimated at 50,000–70,000 in Norway [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>], over 10,000 in Finland [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>], 20,000–35,000 in Sweden [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>••], and 2000 in Russia [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. Approximately half of the Saami speak Saami as their native language. All Saami languages are classified as endangered or highly endangered [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Traditional Saami livelihoods include reindeer herding, fishing, hunting, handicrafts (duodji), and gathering. Reindeer herding is the most viable livelihood. Many of the Saami reindeer-herding families are also involved in Saami handicrafts, fishing, and gathering. In Sweden and Norway, practically only the Saami can practice reindeer herding. At present many Saami are occupied outside traditional livelihoods and many, especially youth, have migrated to urban regions outside Sápmi [
