 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our search identified only a few studies on the secondary effects of climate change. Northern-Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) produces mild winter weather that creates difficult pasture conditions for reindeer. The NAO incidents are expected to increase in future and climate is likely to become more variable in Sápmi region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. The NAO incidents have a negative effect to the winter survival of reindeer. Based on evidence from fieldwork, the increased NAO incidents have contributed to the changes in reindeer-herding practices. Warm winters will promote the development of animal parasite outbreaks among reindeers and parasite species are moving northward [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>]. Based on available evidence, the most prominent secondary effects are increased outbreaks of animal-borne diseases, indications are that milder weather and less snow cover promote the spread of new diseases northwards [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" href="#CR75">75</a>]. Warm winters also promote the survival of geometrid moths that is one of the main drivers for vegetational change in Sápmi. Increase in precipitation increases erosion and risks for accidents.
