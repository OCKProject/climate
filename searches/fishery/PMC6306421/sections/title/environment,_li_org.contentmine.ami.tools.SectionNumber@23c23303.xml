 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditional Saami settlement area includes both sub-arctic and arctic areas with boreal forest, coastal areas, and large mountain regions with alpine vegetation. Snow covers the Sápmi area 8 months a year, and plays a central role in the climatic, ecological, and hydrological processes, and in the way of life and reindeer herding [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Saami language has a precise classification system for snow and knowledge of snow is an important part of reindeer herder’s knowledge [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Reindeer is important for Saami culturally and reindeer herding is means to maintain traditions, language, and cultural identity in changing world. Reindeer herding, as other traditional Saami livelihoods constitute important part of Saami well-being (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Currently, reindeer herding is one of the driving forces together with other herbivore on shaping the vegetation in Sápmi region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]; however, in boreal area forestry and competing land uses, such as mining, infrastructure development, and tourism affect both vegetation and reindeer herding [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. Although reindeer forage over 300 different plants in addition to fungi, ground lichen is the main forage for reindeer in winter. Lichen heaths are in heavily grazed areas and in areas where forestry and reindeer grazing coexist degraded, but there are regional differences in grazing pressure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Human activity influences the range selection of reindeer, and increase grazing pressure inside the reindeer-herding area [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], but there is also evidence that reindeers can locally habituate towards human activities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Predation influences significantly the mortality among reindeers, but the effects on the total reindeer demography and livelihood are debated. Losses are compensated for the reindeer herders [

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saami reindeer herding is distinctively inherited profession and kin-ties are important for reindeer management. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. Reindeer herding is connected to Saami well-being so that the quality of life decrease if the livelihood is lost [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Women constitute a minority of full-time reindeer herders, being actively involved in reindeer-herding culture [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>••]. Evidence from Sweden suggests that there are gender differences in the status of reindeer herder, and different expectations for women [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saami reindeer herding has adopted new technology and methods such as supplementary feeding. It is argued, that these changes have increased the adaptive capacity of reindeer herding, but increased the dependence on subsidies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. However, there are regional variations in different reindeer-herding models and in the use of new methods. Modernization has created social and economic pressures for the reindeer-herding communities. Small proportion of Saami reindeer herders is involved in tourism services, which provide better income and concurrently offers means to maintain traditional livelihood [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Governance and market economy have forced Saami to change their reindeer-herding model in Kola Peninsula. Industrialization has influenced Saami to abandon their culture [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assimilation measures have caused significant loss of Saami language; but language revitalization measures have improved the situation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. The smallest Saami languages alive have only few speakers and it is likely that language loss will continue in the near future. Traditional Saami home regions are located in rural areas with sparse population. Outmigration to urban areas is an increasing trend, but the potential effects of outmigration to demography, Saami society social, and culture have not yet been explored. Migrants are characterized as young and mostly female [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Outmigration influences the communal viability, coherence, and vitality of the traditional Saami regions, and poses challenges to the cultural well-being of the migrants.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saami and their livelihoods are vulnerable and exposed to socioeconomic changes and top-down governance. Adaptive capacity of Saami reindeer herding is limited geographically and in terms of governance [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Small population size and social and assimilative legacy pose serious challenges for the possibilities of Saami to maintain their culture and way of life in changing climate.
