 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saami are considered to be highly adapted to Arctic conditions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>] but it is possible that socioeconomic and lifestyle changes have negative effects on adaptive capacity. Our analysis suggests that the lifestyle, diet, and morbidity of the Saami is changing to resemble the majority populations posing threats for both the physical and mental health of the Saami, increasing general morbidity, and making them more vulnerable to the adverse health effects of climate change. Changes in lifestyle and diet expose Saami to cardiovascular disease. Increased climate change-related heat exposure is associated with an increase in cardiac events and especially elderly are vulnerable [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" href="#CR93">93</a>]. We have identified that the livelihood changes may have direct effects on the physical health and cultural well-being of the Saami, which need to studied further and taken into consideration in governance.

 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projected changes in temperature are likely to increase the risk of adverse secondary health risks both to Saami and reindeer. Disease outbreaks of pathogens transmitted by ticks and voles could emerge in previous non-endemic geographic areas [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" href="#CR94">94</a>]. Infectious diseases are likely to have more outbreaks in changing climate and expand to new territories into the north [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">74</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>]. Increase in precipitation and flooding events could create conditions favorable for mold growth in homes and this may result in an increase in mold-related disorders and allergies. A new emerging health threat especially in Russian Arctic is the melt of permafrost and release of pathogens [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">96</a>].

 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to AMAP human health report, human exposure to most POPs and metals is declining across many parts of the Arctic but interactions between climate change and contaminant transport have the potential to change human exposure in the Arctic significantly [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">97</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A major contributor to mental health among Arctic indigenous populations is chronic psychosocial stress linked to rapid socioeconomic development and this development is expected to accelerate due to climate change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">98</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>]. Our findings support these observations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate adaptation and mitigation actions such as wind power or hydropower development may increase the stress and mental pressure among the Saami and increase pasture competition. Therefor, climate adaptation and mitigation measures should take into account possible effects to the health and well-being of Saami.</p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saami are indigenous people and international covenants obligate the states to protect Saami culture and way of life for future. Health and well-being are basic human rights but in indigenous context culturally meaningful life is a human rights question. Currently there is not sufficient information to appropriately assess health and cultural well-being among the Saami, and therefor, it is challenging to evaluate whether international human rights obligations are met and to what extent adaptation to climate change will be culturally sustainable. Thus, evaluation and long-term monitoring of Saami health and cultural well-being is crucial. Development of a monitoring system is urgent. This study has elaborated the existing knowledge on the relations between environment, culture and health and on the influences of climate change to culture and health of Saami, and shown that the evidence base is limited.</p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saami communities around Sápmi face many socioeconomic challenges that threaten their possibilities to maintain their culture and identity. These multi-stress factors weaken the possibilities of Saami to adapt to climate change and maintain their culture. According to the fieldwork data, climate change poses risk for reindeer health and health of reindeer herders in terms of increased risks for accidents and future health prospects. Most prominent health effects are the mental health effects: increased stress, concern over the future of Saami way of live and pressures to abandon traditional Saami lifestyle. Also literature search support these findings.</p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis suggests that climate change brings both environmental, economic, cultural and social effects on reindeer herding as economic livelihood and as cultural way of life.</p>
 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the health and well-being of Saami to the health of other indigenous people is possible only at a general level. Comprehensive population-based studies and registry-based data are missing—in Nordic countries ethnic registries are forbidden—and hence, even the definition of a Saami is being disputed. The most comprehensive overview on the health of indigenous and tribal people was published in 2016. The study used general indicators—such as life expectancy and infant mortality—available from registries, excluding morbidity and mental health. The analysis shows that direct comparison of health of indigenous peoples is not possible, because of different status and legal interpretation of indigenousness, differences in data collection methods and indicators and lack of standardization of different methods [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">100</a>]. However, it can be argued that based on available evidence, the health of Saami is relatively good or better when compared on a general level to other indigenous peoples globally, but overview on cultural well-being and metal health of Saami is missing. More research and development of a monitoring system are needed to understand the health and cultural well-being of Saami in changing climate taking into consideration Saami values and traditions and major drivers for change.
