 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies on the primary effects of climate change were focused on ongoing and past changes in the vegetation and climate and the climate scenarios (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) in Sápmi. Local observations by reindeer herders and studies confirm that climate change has already altered conditions in Sápmi region. The most prominent are changes in snow cover and vegetation. The ethnographic interviews by Dr. Näkkäläjärvi provided evidence that observations on these changes are common and consistent among reindeer herders. Shrub expansion is occurring rapidly in tundra and mountain range, and the tree line is moving north- and upwards [

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is estimated that the days with snow cover are significantly shortened, but regional differences can be important. Winter thaws, rain-on-snow and refreezing events that are projected to increase creating ice crust [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>], and have a negative effect on reindeer pasture conditions, since reindeer cannot dig nutrition underneath ice cover. Climate change increases the risk of wildfires that have negative health effects and result loss of pasture land. Climate change is projected to threaten the lichen ecosystems in high latitudes and increases competition with other vegetation, especially vascular plants [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>], but on the other hand, the predicted warming will decrease the cold period and days with snow cover increasing utilization of other vegetation for forage [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. Predicted warming will increase heat stress among humans and reindeer. Changes in precipitation, increased heat stress, insect harassment, and changes in snow conditions in winter have an effect on predation and reindeer population dynamics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>]. It is predicted that productivity of reindeer forage will probably increase, but the nutritive value and quality could decrease [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>].

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weather-related accidents were predicted to either decrease [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] or increase [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" href="#CR71">71</a>]. Based on the interviews, the risk for accidents has increased among reindeer herders. Changes in the carrying capacity of ice, snow quality, and formation are likely to increase the risk for transport-related accidents and in the mountain region risk for avalanches can increase. Based on available knowledge, the primary health effects of climate change are likely to increase among Saami reindeer herders. Saami reindeer-herding models differ regionally and vary from semi-nomadic to local, and effects of climate change and adaptation possibilities thus vary significantly. Based on available evidence, it is not possible to estimate how the climate change influences different reindeer-herding models. Climate change is estimated to have both negative and positive effects for reindeer herding. However, the net balance is likely to vary significantly regionally depending on geography, local climate, environment, adaptation and mitigation measures, competing land uses, social system, and Saami population, reindeer-herding models, governance, and socioeconomic factors.
