 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been suggested that genetics together with Saami traditional lifestyle that includes significant physical activity and a healthy diet including reindeer meat, fish, and berries have positive effects on the Saami health reducing the risk of chronic diseases typically linked to western lifestyle [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Unfortunately, there is evidence that the lifestyle is changing: Saami experience less physical activity and traditional diet is, especially outside Saami core areas, being partly or completely replaced with western diet [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]. Saami women are in general more obese than women population in the same area. Saami men are less obese than the other population in the same area [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. Obesity is a risk factor for pre-diabetes and diabetes mellitus. The findings indicate that if the cultural and socioeconomic changes continue among Saami population effecting the traditional lifestyle and diet, it is likely that diabetes mellitus will become a public health concern among Saami population. Change or loss in traditional diet also indicates change in cultural values, livelihoods, and lifestyle.

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies found no differences in the substance use between the Saami and the majority population in Norway [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>] and Sweden [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. However, 50% of non-natural deaths among Saami reindeer herders in Sweden occurred under the influence of alcohol [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>•].

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Northern Norway, the Saami were subjected to violence more than the general population; 22% Saami women experienced sexual violence [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. Several findings from Sweden and Norway indicate that a major part of Saami population has experienced ethnic discrimination and it has negative implications to mental well-being and quality of life [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>]. Several important cultural and social factors, such as living in Saami core areas, involvement in reindeer herding, Saami as a native language, strong family ties, and communality, seem to protect Saami from mental health problems and provide resilience towards ethnic discrimination [
