 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate adaptation and mitigation were approached in the identified studies from two perspectives: (1) adaptation in reindeer herding to the adverse effects of climate change and (2) reindeer as a tool for climate adaptation. We could not identify any studies that discussed how the whole Saami culture and other livelihoods could adapt to the climate change. Findings indicate that adaptation possibilities are limited and available measures are flexible use of pasture land, use of vast environmental knowledge, herding, provide nutrition with supplementary feeding, or fell trees to gain reindeer access to arboreal lichen. Human-animal relationship and reindeer-herding traditions form a basis for adaptation measures [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>]. There is evidence that adaptation measures have cultural effects. Reindeer herders fear that the use of supplementary nutrition changes profoundly their cultural livelihood [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>]. Based on fieldwork data, supplementary feeding and GPS use are means for adaptation in difficult conditions, but they have also important cultural effects and may erode the cultural knowledge of the reindeer herder, which can reduce the adaptive capacity of reindeer-herding culture in the future. Reindeer become tamer due to the use of supplementary nutrition and it affects the range selection of the reindeers.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>] . Incentive grazing in summer increases surface albedo, delays snowmelt and decreases the ground from heating in snowmelt season [
