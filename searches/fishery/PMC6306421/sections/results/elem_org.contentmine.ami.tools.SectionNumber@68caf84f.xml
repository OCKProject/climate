  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditional Saami settlement area includes both sub-arctic and arctic areas with boreal forest, coastal areas, and large mountain regions with alpine vegetation. Snow covers the Sápmi area 8 months a year, and plays a central role in the climatic, ecological, and hydrological processes, and in the way of life and reindeer herding [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Saami language has a precise classification system for snow and knowledge of snow is an important part of reindeer herder’s knowledge [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. Reindeer is important for Saami culturally and reindeer herding is means to maintain traditions, language, and cultural identity in changing world. Reindeer herding, as other traditional Saami livelihoods constitute important part of Saami well-being (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Currently, reindeer herding is one of the driving forces together with other herbivore on shaping the vegetation in Sápmi region [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]; however, in boreal area forestry and competing land uses, such as mining, infrastructure development, and tourism affect both vegetation and reindeer herding [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. Although reindeer forage over 300 different plants in addition to fungi, ground lichen is the main forage for reindeer in winter. Lichen heaths are in heavily grazed areas and in areas where forestry and reindeer grazing coexist degraded, but there are regional differences in grazing pressure [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. Human activity influences the range selection of reindeer, and increase grazing pressure inside the reindeer-herding area [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>], but there is also evidence that reindeers can locally habituate towards human activities [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Predation influences significantly the mortality among reindeers, but the effects on the total reindeer demography and livelihood are debated. Losses are compensated for the reindeer herders [

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saami reindeer herding is distinctively inherited profession and kin-ties are important for reindeer management. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>]. Reindeer herding is connected to Saami well-being so that the quality of life decrease if the livelihood is lost [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Women constitute a minority of full-time reindeer herders, being actively involved in reindeer-herding culture [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>••]. Evidence from Sweden suggests that there are gender differences in the status of reindeer herder, and different expectations for women [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saami reindeer herding has adopted new technology and methods such as supplementary feeding. It is argued, that these changes have increased the adaptive capacity of reindeer herding, but increased the dependence on subsidies [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. However, there are regional variations in different reindeer-herding models and in the use of new methods. Modernization has created social and economic pressures for the reindeer-herding communities. Small proportion of Saami reindeer herders is involved in tourism services, which provide better income and concurrently offers means to maintain traditional livelihood [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>]. Governance and market economy have forced Saami to change their reindeer-herding model in Kola Peninsula. Industrialization has influenced Saami to abandon their culture [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assimilation measures have caused significant loss of Saami language; but language revitalization measures have improved the situation [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]. The smallest Saami languages alive have only few speakers and it is likely that language loss will continue in the near future. Traditional Saami home regions are located in rural areas with sparse population. Outmigration to urban areas is an increasing trend, but the potential effects of outmigration to demography, Saami society social, and culture have not yet been explored. Migrants are characterized as young and mostly female [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. Outmigration influences the communal viability, coherence, and vitality of the traditional Saami regions, and poses challenges to the cultural well-being of the migrants.
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saami and their livelihoods are vulnerable and exposed to socioeconomic changes and top-down governance. Adaptive capacity of Saami reindeer herding is limited geographically and in terms of governance [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>•, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Small population size and social and assimilative legacy pose serious challenges for the possibilities of Saami to maintain their culture and way of life in changing climate.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Saami Lifestyle and Well-Being</div>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been suggested that genetics together with Saami traditional lifestyle that includes significant physical activity and a healthy diet including reindeer meat, fish, and berries have positive effects on the Saami health reducing the risk of chronic diseases typically linked to western lifestyle [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. Unfortunately, there is evidence that the lifestyle is changing: Saami experience less physical activity and traditional diet is, especially outside Saami core areas, being partly or completely replaced with western diet [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>]. Saami women are in general more obese than women population in the same area. Saami men are less obese than the other population in the same area [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. Obesity is a risk factor for pre-diabetes and diabetes mellitus. The findings indicate that if the cultural and socioeconomic changes continue among Saami population effecting the traditional lifestyle and diet, it is likely that diabetes mellitus will become a public health concern among Saami population. Change or loss in traditional diet also indicates change in cultural values, livelihoods, and lifestyle.

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies found no differences in the substance use between the Saami and the majority population in Norway [

  </p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Northern Norway, the Saami were subjected to violence more than the general population; 22% Saami women experienced sexual violence [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. Several findings from Sweden and Norway indicate that a major part of Saami population has experienced ethnic discrimination and it has negative implications to mental well-being and quality of life [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>]. Several important cultural and social factors, such as living in Saami core areas, involvement in reindeer herding, Saami as a native language, strong family ties, and communality, seem to protect Saami from mental health problems and provide resilience towards ethnic discrimination [

   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) in Sápmi. Local observations by reindeer herders and studies confirm that climate change has already altered conditions in Sápmi region. The most prominent are changes in snow cover and vegetation. The ethnographic interviews by Dr. Näkkäläjärvi provided evidence that observations on these changes are common and consistent among reindeer herders. Shrub expansion is occurring rapidly in tundra and mountain range, and the tree line is moving north- and upwards [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>], and have a negative effect on reindeer pasture conditions, since reindeer cannot dig nutrition underneath ice cover. Climate change increases the risk of wildfires that have negative health effects and result loss of pasture land. Climate change is projected to threaten the lichen ecosystems in high latitudes and increases competition with other vegetation, especially vascular plants [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>], but on the other hand, the predicted warming will decrease the cold period and days with snow cover increasing utilization of other vegetation for forage [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. Predicted warming will increase heat stress among humans and reindeer. Changes in precipitation, increased heat stress, insect harassment, and changes in snow conditions in winter have an effect on predation and reindeer population dynamics [

Changes in the carrying capacity of ice, snow quality, and formation are likely to increase the risk for transport-related accidents and in the mountain region risk for avalanches can increase. Based on available knowledge, the primary health effects of climate change are likely to increase among Saami reindeer herders. Saami reindeer-herding models differ regionally and vary from semi-nomadic to local, and effects of climate change and adaptation possibilities thus vary significantly. Based on available evidence, it is not possible to estimate how the climate change influences different reindeer-herding models. Climate change is estimated to have both negative and positive effects for reindeer herding. However, the net balance is likely to vary significantly regionally depending on geography, local climate, environment, adaptation and mitigation measures, competing land uses, social system, and Saami population, reindeer-herding models, governance, and socioeconomic factors.

We could not identify any studies that discussed how the whole Saami culture and other livelihoods could adapt to the climate change. Findings indicate that adaptation possibilities are limited and available measures are flexible use of pasture land, use of vast environmental knowledge, herding, provide nutrition with supplementary feeding, or fell trees to gain reindeer access to arboreal lichen. Human-animal relationship and reindeer-herding traditions form a basis for adaptation measures [

Based on fieldwork data, supplementary feeding and GPS use are means for adaptation in difficult conditions, but they have also important cultural effects and may erode the cultural knowledge of the reindeer herder, which can reduce the adaptive capacity of reindeer-herding culture in the future. Reindeer become tamer due to the use of supplementary nutrition and it affects the range selection of the reindeers.
