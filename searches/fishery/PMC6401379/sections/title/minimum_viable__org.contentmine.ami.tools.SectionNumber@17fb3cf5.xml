 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, minimum viable population (MVP) was defined as the minimum number of individuals that was sufficient to sustain 99% probability of population persistence in 100 years

  </span>. Moreover, we incorporated a genetic effect into the estimate of MVP by considering viable population to maintain more than 90% of genetic diversity, as proposed by Frankham 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
