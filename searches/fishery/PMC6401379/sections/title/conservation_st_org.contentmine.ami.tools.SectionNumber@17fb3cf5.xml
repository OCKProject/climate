 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present results demonstrated that the longer-lived fishes with late maturity, long generation, and large fecundity were expected to have a greater MVP size than the shorter-lived fishes in the Yangtze River. This implies that in spite of playing an important role in the structure and function of an ecological community, long-lived species tend to be at a relative high risk of extinction and are vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances

  </span>. Hence, we should place priority on long-lived species for conservation effort in the Yangtze River.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many factors, such as hunting/fishing, habitat alteration, invasive species, and climate change, could cause the population decline of long-lived species, which also tend to be less resilient and slow to adapt to changing environmental conditions

  </span>, and some alterations of habitat, such as construction of dams, are practically almost impossible to restore to historical conditions. On the other hand, other types of conservation efforts such as reduction in fishing pressure and creation of reserves can be implemented quickly. The previous studies found that increasing the survival of both the juveniles and adults was most beneficial to the persistence of long-lived species

  </span>. Furthermore, stock enhancement can potentially be implemented to mitigate habitat alternations. Our results suggest these conservation efforts should be allocated more toward protecting long-lived species in the Yangtze River.
