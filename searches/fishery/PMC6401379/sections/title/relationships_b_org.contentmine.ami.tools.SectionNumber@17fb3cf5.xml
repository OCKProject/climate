 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three parameters, age at maturity, fecundity, and generation time, were used to analyze the relationships between the life-history traits and the two population viability measures (MVP and 
  <span class="italic">r</span>). All of the life history traits and two population measures were transformed by taking natural logarithm to stabilize variance. At first, the relationship between the natural log-transformed MVP and 
  <span class="italic">r</span> was analyzed, and then, the relationships between the natural log-transformed life history traits and two population viability measures were analyzed with linear regression.
