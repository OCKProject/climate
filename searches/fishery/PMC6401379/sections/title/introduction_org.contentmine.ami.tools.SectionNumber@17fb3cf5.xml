 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Freshwater fishes are confronting some of the most serious threats in the world, including habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, species invasion, and overfishing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>, which caused freshwater fishes to experience a high risk of extinction
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Conservative estimates of population viability suggested that 1800 species, which accounted for 20% of all freshwater fishes, had become extinct or on the verge of extinction in 1992
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. To make the situation worse, the number of endangered freshwater species on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List has more than tripled since 2003
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. Although this is partly because we have more data now than 2003, permitting us to categorize them as threatened, these facts are prompting need for a comprehensive effort to assess the viability of freshwater fishes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two of the important measures of the viability of species are minimum viable population (MVP) size and annual population growth rate. MVP size is the smallest size in which a population can persist despite of confronting impacts from various factors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. In practice, MVP is usually estimated to be equal to the population size enough to ensure a pre-specified probability of persistence over a pre-specified period into the future
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. MVP has become particularly useful to guide conservation efforts for species at risk by providing science-based target abundance in a recovery plan
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. For example, IUCN Criterion D categorizes the level of threat based on a set of threshold population sizes, whilst Criterion E uses the projected risk of extinction faced by a species over a specified period (IUCN 2005). Traill 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span> indicated the number of studies using MVP has gradually increased over a past few decades with no apparent sign for decline in its use. This is partly because conservation agencies need to make rapid decisions about conservation targets, often under limited data availability. At the same time, it is also attracting interests in developing a robust, general guideline for determining MVPs
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. Such a guideline could utilize basic life history traits or other ecological attributes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, which are more readily available. To develop the guideline, the analyses of MVP using multiple species have been performed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, these studies, which depended on multiple data types from multiple species, could not derive such a guideline conclusively. Furthermore, for some taxa such as fish, data are lacking to conduct simultaneous population viability analyses of multiple species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>, leading to a limited number of comprehensive research on the MVP of fish.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population growth rate is another measure often used in viability analysis. It is a per-capita rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases/decreases over a fixed period. Hutchings
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span> argued that population growth rate ultimately determined fish population’s ability to sustain under fishing mortality and to recover after its collapse. Therefore, population growth rate could be used to assess the intrinsic vulnerability and extinction risk of fish species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>, and has been adopted as one of the most important indices by the IUCN Red List guideline and many national guidelines and criteria (e.g. American Fisheries Society)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. However, in practice, population growth rate is very difficult to estimate, especially, for endangered species due to a lack of demographic data
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Instead, the correlations between life-history traits and population growth rate have been quantified in order to evaluate vulnerability of species under threats from various environmental and anthropogenic factors

  </span>.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The objectives of this study were to (1) calculate the MVP and population growth rate of fishes in the Yangtze River, (2) estimate the relationships between the two population viability measures and life-history traits, and (3) suggest conservation strategies for fishes in the Yangtze River.</p>
