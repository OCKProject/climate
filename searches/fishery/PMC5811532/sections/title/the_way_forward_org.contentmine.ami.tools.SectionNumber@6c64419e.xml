 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A number of recent developments may foster significant progress over the next few years. First, novel physical and biogeochemical data synthesis (e.g., remote sensing products, surface ocean CO
  <sub>2</sub> Atlas, profiling floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors) have become available over the last few years promising a breakthrough in assessing heat waves and extreme events in other potential ocean stressors. Second, the horizontal and vertical resolution of the Earth System Models, especially of the ocean components, and the computational power to run simulations at high resolution has continuously increased, so that it is now feasible to investigate MHWs in sufficient high resolution at the global scale. Third, the level of sophistication of marine ecosystem-biogeochemical models in these global Earth System models has improved to a stage permitting us to investigate and simulate changes in MHWs and extreme events in other individual and combined potential ocean ecosystem stressors. Fourth, major progress in probabilistic event attribution research over the last few years allow us to tackle the question whether and to what extent external climate drivers such as human-induced climate change alter the likelihood of ocean extreme events. And finally, recent global compilations of ecosystem relevant parameters, as well as concepts and empirical models of the functioning of organisms and their responses to environmental changes will give the opportunity to assess and quantify risks of ocean extreme events for marine ecosystems in novel ways. However, retrospectives studies, innovative laboratory experiments and interdisciplinary approaches are needed to ultimately understand the impact of MHWs on individual organisms, ecosystems, and their socioeconomic services.
