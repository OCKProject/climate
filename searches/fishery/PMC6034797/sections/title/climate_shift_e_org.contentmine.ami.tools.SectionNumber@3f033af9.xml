 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EwE MSE results suggest that the impacts of climate shifts on herring fisheries could be profound, as the performance of the 
  <span class="italic">BC</span> management strategy relative to the current baseline (herring 
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 0) is highly dependent on the primary productivity regime (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g011" href="#pone.0196307.g011">Fig 11</a>). While “no good productivity years” (
  <span class="italic">BC</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">0</span>.
   <span class="italic">75</span>
  </sub>) caused several functional group biomasses to change more strongly than in the 
  <span class="italic">BC</span> scenario, “only bad productivity years” (
  <span class="italic">BC</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">0</span>.
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </sub>) impacted most functional groups more strongly than 
  <span class="italic">BC</span> or even 
  <span class="italic">MSY</span>. Herring management strategy performance is therefore contingent on primary productivity levels and must be evaluated in this context. This is consistent with the bottom-up control of Northeast Pacific fisheries yields [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref078">78</a>], although recent end-to-end modelling [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref061">61</a>] indicates that this relationship may be complicated by plankton community dynamics, parameter uncertainty and representation of natural mortality. Our results also agree with recent projections of future climate change impacts on local aboriginal herring fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref079">79</a>] and with contemporary findings [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref069">69</a>] regarding the current primacy of climatic drivers over fishing pressure in affecting forage fish and predator biomasses in the California Current.
