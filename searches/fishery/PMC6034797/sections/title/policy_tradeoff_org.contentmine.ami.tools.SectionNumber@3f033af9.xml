 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The EwE MSE results highlight a tradeoff between herring and predatory marine mammal biomasses on the one hand (ecological value) and herring catches and fisheries openings on the other (socioeconomic value). Many previous studies [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref003">3</a>] have revealed such tradeoffs while also noting strong impacts of forage fish fisheries on seabirds and piscivorous fish. Unsurprisingly, grand mean herring catches were highest for those scenarios (constant

  <sub>
   <span class="italic">target</span>
  </sub> or step HCRs, high 
  <span class="italic">F</span>

   <span class="italic">target</span>
  </sub>, low 
  <span class="italic">B</span>

   <span class="italic">lim</span>

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g012" href="#pone.0196307.g012">Fig 12</a>). The probability of herring fishery closure was highest for step HCRs with high

   <span class="italic">target</span>
  </sub> and 
  <span class="italic">B</span>

  </sub> values (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g014" href="#pone.0196307.g014">Fig 14</a>), suggesting potentially high socioeconomic costs for such management strategies. While mean catch was similar in the 
  <span class="italic">BC</span> and 
  <span class="italic">K</span> scenarios, as in the single-species simulations by Hall et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref037">37</a>], the probability of fishery closure in the 
  <span class="italic">BC</span> scenario was approximately twice that observed in the single-species analysis. This is likely due to the interactive effects of stock assessment error and poor primary productivity discussed in detail below. It is worth noting that the 
  <span class="italic">BC</span> strategy was introduced in 1986 to minimize the probability of herring fishery closure while maintaining stable but relatively high catches and spawning stock biomasses [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examining these tradeoffs with the Ecosim policy search routine, which combines ecosystem modelling with multi-attribute objective functions, offers a fruitful avenue for exploring precautionary, ecosystem-based and socioeconomically acceptable herring management strategies. This approach would allow researchers to model each strategy, incorporating the values and preferences of conservationists as well as commercial and aboriginal fishers, and thus search for a strategy that would best balance ecological and socioeconomic outcomes. However, given the substantial error accompanying

  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref056">56</a>], management decisions derived from HCRs based on these quantities are opaque to and thus often contested by stakeholders [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref056">56</a>], e.g. Northeast Pacific aboriginal peoples reliant on herring [

  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref075">75</a>]. Community and herring industry members were interviewed and asked to prioritize among a set of values and choose among fishery management scenarios and

By making explicit the ecological, cultural and socioeconomic values at the science-policy interface, VEBMA offers an integrative, transparent deliberation and decision-support tool that exposes policy tradeoffs and highlights compromise solutions to facilitate collaborative governance among diverse stakeholders and affected local communities [
