  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g002" href="#pone.0196307.g002">Fig 2</a>). Mammalian predators whose diets contain â‰¥ 20% herring (humpback whales, dolphins and porpoises, seals; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g004" href="#pone.0196307.g004">Fig 4</a>) declined strongly, reducing the biomass of mammal-eating transient orcas. By contrast, many largely planktivorous fish and baleen whales benefited from reduced competition with herring for shared zooplankton prey, triggering increases in predators of planktivorous fish (dogfish, sperm whales, resident orcas, blue and salmon sharks). Effects of herring collapse in the Northeast Pacific would likely cascade through much of the food web to yield an ecosystem composition similar to that currently present in western Alaska, where forage fish and their pinniped predators have declined while walleye pollock have flourished following an oceanic regime shift [
