  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g005" href="#pone.0196307.g005">5</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g006" href="#pone.0196307.g006">6</a>) in terms of herring and predator biomasses (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g009" href="#pone.0196307.g009">Fig 9</a>), as previously found by the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref002">2</a>]. However, the magnitude of their advantage varied with the similarity of the 
  <span class="italic">F</span>

   <span class="italic">target</span>
  </sub> and to a lesser extent, 
  <span class="italic">B</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">lim</span>
  </sub> values. Furthermore, hockey-stick HCRs require exceptionally precise annual estimates of stock biomass and fishing mortality, which renders them a difficult and costly EBFM option to implement. A single-species MSE analysis [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref033">33</a>] found no advantage in a hockey-stick HCR relative to the 
  <span class="italic">BC</span> strategy. However, in this HCR, 
  <span class="italic">B</span>

   <span class="italic">lim</span>

  <span class="italic">B</span>

  <span class="italic">B</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">0</span>

  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref071">71</a>]. Furthermore, the 
  <span class="italic">B</span>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reducing 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">target</span>
  </sub> thus appears to be the simplest approach to maintaining high herring and predatory mammal biomasses in the Northeast Pacific. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of the Lenfest Task Force [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref002">2</a>], but not with those of Cleary et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref033">33</a>]. Simultaneously raising 
  <span class="italic">B</span>

   <span class="italic">lim</span>

  <span class="italic">B</span>
  <sub>

  <span class="italic">BC</span> strategy) to 0.40

  <sub>
   <span class="italic">0</span>

  <span class="italic">LF1</span> and

  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref002">2</a>], would enhance the effectiveness of 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">target</span>
  </sub> reductions. Raising 
  <span class="italic">B</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">lim</span>
  </sub> to 0.70â€“0.80
  <span class="italic">B</span>

  </sub>, also suggested by the Task Force [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref002">2</a>], would likely be even more effective, but our EwE model could not consistently produce herring biomasses at this level, likely due to poor herring recovery or inadequate herring prey availability in the current Northeast Pacific ecosystem. A recent study [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref072">72</a>] also recommended using 
  <span class="italic">B</span>

  <span class="italic">B</span>

   <span class="italic">0</span>
  </sub> in British Columbia herring fisheries to account for the ecosystem role of herring and for stock assessment error due to variable egg loss rates and spawn survey catchability.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herring fishing at 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">MSY</span>
  </sub> caused stronger biomass changes in many functional groups than any other strategy tested (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g009" href="#pone.0196307.g009">Fig 9</a>). The resulting substantial reorganization of the food web was deleterious to herring predators and favourable to planktivores. Exploiting forage fish at 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">MSY</span>
  </sub> often has adverse effects on predators and food webs [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref044">44</a>] and carries the risk of forage fish stock depletion when assessment error combines with poor primary productivity [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref015">15</a>]. These findings apply equally to 
  <span class="italic">MSY</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">s</span>
  </sub> and 
  <span class="italic">MSY</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">e</span>
  </sub>, although higher 
  <span class="italic">B</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">lim</span>
  </sub> values somewhat mitigate their effects on functional group biomasses (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g009" href="#pone.0196307.g009">Fig 9</a>). However, unlike Walters et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref044">44</a>], we detected relatively strong negative effects on predator biomasses even when only one species (herring) was fished at 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">MSY</span>
  </sub>. This suggests that 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">MSY</span>
  </sub> may be incompatible with herring EBFM, at least when not moderated by a precautionary hockey-stick HCR such as that applied to Norwegian spring-spawning herring [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref060">60</a>]. Given that herring mortality in the postwar British Columbia reduction fishery often exceeded 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">MSY</span>
  </sub> [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref073">73</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref074">74</a>], this fishery likely had substantial adverse impacts on some herring predators.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is noteworthy that the spawn-on-kelp fishery alone (
  <span class="italic">SOK</span> scenario), even assuming maximum incidental spawner mortality (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">target</span>
  </sub> = 0.01), apparently has negligible effects on herring and predator biomasses (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g009" href="#pone.0196307.g009">Fig 9</a>). This finding agrees with that of Shelton et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref029">29</a>] based on single-species modelling and extends its applicability into the EBFM realm. Since most herring taken in the Northeast Pacific are pre-spawners fished for their roe, the 
  <span class="italic">SOK</span> scenario may offer a more sustainable alternative to the roe herring fishery.
