 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In some runs of each EwE MSE scenario, simulated stock assessment error appears to have coincided with poor primary productivity years, exacerbating herring fishing effects on the food web (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g010" href="#pone.0196307.g010">Fig 10</a>). Overestimation of stock biomass by 30% (the maximum value permissible in our model settings) in a poor productivity year would create simultaneous top-down and bottom-up pressures on herring. This could lead to strong direct and indirect trophic effects on numerous functional groups. As primary productivity and stock assessment error were the only randomly varying factors in our simulations, an additive relationship between them is the most logical explanation for the strong herring fishing effects observed in the μ—0.675σ of group biomass distributions. For those functional groups (e.g. transient salmon and inshore rockfish) showing consistent negative effects across all strategies, poor primary productivity years alone appear to be responsible. Consecutive poor productivity years, accompanied by initially random but propagating stock biomass overestimations [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref056">56</a>], could establish a pernicious positive feedback loop reducing many group biomasses. This interpretation agrees with recent findings [
