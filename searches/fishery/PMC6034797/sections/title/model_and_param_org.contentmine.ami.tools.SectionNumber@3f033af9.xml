 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While EwE MSE simulations incorporate uncertainty by representing stock assessment error and interannual variability in primary productivity through Monte Carlo resampling, our analyses, as with all complex simulations, suffer from both model and parameter uncertainty.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Ecopath model represents the relationship between functional group biomass and non-predation-related natural mortality linearly. For groups characterized by high density-dependent mortality, a quadratic representation may better capture control mechanisms in predator-prey interactions and propagation of bottom-up effects through the food web [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref061">61</a>], but the requisite empirical data are difficult to obtain. The current model also does not represent non-consumptive, fear-mediated [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref062">62</a>] top-down effects of top predators (e.g., large demersal sharks) on mesopredators (e.g., seals), with cascading positive effects on prey (e.g., herring). Such effects could be modelled using trophic mediation functions; however, the quantitative data needed for an accurate representation are not yet available. The lack of explicit age structure for most predatory fish (except Pacific halibut 
  <span class="italic">Hippoglossus stenolepis</span>) in the present model precludes examining the effects of their trophic ontogeny on herring ecology [

  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref051">51</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref052">52</a>], but our moderately detailed model should be sufficient to meet the goals of this study.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosim assumes stock-recruitment relationships for all forage fish, which has been questioned [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref051">51</a>]. However, the authors of this study admit that in the absence of such relationships, predators could still be affected by declines in forage fish standing stocks due to fishing. Another recent study [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref052">52</a>] suggests that an absence of stock-recruitment relationships in predatory fish (also assumed by Ecosim) could buffer them against forage fish depletion, but its authors concede that predator-prey recruitment covariation due to common bottom-up drivers in shared nursery areas could counteract this effect.

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196307.s001" href="#pone.0196307.s001">S1 File</a>) may affect simulation results, but could be remedied in future studies by Monte Carlo resampling of parameter values. Low functional group resolution (particularly for seabirds and zooplankton) in the current model may obscure important predator-prey interactions (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196307.s001" href="#pone.0196307.s001">S1 File</a>), but will be enhanced in future model versions [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref022">22</a>]. Sensitivity analyses (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196307.s001" href="#pone.0196307.s001">S1 File</a>) showed that Ecosim and EwE MSE results are quite robust to uncertainty in Ecosim vulnerability parameters.
