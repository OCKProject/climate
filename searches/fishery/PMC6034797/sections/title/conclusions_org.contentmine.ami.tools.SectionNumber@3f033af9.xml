 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecopath, Ecosim and EwE MSE results show that Pacific herring is an important prey item for various Northeast Pacific predators, particularly marine mammals, and that its depletion could have notable cascading effects on predator populations and food web structure. EwE MSE simulations suggest that fishing strategies incorporating low

  </sub> and hockey-stick HCRs are particularly promising for precautionary and ecosystem-based herring fisheries management (corroborating the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force findings), while unmoderated MSY strategies are incompatible with these approaches. Notably for British Columbia and Alaska, EwE MSE results also indicate that the SOK fishery traditionally practiced by coastal First Nations has minimal ecological impacts, while the existing British Columbia herring management strategy shows only modest impacts. However, fishing effects on herring and its predators may often be exacerbated by stock assessment error and poor primary productivity, raising the risk of strong ecosystem impacts under climate variability and shifts. The EwE MSE simulation results demonstrate that tradeoffs among the ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic values of Pacific herring must be weighed carefully, considering the impacts and risks to herring predators and the food web, as well as to commercial and aboriginal fisheries and local communities.
