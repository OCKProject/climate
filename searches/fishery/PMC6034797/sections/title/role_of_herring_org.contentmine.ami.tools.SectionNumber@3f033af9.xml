 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of the simulated herring management strategies noticeably reduced the biomasses of herring-eating mammals and the top predators reliant on those groups. Simultaneously, these strategies raised herring competitor biomasses (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g009" href="#pone.0196307.g009">Fig 9</a>). Forage fish trophic interactions, i.e., support for predators and competition with planktivores, are responsible for these effects, particularly the stronger bottom-up effects of forage fish fisheries on marine mammals [

  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref008">8</a>] relative to piscivorous fish [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref007">7</a>]. While EwE typically predicts stronger impacts of forage fish fisheries on predators than does Atlantis due to more explicit age structure in the latter [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref052">52</a>], our multi-stanza (age-structured) representations of herring and halibut at least partially mitigated this effect. Trophic ontogeny is much more pronounced among large fish than in marine mammals, making the interactions between herring and the latter less sensitive to this model uncertainty. The EwE MSE simulation results indicate that herring plays an important role in the Northeast Pacific food web as both prey to predators (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g003" href="#pone.0196307.g003">Fig 3</a>) and competitor to planktivores.

  <span class="italic">BC</span>, will not substantially reorganize Northeast Pacific food webs, in contrast to forage fish fisheries in many upwelling ecosystems [

  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref003">3</a>]. This conclusion is supported by the lack of noticeable herring fishing effects on the 
  <span class="italic">MTL</span> and Shannon-Wiener 
  <span class="italic">H’</span> values of the modelled food web. This may be due to higher ecological redundancy in the Northeast Pacific forage fish guild relative to tropical upwelling systems [

  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref063">63</a>], as well as the diverse and flexible diets of most herring predators in the modelled ecosystem (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196307.g004" href="#pone.0196307.g004">Fig 4</a>), as observed for forage fish predators in coastal waters throughout the continental USA [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, for relatively omnivorous predators (e.g., fin whales, sea lions and seabirds), almost no net biomass changes were observed at

  </sub>, as herring fishing effects were balanced by increases in other forage fish or zooplankton competing with herring or consumed by herring, respectively. This complex relationship between herring, other forage fish and zooplankton may also explain herring fisheries effects on the highly omnivorous Pacific hake. Herring fishing effects on seabirds, however, may not be accurately quantified by our model due to the limited resolution of our seabird representation, which we are improving (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196307.s001" href="#pone.0196307.s001">S1 File</a>). Previous studies [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref004">4</a>] addressed the importance to seabirds of all forage fish rather than a single species (e.g., Pacific herring), hence their findings and ours are not directly comparable. In addition, multiple studies [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref010">10</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref069">69</a>] have found that local rather than total forage fish biomass may be particularly important to seabirds and other central place foragers. Such small-scale spatial effects cannot be simulated in the EwE MSE module, but may be investigated in Ecospace [

  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref070">70</a>]. Finally, the lack of noticeable herring fishery impacts on the three predators in our model which predominantly consume juvenile rather than adult herring (i.e., Pacific cod 
  <span class="italic">Gadus macrocephalus</span>, lingcod 
  <span class="italic">Ophiodon elongatus</span> and inshore rockfish 
  <span class="italic">Sebastes</span> spp.) agrees with the conclusions of two recent studies [
