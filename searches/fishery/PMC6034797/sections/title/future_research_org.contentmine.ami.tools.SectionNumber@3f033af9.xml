 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the completion of these analyses, a new EwE plugin supplying improved MSE functionality, combined with extensive consideration of parameter uncertainty via Monte Carlo resampling and generation of multiple EwE models as platforms for MSE analysis, has been introduced [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref080">80</a>] and applied to pressing issues in strategic management of North Sea fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref081">81</a>]. This plugin, combined with an improved food web model [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref022">22</a>], will allow us to explore the effects of model structure and resolution, parameter uncertainty and implementation error on the conclusions of the present study, as well as to simulate more complex HCRs [
  <a rid="pone.0196307.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196307.ref059">59</a>] in a true MSE framework with full representation of all human and ecological subsystems [
