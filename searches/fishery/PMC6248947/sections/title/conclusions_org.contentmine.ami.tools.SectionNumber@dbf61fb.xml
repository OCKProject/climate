 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we show that the redundancy of functional groups of fish in the Barents Sea varied in space and time during 2004â€“2012. Fish communities in the Arctic part of the Barents Sea have different functional configurations than those boreal communities in Atlantic water masses. On the other hand, the central Barents Sea appeared to sustain diverse demersal assemblages including both Arctic and boreal species. Persistent spatial patterns in FR may therefore largely reflect adaptations to spatial variations in water mass characteristics and vertical carbon flux in the Barents Sea. However, recent environmental change has caused the water masses in the Barents Sea to heat up and the sea ice to retreat. Consequently, a borealization of Arctic fish communities has occurred in which boreal fish have moved north-eastwards into previously Arctic areas. Typical Arctic species have been marginalized in the Barents Sea. The borealization of the fish community implies an introduction of typical boreal functional traits to the Arctic environment, as well as a diminishing representation of typical Arctic traits. Such borealization will also lead to an altered FR in the Barents Sea. The functional groups dominated by boreal species generally increased their redundancy in the central and north-eastern Barents Sea whilst those groups that were dominated by Arctic species showed a decline in redundancy values which calls for further study. Furthermore, there are several speciose functional groups of fish in the Barents Sea, some groups are species poor and are hardly able to buffer against species loss. Thus, the changes in FR of fish communities may affect the future ecosystem functioning in the Barents Sea. Functional redundancy is a transparent metric that may help inform management on ecosystem functioning and vulnerability.</p>
