 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we observed several persistent, large-scale patterns of FR in Barents Sea fish. In the following, we argue that these patterns reflect the species' adaptations to the spatially differing environmental conditions. The central Barents Sea (Polar Front area), where warm and saline Atlantic water meets cold and less saline Arctic water, marks the northern limit of boreal species and the southern limit of Arctic species. Water temperature positively correlates with the metabolic rate of a species and therefore its energy demands [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref059">59</a>]. It can therefore be assumed that fish residing in the cold, north-eastern part of the Barents Sea study area in general have lower energy demands than those residing in the warmer part.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to contrasting water mass characteristics, Atlantic and Arctic waters differ when it comes to the prevailing carbon flux regime. In Atlantic water, the annual estimated gross primary production and vertical export of carbon is higher than in Arctic water masses. The proportion of carbon being exported towards the bottom is however higher in Arctic than in Atlantic water masses [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref023">23</a>]. A high overall production and vertical export in the south-west apparently supports a high demersal and pelagic diversity, which in turn is reflected by a relatively high redundancy in four out of six functional groups: the Elasmobranchs, the Semipelagics, the Redfish and the Large demersals. In the Arctic, relatively low primary production rates, combined with high rates of vertical carbon flux, leaves relatively small amounts of energy in the upper water levels. This in turn may explain the low diversity of planktivorous species [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref005">5</a>]. The Arctic carbon export regime thus favours a benthic affiliation, which is supported by the fact that the functional groups most common in the Arctic (e.g., the Long demersals) are dominated by bottom-dwelling, benthivorous species [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref035">35</a>]. Yet, the amounts of carbon reaching the seabed in the Arctic part of the Barents Sea is limited, with high seasonal and inter-annual variability [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref023">23</a>]. This calls for additional adaptations in order to reduce energy demands of the species living there. For instance, metabolic rate is also positively correlated with body mass [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref059">59</a>]. The two functional groups that comprised most of the cold-water adapted, Arctic fish species (i.e., the Lumpsuckers and the Long demersals) also displayed the smallest average body sizes, thus further reducing their energy demands.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Body shape is another cold-water adaptation with implications for metabolic rate [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref059">59</a>]. Fish found in Atlantic water masses of the Barents Sea display a variety of body shapes, including fusiform, flat, deep/short, elongated and eel-like shapes, whereas those found in Arctic waters are typically elongated or eel-like. Codfish (order Gadiformes), a dominating group of fish in the central and Atlantic parts of the Barents Sea, have a fusiform body shape, which is shown to have a high resting metabolic rates [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref059">59</a>]. Eelpouts, a specious an eel-like shaped family common in the central and Arctic parts of the Barents Sea, typically display low resting metabolic rates [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref059">59</a>]. Typically fish species from Arctic waters in the Barents Sea have body shapes that promote low resting metabolic rates. Furthermore, at low swimming speeds, evidence suggests that an eel-like shape is more power efficient than a fusiform shape [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref060">60</a>], indicating limited motion, modest swimming speeds and a non-migratory behaviour. In the case of avoidance, fish species with eel-like body shape are however able to escape explosively (personal observation).
