 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test for spatial and temporal dependence, counts of the functional groups for all the sample points (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 237) were related to their corresponding grid cells and years. Discrete spatial and temporal explanatory variables, were defined using a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The significant contribution to the explained inertia of each explanatory variable was tested using a permutation test with 9999 permutations (R package vegan).
