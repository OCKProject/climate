 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marine ecosystems presently undergo substantial compositional and structural alterations in response to environmental change, with associated implications for ecosystem functioning and vulnerability [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref001">1</a>]. Although climate is predicted to change most rapidly at high-latitudes [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref002">2</a>], where climate-induced ecological responses are already evident [

  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref004">4</a>], Arctic marine ecosystems are generally understudied [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref005">5</a>], and very little research has been directed towards ecosystem functioning and possible alterations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marine ecosystem functioning is influenced by species composition via the functional traits (i.e., properties) of individual species. Functional traits allow the identification of the ecosystem functions of individual community members, the functional characterization of a community and the assessment of its functional diversity and redundancy [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref008">8</a>]. In ecosystems, functional diversity (FD) and functional redundancy (FR) are important components of community vulnerability [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref009">9</a>]. FD can be regarded as a measure of the number of properties that an assemblage of species possesses, therefore representing the number of ecosystem properties that the assemblage provides to the ecosystem. FR informs about the number of species that play similar functional roles in a community [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref008">8</a>]. In ecosystems, a mix of various functional types of species (i.e., high FD) is necessary in order to ensure sufficient adaptability when facing environmental perturbations [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref009">9</a>] as a higher number of functional “tools” increases the capacity to cope with upcoming environmental challenges. Assessing the functional character and the diversity and redundancy of a community will therefore allow ecosystem functioning and vulnerability to be addressed. As such, FR informs about the vulnerability of the ecosystem. High FR implies that species loss might not necessarily induce any clear, immediate effects on ecosystem functioning, since similar species could compensate functionally [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref010">10</a>]. Thus, FR is thought to influence buffering capacity, and therefore the ability of ecosystems to maintain their functionality when facing stress [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we provide a functional classification of the fish community in the Barents Sea, a sub-Arctic shelf sea off the northern coasts of Russia and Norway. The Barents Sea encompasses both Arctic and Atlantic water masses, inhabited by different fish species [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref012">12</a>] characterized by different traits [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref013">13</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref014">14</a>]. The area is ideal to investigate whole-community structure and community-wide shifts; it is well-studied, with an extensive database, and has strong, natural gradients in environmental characteristics. Furthermore, recent climate warming has resulted in an increase of warm Atlantic water and a decrease of cold Arctic water, and a decline in sea ice coverage in the area ([
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref015">15</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref016">16</a>], and citations therein). In recent years, these environmental perturbations have caused structural reorganisation in the fish community and its trophic configuration (i.e., 
  <span class="italic">borealization</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref017">17</a>] and associated spatial alterations in FD [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref013">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we analyse the spatial patterns in the redundancy of functional groups, and investigate the recent trends in FR associated with documented poleward distributional shifts driven by rapid climate warming. Based on functional traits data, we allocate fish species to functional groups. This information is then integrated with fish composition data, sampled annually from the entire Barents Sea during the period 2004–2012, to assess the spatial distribution and redundancy of each functional group. We use the following two hypotheses:</p>

  <div class="list-item">
   <p>The fish communities in Arctic and Atlantic waters of the Barents Sea are dominated by different functional groups, and therefore different functional processes.</p>

   <p>Recent changes in fish community structure driven by warming have implications for the FR in time and space.</p>
