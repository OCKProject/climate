  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref032">32</a>]. In order to assess and compare the overall trophic status of the functional groups, indicative estimates of each species’ trophic level (TL) were extracted from FishBase [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref033">33</a>]. In order to assess the temporal scales at which individuals from each functional group operate, estimates of each species' longevity were compiled based on literature reviews [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref014">14</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref024">24</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref033">33</a>]. Additional ecological characteristics of the functional groups were assessed and compared by means of estimating maximum body length (ML) and environmental tolerance range of the species, both obtained from the trait matrix. The average values of TL, ML, environmental tolerance range and longevity were calculated for each functional group and compared to the groups using a simple ANOVA (α = 0.05). In cases where species were aggregated to a higher taxonomic level (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Zoarcidae</span> spp.), we calculated average values for the taxon based on values of the constituent species.
