 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the functional group approach allows general, large-scale species composition patterns to be addressed, it tends to mask abundance-related ecological features. Although spatio-temporal patterns in FR appeared to be relatively stable, the cod abundance has rapidly increased in the northern Barents Sea in the later years as a response to a warmer climate [

  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref069">69</a>]. A similar pattern could be recognized in the Large demersals group, where long rough dab currently display a northward distribution shift [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref012">12</a>]. However, such changes may have implications beyond purely spatial ones. Intensified fisheries in the northern Barents Sea is one expected consequence of the northward shift of boreal, commercially valuable species. Fisheries impact species across many functional groups, not only target species, and as such, future Arctic fish communities (e.g., the Long demersals) may need to cope with intensified fishery-induced disturbance. On the other hand, the small (three species) Redfish group displayed a spatial expansion during the study period, to cover the entire Barents Sea in 2012, despite one of the group members (the golden redfish,

  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref070">70</a>]. Redfish share several life history traits that make them sensitive to fishing, exemplified by large body size, high longevity and late maturation [
  <a rid="pone.0207451.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0207451.ref014">14</a>]. Caution is thus required to avoid decimation of this small predatory group of species.
