  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The permutation procedure on the cluster dendrogram suggested a division of the species into six functional groups (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.009). The groups were assigned short names on the basis of typical group characteristics (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207451.g003" href="#pone.0207451.g003">Fig 3</a>). For instance, most of the members of the Long demersals group display an elongated or eel-like body shape, whereas the species of the Redfish group are all redfish belonging to the family 
   <span class="italic">Sebastidae</span>. Although the groupings were based solely on the multivariate analysis of trait data, some groups consisted of phylogenetically closely related species (e.g., the redfish group), due to the effect of phylogenetic proximity on phenotypic similarity.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were large spatial (between cells) differences across the Barents Sea in terms of functional group composition and smaller differences between the years. Of the total inertia in the samples-by-functional groups table of counts (a 273 × 6 matrix), 67.5% was explained by the spatial position and 3.7% by the years. Both these results, which quantify the level of spatial and temporal dependence respectively, are significant (permutation test, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The functional groups varied in the number of species (i.e., 3–24 taxa per functional group; 
   <a rid="pone.0207451.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0207451.t003">Table 3</a>) and with respect to biogeographic composition. The “redfish” and “lumpsuckers” groups, consisting of only three species each, were the smallest functional groups. The “long demersals” group, consisting of 24 taxa, including eelpouts (
   <span class="italic">Lycodes</span> spp.) and wolffish (
   <span class="italic">Anarhichas</span> spp.), constituted the most species-rich functional group and consisted of 12 boreal, three arcto-boreal and 9 Arctic species. The Elasmobranch group consisted of five boreal and one Arctic species, whereas the Lumpsuckers consisted of one boreal and two Arctic species. The three remaining functional groups consisted solely of boreal species.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">FR in the Barents Sea varied between areas and functional groups. Some functional groups displayed persistent spatial patterns (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207451.g004" href="#pone.0207451.g004">Fig 4</a>); for instance, the Elasmobranchs, which primarily consisted of boreal species, were most redundant in the south-west, with decreasing redundancy towards the north-east. The Lumpsuckers, which consisted of a mix of Arctic and boreal species, displayed scattered and variable distributions in the central, northern and eastern Barents Sea. The Long demersals, where half of the species were boreal and the rest either Arctic or arcto-boreal, covered the entire Barents Sea. They were however, most redundant in the central and northern Barents Sea. The Semipelagics, which were boreal, were distributed in the south-west. The redfish and the large demersals, all of which were boreal, displayed the highest redundancy in the south-west and decreased redundancy towards the north-east.
