  <p>Proportion of the Barents Sea covered by the individual functional groups in the period 2004â€“2012, expressed as spatial coverage in %, for 
   <span class="bold">(A)</span> Elasmobranchs, Lumpsuckers and Long demersals, and for 
   <span class="bold">(B)</span> Redfish, Large demersals and Semipelagics. The numbers indicate the actual average functional redundancy for each functional group by year. Circle size indicates the degree of co-occurrence (DCO), i.e. for each functional group and each year, the actual average functional redundancy was divided by the number of taxa in that group.
