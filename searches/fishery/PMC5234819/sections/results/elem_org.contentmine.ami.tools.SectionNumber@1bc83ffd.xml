  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 6-year study period 7966 vessel-days of fishing were reported in the study area, including 1,380 unique days that accounted for roughly 63% of the study period (
   <a rid="pone.0170132.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170132.t003">Table 3</a>). Raw predator tracking data, collected during 394 deployments, provided 11073 tag-days of data that represented 748 unique days (
   <a rid="pone.0170132.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170132.t003">Table 3</a>). Roughly 80% of the available tracking data was concurrent, on a daily basis, with fishing activity in the study area. The average duration of each deployment on penguins during the breeding season lasted 1 to 2 weeks, while average winter deployments provided data for roughly 3 months (
   <a rid="pone.0170132.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170132.t003">Table 3</a>). The average duration of deployments on fur seals was roughly 3 weeks during summer, while overwinter deployments provided data for more than 5 months (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the six years of the study, differences in the seasonal movements of each predator species were observed (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g002" href="#pone.0170132.g002">Fig 2</a>). During the summer breeding season, all predators foraged near their respective breeding locations, with mean maximum foraging ranges being largest for fur seals (97.4 ± 50.5 km) and smallest for gentoo penguins (15.6 ± 6.0 km at Cape Shirreff and 15.3 ± 11.5 km at Admiralty Bay; 
   <a rid="pone.0170132.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170132.t003">Table 3</a>). During winter, fur seals and chinstraps exhibited long-distance movements into the South Pacific and South Atlantic. Fur seals radiated from Cape Shirreff to occupy a wide swath of habitats mainly north of 60°S, including remote, pelagic regions of the central South Pacific; waters surrounding southern South America, the Patagonian shelf, and South Georgia. Mean maximum great circle distances from Cape Shirreff were 2187 ± 1343 km and one female fur seal reached a maximum great circle distance of 4750 km from Cape Shirreff. Chinstrap penguins exhibited longitudinal migrations into habitats mainly south of 60°S through the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas as far west as 158°W (a great-circle distance of 4782 km from Cape Shirreff). Chinstrap penguins also moved as far east as 26°E (a great-circle distance of 1903 km from Cape Shirreff), near the South Sandwich Islands. Despite these long-distance movements, both fur seals and chinstrap penguins occupied areas throughout the Scotia Sea during winter (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g002" href="#pone.0170132.g002">Fig 2</a>). Gentoo penguins also moved away from their breeding colonies during winter, but did not disperse as widely as chinstrap penguins or fur seals. In particular, gentoo penguins tagged at Cape Shirreff typically moved into the southwestern Bransfield Strait and occupied coastal areas along the Antarctic Peninsula during winter, with maximum distances from Cape Shirreff averaging 120 ± 82 km. Adélie penguins were not tracked during winter, but incubation shift and pre-molt movements (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g002" href="#pone.0170132.g002">Fig 2</a>) are indicative of the winter movements undertaken by Adélie penguins that breed in Scotia Arc [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishing was conducted in every SSMU in the study area, but predominantly west of the South Orkney Islands, in the Bransfield Strait, and over the shelf north of the South Shetland Islands (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g003" href="#pone.0170132.g003">Fig 3A</a>). The numbers of tows and total catches of krill were highest in the South Orkney Islands and within the Bransfield Strait (
   <a rid="pone.0170132.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170132.t002">Table 2</a>). Similarly, raw predator tracking data from the two tagging sites were recorded in all SSMUs except in the SSMU southeast of the South Orkney Islands. In general, the combined spatial distribution of penguins and fur seals tended to be broader than that of the fishery. Despite wide coverage by the predators, we note that the predator location data are concentrated near tagging locations at Cape Shirreff and Admiralty Bay (

However, even at the smallest temporal and spatial scales, overlap of tracked predators and the fishery occurred throughout areas north of South Shetland Islands, west of the South Orkney Island groups and within the Bransfield Strait from King George Island in the northeast to the area around Brabant Island and the Danco Coast in the southwest (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The number of times overlap occurred in any grid cell was typically low. On a daily basis at the smallest spatiotemporal scale, the maximum overlap in any grid cell was 20 days, or roughly 3% of the days with concurrent predator and fishery data (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g004" href="#pone.0170132.g004">Fig 4A</a>). The frequency of overlap increased with the temporal and spatial scale considered such that maximum overlap occurred in 52% of the months on a 1° longitude x 0.5° latitude grid (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g004" href="#pone.0170132.g004">Fig 4B</a>) and 100% of the years (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the spatiotemporal scale of our analysis increased, the proportion of grid cells where overlap occurred also increased (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g005" href="#pone.0170132.g005">Fig 5</a>), but the increases occurred at different rates for each respective index of overlap. Overlap with respect to the area occupied by the fishery (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g005" href="#pone.0170132.g005">Fig 5A</a>) increased most rapidly at the smallest scales, with a mean overlap of 10% on the smallest spatiotemporal scale, 38% at the middle scale (1 month, 1° longitude), and up to 70% of the total fished area at the largest scales. The rapid increase in overlap of the fished area at smaller spatial and temporal scales indicates a relatively constrained distribution of the fishery within the concurrent foraging range of all tracked predators. Relative to the total area occupied by the predators at any one time (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g005" href="#pone.0170132.g005">Fig 5B</a>), the initial 10% overlap level observed for the fishery area was not achieved until scales larger than weekly and 0.5° longitude were considered and overlap was roughly 15% at the middle scale. Thereafter, overlap increased to near 90% at the largest spatiotemporal scale, indicating that the fished areas overlap almost all of the annual foraging ranges of predators tracked from just two breeding locales. Overlap in the area occupied by both predators and the fishery (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g005" href="#pone.0170132.g005">Fig 5C</a>) was similar to, but lower than, the pattern of overlap based on predator area alone. The Schoener index, which accounts for both co-occurrence in a grid cell and the proportional use of that area by predators and the fishery, respectively, exhibited a lower absolute level of overlap across all scales, but retained the general pattern of increasing overlap with increasing spatiotemporal scale (

Average maximum dive depths for predators and average net depth in the fishery for 2009–2012 are plotted at a magnified depth scale for day (C) and night (D) to better illustrate depth ranges; the depth of maximum krill density during day or night is marked with a solid horizontal line in panels A through D. Average maximum dive depth for predators and average net depth in the fishery for 2012 to 2014 are plotted for day time (E) and night time (F); for reference, the depth of maximum krill density from 2009–2012 (no krill density data are available for 2012–2014) is marked as a dashed horizontal line.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depth use by predators tracked the diel distributions of krill. During daytime, which accounts for roughly 70% of the time during January and February at Cape Shirreff, the mean maximum depths used by fur seals (32.8 ± 2.2 m) and chinstrap penguins (30.7 ± 2.6 m) were similar, while gentoo penguins generally made deeper dives (51.6 ± 6.1 m; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g008" href="#pone.0170132.g008">Fig 8C</a>). For all predators, mean maximum dive depths were at or just above the depths where krill density was highest (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g008" href="#pone.0170132.g008">Fig 8</a>). Fishing depths during daytime averaged 40.9 ± 4.3 and fell between the mean maximum depths of the predators and the depth of maximum krill density. During night time, the mean maximum depths use by fur seals (26 ± 1.8 m), gentoo (31 ± 21.1 m) and chinstrap penguins (18.9 ± 3.7 m) shoaled, and were, on average, 13.0 ± 7.1 m shallower than daytime depths (
