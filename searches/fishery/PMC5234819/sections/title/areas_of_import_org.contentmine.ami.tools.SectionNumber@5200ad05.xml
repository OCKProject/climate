 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three general locations of overlap occurred in coastal waters near each tagging location, to the west of the South Orkney Islands, and in the southwestern Bransfield Strait warrant further discussion. The density of data from tagged animals was greatest near the summer breeding colonies of our study animals (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g002" href="#pone.0170132.g002">Fig 2B</a>). Thus, we expected higher overlap to occur in the vicinity of Cape Shirreff and Admiralty Bay. Indeed, high rates of overlap occurred along the northern shore of Livingston Island and at the mouth of Admiralty Bay (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g004" href="#pone.0170132.g004">Fig 4A</a>). Fishing activity in the SSMUs adjacent to each tagging site was among the highest in the study region, representing 14.4% of tows and 14.5% of total catch in the Antarctic Peninsula Bransfield Strait East (APBSE) and 9% of all tows and 6.7% of the total catch in the Antarctic Peninsula Drake Passage East (APDPW) during the study period (
  <a rid="pone.0170132.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170132.t003">Table 3</a>). The observed overlap reaffirms prior work to define SSMUs based on likely foraging ranges of penguins and seals [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overlap observed near the South Orkney Islands and in the southwestern Bransfield Strait reveals that potential direct competition for krill between the krill fishery and predators is not limited to local foraging habitats near breeding areas during the summer. Rather, direct predator-fishery interactions may be widespread and occur during winter when predators are distributed more widely. Foraging conditions encountered during winter are considered key drivers of recruitment and overwinter survival in the Antarctic Peninsula region [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref062">62</a>]. The extent of concurrent overlap with fisheries in over-wintering habitats provides a mechanism, namely competition, by which predator survival may be further impacted.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The South Orkney West (SOW) and Bransfield Strait West SSMUs experienced the greatest amount of effort by the fishery during the study period (
  <a rid="pone.0170132.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170132.t002">Table 2</a>), accounting for roughly 63% of total net tows and 68% of total catch combined. In both areas, fishing effort occurred throughout the SSMUs, but there were clear concentrations of effort in relatively small areas within each SSMU. The concentration of effort may indicate the presence of predictable aggregations of krill; such aggregations would likely be important foraging areas for predators [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref023">23</a>]. With respect to predators in these regions, the confluence of the Scotia and Weddell Seas for Adélie and chinstrap penguins has been documented with tracking data during winter [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref027">27</a>] and here we show that concurrent overlap with the fishery also occurred in this general area. These locations near the South Orkney Islands are either focal foraging areas during the non-breeding season (e.g., for Adélie penguins, [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref027">27</a>]) or stopovers along migratory corridors (e.g., for chinstrap penguins [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref025">25</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref027">27</a>] and fur seals [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref063">63</a>]) between the Antarctic Peninsula and the eastern Scotia Sea.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Bransfield Strait, there is evidence from acoustic surveys to further support the argument that predictable aggregations of prey are critical for predators. First, overlap in the Bransfield Strait was highest where mean density of krill was greatest (&gt;150g·m
  <span class="sup">-2</span>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170132.g006" href="#pone.0170132.g006">Fig 6</a>). Furthermore, unpublished data from the U.S. AMLR program suggests that estimates of krill density throughout the Bransfield Strait during winter are higher relative to other locations and seasons around the South Shetland Islands. Predators are known to concentrate foraging effort in such “hotspots” in the Antarctic Peninsula region [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref064">64</a>], and the southwestern Bransfield Strait is a key foraging habitat during the non-breeding period for numerous seabirds and marine mammals [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref064">64</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref065">65</a>]. Given that the background dynamic of sea ice advance and retreat can affect the ability of predators and the fishery to access such hotspots, it is likely that such predictable locations of krill aggregations promote the occurrence of overlap when environmental conditions permit access by the fishery. While the frequency of overlap in these more distant areas was low, the observation of concurrent presence of predators from only two sites and the fishery nonetheless highlights the importance of such small areas within SSMUs for both predators and the fishery.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the depth distributions of predators and the krill fishery overlapped in the vicinity of Cape Shirreff. Predators tracked the vertical diel migration of krill more closely than the fishery, but the data suggest that all predators and the fishery focused effort on depths where krill density was highest during both day and night. We caution that the comparison of depth use is based on multi-year averages and does not represent concurrent use of vertical habitat. Nevertheless, breeding locations of central place forages may be determined, in part, by proximity to predictable aggregations of prey [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref021">21</a>]. If so, then average depth use may provide an integrated estimate of critical foraging habitat. The data suggest that separation between predators during the day was marginally greater (13 ± 10 m) than during night (8.1 ± 3.7 m), consistent with expectations of niche partitioning among predators with similar dietary preferences. In particular, greater krill density throughout the upper 50m of the water column during night may relax competitive conditions among predators and allow greater overlap in depth use. Against this backdrop of depth use by the predators, it is notable that average fishing depths fall directly within the range used by the predators. The shared use of depths with high krill densities by predators and the fishery further support the argument that predators and fisheries compete for krill.
