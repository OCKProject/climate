 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used position data from 394 deployments of ARGOS and archival FastLoc
  <span class="sup">©</span> GPS satellite telemetry tags. At-sea positions were estimated during all summer breeding periods, 2009–2014, on penguins with ARGOS tags. Location estimates during the pup-rearing period for fur seals were estimated with both ARGOS (2009–2010) and GPS (2009–2014) tags (
  <a rid="pone.0170132.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170132.t001">Table 1</a>). We also used data collected with ARGOS tags from two overwinter studies of fur seals, chinstrap and gentoo penguins in 2010 and 2011 (
  <a rid="pone.0170132.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170132.t001">Table 1</a>). Summer deployments provided location estimates whenever the tag was wet and for up to one hour after continuous dry conditions were recorded by on-board saltwater sensors. Winter deployments on penguins were duty cycled to provide position estimates for 12 hrs every third day. The ARGOS telemetry instruments used during these tracking studies included SPOT4 and SPOT5 satellite tags (Wildlife Computers, Inc. Redmond, WA, USA), and KiwiSat 101 satellite tags (Sirtrack, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand). The FastLoc
  <span class="sup">©</span> GPS tags were Mk10 tags (Wildlife Computers, Redmond, WA, USA).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depth data collected during foraging dives by chinstrap and gentoo penguins and fur seals were recorded with time-depth records (TDR) at Cape Shirreff (
  <a rid="pone.0170132.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0170132.t001">Table 1</a>). For penguins, foraging dives near breeding colonies were recorded at 1s intervals with Mk9 TDRs (Wildlife Computers, Redmond, WA, USA) from January through February. Fur seal foraging dives over the first 6 foraging trips following parturition, occurring from early December into February, were recorded at 2s intervals using Mk10 TDRs (Wildlife Computers, Redmond, WA, USA). The dive data were processed to identify maximum depths for each dive using Wildlife Computers Instrument Helper (Version 3.0). Only dives exceeding 5m in depth were included in our analysis. The 5m cutoff was used to remove porpoising during travel and is consistent with prior analyses for penguins [

  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref044">44</a>]. The 5m cutoff is deeper than previously used cutoffs for fur seals (e.g. 2m [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref045">45</a>]), but inspection of the data suggested that 5m was appropriate, and the estimates of mean maximum dive depths presented here are similar to those previously reported for Antarctic fur seals [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All telemetry instruments were attached directly to the back plumage or pelage using adhesives, either quick-drying epoxy or cyanoacrylate glue. For penguins, small plastic cable ties were threaded through underlying feathers and closed over the top of the tag as an additional fastener. Instruments were recovered from all animals that returned to the tagging locations after the summer or winter observation periods. In total, the instrument recovery rate for this study was roughly 75%.</p>
