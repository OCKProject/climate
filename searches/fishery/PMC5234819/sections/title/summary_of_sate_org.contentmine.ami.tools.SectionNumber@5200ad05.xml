 <div class="title">Summary of satellite telemetry deployments and temporal coverage of fishing activity during 2009â€“2014.</div>
 <p>Average deployment duration and maximum distance from tagging locations were calculated from the entire data set. Total and unique days were calculated only for data within the study area (-70S to -57S and -70W to -30W). For the fishery, N is the total number of vessels across all years and the average deployment is the average time, in days, spent in the study area by each vessel.</p>
