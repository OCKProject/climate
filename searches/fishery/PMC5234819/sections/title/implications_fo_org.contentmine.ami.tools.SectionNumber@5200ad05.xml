 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosystem-based fisheries management of fisheries that target forage species, like krill, involves the management of risks to the prey resource, predators, and the marine ecosystem in general [

Resolving trade-offs between the acceptable risks to prey, predators, and fisheries is a general challenge for implementation of EBFM. Within the CCAMLR, the concept of the SSMU was an important step toward managing such risks by erecting discrete management units with potentially distinct catch allocations intended to limit the risk of negative impacts of localized fishing on krill-dependent predators. This step may, however, be insufficient; ecosystem modeling work has demonstrated that simply distributing krill catches among SSMUs may not be without risk to dependent predators [

  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref053">53</a>]. Furthermore, our results indicate that direct interactions between predators and fisheries are common at scales smaller than SSMUs. This suggests that allocations of krill catches in the Scotia Sea should consider how to minimize the concentration of fishing effort within SSMUs, particularly if localized fishing overlaps with the foraging ranges of predators. Such spatial limitations on catch are, however, not without risk to performance of the fishery [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More generally, while a consensus view is emerging that a relatively large percentage of prey biomass be reserved (i.e. not caught by fisheries) to meet predator demands, e.g., about 33% of standing biomass [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref066">66</a>] or 40% of pre-exploitation biomass [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref002">2</a>], our results suggest that equal consideration should be given to the spatial distribution of catch limits. Spatial heterogeneity in prey distributions, predator foraging areas, and fishery operations imply that direct interactions of the prey-predator-fishery system often may be localized relative to the larger marine ecosystem being managed. For example, prey density in marine systems may be enhanced by local aggregative mechanisms, whether oceanographic or bathymetric; such areas are likely to be favored by predators and fisheries. This is supported by our maps of overlap, which identified areas where concurrent occupation by predator and fisheries occurred repeatedly over time. A concentration of fishing effort in such localized areas may negatively impact predators, particularly central-place foragers like numerous breeding seabird and pinniped species [
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref003">3</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref067">67</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0170132.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0170132.ref068">68</a>]. To mitigate potential negative effects of fisheries on predators in critical foraging areas, it thus seems necessary to specify not only relatively low harvest rates for forage fish fisheries, but to identify areas where the risk to predators may be greatest and implement management measures that account for high-risk areas. Such information, as presented in simple overlap maps, can advance EBFM efforts by directly including predator-derived indices in a risk-assessment framework.
