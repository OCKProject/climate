  <div class="title">Overlap of krill, predators, and the fishery in depth.</div>
  <p>A) Overlap during day. B) Overlap during night. Transparent bars in the left hand panels represent mean ± 1 SD in depth use for each predator and the fishery. Average maximum dive depths for predators and average net depth in the fishery for 2009–2012 are plotted at a magnified depth scale for day (C) and night (D) to better illustrate depth ranges; the depth of maximum krill density during day or night is marked with a solid horizontal line in panels A through D. Average maximum dive depth for predators and average net depth in the fishery for 2012 to 2014 are plotted for day time (E) and night time (F); for reference, the depth of maximum krill density from 2009–2012 (no krill density data are available for 2012–2014) is marked as a dashed horizontal line. Note that y-axes in panels C through F differ from panels A and B.</p>
