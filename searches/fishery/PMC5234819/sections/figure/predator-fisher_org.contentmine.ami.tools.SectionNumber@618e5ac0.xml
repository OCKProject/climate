  <div class="title">Predator-fishery overlap and mean summer krill density in FAO Subarea 48.1.</div>
  <p>Data are binned to a 0.25° longitude x 0.125°latitude grid. The time scale for overlap is 1 month. Mean summer acoustic krill density is overlaid as red circles whose diameter is proportional to krill density. The corresponding quantiles of the krill density distribution are indicated in the legend. Boundaries of SSMUs are plotted as dashed lines. Overlap in depth.</p>
