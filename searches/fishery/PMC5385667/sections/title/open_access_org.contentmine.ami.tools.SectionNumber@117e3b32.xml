 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Open access fisheries do not have well-defined access rights; access rights either are completely absent or are not enforced (Sumaila 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2012</a>). Under open access, the fish stock is rival but non-excludable, meaning that the right to fish is accorded to anyone, sometimes with a license or a nominal fee accessible to anyone. Individuals have incentives to maximize their profits, even at the expense of capturing as many fish as possible in a short time (Hardin 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">1968</a>; Costanza et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1998</a>), which can lead to unsustainable harvest levels and destructive fishing practices that will eventually erode the economic value of the fishery as well (Worm et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">2009</a>). Additionally, unlimited access can create a competitive ‘race to fish’ to catch fish before others do, which further exacerbates overfishing and incentivizes over-capitalization, redundant effort, and inefficient timing of harvest, again lowering the profitability of the fishery (Pauly et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2002</a>; Costello et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2008</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>). Many fisheries around the world are managed as open access; however, open access systems have a poor record of performance in terms of sustainability (Gordon 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">1954</a>; Costello et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>) and are a primary contributor to the stock collapse of many of the world’s fisheries (Pauly et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2002</a>). In addition, for overexploited fisheries, reducing fishing pressure is the principal means of reducing the impacts of climate change (Brander 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2007</a>), and this may be difficult to achieve under open access regimes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In open access fisheries, harvest decisions are often made with limited consideration of ecological information or economic costs and benefits to society (Costanza et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1998</a>), and there is often low compliance with regulations due to the lack of well-defined access rights and enforcement (Sumaila 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2012</a>). An open access system lacks allocation of property rights, which have been demonstrated to create incentives for conserving biodiversity and habitats. Thus, in the absence of rights, open access does not promote the conservation of habitats and ecosystems (ECR-2), nor sustainable management (ERC-1), and intensive and sometimes destructive fishing prevails over sustainable use of the resource (Grafton et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2006</a>). Well-known fisheries collapses have occurred in open access systems, like the Canadian Atlantic cod (McCay et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2011</a>), in part because adaptive management (SCR-1) is discouraged by the regulatory regime.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Large open access systems may also experience complex stakeholder and institutional networks (Fidelman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2013</a>). For example in the Peruvian anchoveta, formal institutions are slow in responding to climate changes (Badjeck et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2009</a>), constraining effective multi-level governance (SCR-4), and making community-based management (SCR-6) more difficult (Badjeck et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2009</a>). In fact, management involvement of stakeholders who do not have a long-term interest in the fishery may even have negative effects on sustainability (Botsford et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">1997</a>), as they may lack stewardship incentives (SCR-3) (Costello et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2008</a>). In theory for open access, fishers respond to profitability, entering a fishery depending on the expected economic returns at a given time. In this context, fishers enter and exit the fishery more freely, which may help them buffer against stock fluctuations or declining stocks by having developed alternative sources of income (livelihood diversification (SCR-2)) (Allison and Ellis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2001</a>). However, this flexibility may be limited by the high capital investments in many open access systems that make it more difficult to exit the fishery, and for the poorest fishers, who may remain in the fishery despite severely declining stocks (e.g., Cinner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2009a</a>). Fisher mobility can be high in open access systems, and fishers may be accustomed to shifting from one area to another in the search for productive stocks (SCR-5) (Sumaila et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2011</a>). On the ecological side, however, fisher mobility is related to a decrease in ecological resilience due to the serial depletion of stocks and to a lower capacity to monitor and determine population dynamics, making adaptive management more difficult (SCR-1) (DeYoung et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2008</a>; Leith et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2014</a>).
