 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limited entry, also known as restricted access, occurs when a management institution establishes conditions (e.g., licenses, gear limitations, area/seasonal restrictions) that determine and limit who is able to fish (Townsend 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">1990</a>). Most commonly in limited access, there are a fixed number of licenses issued that permit access to harvest the resource, as is the case for many commercial fisheries around the world (Hilborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the different possible restrictions on access, fisheries can underperform or fail in economic and biological terms due to excessive capital investment (Hilborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>), redundant effort, inefficient timing of harvest, or other inefficiencies that are also common to the open access regime (Costello et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>). Indeed, failure to control effort can still lead a limited entry fishery to near open access overcapacity and effort conditions, with the subsequent negative implications for recovery under climate change (Brander 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2007</a>). This overcapacity provides no incentives to fishers to engage in sustainable management (Hilborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>; Defeo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some limited entry fisheries have resulted in sustainable harvest (ECR-1) (Townsend 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">1990</a>, Hilborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2003</a>), generally when institutional systems provide incentives to individual operators to motivate sustainable harvest (Hilborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>). However, solely restricting access in order to manage fisheries does not guarantee sustainable harvest or conservation of biodiversity or habitat (ECR-2) (Hilborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>). Limited entry per se does not incentivize fishers to respond to fishery stressors (ERC-3) and avoid discards, for example, as evidenced in the US west coast trawling fishery that discarded 40 percent of catches (Hilborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>). Successful examples exist, however, under mandatory controls to avoid by-catch, such as the East Australian longline fishery that uses limited entry spatial zones to conserve Bluefin tuna (Hobday et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2010</a>). In regard to social resilience, limited entry as a management system usually fails to address stewardship (SCR-3) due to the low level of access rights, but may be flexible for engaging in alternative livelihoods (SCR-2) for the same reason (Allison and Ellis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2001</a>). The top-down nature of restricting access frequently hinders community-based management (SCR-6), and in some cases also produces a mismatch between management and biological scales, as in the example of the Atlantic tuna fishery (Berkes 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2006</a>). A detailed analysis of effective multi-level governance (SCR-4) has been conducted in the Australian Great Barrier Reef fisheries (Fidelman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2013</a>). In this region, the potential of a multi-level approach to help the system adapt to climate change appears to be threatened by a complex and fragmented governance system (Fidelman et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike open access, limited entry systems could be implemented more effectively from a community-based basis (SCR-6), as shown by hake and pollock cooperatives in the United States (Hilborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>). However, community-based management within a limited entry setting may not be sufficient for achieving sustainable use of the resource, as in the case of the Galapagos sea cucumber fishery (Defeo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>), where the fishery was incapable of implementing adaptive management (SCR-1). In contrast, limited access regulations can be relatively easily adjustedâ€”including changing the number or cost of licenses, or altering area and gear restrictions based on seasonal projections (Wilen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">1988</a>; Townsend 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">1990</a>). This flexibility can potentially be beneficial for adaptive management (SCR-1), and for allowing fishing in new areas (SCR-5) when stocks shift their distributions (Cheung et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2012</a>).
