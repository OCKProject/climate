 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a detailed review of the literature, we identify three ecological climate resilience (ECR) and six socio-economic climate resilience (SCR) criteria for assessing the resilience potential of fisheries management systems. We summarize these criteria in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, where we include the rationale supporting each criterion and references that support the link between resilience and the specific criterion. A more detailed description of the different criteria and supporting literature is available in 10.1007/s13280-016-0850-1.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although we classify resilience criteria as either social or ecological, feedbacks and interactions exist whereby ecological criteria can enhance or erode social resilience, and vice versa, creating complex tradeoffs and synergies within fisheries’ resilience options. Based on arguments made in the literature, the nature of these social–ecological resilience interactions for the nine criteria is represented in Fig.

  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological criteria like Sustainable and age-diverse populations (ECR-1) and Conservation of biodiversity and habitats (ECR-2) have clear ecological benefits for resilience (Levin and Lubchenco 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">2008</a>; Perry et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">2010</a>; Bernhardt and Leslie 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2013</a>), which can also enhance social resilience as fishers may have a more secure source of income when fish populations are sustainably managed (ECR-1). These social benefits can also arise in the longer run as habitats and ecosystems are in a good state (ECR-2). Managing existing stressors (ECR-3) is expected to increase ecological resilience (Barange and Perry 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2009</a>), but can have varying effects for social resilience. For example, decreasing stressors like pollution may increase revenues due to an increase in quality/quantity of fish, but can also compromise livelihood diversification through more restrictive regulations placed on other sectors (i.e., agriculture, Badjeck et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social criteria, specifically adaptive management (SCR-1) is likely to increase ecological resilience by incorporating learning and new science into management (Plaganyi et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">2011</a>; Rivera et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2014</a>), which can increase the likelihood that fishing pressure is sustainable and prepare fishers for abrupt and unexpected changes (Lehodey et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2006</a>). Diversified livelihoods (SCR-2) may promote social resilience by decreasing reliance on fisheries (Cinner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2009a</a>; Defeo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>; Pinsky and Mantua 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2014</a>), but the impacts on ecological resilience remain unclear as fishers may engage in other activities that are damaging for the ecosystem, and/or lack stewardship incentives if they can easily exit the sector. Stewardship incentives (SCR-3) can increase ecological resilience as fishers may advocate for sustainable management. Stewardship is promoted under long-lasting access to the resource, which also contributes to social resilience (Essington et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>). Multi-level governance (SCR-4) increases social resilience by providing flexibility in resource management, for example by matching management scales to biological scales of the resources. Multi-level governance can also facilitate the implementation of adaptive management that increases ecological resilience (Hughes et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2005</a>). The Maine lobster fishery provides a good example of multi-level governance that led to careful monitoring, adaptive management, and sustainable harvest of the resource (Schultz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fisher mobility (SCR-5) can increase social resilience, especially for industrial fisheries (Pinsky and Mantua 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">2014</a>) that have the capacity to change fishing grounds easily (Allison and Ellis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2001</a>). For small-scale fisheries, mobility can be also be beneficial for accessing new areas that become more productive due to shifting stocks. In both cases, fisher mobility may decrease ecological resilience as fishers can deplete one area and move to the next, but may increase social resilience as fishers access new fishing grounds. This potential positive effect of mobility for social resilience could be limited, however, by negative interactions among ‘original’ and ‘new’ fishers in a given area. Finally, Community-based management (SCR-6) is expected to increase social resilience by enhancing the sense of stewardship and sensitivity of fishers to socio-economic constraints, and by allowing for the incorporation of local knowledge of the resource (Gutierrez et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2011</a>). Community-based management is also a potentially useful approach to generate adaptive capacity (Rivera et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">2015</a>). Adaptive capacity refers to the ability to anticipate and respond to disturbances, and to minimize, cope with, and recover from their consequences (Maldonado and Moreno-Sánchez 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">2014</a>). Community-based management has also been shown to improve compliance with rules (e.g., catch limits, size limits), monitoring, and surveillance (Gutierrez et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2011</a>) that will directly benefit ecological resilience.
