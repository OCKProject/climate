 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fisheries regulatory systems vary in their approaches to harvest control rules, fisher behavioral incentives, and adaptability to a changing environment. We examine specific regulatory approaches ranging from open access to limited entry to rights-based systems (ITQs and TURFs), and discuss their likelihood of meeting the above resilience criteria. To illustrate the potential effects of regulatory regimes on fisheries resilience, we collect a number of examples from the literature that we describe here and summarize in Table

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Open access</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Open access fisheries do not have well-defined access rights; access rights either are completely absent or are not enforced (Sumaila 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2012</a>). Under open access, the fish stock is rival but non-excludable, meaning that the right to fish is accorded to anyone, sometimes with a license or a nominal fee accessible to anyone. Individuals have incentives to maximize their profits, even at the expense of capturing as many fish as possible in a short time (Hardin 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">1968</a>; Costanza et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1998</a>), which can lead to unsustainable harvest levels and destructive fishing practices that will eventually erode the economic value of the fishery as well (Worm et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">2009</a>). Additionally, unlimited access can create a competitive ‘race to fish’ to catch fish before others do, which further exacerbates overfishing and incentivizes over-capitalization, redundant effort, and inefficient timing of harvest, again lowering the profitability of the fishery (Pauly et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2002</a>; Costello et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2008</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>). Many fisheries around the world are managed as open access; however, open access systems have a poor record of performance in terms of sustainability (Gordon 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">1954</a>; Costello et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>) and are a primary contributor to the stock collapse of many of the world’s fisheries (Pauly et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2002</a>). In addition, for overexploited fisheries, reducing fishing pressure is the principal means of reducing the impacts of climate change (Brander 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2007</a>), and this may be difficult to achieve under open access regimes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In open access fisheries, harvest decisions are often made with limited consideration of ecological information or economic costs and benefits to society (Costanza et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">1998</a>), and there is often low compliance with regulations due to the lack of well-defined access rights and enforcement (Sumaila 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">2012</a>). An open access system lacks allocation of property rights, which have been demonstrated to create incentives for conserving biodiversity and habitats. Thus, in the absence of rights, open access does not promote the conservation of habitats and ecosystems (ECR-2), nor sustainable management (ERC-1), and intensive and sometimes destructive fishing prevails over sustainable use of the resource (Grafton et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2006</a>). Well-known fisheries collapses have occurred in open access systems, like the Canadian Atlantic cod (McCay et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" href="#CR74">2011</a>), in part because adaptive management (SCR-1) is discouraged by the regulatory regime.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Large open access systems may also experience complex stakeholder and institutional networks (Fidelman et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2013</a>). For example in the Peruvian anchoveta, formal institutions are slow in responding to climate changes (Badjeck et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2009</a>), constraining effective multi-level governance (SCR-4), and making community-based management (SCR-6) more difficult (Badjeck et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2009</a>). In fact, management involvement of stakeholders who do not have a long-term interest in the fishery may even have negative effects on sustainability (Botsford et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">1997</a>), as they may lack stewardship incentives (SCR-3) (Costello et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2008</a>). In theory for open access, fishers respond to profitability, entering a fishery depending on the expected economic returns at a given time. In this context, fishers enter and exit the fishery more freely, which may help them buffer against stock fluctuations or declining stocks by having developed alternative sources of income (livelihood diversification (SCR-2)) (Allison and Ellis 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2001</a>). However, this flexibility may be limited by the high capital investments in many open access systems that make it more difficult to exit the fishery, and for the poorest fishers, who may remain in the fishery despite severely declining stocks (e.g., Cinner et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2009a</a>). Fisher mobility can be high in open access systems, and fishers may be accustomed to shifting from one area to another in the search for productive stocks (SCR-5) (Sumaila et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2011</a>). On the ecological side, however, fisher mobility is related to a decrease in ecological resilience due to the serial depletion of stocks and to a lower capacity to monitor and determine population dynamics, making adaptive management more difficult (SCR-1) (DeYoung et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2008</a>; Leith et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">2014</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limited entry</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Limited entry, also known as restricted access, occurs when a management institution establishes conditions (e.g., licenses, gear limitations, area/seasonal restrictions) that determine and limit who is able to fish (Townsend 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">1990</a>). Most commonly in limited access, there are a fixed number of licenses issued that permit access to harvest the resource, as is the case for many commercial fisheries around the world (Hilborn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the different possible restrictions on access, fisheries can underperform or fail in economic and biological terms due to excessive capital investment (Hilborn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>), redundant effort, inefficient timing of harvest, or other inefficiencies that are also common to the open access regime (Costello et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>). Indeed, failure to control effort can still lead a limited entry fishery to near open access overcapacity and effort conditions, with the subsequent negative implications for recovery under climate change (Brander 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2007</a>). This overcapacity provides no incentives to fishers to engage in sustainable management (Hilborn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>; Defeo et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some limited entry fisheries have resulted in sustainable harvest (ECR-1) (Townsend 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">1990</a>, Hilborn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2003</a>), generally when institutional systems provide incentives to individual operators to motivate sustainable harvest (Hilborn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>). However, solely restricting access in order to manage fisheries does not guarantee sustainable harvest or conservation of biodiversity or habitat (ECR-2) (Hilborn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>). Limited entry per se does not incentivize fishers to respond to fishery stressors (ERC-3) and avoid discards, for example, as evidenced in the US west coast trawling fishery that discarded 40 percent of catches (Hilborn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>). Successful examples exist, however, under mandatory controls to avoid by-catch, such as the East Australian longline fishery that uses limited entry spatial zones to conserve Bluefin tuna (Hobday et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2010</a>). In regard to social resilience, limited entry as a management system usually fails to address stewardship (SCR-3) due to the low level of access rights, but may be flexible for engaging in alternative livelihoods (SCR-2) for the same reason (Allison and Ellis 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2001</a>). The top-down nature of restricting access frequently hinders community-based management (SCR-6), and in some cases also produces a mismatch between management and biological scales, as in the example of the Atlantic tuna fishery (Berkes 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2006</a>). A detailed analysis of effective multi-level governance (SCR-4) has been conducted in the Australian Great Barrier Reef fisheries (Fidelman et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2013</a>). In this region, the potential of a multi-level approach to help the system adapt to climate change appears to be threatened by a complex and fragmented governance system (Fidelman et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2013</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike open access, limited entry systems could be implemented more effectively from a community-based basis (SCR-6), as shown by hake and pollock cooperatives in the United States (Hilborn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>). However, community-based management within a limited entry setting may not be sufficient for achieving sustainable use of the resource, as in the case of the Galapagos sea cucumber fishery (Defeo et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>), where the fishery was incapable of implementing adaptive management (SCR-1). In contrast, limited access regulations can be relatively easily adjusted—including changing the number or cost of licenses, or altering area and gear restrictions based on seasonal projections (Wilen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" href="#CR101">1988</a>; Townsend 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">1990</a>). This flexibility can potentially be beneficial for adaptive management (SCR-1), and for allowing fishing in new areas (SCR-5) when stocks shift their distributions (Cheung et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2012</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual transferable quotas (ITQs)</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catch share systems such as individual transferable quotas (ITQs) allocate to owners the right to harvest a specified proportion of the total allowable catch (TAC), where rights are divisible, leasable, and transferable among users (Costello et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>). Fish stocks are usually managed at a regional level where the responsible institution sets the TAC with which users must comply. ITQs are typically non-spatial, in the sense that stocks are often mobile and participants can harvest these stocks anywhere as long as they operate within agreed upon jurisdictional limits. This flexibility can help in adapting to climate change shifting stocks, but past examples have shown how unanticipated environmental regime shifts, such as those expected from climate change, pose serious challenges for maintaining international cooperation for transboundary stocks under ITQs, as for example the Pacific salmon conflict between the US and Canada (Miller and Munro 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2004</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ITQs vary in design (e.g., tenure length, rules regarding transferability), which may impact resilience. For example, ITQs have been observed to decrease variability in landings and exploitation rates for multi-species fisheries, but this effect is only present when the ITQ right is durable and secure (Essington et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>), namely when rights have an appropriately long tenure. In fact, secure rights have also been shown to provide higher asset values from the fishery (Grainger and Costello 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2011</a>). It is widely recognized that ITQ fisheries are less likely to experience a collapse in landings or to have excessive overfishing, and they typically lead to better compliance with catch limits compared to the absence of rights (Townsend 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">1990</a>; Worm et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">2006</a>; Costello et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2008</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>; Essington et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>; Melnychuk et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2012</a>; van Putten et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2013</a>). Well-designed ITQs can lead fishers to support lower TACs (Costello et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>), and to avoid short-term resource degradation (Essington et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>). Long-term rights can also in some cases promote the conservation of non-target species or habitats (ECR-2). One example is fishers voluntarily retiring bottom longlines known to damage corals (Arnason 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2002</a>). However, when ITQs are allocated only to target species, there may be little incentive to avoid by-catch of non-target species, and therefore multi-species ITQs have been created to diminish by-catch discards (Costello et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Access rights better align users’ economic incentives with ecological goals (Essington et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>). In an ITQ fishery, quota owners have incentives to maintain the targeted resource at a sustainable limit (ECR-1), and in some cases there is evidence of stock recovery (Hentrich and Salomon 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2006</a>). Chu (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2009</a>) reviewed 20 ITQ fisheries around the world finding that 12 stocks were improved after ITQ implementation, but they conclude that additional measures are still necessary to promote recovery, such as good enforcement and monitoring, or implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management (Chu 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2009</a>). ITQs can promote stewardship that enhances social resilience by instilling a longer-term perspective in resource management (SCR-3) and promoting decisions that maximize long-term profitability (Essington et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>). For example, voluntary surveillance and monitoring institutions have been established under New Zealand ITQ fisheries (ECR-3) (Hentrich and Salomon 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2006</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multi-level governance can be possible, although ITQ systems are usually designed as top-down management institutions (SCR-4). An exception is the Netherlands ITQ system that is based on local management groups, and emerged from a co-management system between regional producer organizations (Hentrich and Salomon 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2006</a>). ITQs may not facilitate diversified livelihoods (SCR-2), for example fishers exiting New Zealand’s ITQ systems were found to lack any alternative livelihood option (citation). Fishing fleet mobility, given that rights are over a stock rather than over a territory, contributes to social resilience by allowing vessel operators to access fish stocks that vary in or shift their distribution so long as they do not shift outside of the jurisdiction of the ITQ system (SCR-5). Higher mobility is most likely in technology-intensive commercial fisheries, where larger operators may be able to change their operation in response to fish redistributions (Fulton 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2011</a>; Holbrook and Johnson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2014</a>). However, there will be important constraints to this flexibility, related to competition for new areas and restrictions imposed by international borders (Cheung et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2012</a>), as well as governance problems due to the changes in species’ distributions across national borders and the resulting implications for management institutions (Berkes 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2006</a>). Miller and Munro (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2004</a>) propose side payments between two countries as a way to increase ITQ flexibility under climate change when countries face an environmental regime shift and the access to the resource varies in time. Finally, and despite the fact that little progress has been made in incorporating community-based management into ITQ systems (Arnason 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2005</a>), the two approaches can be compatible (SCR-6), as observed for the case of the Tasmanian lobster fishery. There the success was due to a combination of ITQs with a strong tradition of participatory management (van Putten et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2013</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries (TURFs) define property rights over spatial areas of the ocean, as opposed to rights over a portion of the catch (Costello et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>). TURFs are fixed in space and provide concessions to individual fishers or unions/cooperatives to manage the resources. Monitoring and enforcement typically depends on the owners, while fisheries agencies are commonly responsible for establishing the overall total allowable catch (TAC). TURFs constitute a common near-shore fisheries management system in many countries such as Chile, Spain, Japan, and Mexico (Wilen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TURF fisheries that are managed through incentive-based participation and effective enforcement may be better able to withstand climate impacts (Hilborn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2003</a>), and thus be more durable against environmental change. For example in Chile, TURFs resulted in increased abundance and size of managed and unmanaged species in comparison with open access areas (Gelcich et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2012</a>; ECR-1). A survey of species and habitats inside and outside of several TURFs in Chile showed that reef fish species had significantly higher species richness, biomass, and density in TURFs compared with open access areas (ECR-2), even though these are not the managed species under property rights regimes (Gelcich et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2012</a>). In Galicia, Spain the TURF system includes advisors working with fisher cooperatives, who facilitate and support decision-making processes and play a key role in communication between fishers, scientists, and policy makers (Macho et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2013</a>). These strategies can in many cases allow for adaptive (SCR-1) and community-based management (SCR-6) (Hilborn et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>; Defeo et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>). Having spatial property rights may also create incentives for avoiding other anthropogenic pressures that lead to habitat destruction (ECR-3). In TURFs, fishers tend to more actively monitor their territories (Gelcich et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2008</a>), protecting against sources of habitat destruction and pollution. Additionally, spatial property rights provide incentives for fishers to combat poaching, even giving fishers direct authority over surveillance. For example, in the Spanish Asturias TURF system for goose barnacle, members actively engage in surveillance to prevent illegal harvest (Rivera et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2014</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since TURFs give exclusive control over the target species in a given area, they create incentives for broader ecosystem-wide stewardship (Costello et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>), thus reducing fishing mortality and contributing to the ecological resilience of the fish populations (ECR-1) (Defeo et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>). Additionally, social resilience is increased by maintaining the stock at desirable levels for a longer-term provision of services (SCR-3) (Defeo et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>). Ownership of an area can also allow TURF owners to generate revenues through other compatible activities such as tourism, recreation, and aquaculture—thus diversifying local livelihoods and enhancing social resilience (SCR-2). For example, research has shown that TURFs in Chile have led to a high level of diversified income sources for the fishers involved (Moreno and Revenga 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">2012</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The governance of TURFS can include some top-down control but is generally community-based, which allows both for a participative bottom-up and multi-level governance structure involving the local cooperatives and/or unions of fishers and local and regional institutions in the governance process (SRC-4) (Ovando et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2013</a>). The Asturias goose barnacle TURF system has promoted the incorporation of traditional knowledge into management and the matching of resource and management scales (Rivera et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2014</a>). On-site decision-making also helps in designing management plans and rules that avoid perverse incentives such as the ‘race to fish’ or subsidizing overcapacity fleets and related industries (Pauly et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2002</a>). For example in Japan, the institutional flexibility of the TURF system allowed for the bottom-up creation of new management associations for particular species when necessary (Wilen et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">2012</a>). Regarding fisher mobility, TURFs inhibit movement because access rights are to specific fishing grounds (e.g., Aburto et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2013</a>). Their spatial nature causes TURFs to be potentially worse than ITQs, limited entry, or open access in terms of promoting fisher mobility, which could be quite problematic for resilience when fish stocks exhibit major shifts in distribution (SCR-5).
