 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catch share systems such as individual transferable quotas (ITQs) allocate to owners the right to harvest a specified proportion of the total allowable catch (TAC), where rights are divisible, leasable, and transferable among users (Costello et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>). Fish stocks are usually managed at a regional level where the responsible institution sets the TAC with which users must comply. ITQs are typically non-spatial, in the sense that stocks are often mobile and participants can harvest these stocks anywhere as long as they operate within agreed upon jurisdictional limits. This flexibility can help in adapting to climate change shifting stocks, but past examples have shown how unanticipated environmental regime shifts, such as those expected from climate change, pose serious challenges for maintaining international cooperation for transboundary stocks under ITQs, as for example the Pacific salmon conflict between the US and Canada (Miller and Munro 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2004</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ITQs vary in design (e.g., tenure length, rules regarding transferability), which may impact resilience. For example, ITQs have been observed to decrease variability in landings and exploitation rates for multi-species fisheries, but this effect is only present when the ITQ right is durable and secure (Essington et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>), namely when rights have an appropriately long tenure. In fact, secure rights have also been shown to provide higher asset values from the fishery (Grainger and Costello 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2011</a>). It is widely recognized that ITQ fisheries are less likely to experience a collapse in landings or to have excessive overfishing, and they typically lead to better compliance with catch limits compared to the absence of rights (Townsend 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">1990</a>; Worm et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" href="#CR103">2006</a>; Costello et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2008</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>; Essington et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>; Melnychuk et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">2012</a>; van Putten et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2013</a>). Well-designed ITQs can lead fishers to support lower TACs (Costello et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>), and to avoid short-term resource degradation (Essington et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>). Long-term rights can also in some cases promote the conservation of non-target species or habitats (ECR-2). One example is fishers voluntarily retiring bottom longlines known to damage corals (Arnason 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2002</a>). However, when ITQs are allocated only to target species, there may be little incentive to avoid by-catch of non-target species, and therefore multi-species ITQs have been created to diminish by-catch discards (Costello et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Access rights better align users’ economic incentives with ecological goals (Essington et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>). In an ITQ fishery, quota owners have incentives to maintain the targeted resource at a sustainable limit (ECR-1), and in some cases there is evidence of stock recovery (Hentrich and Salomon 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2006</a>). Chu (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2009</a>) reviewed 20 ITQ fisheries around the world finding that 12 stocks were improved after ITQ implementation, but they conclude that additional measures are still necessary to promote recovery, such as good enforcement and monitoring, or implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management (Chu 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2009</a>). ITQs can promote stewardship that enhances social resilience by instilling a longer-term perspective in resource management (SCR-3) and promoting decisions that maximize long-term profitability (Essington et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>). For example, voluntary surveillance and monitoring institutions have been established under New Zealand ITQ fisheries (ECR-3) (Hentrich and Salomon 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2006</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multi-level governance can be possible, although ITQ systems are usually designed as top-down management institutions (SCR-4). An exception is the Netherlands ITQ system that is based on local management groups, and emerged from a co-management system between regional producer organizations (Hentrich and Salomon 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2006</a>). ITQs may not facilitate diversified livelihoods (SCR-2), for example fishers exiting New Zealand’s ITQ systems were found to lack any alternative livelihood option (citation). Fishing fleet mobility, given that rights are over a stock rather than over a territory, contributes to social resilience by allowing vessel operators to access fish stocks that vary in or shift their distribution so long as they do not shift outside of the jurisdiction of the ITQ system (SCR-5). Higher mobility is most likely in technology-intensive commercial fisheries, where larger operators may be able to change their operation in response to fish redistributions (Fulton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2011</a>; Holbrook and Johnson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2014</a>). However, there will be important constraints to this flexibility, related to competition for new areas and restrictions imposed by international borders (Cheung et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2012</a>), as well as governance problems due to the changes in species’ distributions across national borders and the resulting implications for management institutions (Berkes 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2006</a>). Miller and Munro (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">2004</a>) propose side payments between two countries as a way to increase ITQ flexibility under climate change when countries face an environmental regime shift and the access to the resource varies in time. Finally, and despite the fact that little progress has been made in incorporating community-based management into ITQ systems (Arnason 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2005</a>), the two approaches can be compatible (SCR-6), as observed for the case of the Tasmanian lobster fishery. There the success was due to a combination of ITQs with a strong tradition of participatory management (van Putten et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2013</a>).
