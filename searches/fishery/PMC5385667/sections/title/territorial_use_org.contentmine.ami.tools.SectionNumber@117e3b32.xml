 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries (TURFs) define property rights over spatial areas of the ocean, as opposed to rights over a portion of the catch (Costello et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>). TURFs are fixed in space and provide concessions to individual fishers or unions/cooperatives to manage the resources. Monitoring and enforcement typically depends on the owners, while fisheries agencies are commonly responsible for establishing the overall total allowable catch (TAC). TURFs constitute a common near-shore fisheries management system in many countries such as Chile, Spain, Japan, and Mexico (Wilen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TURF fisheries that are managed through incentive-based participation and effective enforcement may be better able to withstand climate impacts (Hilborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2003</a>), and thus be more durable against environmental change. For example in Chile, TURFs resulted in increased abundance and size of managed and unmanaged species in comparison with open access areas (Gelcich et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2012</a>; ECR-1). A survey of species and habitats inside and outside of several TURFs in Chile showed that reef fish species had significantly higher species richness, biomass, and density in TURFs compared with open access areas (ECR-2), even though these are not the managed species under property rights regimes (Gelcich et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2012</a>). In Galicia, Spain the TURF system includes advisors working with fisher cooperatives, who facilitate and support decision-making processes and play a key role in communication between fishers, scientists, and policy makers (Macho et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">2013</a>). These strategies can in many cases allow for adaptive (SCR-1) and community-based management (SCR-6) (Hilborn et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2005</a>; Defeo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>). Having spatial property rights may also create incentives for avoiding other anthropogenic pressures that lead to habitat destruction (ECR-3). In TURFs, fishers tend to more actively monitor their territories (Gelcich et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2008</a>), protecting against sources of habitat destruction and pollution. Additionally, spatial property rights provide incentives for fishers to combat poaching, even giving fishers direct authority over surveillance. For example, in the Spanish Asturias TURF system for goose barnacle, members actively engage in surveillance to prevent illegal harvest (Rivera et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since TURFs give exclusive control over the target species in a given area, they create incentives for broader ecosystem-wide stewardship (Costello et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2010</a>), thus reducing fishing mortality and contributing to the ecological resilience of the fish populations (ECR-1) (Defeo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>). Additionally, social resilience is increased by maintaining the stock at desirable levels for a longer-term provision of services (SCR-3) (Defeo et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2014</a>). Ownership of an area can also allow TURF owners to generate revenues through other compatible activities such as tourism, recreation, and aquaculture—thus diversifying local livelihoods and enhancing social resilience (SCR-2). For example, research has shown that TURFs in Chile have led to a high level of diversified income sources for the fishers involved (Moreno and Revenga 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The governance of TURFS can include some top-down control but is generally community-based, which allows both for a participative bottom-up and multi-level governance structure involving the local cooperatives and/or unions of fishers and local and regional institutions in the governance process (SRC-4) (Ovando et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">2013</a>). The Asturias goose barnacle TURF system has promoted the incorporation of traditional knowledge into management and the matching of resource and management scales (Rivera et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">2014</a>). On-site decision-making also helps in designing management plans and rules that avoid perverse incentives such as the ‘race to fish’ or subsidizing overcapacity fleets and related industries (Pauly et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">2002</a>). For example in Japan, the institutional flexibility of the TURF system allowed for the bottom-up creation of new management associations for particular species when necessary (Wilen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">2012</a>). Regarding fisher mobility, TURFs inhibit movement because access rights are to specific fishing grounds (e.g., Aburto et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2013</a>). Their spatial nature causes TURFs to be potentially worse than ITQs, limited entry, or open access in terms of promoting fisher mobility, which could be quite problematic for resilience when fish stocks exhibit major shifts in distribution (SCR-5).
