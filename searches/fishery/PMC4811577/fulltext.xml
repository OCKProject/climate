For coral reefs there has been increasing interest in recent decades in the use of ecosystem models for evaluating the effects of fishing and the efficacy of marine protected areas. However, ecosystem models that integrate physical forcings, biogeochemical and ecological dynamics, and human induced perturbations are still underdeveloped. We applied an ecosystem model (Atlantis) to the coral reef ecosystem of Guam using a suite of management scenarios prioritized in consultation with local resource managers to review the effects of each scenario on performance measures related to the ecosystem, the reef-fish fishery (e.g., fish landings) and coral habitat. Comparing tradeoffs across the selected scenarios showed that each scenario performed best for at least one of the selected performance indicators. The integrated &#x02018;full regulation&#x02019; scenario outperformed other scenarios with four out of the six performance metrics at the cost of reef-fish landings. This model application quantifies the socio-ecological costs and benefits of alternative management scenarios. When the effects of climate change were taken into account, several scenarios performed equally well, but none prevented a collapse in coral biomass over the next few decades assuming a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions scenario.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided to MW though the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

This is especially true for many tropical countries and island territories where coral reefs provide provisional and regulatory services to millions of people who depend on them [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the overwhelming evidence of anthropogenic loss or degradation of coral reef ecosystems worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152577.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] leads to challenges for coral reef managers who need to sustain the ecosystem functions and services under changing environmental conditions and human use patterns [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152577.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Management decisions intended to achieve desired outcomes have cultural, social and economic consequences for the resource users and these consequences should be accounted for in policy decisions to increase compliance [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152577.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, coral reef fisheries not only provide food but also recreation and cultural identity for local residents [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Loss of fishery yield due to over-exploitation, degraded habitats or policy regulations have far-reaching social, cultural and economic consequences for the people relying on these resources. This recognition that humans are an integrated part of the ecosystems, has led a movement toward ecosystem-based management (EBM) in the last decade [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152577.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ecosystem models can be useful tools in the planning and implementation of EBM by evaluating ecological and socioeconomic tradeoffs of alternative management policies prior to their implementation [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152577.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In the last 30 years, research on the efficacy of coral reef fisheries management and implications of alternative management scenarios has seen a steep increase [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in 80% of these studies conclusions were primarily in general conjectural terms and projections of climate change were often not taken into account [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Johnson et al [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] concluded that studies on the effectiveness of different management actions and approaches, tradeoffs and trajectories under climate change are still lacking and this study contributes to filling that gap.</p><p>In this paper, we describe the application of an ecosystem model to a complex multispecies fishery with degraded habitats where we evaluate the socio-ecological tradeoffs of alternative management policies, taking into account the projected effects of climate change. We apply the model using the island of Guam in the tropical west Pacific Ocean as a case study. Over the last three decades coral cover and reef-fish biomass have declined in Guam [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To enhance conservation of fish stocks and habitat, the government of Guam established five marine protected areas (MPAs) in 1997&#x02013;2001. MPAs have been shown to be effective at enhancing resilience to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], increasing coral recovery in the Caribbean [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], supporting larval supplies to other areas [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and enhancing biomass and reproduction of fish species [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The MPAs around Guam have increased fish abundance and reproduction of some fish species compared to the open access areas [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152577.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but fish biomass is still heavily depleted compared to a situation without humans [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Guam managers are now interested in using ecosystem modelling to explore tradeoffs of alternative management approaches [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Five potential management scenarios were selected after discussions at two informal meetings in Guam with local managers and other stakeholders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152577.s002">S1 Table</xref> is a list of participatory agencies). These simulated scenarios are example scenarios to visualize the utility of the &#x02018;end-to-end&#x02019; Guam Atlantis model and to help understand and evaluate the socio-ecological tradeoffs of alternative management policies. Policy performance was measured against indicators for ecosystem services (e.g., reef status, biomass of exploited species, total landings). Simulations were modeled with and without the cumulative effects of climate change. Model results of the selected management policies were then compared relative to each other and these results can be used to evaluate the trade-offs inherent in having both socio-economic and ecological goals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Atlantis ecosystem model</title><p>The Atlantis ecosystem model is a deterministic spatially-explicit dynamic model that couples biophysical processes with human-use dynamics and is used as a policy exploration tool for EBM [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The main dynamics and process equations are provided in Fulton <italic>et al</italic>.

In a companion paper [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] we explored the interactive effect size of the three main drivers that influence the reef status in Guam: land-based sources of pollution (LBSP; sediments and nutrients), fishing, and climate change (ocean warming and acidification). In the supplemental materials of that paper we detail the validation of the different stressors by comparing modeled data with empirical data or expected patterns. Modeled effects of LBSP and fishing showed a good overlap with empirical data, although model skill assessment showed that the model was positively biased towards functional species groups with a high biomass, these groups were over-represented (especially the small-bodied parrotfish (scrapers)). Model sensitivity analyses indicated that the LBSP effects, in particular, were sensitive to productivity. Ocean acidification was not well resolved in the model, but the more imminent climate change threat to corals due to ocean warming showed a few bleaching events in the first decade in 2000, after which corals recovered to some extent. These results are in agreement with empirical studies. The model also showed that corals could not keep up when bleaching events were annual, as projected to happen under the current greenhouse gas emission trajectory (IPCC AR8.5). By around 2040 coral biomass had plummeted to very low levels both for branching and massive corals [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; a result also shown by other studies [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Despite the limitations of the model (bias, sensitive to productivity, effects of acidification not well resolved), the model was able to project plausible biomass data under the different stressors and was deemed robust for comparative studies [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Human-use dynamics can be incorporated in Atlantis through the fishing module, and the management and assessment module. For the purpose of our paper, we are only interested in the relative comparisons of the performance of alternative management scenarios. Fishing was simplified and represented by constant fishing mortality rates (% mortality per year) over the course of the simulation (with variations to represent the management scenarios). We did not include the monitoring and assessment module of the Atlantis model framework. To set our fixed fishing mortality, we first calibrated the model to spatially explicit historical landings of the shore-based fishery and to biomass trends [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152577.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We calculated the fishing mortality for each functional species group by dividing the landings at year 1 with the standing stock biomass at year 1 to get a proxy for annual fishing mortality for that functional group. We then used those proxy values as the fixed fishing mortality per functional group.</p><p>The recently developed Guam Atlantis model [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] encompasses the shallow (&#x02264; 30 m) reefs around Guam, spanning approximately 110 km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152577.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

Results from our study showed that the status quo scenario (MPAs as the only fishery regulation) did not come out as the &#x02018;best&#x02019; overall approach for Guam as a whole. Only for goal 4, maintaining or improving fisheries landings, did status quo produce the &#x02018;best&#x02019; result, particularly when there were no land-based sources of pollution. This suggests that to improve ecosystem services, spatial management must be used in conjunction with other forms of fishery regulations (e.g., combined catch limits and size limits), as in the full regulation scenario considered here. In that case, including MPAs does show improved ecosystem services compared with no MPAs (i.e., scenario 6 and 7) in that the overall reef fish biomass is higher and one less functional group was over-exploited. However the ecosystem benefits of using input (size limit) and output (catch limit) controls come at a cost of reduced fishing landings inherent in the reduction in fishing. Such trade-offs need to be acknowledged openly if stakeholder communities are to appreciate the reality of what is needed for reef resilience. Model results were shared with the various stakeholder groups and discussions highlighted the usefulness of the model as a support tool but also in the need to improve the model to address the current model limitations. For example, including the reef-fish landings of the boat-based fishery and scenarios with more realistic reduction of land-based sources of pollution (e.g. 50% reduction instead of the now used 100%) was mentioned.</p><p>While the full regulation scenario performed best for the ecosystem state, the cost of enforcement associated with the input and output controls was not factored into our analysis. Enforcing TACs and/or size limits around the entire island is more labor intensive, and hence more costly, than the enforcement of fishery regulations in just site-based marine preserves, as under the current status quo scenario. Moreover enforcement is complicated because fishers typically work on a small scale (e.g., only in areas close to their homes), and hence the area of enforcement is large and therefore costly, and catches include multi species which makes single species management methods expensive. Additionally, success of any fishery regulation is influenced by compliance with these regulations and that depends on the fishers&#x02019; costs and revenue associated with illegal fishing but also on moral obligations and the influence of society [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Involving stakeholders, including fishers, at an early stage of planning fisheries regulations and education could be a tool to gain acceptance of regulations although education likely will not target all groups and enforcement could still be a necessity to reach objectives [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additional costs related to habitat damage inflicted by fishing gear, abandoned gear (e.g. ghost nets, fishing line), and trampling was also not taken into account [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152577.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Including the positive habitat effects of marine preserves compared to other fishing gears types in the economic analysis might offset the cost of enforcement [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Managers and stakeholders need to agree on the weighting of the contradictory objectives and take into account these issues of gear use and enforcement when making a decision on which management approach would best suit their needs.</p><p>When taking into consideration the cumulative effects of climate change impacts, all simulated scenarios performed poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152577.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Regulations on size-limits and TAC with or without MPAs and no additional LBSP showed a slightly better performance than the status quo scenario with no additional LBSP in terms of fish biomass (total reef fish, herbivores), but that did not correspond with clearly increased capacity for corals to deal with climate change. When the ocean temperature was consistently above the bleaching threshold in successive years and the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was above 500 ppm, all three approaches showed a severe decline in coral biomass starting as soon as 2025 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152577.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This result corresponds with the findings of other recent studies of Pacific coral reef ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0152577.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. On a global scale, a meta-analysis showed that corals will be in a rapid and terminal decline when the frequency of thermal events is too high for corals to recover [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Veron <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] showed that corals would be negatively affected by the combined effects of mass bleaching and ocean acidification once CO<sub>2</sub> concentration reaches above 450 ppm. While Silverman <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] suggests that when the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration surpasses 560 ppm, coral reefs will dissolve, and hence, fisheries management can have little impact on their survival at that point. The results from this case study can be used to draw more general conclusions about the range of management measures that are likely important in practical implementation of EBM in other tropical reefs.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Model limitations</title><p>Ecosystem modeling approaches are becoming more common as a support tool for EBM by providing quantitative evaluations and synthesis of complex dynamics in ecosystems. However, the complexity makes straight forward model skill assessments [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] very hard and in our case the lack of time series made it impossible. Another limitation of the model is that we did not incorporate possible scope for coral adaptation or acclimatization to changing environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], or the effects of cyclones or changes in nutrient supply from deeper waters as a result of predicted increased stratification [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Additionally, the physical state of the ecosystem contributed to the uncertainty of model outcomes as the oceanographic module, used to force water flows and the advection of nutrients and plankton, was based on a ROMS model developed for the Coral Triangle (CT-ROMS; Southwest of Guam) rather than targeted on Guam [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This meant that Guam was on the &#x02018;edge&#x02019; of the CT-ROMS model domain, hence, not adequately incorporating all of the regional oceanographic initial conditions. Lastly, the positive bias in the model towards functional species groups with a high biomass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152577.s007">S1 Text</xref>) likely influenced the relative low response of herbivores compared to invertivores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152577.g002">Fig 2</xref>) as scrapers, in particular, had a biomass that was 3 times higher than the observed biomass in 2011 [<xref rid="pone.0152577.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is likely that the fishing mortality was therefore set too low resulting in a continued increase in the standing stock biomass of scrapers.</p><p>Because of the limitations of the model, the results presented here should only be considered relative to each other rather than in absolute terms. The analysis of management options can be considered as a first step and subject to uncertainty that could be resolved (to some degree) in the future by checking the relative performance of the management options across multiple parameterizations of the model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Two general conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, choosing among management scenarios with conflicting goals requires a priori weighting of the importance of the various goals. Ecosystem models can be effective tools for local management in visualizing and exploring the costs and benefits of the various approaches under consideration as highlighted in this study. Adoption of the approach that performed best can result in a more effective achievement of socio-ecological goals. Second, under the business as usual greenhouse gas emissions scenario (the RCP8.5 trajectory), with no adaptation or acclimation by reef organisms, the reefs around Guam will collapse in the next few decades. This collapse is likely to occur even with management scenarios in place to alleviate local stressors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152577.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Ecosystem response ratio after 45-year simulation of alternative scenarios on (<italic>a</italic>) vertebrates and (<italic>b</italic>) invertebrates (values normalized so 1.0 = best [highest biomass] and 0.0 = worst [lowest biomass]).</title><p>Results of &#x0201c;Size Limit and TAC&#x0201d; were very similar to only TAC results and left out for clarity.
