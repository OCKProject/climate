   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152577.s007" href="#pone.0152577.s007">S1 Text</a>. In a companion paper [
   <a rid="pone.0152577.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref026">26</a>] we explored the interactive effect size of the three main drivers that influence the reef status in Guam: land-based sources of pollution (LBSP; sediments and nutrients), fishing, and climate change (ocean warming and acidification). In the supplemental materials of that paper we detail the validation of the different stressors by comparing modeled data with empirical data or expected patterns. Modeled effects of LBSP and fishing showed a good overlap with empirical data, although model skill assessment showed that the model was positively biased towards functional species groups with a high biomass, these groups were over-represented (especially the small-bodied parrotfish (scrapers)). Model sensitivity analyses indicated that the LBSP effects, in particular, were sensitive to productivity. Ocean acidification was not well resolved in the model, but the more imminent climate change threat to corals due to ocean warming showed a few bleaching events in the first decade in 2000, after which corals recovered to some extent. These results are in agreement with empirical studies. The model also showed that corals could not keep up when bleaching events were annual, as projected to happen under the current greenhouse gas emission trajectory (IPCC AR8.5). By around 2040 coral biomass had plummeted to very low levels both for branching and massive corals [
   <a rid="pone.0152577.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref026">26</a>]; a result also shown by other studies [

   <a rid="pone.0152577.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref029">29</a>]. Despite the limitations of the model (bias, sensitive to productivity, effects of acidification not well resolved), the model was able to project plausible biomass data under the different stressors and was deemed robust for comparative studies [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human-use dynamics can be incorporated in Atlantis through the fishing module, and the management and assessment module. For the purpose of our paper, we are only interested in the relative comparisons of the performance of alternative management scenarios. Fishing was simplified and represented by constant fishing mortality rates (% mortality per year) over the course of the simulation (with variations to represent the management scenarios). We did not include the monitoring and assessment module of the Atlantis model framework. To set our fixed fishing mortality, we first calibrated the model to spatially explicit historical landings of the shore-based fishery and to biomass trends [
   <a rid="pone.0152577.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref030">30</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0152577.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref031">31</a>]. We calculated the fishing mortality for each functional species group by dividing the landings at year 1 with the standing stock biomass at year 1 to get a proxy for annual fishing mortality for that functional group. We then used those proxy values as the fixed fishing mortality per functional group.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In November 2012 the Coral Reef Conservation Program management liaison, Ms Valerie Brown, NOAA Pacific Islands Regional Office, facilitated an informal meeting. Invitations to attend an introductory presentation on integrated ecosystem modeling and how it could help managers were sent out to all local and federal managers and other stakeholders (staff of university of Guam, Marine Laboratory, US Navy, NGOs, fisheries Co-op) that are involved with coral reef ecosystems in Guam. Fifteen people representing 11 organizations attended and follow up meetings were organized with staff of organizations that could not attend, reaching out to another 11 people (

Based on discussions of management goals and identified management scenarios of interest, we selected six scenarios. In June 2014, we presented those selected scenarios to the resource managers and stakeholders to make sure we captured their interest sufficiently. Apart from those six alternative management scenarios we also simulated a ‘no-change’ or ‘status quo’ scenario and a ‘no stressors’ (no fishing, no LBSP, no climate change) scenario. We identified appropriate ecosystem metrics based on the managers’ goals (

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Scenario 1—Status quo (no change) represented by five MPAs and existing levels of land-based sources of pollution.</p>

LBSP was modeled as the addition of nutrients and sediments to the coastal polygons with riverine run-off and/or sewage outfall pipes (
     <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152577.g001" href="#pone.0152577.g001">Fig 1</a>), and estimated loads were based on flow data and the related sediment and nutrient inputs per river for each Atlantis polygon [

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Scenario 2—Remove existing MPAs and implement a weekly catch limit (further referred to as TAC) with existing levels of LBSP.</p>
    <p>We estimated an annual catch limit as 75% of the average catches of the first five years of the status quo catches and then converted this value to a weekly TAC. We simulated the TAC scenario with the same fixed fishing mortality rates as in the status quo simulation but when the TAC was reached, fishing stopped for that week. Fishing was allowed in every polygon.</p>

    <p>Scenario 3—Remove existing MPAs and implement size limits with existing levels of LBSP.</p>
    <p>For the size-limit-based fishery simulations, we assumed the same fixed fishing mortality rates as in the status quo simulation but no immature fishes were targeted. Since fishing mortality stayed the same under this scenario compared to the status quo scenario, older size classes get targeted more heavily. Based on the weight and age at first maturity, the age and size at first capture for each functional group differed (
     <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152577.s004" href="#pone.0152577.s004">S3 Table</a>). Fishing was allowed in every polygon.

   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Scenario 5—Remove existing MPAs and implement TAC and size limits with no additional LBSP.</p>
    <p>This scenario differed only from scenario 4 by not simulating the delivery of additional nutrients and sediments to the coastal areas.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Scenario 6—Status quo with no LBSP.</p>
    <p>In this scenario we used the same constant fishing mortalities as identified under scenario 1, but did not simulate any additional nutrients and sediments to the coastal areas.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Scenario 7—Full regulations. In this scenario we kept existing MPAs in place and implemented both size limits and TAC with no LBSP. This scenario combines all management regulations.</p>
    <p>Each of the scenarios was simulated for 45 years (1985–2030) without including climate change projections. We wanted to take a realistic no-regrets approach to management strategy selection, so the better performing scenarios with no climate change were also re-run for 45 years with climate drivers included. For this approach we selected the three scenarios where the performance evaluation with no climate change had the highest average across all four goals.</p>
