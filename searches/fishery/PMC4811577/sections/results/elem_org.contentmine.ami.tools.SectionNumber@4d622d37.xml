 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, no one management scenario was best for all goals. However, with regard to fish biomass, as can be expected, fishery regulations that reduce fishing pressure led to a higher biomass of target species (apex predators, herbivores and invertivores), while the non-target groups were less influenced (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152577.g002" href="#pone.0152577.g002">Fig 2</a>). Surprisingly, the response of target herbivores was less pronounced compared to the target invertivores (but see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec014" href="#sec014">discussion</a>). Response of invertebrate groups was similar in all fishery regulation and status-quo scenarios (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152577.g002" href="#pone.0152577.g002">Fig 2</a>). Likely because of an increase in biomass in invertebrate feeders, the overall biomass of invertebrates decreased correspondingly

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scenarios with no land-based sources of pollution (a range of different fishery regulations) showed a shift in the benthic composition towards an increase in benthic filter feeders (corals, soft corals, sponges, bivalves, anemones, zooanthids), as well as a reduction in the overall biomass of primary producers (benthic algae and phytoplankton), compared to scenarios with LBSP (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The management of complex ecosystems is influenced by the tradeoffs of the objectives related to different components of the reef system, i.e., the ecosystem goods (metrics #4) and ecosystem services (metrics #1–3). To show these tradeoffs we present an overall aggregate performance measure kite diagram for the average of the last 5 years of the simulation of each management scenario (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152577.g003" href="#pone.0152577.g003">Fig 3</a>). Comparing tradeoffs across these scenarios show that each scenario neared the criteria of at least one of the ecosystem metrics (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152577.g003" href="#pone.0152577.g003">Fig 3</a>). When fishing is regulated according to the integrated ‘full regulation’ scenario (size limit, TAC, MPAs, and no LBSP), landings were reduced to 79% of the status quo landings but all other metrics increased between 115% (biomass herbivores) and 157% (total reef-fish biomass) compared to the status quo (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152577.s005" href="#pone.0152577.s005">S4 Table</a>). The outcomes of the full regulation scenario approached the criteria for four out of the six metrics (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0152577.g003" href="#pone.0152577.g003">Fig 3</a>). Results were similar for the combined size limit, TAC and no LBSP scenario, but the total reef-fish biomass metric performed less well in this latter scenario and there was one more over-exploited group. This indicates that integrated management including MPAs and off reserve restrictions leads to a higher overall biomass and an increase in the spawning potential compared to open access.
