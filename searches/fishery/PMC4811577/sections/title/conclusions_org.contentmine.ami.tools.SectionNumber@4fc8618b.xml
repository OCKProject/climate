 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two general conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, choosing among management scenarios with conflicting goals requires a priori weighting of the importance of the various goals. Ecosystem models can be effective tools for local management in visualizing and exploring the costs and benefits of the various approaches under consideration as highlighted in this study. Adoption of the approach that performed best can result in a more effective achievement of socio-ecological goals. Second, under the business as usual greenhouse gas emissions scenario (the RCP8.5 trajectory), with no adaptation or acclimation by reef organisms, the reefs around Guam will collapse in the next few decades. This collapse is likely to occur even with management scenarios in place to alleviate local stressors.</p>
