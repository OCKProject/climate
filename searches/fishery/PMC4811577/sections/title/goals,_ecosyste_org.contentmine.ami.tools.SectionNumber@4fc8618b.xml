 <div class="title">Goals, ecosystem metrics and performance criteria.</div>
 <p>Performance of the alternative strategies was based on reaching the criteria of conservation ecosystem metrics (#1â€“3) and extraction ecosystem metrics (#4a, b). Criteria were based on a simulation of no local (fishing and land-based sources of pollution) or global (climate change) stressors. The criteria for landings are the total catches from the status quo simulation.</p>
