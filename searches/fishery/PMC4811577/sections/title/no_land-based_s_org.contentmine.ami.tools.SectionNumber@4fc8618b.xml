 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scenarios with no land-based sources of pollution (a range of different fishery regulations) showed a shift in the benthic composition towards an increase in benthic filter feeders (corals, soft corals, sponges, bivalves, anemones, zooanthids), as well as a reduction in the overall biomass of primary producers (benthic algae and phytoplankton), compared to scenarios with LBSP (

Other ecosystem effects included a clear increase in biomass of planktivores (FPL), mid-water piscivores (FPM), rays (RAY), sea stars (BSS) and demersal (ZD) and herbivorous (copepods, ZH) zooplankton and a decrease in the biomass of benthic carnivores (BC), infauna (BM, polychaetes), cephalopods (CEP), and benthic grazers (BG, urchins), (
