 <div class="title">Spatial structure of the Guam Atlantis model based on homogeneous biophysical characteristics.</div>
 <p>Polygons closest to shore have one depth layer (0–6 m) and the others two (0–6 m and 6–30 m for the middle ones and 0–6 m and 6–100 m for the 7 outer, boundary polygons). Blue polygons indicate marine preserves. The star in the inset map represents the location of Guam located in the Mariana Archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. Polygons with nutrient and/or sediment inputs are those numbered 3, 7, 8, 10, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, 26, 30, 32, 48, 49, 52, and 53. (Figure taken with permission from [
