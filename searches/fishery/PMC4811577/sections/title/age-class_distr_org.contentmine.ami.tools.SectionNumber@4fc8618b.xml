 <p>The “No Stressors” scenario indicates no fishing and no land-based sources of pollution (LBSP). The scenario “Size Limit &amp; TAC &amp; no LBSP” had similar results as the “Size Limit &amp; TAC” scenario and is therefore left out for clarity. The “Full Regulation” scenario is comprised of size limit, TAC, MPAs and no LBSP.</p>
