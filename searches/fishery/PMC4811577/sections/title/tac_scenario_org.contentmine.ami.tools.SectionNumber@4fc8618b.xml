 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among fishery regulations scenarios, imposing a TAC led to more favorable outcomes than status quo and size limit scenarios with a tradeoff of 80% of the status quo fish landings. The TAC scenario led to higher biomass of herbivores and overall reef-fish biomass and fewer groups becoming overexploited compared to the status quo and size limit scenariosâ€”only the bumphead parrotfish was still overexploited (
