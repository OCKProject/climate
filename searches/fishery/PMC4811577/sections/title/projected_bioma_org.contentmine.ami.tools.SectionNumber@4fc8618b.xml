 <div class="title">Projected biomass trajectories of (
  <span class="italic">grey line</span>) massive corals and (
  <span class="italic">black line</span>) branching corals under four fisheries management scenarios, no land-based sources of pollution, and projected climate change impacts (ocean acidification and ocean warming) under the IPCC AR5 RCP8.5 emission scenarios.
 </div>
 <p>All simulated scenarios projected the same trend in coral biomass resulting in the overlay of biomass trajectories for branching and massive corals. The scenarios simulated were status quo with no LBSP, size limit and TAC with no LBSP, full regulation, and no fishing and no LBSP (no stressors).</p>
