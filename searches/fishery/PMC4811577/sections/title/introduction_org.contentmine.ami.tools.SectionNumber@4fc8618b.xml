 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sustainable use of environmental resources is inextricably linked to long-term human well-being [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref001">1</a>]. This is especially true for many tropical countries and island territories where coral reefs provide provisional and regulatory services to millions of people who depend on them [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref002">2</a>]. However, the overwhelming evidence of anthropogenic loss or degradation of coral reef ecosystems worldwide [

  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref004">4</a>] leads to challenges for coral reef managers who need to sustain the ecosystem functions and services under changing environmental conditions and human use patterns [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref005">5</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref006">6</a>]. Management decisions intended to achieve desired outcomes have cultural, social and economic consequences for the resource users and these consequences should be accounted for in policy decisions to increase compliance [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref008">8</a>]. For example, coral reef fisheries not only provide food but also recreation and cultural identity for local residents [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref009">9</a>]. Loss of fishery yield due to over-exploitation, degraded habitats or policy regulations have far-reaching social, cultural and economic consequences for the people relying on these resources. This recognition that humans are an integrated part of the ecosystems, has led a movement toward ecosystem-based management (EBM) in the last decade [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref010">10</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref011">11</a>]. Ecosystem models can be useful tools in the planning and implementation of EBM by evaluating ecological and socioeconomic tradeoffs of alternative management policies prior to their implementation [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the last 30 years, research on the efficacy of coral reef fisheries management and implications of alternative management scenarios has seen a steep increase [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref014">14</a>]. However, in 80% of these studies conclusions were primarily in general conjectural terms and projections of climate change were often not taken into account [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref014">14</a>]. Johnson et al [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref014">14</a>] concluded that studies on the effectiveness of different management actions and approaches, tradeoffs and trajectories under climate change are still lacking and this study contributes to filling that gap.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we describe the application of an ecosystem model to a complex multispecies fishery with degraded habitats where we evaluate the socio-ecological tradeoffs of alternative management policies, taking into account the projected effects of climate change. We apply the model using the island of Guam in the tropical west Pacific Ocean as a case study. Over the last three decades coral cover and reef-fish biomass have declined in Guam [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref015">15</a>]. To enhance conservation of fish stocks and habitat, the government of Guam established five marine protected areas (MPAs) in 1997–2001. MPAs have been shown to be effective at enhancing resilience to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref016">16</a>], increasing coral recovery in the Caribbean [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref017">17</a>], supporting larval supplies to other areas [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref018">18</a>] and enhancing biomass and reproduction of fish species [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref019">19</a>]. The MPAs around Guam have increased fish abundance and reproduction of some fish species compared to the open access areas [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref020">20</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref021">21</a>], but fish biomass is still heavily depleted compared to a situation without humans [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref022">22</a>]. Guam managers are now interested in using ecosystem modelling to explore tradeoffs of alternative management approaches [
  <a rid="pone.0152577.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0152577.ref023">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five potential management scenarios were selected after discussions at two informal meetings in Guam with local managers and other stakeholders (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0152577.s002" href="#pone.0152577.s002">S1 Table</a> is a list of participatory agencies). These simulated scenarios are example scenarios to visualize the utility of the ‘end-to-end’ Guam Atlantis model and to help understand and evaluate the socio-ecological tradeoffs of alternative management policies. Policy performance was measured against indicators for ecosystem services (e.g., reef status, biomass of exploited species, total landings). Simulations were modeled with and without the cumulative effects of climate change. Model results of the selected management policies were then compared relative to each other and these results can be used to evaluate the trade-offs inherent in having both socio-economic and ecological goals.
