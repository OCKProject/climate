In addition, decreased host resistance to infection and chromosomal aberrations in both humans and animal studies have also been reported (<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Several hematological parameters are altered in benzene-exposure scenarios, such as hematocrit, platelets, mean corpuscular volume, white and red blood cell counts, as well as absolute lymphocyte counts (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Fan, 2014</xref>). However, these are all unspecific markers. Currently, only two specific validated benzene metabolite biomarkers are applied, urinary, trans, trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA) and S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA). Both are considered reliable biomarkers concerning occupational benzene exposure (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">ACGIH, 2017</xref>), as they have been shown to correlate well with external exposure to benzene in several studies carried out on occupationally-exposed subjects. However, some studies indicate that t,t-MA displays lower specificity than SPMA, due to relatively high background values of creatinine, which may be found in non-exposed individuals, and recommend its use only in higher benzene exposure scenarios (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Boogaard &#x00026; Van&#x000a0;Sittert, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Protano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Some studies have also proposed associations between t,t-MA and hematological parameters, such as the study carried out by <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Wiwanitkit, Suwansaksri &#x00026; Soogarun (2004)</xref>, where correlations between t,t-MA and platelet count in subjects occupationally exposed to benzene were assessed. Although no significant correlations were observed, the authors indicated that platelet counts and plateletcrits (PCT) decreased while urinary t,t-MA increased, and that, when applying the upper normal limit t,t-MA level as the cutoff level, statistically significant lower platelet counts and PCT were observed in the subjects with urine t,t-MA higher than upper normal limit. This indicates that other benzene exposure biomarkers may arise in the future.</p><p>Benzene is also found in tobacco smoke, although the risk of leukemia from this type of lower environmental level exposure is still not fully understood (<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Snyder, 2014</xref>). However, while research results concerning this link are not always consistent, evidence of a positive association between these factors has been reported (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Lichtman, 2007</xref>). In fact, recent studies estimating leukemia risks in human populations exposed to benzene from tobacco smoke using epidemiological data indicate that an increased risk of leukemia from low-level exposure to benzene seems to exist, and that benzene may contribute up to a third of smoking-induced leukemia (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Fiebelkorn &#x00026; Meredith, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Regarding tobacco smoking effects on benzene biomarkers, studies have indicated that direct effects on both SPMA and t,t-MA are observed in smokers compared to non-smokers. For example, one study involving 446 healthy volunteer residents from the general population since at least 10 years in an area of central Italy reported that SPMA concentrations in smokers (93) was about ten-fold higher than in non/ex-smokers (197/156), while smoker t,t-MA levels were about two-fold higher than in non/ex-smokers (<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Tranfo et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, tobacco smoking is a confounding variable regarding benzene exposure that should be taken into account in benzene assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Benzene exposure in fishers</title><p>Fishers are exposed to benzene by turning on their vessel engines and inhaling diesel exhaust fumes. Studies concerning benzene exposure in fishers are extremely scarce. In one report, high-performance liquid chromatography was applied to determine this biomarker in urine from 49 subjects (30 fishers and 19 control subjects), from a Thai rural community (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Thummachinda et al., 2002</xref>). Mean urinary t,t-MA levels in fishers (0.180 &#x000b1; 0.130 mg/g creatinine) were significantly higher than in the control group (0.015 &#x000b1; 0.053 mg/g creatinine) (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). The authors, thus, classified the study population at high risk due to chronic benzene exposure.</p><p>In another report, personal exposure to benzene in commercial fishers was compared among two-stroke, four-stroke and diesel engines (<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Kirrane et al., 2007</xref>). The authors employed passive monitors to determine benzene emissions in the three engine categories, and applied mixed-effect linear regression models to predict exposure levels. The predicted benzene exposure levels to fishers on boats equipped with two stroke, four-stroke and diesel engines were of 58.4, 38.9 and 15.7&#x000a0;mg/m3, respectively. The authors hypothesis, that fishers who use carbureted two-stroke engines were expected to present higher hydrocarbon exposure than those who use diesel engines or less polluting four-stroke engines, was, thus, confirmed, as two-stroke engines release high levels of hydrocarbons because oil is mixed with the fuel to lubricate the piston and the fuel intake and exhaust ports are open simultaneously during a portion of compression&#x02013;combustion cycle (<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Kirrane et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Other studies carried out with this vulnerable group are not directly linked to benzene exposure, but to its main carcinogen effects (leukemia and NHL, among others) (<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Arnold, 2013</xref>). For example, one study carried out comparisons between hospitalization rates among German coastal and deep-sea fishers, using data from a health insurance company for seafarers, from 1997 to 2007 (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Oldenburg, Harth &#x00026; Manuwald, 2015</xref>). The results indicate that German fishers showed a considerably higher standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR) for malignant neoplasms, respiratory cancer, and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Comparing coastal and deep-sea fishers, the risk for respiratory cancer and NHL among coastal fishers exceeded that of deep-sea fishers, and differences between qualification levels among fishers were also observed, where less qualified deep sea fishers displayed considerably higher SHR for malignant neoplasms than more highly qualified ones.</p><p>In another study, significantly increased acute myeloid leukemia risks were noted for fishers and related fishing workers (<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>), although no investigations on their causes were performed.</p><p>It is noteworthy that climate change effects, such as increasing sea temperature and ocean acidification, among others, has led to marked alterations in fish species distributions, both in latitude and depth, resulting in faster life cycles and smaller body sizes of many commercial species worldwide (<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Perry et al., 2005</xref>). This may, in turn, result in longer and higher amounts of fishing trips for fishers, due to higher search efforts for commercial species, which, in turn, may lead to increased benzene exposure. No studies correlating these factors, however, have been addressed in the literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Benzene legislation in Brazil</title><p>In Brazil, benzene is considered a health risk factor due to occupational exposure since the 1930s. However, only from the 1980s did an intensification of trade union movements begin, claiming the social visibility of problems arising from the use of benzene (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Brasil, 2018</xref>).</p><p>With the increase of the union pressure, public institutions began to carry out studies and epidemiological investigations in the work environments with benzene, culminating in Brazil&#x02019;s Benzene Agreement, signed on September 28th, 1995 and the establishment of a Permanent National Commission on Benzene on March 26th, 1996, composed of a tripartite body formed to discuss, negotiate and monitor the agreement. The main responsibilities of this Commission are to complement the agreement concerning issues such as changes in worker health status and propose and monitor studies, research, scientific events and changes in legal instruments (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">De Freitas, Porto &#x00026; Machado, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The Benzene Agreement includes the creation of certification for the controlled use of this substance, the establishment of penalties for non-adherents, decreased benzene content in gasoline to a maximum of 1% and an agreement to decrease benzene content in manufactured products to 0.1% at most by 2007. The agreement also establishes muconic acid as the biological benzene exposure indicator (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">De Freitas, Porto &#x00026; Machado, 2006</xref>).</p><p>However, despite the existence of indicators of environmental benzene targets in the air, such as the Technological Reference Value - Time Weighted Average (VRT-MPT) as a mandatory element to guide the continuous control programs and better occupational conditions (where the benzene concentration limit for the environment is set at 2.5 ppm (8.1 mg/m3) for steel companies and 1.0 ppm (3.3 mg/m3) for other companies that produce, or manipulate benzene and its liquid mixtures with 1% or more of its volume) (<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Graciani &#x00026; Ferreira, 2014</xref>), it is not possible to correlate their values with health risks. Therefore, the Brazilian Legislation on Benzene indicates that contact with benzene should be avoided and that there is no safe level of occupational exposure to this substance (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Brasil, 2018</xref>). This is in agreement with WHO guidelines (<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2010</xref>), which indicate that, as benzene is a carcinogenic substance, no safe level of exposure is recommended, so even low levels should be investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Studies associating benzene exposure and fishery activities in Brazil</title><p>Awareness of public health impacts resulting from benzene exposure to benzene is increasing in developing countries, although few have introduced policies and regulations in this regard (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Thummachinda et al., 2002</xref>). Brazil is an exception, since benzene is considered a priority for the Brazilian National Health System (SUS) (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Moura-Correa &#x00026; Santana, 2014</xref>). A National Health Surveillance program (VISAT) has been implemented, aiming at the development of intervention policies regarding risk factors and determinants in worker health hazards, which includes benzene exposure (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Moura-Correa et al., 2014</xref>). However, although benzene is targeted by health surveillance in Brazil, scarce data are available on both occupational or environmental benzene exposure (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Moura-Correa &#x00026; Santana, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition, few studies focus on understanding fisher organization and working conditions, and even less so concerning chemical exposure, are available for Brazil (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Nogueira, De Souza &#x00026; Br&#x000ed;gida, 2017</xref>) and, to the best of our knowledge, no benzene studies in this regard are available for this country.</p><p>As in other countries, small-scale fishers in Brazil secure a large share of the domestic supply of fishery products, usually using low-impact technologies, with almost no public support (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Nogueira, De Souza &#x00026; Br&#x000ed;gida, 2017</xref>). Over 60% of Brazil&#x02019;s total fish landings originate from artisanal fisheries (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2010</xref>). In 2011, a total of 875 700 fishers (both men and women participate in fishery activities in Brazil, where one in three fishers is a woman) were directly engaged in full time fishing activities, and Brazil&#x02019;s fishing fleet comprised over 60 000 vessels, with about one third being motorized (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Professional Brazilian fisher age distribution indicates that most range from 30 to 39 years old, totaling 242,683 workers, corresponding to 28.44% of the country&#x02019;s total. The second age group with the highest number of fishers ranges from 40 to 49 years old, at 220,443 individuals, 25.84% of the national total. A significant amount of fishers comprises the age group between 50 and 59 years old, at 158,201 individuals, and between 20 and 29 years old, at 187,984, accounting for 18.54% and 22.03%, respectively, of country&#x02019;s total fishers in the country (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Nogueira, De Souza &#x00026; Br&#x000ed;gida, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Studies in Brazil indicate that fishers may work for over 40 years in fishery activities (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Machado &#x00026; Piccolo, 2018</xref>), and a recent census (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">IBGE, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">ND Mais, 2011</xref>) indicates that fishers from Santa Catarina, one of the Brazilian states with the most expressive fishing activities, represent 20% of people over 60 still in activity, alongside farmers, aquaculture and forest sector personnel, which, together, account for other 42 thousand people in this state only Thus, it seems likely that a significant amount of Brazilian fishers work up to or over 60 years old. Regarding working hours, informal assessments indicate from 12 to 14&#x000a0;h a day regularly, for both male and female fishers (<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">CPP, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">ND Mais, 2011</xref>), and one report in the scientific literature indicates a means of 19.8&#x000a0;h a day in 2013 (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Campos &#x00026; Chaves, 2016</xref>). Thus many older fishers remain in activity, chronically exposed to exhaust fumes in their daily fishing activities for hours at a time.</p><p>Some studies have reported report leukemia incidences in this group cases in several Brazilian regions, although encompassing agricultural, hunting and fishing workers as a single group (<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Moraes et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, incomplete occupational information in Brazilian cancer hospital records is a reality, which directly reflects surveillance actions and associations between occupational, environmental and occupational exposure (<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Moraes et al., 2017</xref>), thus impeding further analyses of benzene-exposure scenarios concerning Brazilian fishers.</p><p>Furthermore, the impact of smoking habits in fishers, although of paramount importance, cannot be adequately evaluated, as no systematic review on the subject is available, and data is extremely discrepant throughout the different Brazilian regions. For example, previous studies in artisanal fisher communities in Brazil indicate that, from a sample universe of 18 individuals in the Copacabana artisanal fishing community in Southeastern Brazil, 33% continued to smoke or had been a smoker (ranging from 6 to 30 years of smoking), and that 67% broke the habit after 20&#x02013;50 years of smoking, while from a total of 14 individuals, in the Paraty artisanal fishing community, also in Southeastern Brazil, 64% were or had been smokers (ranging from 13 to 65 years of smoking) (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Cavichiolo, Begossi &#x00026; Gurgel, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, in other fisher communities, the opposite is noted, i.e., in one artisanal fishing community in the Brazilian Amazon, in the Northwest region of the country, of a total of 517 participants, most (77.7%) reported not smoking at all, while 3.1% reported smoking one cigarette a day (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Nuernberg, 2010</xref>). This further indicates that Brazilian fisher benzene-exposure scenarios are understudied with regard to several epidemiological factors, in addition to exposure during fisher activities.</p><p>The low number of papers found on the subject of fisher benzene exposure is expected, due to knowledge gap in this regard, reiterated by the present assessment. Other mini-reviews on other fisher related health assessments, such as fisher mortality, have demonstrated similarly low number of studies (nine) (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Matheson et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is clear that fishers are a vulnerable group in many dimensions, i.e., social, health, environmental and economic. However, benzene exposure studies concerning this group are extremely scarce in the literature in general, and more so in Brazil, although the country has a vast fisher workforce. In addition, no systematic studies on the laboral characteristics of these workers (hours worked per day, maximum worked years) are available in the country, which makes it even more difficult to assess the incidence of benzene-related effects in this group. As these workers are in everyday contact with benzene, due to the fuel combustion used in their fishing activities, and, thus, chronically exposed to this carcinogenic pollutant, surveillance actions are paramount, regarding both benzene exposure and urinary biomarker monitoring, in order to implement decision-making and regulatory actions. It is important to note, however, that SPMA and t,t-MA analyses are considered costly in Brazil, due to expensive reagents such as clean-up cartridges and the use of high performance and expensive equipment, like LC-MS/MS and HPLC. Thus, in Brazil&#x02019;s reality, few health surveillance laboratories are qualified to perform these analyses. In this context, estimating the costs of these technologies is paramount in order to aid in the development of better strategies to enable wider access to these analyses. These calculations should include standard operating procedures, and both direct (reagents, supplies, hired personnel, equipment depreciation, general expenses, among others) and indirect costs (such as cleaning, building maintenance, property security, and energy). In addition, as many products for these analyses must be imported, the value must be converted into Brazilian currency at the commercial exchange rate on the date of the proposal (which is, currently (2019) at a 4 to 1 ratio, in American dollars, which makes some items prohibitively expensive), and about 30% extra on the total value is applied to cover additional import costs. These actions can help to standardize these assessments in future studies concerning the inclusion of these tests as a routine for monitoring fisher health through biomarker analyses, with possible future implementation in the Brazilian Public Health System.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional Information and Declarations</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><title>Competing Interests</title><fn id="conflict-1" fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Rachel Ann Hauser-Davis is an Academic Editor for PeerJ.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contributions"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn id="contribution-1" fn-type="con"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-1">Rachel Ann Hauser-Davis</xref> conceived and designed the experiments, performed the experiments, analyzed the data, contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, prepared figures and/or tables, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, approved the final draft.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Data Availability</title><fn id="addinfo-1"><p>The following information was supplied regarding data availability:</p><p>This is a review article, no raw data was collected.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><ref-list content-type="authoryear"><title>References</title><ref id="ref-1"><label>ACGIH (2017)</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)</collab></person-group><year>2017</year><article-title>TLVs and BEIs</article-title><source>Based on the documentation of the threshold limit values for chemical substances and physical agents and biological exposure indices</source><publisher-name>ACGIH</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Cincinnati</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref-2"><label>Arnold (2013)</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arnold</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><year>2013</year><article-title>The use of biomonitoring data in exposure and human health risk assessment: benzene case study</article-title><source>Critical Reviews in Toxicology</source><volume>43</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>119</fpage><lpage>153</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3109/10408444.2012.756455</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23346981</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref-3"><label>Boogaard &#x00026;
