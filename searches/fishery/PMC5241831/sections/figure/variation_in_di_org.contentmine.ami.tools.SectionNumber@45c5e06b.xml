  <div class="title">Variation in diversification of fishing opportunities across Alaskan communities.</div>
  <p>Average revenues from the largest six major species/groups in Alaska from 1980â€“2013 are aggregated by census area or borough. Pie chart diameter reflects the average annual revenue (mean earnings) from fishing in 2013 US dollars. Graphs for California, Oregon and Washington are for revenue from Alaskan state fisheries by permit holders residing in those states. Revenue is allocated to permit holder residence, not fishing area.</p>
