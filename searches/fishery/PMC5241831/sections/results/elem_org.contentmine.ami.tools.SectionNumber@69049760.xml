  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean regime shift reorganizes commercial fisheries catch</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ecosystems of the North Pacific Ocean are notoriously variable, expressing change at interannual and interdecadal time scales large enough to seriously challenge the sustainability of fishery-dependent communities. These unpredictable changes in productivity and species composition are due mostly to oceanographic changes that favour certain stocks or species. Importantly, these changes do not result in the unilateral collapse or benefit of all species; rather they cause a reshuffling of the relative abundances of important commercial species
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. It has been well documented that, in 1989, there were major changes in productivity and species composition across the North Pacific that have persisted since the regime shift
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>). There were observed changes in recruitment of many species
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>. Oceanographic changes are most likely to impact juvenile fishes and recruitment
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>; therefore, the timing of changes in adult stock size and impacts on fisheries will be dependent on the life-history of the species and age they recruit to the fishery
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how the 1989 regime shift affected commercial fisheries across Alaska, we evaluated changes over time in commercial fisheries harvest by stock. Using dynamic factor analysis (DFA)
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>, a dimension reduction technique developed specifically for time series, we searched for the most common shared trend among time series of commercial catches from 60 different fish stocks harvested throughout Alaska (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 1</a>). The dominant pattern in commercial fisheries catch shared among stocks shows striking changes around 1989 indicating the influence of the regime shift on fishery catches (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). However, not all stocks or species responded in the same direction (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a> inset). While total pounds harvested in Alaskan fisheries increased by about 30% after 1989, many stocks (66%) exhibit a negative response to the changes in ocean conditions after 1989 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a> inset). Notably, stocks of salmon and herring in the northern Bering Sea declined after 1989, but catches of walleye pollock and salmon in Southeast Alaska increased. How these shifts in the composition of commercially available species manifest as changes in revenue for resource-dependent communities is likely mediated by the exploitation strategies or constraints on individual communities.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean regime and market shifts impact fishing revenues</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand the impacts of the regime shift and changes in commercial fishery harvest on Alaskan fishing communities, we evaluated the trends in commercial fishing revenue which also changed substantially after the 1989 regime shift (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c,d</a>). We again used DFA on revenue time series for 105 Alaskan fishing communities, based on ex-vessel values, to reveal common trends in revenue that were shared among Alaska's fishing communities (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c,d</a>). There was model support for two independent trends in revenue over time (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 2</a>), both of which indicate significant changes in revenue derived from commercial fishing, but for different reasons. The first shared trend is highly correlated (
   <span class="italic">r</span>=0.86, Pearson correlation) with the common trend in commercial catches (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). The second shared trend is highly correlated (
   <span class="italic">r</span>=0.87, Pearson correlation) with the price-per-pound paid to fishers for Pacific salmon species, the dominant commercial fisheries by value in Alaska (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>). There are obvious feedbacks between catch and price as supply and demand relationships have strong influence on the value of fisheries
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>; however, this change in salmon price was driven primarily by a substantial increase in global aquaculture production of salmon
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">10</a>. While changes in catch or price alone can generate strong changes in revenue, synergistically they can influence revenue with no absolute change in either one. Simply changing the composition of catch among the different relative values can significantly impact revenue. Here we find that changes in revenue are significantly controlled by changes in catch, price and the product of the two (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 3</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diversity of fishing among Alaskan fishing communities</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A gradient in the diversity of fishing opportunities exists across Alaskan fishing communities that is driven by demographic and geographic patterns. Commercial fishing in Alaska is a vital source of income statewide providing $1.3 billion annually from harvest alone
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>, and in some remote areas where other sources of income are scarce, fishing may be the only major industry
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>. Despite the clear importance of fishing and the risks associated with fishing as an income source
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a>, many communities participate in only a few fisheries (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). In more developed regions, which have more access to capital or a higher diversity of commercial fish stocks nearby, communities often participate in 30 or more fisheries distributed across several species. Many communities participate in a similar group of fisheries, but few have their efforts broadly distributed across those fisheries (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Both the number of fisheries a community participates in and distribution among these (evenness) are potentially important dimensions of diversity and its role in stabilizing community revenues.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diversity and turnover provide resilience to regime changes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure the effect of diversification of fishing opportunities in creating resilient communities, we compared changes in revenue in response to the regime shifts against the degree of diversification in fishing communities across Alaska. Overall, 93 of 105 communities showed decreased fishing revenue following the 1989 regime shift and abrupt change in price, but the magnitude of the response was strongly modulated by diversity in the composition of each community's revenue (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). We compared the average revenue in the 10 years before 1989 with the average revenue in the 10 years following, and related the per cent change in revenue with each community's level of diversification across species and locations before the regime shift (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). Many communities lost &gt;50 per cent of their revenue following the 1989 regime shifts. Others saw large increases. Communities that participated in, and had revenue spread across a broader suite of fisheries showed smaller losses in revenue in response to the ecological and market changes that occurred in 1989 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). Communities with the highest levels of diversity saw little or no change in revenue. In aggregate, fishery revenues statewide declined by about 15%; therefore, a more diversified approach for many small communities could have reduced their revenue losses. An important aspect of this log-linear relationship is that a relatively small level of diversity, a value of approximately three (reciprocal Simpson's index), provides most of the benefit of diversification (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). Yet &gt;80 percent of communities fall below three and most are below two. For context, this value could correspond to a strategy with three fisheries evenly divided or a dominant fishery with several smaller supporting fisheries. Here a more even distribution among fisheries provided a greater benefit than the number of fisheries alone (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 4</a>). One of the major requirements for diversity to enhance stability is that components vary asynchronously. Simply diversifying among three similar species or across small spatial scales may not necessarily improve resilience.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second consequence of this log-linear relationship is that further increases in diversity may have diminishing returns. There is a need for more explicit assessments of how to distribute risk by constructing efficient resource portfolios in resource-dependent communities. Diversification of fishing opportunities, in this coupled human-natural system, substantially reduced the vulnerability of fisheries revenues into communities against these regime shifts, demonstrating the potential for resource heterogeneity to ameliorate risk to future abrupt changes in ecosystems and markets.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A major consequence of the 1989 regime shift was complementary changes in species abundance
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>, where some species increased in abundance as others showed marked declines. We measured turnover, the relative change in the composition of a community's catches, within each community's fishing portfolio from before to after 1989 using Jaccard's dissimilarity index. Together with diversification, turnover explained 26% of the variation in changes in community revenue including a significant interaction (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Tables 5 and 6</a>). Communities with the highest diversity had higher turnover while communities with small diversity had little or no turnover. Having a diverse portfolio of fishing opportunities and the ability to shift the relative distribution of stocks within the portfolio improved changes in revenue and in fact enabled some communities to increase revenue streams from fishing despite substantial shifts in abundance, species composition, and prices (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b</a>). While only a small level of diversity reduces vulnerability, having a large set of fishing options provides opportunity to more easily adapt to and take advantage of fluctuations in species abundance and prices. Creating and maintaining flexibility in fishing opportunities appears to be an effective tool for providing resilience against unforeseen changes in environmental and economic conditions.
