  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The state of Alaska manages all fisheries operating within three nautical miles of shore and a small set of fisheries operating in the USA exclusive economic zones (&gt;3 nautical miles). Alaskan commercial fisheries are delineated by taxa (either species or species group), the area harvested, and the gear used to harvest them. State managed fisheries are mostly managed using some form of limited entry where access is controlled, but can be bought or sold among parties. Any individual harvesting in a state managed fishery requires a permit specific to the taxa, area fished and gear used. All landed catches and revenue in Alaskan commercial fisheries are required to be reported. The Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission (CFEC) tracks landings and revenue by permit and permit-holder residency. Therefore, reported catch and revenue are assigned to communities where the permit holder resides. For confidentiality reasons, the CFEC cannot report very small fisheries that have less than four permit holders per community. Therefore, these fisheries are not included in our analysis. Management of sablefish and halibut fisheries switched to individual transferable quota systems in 1995, which could alter the revenue and catches in these fisheries. However, excluding catches and revenues for these species does not change the results in this study.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used community level gross fishing revenues data collated by the CFEC. These revenues represent the sum of annual gross fishing revenues attributable to CFEC commercial fishing permits registered to a specific Alaskan community. Some communities have seen changes and permit migration. We ran these analyses using revenue per permit fished to account for these changes, and there is no change in the results or conclusions. All revenue data were adjusted for inflation to 2013 USD using the US annual average consumer price index (

Salmon price data was provided by CFEC summary data. Prices were adjusted for inflation to 2013 USD using the USA annual average consumer price index.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To search for common trends in commercial fisheries catch among different stocks across Alaska as well as common patterns in community revenues we applied DFA
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a> to time series of commercial harvest by stock and to time series of Alaskan fishing community revenue (separate analyses). Similar to principal component analysis, DFA is a dimension reduction technique designed specifically for use with time series data. With DFA, we are trying to explain temporal variation in a set of 
   <span class="italic">n</span> observed time series using linear combinations of independent hidden random walks. The model structure is as follows:

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate common trends in commercial fisheries harvest among stocks around Alaska, we applied the DFA to time series of fisheries delineated by taxa and location harvest (that is, catch was aggregated among different gear types within the same taxa/location combination). This yielded an increased number of complete time series of catch. We limited stocks to only those that had no more than three zero-catch values (
   <span class="italic">n</span>=60). This increased the overall diversity of taxa and locations represented in the data. We compared models with one or two hidden trends as well as two error structures; where all stocks share a single observation error (diagonal and equal) and where all stocks have individual observation error (diagonal and unequal). All data were 
   <span class="italic">z</span>-scored to account for differences in means and intrinsic variance dynamics.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a separate analysis, we applied the DFA to time series of fishing community revenues allocated to Alaskan cities. For fishing communities we included only those that had non-zero revenue in all years between 1980 and 1999 (
   <span class="italic">n</span>=105). We compared models with 1 or 2 hidden trends as well as two error structures; where all stocks share a single observation error (diagonal and equal) and where all stocks have individual observation error (diagonal and unequal). All data were 
   <span class="italic">z</span>-scored to account for differences in means and intrinsic variance dynamics. DFA models were fit using the ‘MARSS' package in R

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure the effect of diversification on changes in community revenues and commercial fishing catches we compared revenue and catch before and after 1989 and diversity in fishing opportunities as well as turnover. We included only communities with non-zero revenue in all years between 1980–1999. Shifts in revenue were simply computed as the per cent change in the mean annual revenue for the period 1980–1989 and the period 1990–1999 allocated to individual communities. Changes in catches were computed this same way using total annual pounds landed allocated to individual communities. The earliest available year for catch and revenue data reported to individual communities is 1980 (total of 10 years pre-regime shift). For an even comparison we used only the 10 years post-1989 (1990–1999).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diversity was computed for each community over the 10 years before the 1989 (1980–1989). We used the reciprocal Simpson's index (1/D) where diversity (D)</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure turnover in the relative composition of a community's commercial fishing catches, we compared the commercial fisheries catches from before and after 1989. For each community a relative composition by fishery was computed based catches on for each of two periods, 1980–1989 and 1990–1999. Specifically, each fishery's contribution to the total catch for each period in total was computed. Then, the relative change in composition was computed using Jaccard's dissimilarity (
   <span class="italic">J</span>) index between these two time periods, A (1980–1989) and B (1990–1999).
