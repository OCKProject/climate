 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ecosystems of the North Pacific Ocean are notoriously variable, expressing change at interannual and interdecadal time scales large enough to seriously challenge the sustainability of fishery-dependent communities. These unpredictable changes in productivity and species composition are due mostly to oceanographic changes that favour certain stocks or species. Importantly, these changes do not result in the unilateral collapse or benefit of all species; rather they cause a reshuffling of the relative abundances of important commercial species
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. It has been well documented that, in 1989, there were major changes in productivity and species composition across the North Pacific that have persisted since the regime shift
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a> (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>). There were observed changes in recruitment of many species
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>. Oceanographic changes are most likely to impact juvenile fishes and recruitment
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>; therefore, the timing of changes in adult stock size and impacts on fisheries will be dependent on the life-history of the species and age they recruit to the fishery

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how the 1989 regime shift affected commercial fisheries across Alaska, we evaluated changes over time in commercial fisheries harvest by stock. Using dynamic factor analysis (DFA)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>, a dimension reduction technique developed specifically for time series, we searched for the most common shared trend among time series of commercial catches from 60 different fish stocks harvested throughout Alaska (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 1</a>). The dominant pattern in commercial fisheries catch shared among stocks shows striking changes around 1989 indicating the influence of the regime shift on fishery catches (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). However, not all stocks or species responded in the same direction (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a> inset). While total pounds harvested in Alaskan fisheries increased by about 30% after 1989, many stocks (66%) exhibit a negative response to the changes in ocean conditions after 1989 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a> inset). Notably, stocks of salmon and herring in the northern Bering Sea declined after 1989, but catches of walleye pollock and salmon in Southeast Alaska increased. How these shifts in the composition of commercially available species manifest as changes in revenue for resource-dependent communities is likely mediated by the exploitation strategies or constraints on individual communities.
