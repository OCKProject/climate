 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand the impacts of the regime shift and changes in commercial fishery harvest on Alaskan fishing communities, we evaluated the trends in commercial fishing revenue which also changed substantially after the 1989 regime shift (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c,d</a>). We again used DFA on revenue time series for 105 Alaskan fishing communities, based on ex-vessel values, to reveal common trends in revenue that were shared among Alaska's fishing communities (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c,d</a>). There was model support for two independent trends in revenue over time (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 2</a>), both of which indicate significant changes in revenue derived from commercial fishing, but for different reasons. The first shared trend is highly correlated (
  <span class="italic">r</span>=0.86, Pearson correlation) with the common trend in commercial catches (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). The second shared trend is highly correlated (
  <span class="italic">r</span>=0.87, Pearson correlation) with the price-per-pound paid to fishers for Pacific salmon species, the dominant commercial fisheries by value in Alaska (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>). There are obvious feedbacks between catch and price as supply and demand relationships have strong influence on the value of fisheries
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>; however, this change in salmon price was driven primarily by a substantial increase in global aquaculture production of salmon

While changes in catch or price alone can generate strong changes in revenue, synergistically they can influence revenue with no absolute change in either one. Simply changing the composition of catch among the different relative values can significantly impact revenue. Here we find that changes in revenue are significantly controlled by changes in catch, price and the product of the two (
