 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Diversity of fishing among Alaskan fishing communities</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A gradient in the diversity of fishing opportunities exists across Alaskan fishing communities that is driven by demographic and geographic patterns. Commercial fishing in Alaska is a vital source of income statewide providing $1.3 billion annually from harvest alone
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>, and in some remote areas where other sources of income are scarce, fishing may be the only major industry
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>. Despite the clear importance of fishing and the risks associated with fishing as an income source
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a>, many communities participate in only a few fisheries (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). In more developed regions, which have more access to capital or a higher diversity of commercial fish stocks nearby, communities often participate in 30 or more fisheries distributed across several species. Many communities participate in a similar group of fisheries, but few have their efforts broadly distributed across those fisheries (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Both the number of fisheries a community participates in and distribution among these (evenness) are potentially important dimensions of diversity and its role in stabilizing community revenues.
