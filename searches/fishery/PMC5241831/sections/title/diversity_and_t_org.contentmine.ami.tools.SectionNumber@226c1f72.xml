 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure the effect of diversification of fishing opportunities in creating resilient communities, we compared changes in revenue in response to the regime shifts against the degree of diversification in fishing communities across Alaska. Overall, 93 of 105 communities showed decreased fishing revenue following the 1989 regime shift and abrupt change in price, but the magnitude of the response was strongly modulated by diversity in the composition of each community's revenue (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). We compared the average revenue in the 10 years before 1989 with the average revenue in the 10 years following, and related the per cent change in revenue with each community's level of diversification across species and locations before the regime shift (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). Many communities lost &gt;50 per cent of their revenue following the 1989 regime shifts. Others saw large increases. Communities that participated in, and had revenue spread across a broader suite of fisheries showed smaller losses in revenue in response to the ecological and market changes that occurred in 1989 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). Communities with the highest levels of diversity saw little or no change in revenue. In aggregate, fishery revenues statewide declined by about 15%; therefore, a more diversified approach for many small communities could have reduced their revenue losses. An important aspect of this log-linear relationship is that a relatively small level of diversity, a value of approximately three (reciprocal Simpson's index), provides most of the benefit of diversification (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). Yet &gt;80 percent of communities fall below three and most are below two. For context, this value could correspond to a strategy with three fisheries evenly divided or a dominant fishery with several smaller supporting fisheries. Here a more even distribution among fisheries provided a greater benefit than the number of fisheries alone (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 4</a>). One of the major requirements for diversity to enhance stability is that components vary asynchronously. Simply diversifying among three similar species or across small spatial scales may not necessarily improve resilience.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second consequence of this log-linear relationship is that further increases in diversity may have diminishing returns. There is a need for more explicit assessments of how to distribute risk by constructing efficient resource portfolios in resource-dependent communities. Diversification of fishing opportunities, in this coupled human-natural system, substantially reduced the vulnerability of fisheries revenues into communities against these regime shifts, demonstrating the potential for resource heterogeneity to ameliorate risk to future abrupt changes in ecosystems and markets.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A major consequence of the 1989 regime shift was complementary changes in species abundance
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>, where some species increased in abundance as others showed marked declines. We measured turnover, the relative change in the composition of a community's catches, within each community's fishing portfolio from before to after 1989 using Jaccard's dissimilarity index. Together with diversification, turnover explained 26% of the variation in changes in community revenue including a significant interaction (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Tables 5 and 6</a>). Communities with the highest diversity had higher turnover while communities with small diversity had little or no turnover. Having a diverse portfolio of fishing opportunities and the ability to shift the relative distribution of stocks within the portfolio improved changes in revenue and in fact enabled some communities to increase revenue streams from fishing despite substantial shifts in abundance, species composition, and prices (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b</a>). While only a small level of diversity reduces vulnerability, having a large set of fishing options provides opportunity to more easily adapt to and take advantage of fluctuations in species abundance and prices. Creating and maintaining flexibility in fishing opportunities appears to be an effective tool for providing resilience against unforeseen changes in environmental and economic conditions.
