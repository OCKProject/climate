 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ninety four observations of presence and 36 observations of absence of MNF were received from 113 respondents. Here we explore only presence observations, in order to guard against bias, but the absence records are given for information in the Supplementary Material. Fifty seven observations were given from those working in the conservation and ecology sector, 17 from development and health, 17 with a fisheries focus and 3 in relevant commercial or tourism roles (

Numerous other methods were described by survey respondents, including a number of trap designs, ‘scoop’ or ‘dip’ nets, and the use of static ‘set’ nets used to funnel fish, sometimes with photographic evidence (
