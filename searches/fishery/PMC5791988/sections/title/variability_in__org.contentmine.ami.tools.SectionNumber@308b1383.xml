 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most deployment appears to remain small-scale, with the use of one or a few nets sewn together as small-scale seine nets in shallow-water environments. Use on coral reefs was reported infrequently and anecdotal information suggests that MNs are largely unsuitable for this environment due to frequent tearing.</p>

As long as people have a use or market for the associated species then it can be inferred that MNs may confer an important advantage to users either as an additional gear or an alternative livelihood choice. Use in shallow water may also mean that MN fishers can continue to engage in traditionally widespread gleaning activities for resources such as octopus and molluscs concurrently.
