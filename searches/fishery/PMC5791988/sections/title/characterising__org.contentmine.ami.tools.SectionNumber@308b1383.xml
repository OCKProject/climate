 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Characterising the global prevalence of MNF</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A critical question posed by the public health community when engaged on the issue of MNF and whether or not a policy response is required is: how widespread of an issue is it? Is it just isolated pockets on a few lakeshores or engaged in by multiple people in multiple communities? Here we have aimed to answer these questions to a degree necessary to catalyse an appropriate response. MNF is widely represented across all equatorial regions; our survey results confirm presence of the activity in most regions classified as ‘at risk’ areas for malarial transmission, save for European and Middle Eastern regions. This distribution correlates with regions where efforts to supply free and/or subsidised MNs as part of anti-malarial efforts are particularly pervasive [
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref003">3</a>]. Although it is unwise to infer absolute levels of prevalence of MNF by region from a non-random survey, recent suggestions of rapid increases in MNF activity in the East African region in the media, peer reviewed and grey literature [
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref006">6</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref022">22</a>] appear to be supported by our results, with a high concentration of reports both coastally and around the African Great Lakes. However, high response rates from Mozambique and Madagascar may be influenced by well-established networks of NGOs operating in the region that were able to distribute the survey widely.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cumulative frequency of first observations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191519.g002" href="#pone.0191519.g002">Fig 2</a>) appears to align with the cumulative number of nets distributed globally; according to the Alliance for Malaria Prevention (LLINs only are presented here, other nets have been distributed but not on a similar scale). The launch of WHO’s Roll Back Malaria (RBM) programme in 1998 had the goal of unifying public and private efforts towards tackling malaria globally. Goals were set for universal coverage of bed nets for those living in at-risk areas. A few years later large scale distribution programmes began globally, but with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa [
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref003">3</a>]. These results may therefore reflect the rise in MN distribution campaigns under the WHO malaria programme. However, they should be treated with caution as just ten respondents had witnessed the introduction of the activity personally (as opposed to on their arrival in an area). There are also well documented issues of recall accuracy and the fact that observer presence has increased in recent years stems from increased NGO activity in many regions, whether health or environment-focused.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in reported prevalence of MNF in Africa and Asia point towards a possible link between MNF and MN-distribution efforts. Net distribution efforts in Asia are considerably lower than in sub-Saharan Africa. Although internal national efforts exist, 82% of international investment has been directed to Africa [
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref003">3</a>], so net availability may be a contributing factor. The activity may also have a different level of visibility in Asia where small mesh nets in general are more common and MNs may be indistinguishable from other materials. The limited information gleaned for the Americas and Oceania, despite confirming presence of MNF from at least two sites in each region, does not support any broad inferences as to prevalence.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the limited peer reviewed literature incorporating information on MNF is largely focussed on freshwater environments [
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref023">23</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191519.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191519.ref024">24</a>], our survey suggests that MNF is widespread and frequent in marine environments. We can also infer that where MNF has been reported to occur (marine or freshwater) it is a frequent and perennial activity. This could indicate that MNF has become part of daily livelihood and/or consumption portfolios for at least certain user groups. Consideration of livelihoods is therefore of great importance when designing interventions/policy options.
