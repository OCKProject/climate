 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ethical approval for this research was granted through the Imperial College’s MSc in Conservation Science’s research ethics process, involving formal review and approval by a committee of Faculty members. All responses were anonymous unless the respondent chose to identify themselves. No questions required information which could identify individuals engaging in MNF and all personal information relating to respondents was available only to the authors. Quotes are only used with consent from respondents. Detailed location data (at a resolution finer than 1 degree or with descriptive information) are available only on application to the authors and based on the undertaking that fine-scale locations are not identified in subsequent analyses.</p>
