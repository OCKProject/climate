We examined changes in the seasonal distribution and relative abundance of monkfish in the scallop access areas in Closed Area I and Closed Area II on Georges Bank using catch data from a three-year seasonal scallop dredge survey. Over the course of the survey, more than 6,000 monkfish were caught and measured, and clear seasonal changes in monkfish abundance were documented. Monkfish catch peaked in the summer and early fall when they were caught across the entire survey area, while they were caught only in deeper waters at the edges of the bank in the winter. Monkfish relative abundance was modeled using a generalized linear mixed model with a Tweedie distribution, and the final model, with month, depth, and bottom temperature as fixed effects, effectively explained the seasonal shifts in the location and relative abundance of monkfish observed during this study. The results suggest that monkfish movements are driven by seasonal changes in bottom temperature. Management measures for monkfish are determined primarily based on data collected during the Northeast Fisheries Science Center bottom trawl surveys, yet this survey catches few monkfish, adding uncertainty to stock assessments. Our research indicates that increasing the use of dredge surveys to collect data on monkfish would be a positive step toward improving monkfish assessments. If monkfish movements are impacted by changes in thermal habitat, their distributions may shift in response to climate change, increasing the need for improved monkfish assessment strategies to effectively manage the species in the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>NOAA Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside</institution></funding-source><award-id>NA11NMF4540027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smolowitz</surname><given-names>Ronald J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>NOAA Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside</institution></funding-source><award-id>NA12NMF4540034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smolowitz</surname><given-names>Ronald J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>NOAA Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside</institution></funding-source><award-id>NA13NMF4540011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smolowitz</surname><given-names>Ronald J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the NOAA Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside grants NA11NMF4540027, NA12NMF4540034, and NA13NMF4540011 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/coopresearch/rsa_program.html">https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/coopresearch/rsa_program.html</ext-link>).

Monkfish are widely distributed across a range of depths (inshore to &#x0003e;900 meters) and temperatures (0&#x000b0;to 24&#x000b0;C), and they are caught in all sampled depths and temperatures during the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) annual seasonal surveys [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Early genetic analysis indicated that the American monkfish population was a single genetic stock, with no differentiation between individuals caught from the North Carolina to Maine [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but more recent studies revealed genetic differentiation between American monkfish caught north and south of Delaware Bay where its range overlaps that of the congeneric blackfin goosefish (<italic>Lophius gastrophysus</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The monkfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) was created in response to significant increases in monkfish landings in the mid- to late- 1980s, and it first took effect in 1999 [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Monkfish are currently managed as two units, with the boundary between the Northern Fishery Management Area (NFMA) and Southern Fishery Management Area (SFMA) cutting across Georges Bank at 41&#x000b0;N latitude (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206829.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). Although there is no evidence of distinct northern and southern biological stocks corresponding to this boundary [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], recent tagging studies indicate that there is limited movement between management areas, with all observed movements occurring from the NFMA to the SFMA [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The fishery is managed through a days-at-sea system coupled with trip limits, and fishing is permitted year round. Landings peak in spring in both management areas [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Most commercial catch is taken by trawl gear in the NFMA, in a fishery that is integrated with the Northeast multispecies fishery [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the SFMA, monkfish are caught mainly in a targeted gillnet fishery [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Vessels with commercial scalloping permits can land monkfish, and scallop dredges accounted for up to 40% of landings in the NFMA and half of landings in the SFMA in the 1980s and 1990s [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Yet seasonal changes in monkfish abundance indices have suggested seasonal movements in opposite directions. In the early 1900s, Tracy (1906) stated that monkfish were common in inshore Rhode Island waters from April until July and in October, but absent during summer months [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. He hypothesized that monkfish migrated into deep waters during the summer to avoid warm temperatures because monkfish were caught in depths of 240&#x02013;730 meters in September, while they were distributed widely in shallower waters in the spring and fall. Yet recent surveys indicate that more monkfish inhabit shallow waters during summer months and move into deep waters during the winter, a trend opposite from what was documented previously [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Tagging studies offer a more direct method for tracking migrations. A single monkfish was caught and tagged on the northern edge of Georges Bank in December 2003 and caught six months later near Cape Cod, Massachusetts [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. More recently, a total of 607 data storage tags were implanted in monkfish off the eastern coast of the US from offshore Gulf of Maine to Virginia between 2008 and 2014, and 46 of these fish were recaptured [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Inshore migrations were documented for four monkfish tagged off the continental shelf in Block Canyon in April 2011. Each fish moved into shallow inshore southern New England waters by late May, and these inshore migrations moved the monkfish into warmer waters during with temperatures increasing from lows of 4&#x02013;6&#x000b0;C to highs of 20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C; however, one fish stayed inshore through February of the following year as temperatures approached 0&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While these studies showed that some monkfish migrate between deeper offshore waters in the winter and shallow inshore waters in the summer, they did not differentiate between movements toward shore versus movements into shallower depths or preferred temperatures due to limited sample sizes, release dates, and locations.</p><p>The NEFSC spring (March&#x02013;May) and fall (September&#x02013;November) bottom trawl survey is the main source of data used to define Biological Reference Points for monkfish stock assessments and Essential Fish Habitats for juvenile and adult monkfish [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These seasonal surveys, conducted twice a year along the east coast of the United States out to depths of &#x0003e;350 meters, use a lined survey trawl modeled after commercial fishing gear [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additional surveys using shrimp survey and commercial trawls and scallop survey dredges have been used to supplement the data collected by the NEFSC spring and fall surveys when possible [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Because none of these surveys provide sufficient data at an appropriate scale throughout the year for examining seasonal changes in monkfish distributions on Georges Bank, we analyzed catch and environmental data (depth and temperature) collected during a three-year seasonal scallop dredge survey focused on the scallop access areas in Closed Area I (CAI) and Closed Area II (CAII) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206829.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). While this survey covered a much smaller area than the NEFSC seasonal trawl surveys, the higher spatial and temporal resolution provided an opportunity to examine the movements and distribution of monkfish in a new way.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to describe and model seasonal changes in monkfish distribution and relative abundance on Georges Bank. In addition, scallop dredges were assessed as monkfish survey gear by comparing catch per unit area and length frequencies from this study with catch statistics from the NEFSC bottom trawl survey. Finally, we examined the shifts in monkfish catch relative to depth and temperature, and because the shallow stations were located in the center of the survey area rather than closer to shore, investigated if seasonal movements were between inshore and offshore areas or shallow and deep waters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Seasonal bycatch survey</title><p>All fishing surveys were approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service through Exempted Fishing Permits issued by the Northeast Regional Administrator to the Coonamessett Farm Foundation and the fishing vessels participating in the research.</p><p>We conducted 27 survey trips aboard commercial sea scallop fishing vessels between May 2011 and March 2014. Surveys were performed monthly from May 2011 until November 2011, and then every six weeks from January 2012 until March 2014. The sampling locations were located in CAI and CAII on Georges Bank, with some additional stations south and west of CAII (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206829.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). The survey used a fixed grid design, with 31 stations sampled during every trip in CAI and 44 stations sampled during every trip in CAII, with 16 additional stations sampled in the open areas adjoining CAII during the final year of the study. Station depths ranged from 37 to 108 meters. CAI stations were separated by 5.4 km east to west and 7.2 km north to south, while CAII stations were separated by 8.6 km east to west and 11.1 km north to south. Open area stations (areas open for scallop fishing year round) added in 2013 were grouped with CAII stations for all analyses.</p><p>During each survey, two commercially rigged scallop dredges were towed from the vessel: a standardized 4.57m-wide turtle-deflector dredge (TDD) (<bold><xref rid="pone.0206829.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>) and a New Bedford-style dredge (NBD) supplied by the vessel or by Coonamessett Farm Foundation (CFF) [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Each tow passed through the center of the pre-determined grid cell from a start point decided by the vessel captain. Under ideal conditions, the tows were 30 minutes long at 4.8 knots (8.89 km/h). If a tow lasted less than twenty minutes or had gear complications, it was declared invalid and the station would be towed a second time. Start coordinates, depth, and temperature were recorded for each tow, with temperature and depth recorded every 30 seconds by two loggers (Vemco Minilog temperature logger and Star-Oddi DST milli-TD temperature-depth logger) attached to the dredges.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0206829.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0206829.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Gear specifications for the turtle-deflector dredge.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0206829.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0206829.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Specification</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rings</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Commercial 4-inch</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Width</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.57 meters</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Apron</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8-by-40 ring</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bag</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10-by-40 ring</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sides</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6-by-18 ring</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Skirt</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 ring</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Twine top</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.5 inch stretched mesh</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hanging ratio</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2:1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Turtle mat</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">present</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ticklers</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 rows</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scope</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3:1 + 10</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>After each tow, scallops and commercially important bycatch species were sorted, counted, and measured.

To examine how total, juvenile, and adult monkfish abundance was distributed relative to sampled bottom temperatures and depths, the unweighted and abundance-weighted cumulative frequency distributions of each variable were plotted by season, and the cumulative distributions were compared using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Using the tow midpoints, based on coordinates recorded at sea, to specify survey locations, the abundance of monkfish caught in the CFF dredge was plotted by month using ArcGIS. The abundance of juvenile and adult monkfish were also plotted by season (winter: December-February, spring: March-May, summer: June-August, fall: September-November), with monkfish categorized based on the 50% length at maturity cutoff of 43 cm used for monkfish management [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Comparison of CFF dredge and NEFSC bottom trawl monkfish catch</title><p>The NEFSC has conducted seasonal bottom trawl surveys along the northeastern coast of the United States since 1963 using standardized trawls modeled after commercial gear [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

Furthermore, longitude was correlated with depth in both closed areas and with latitude in CAII.

Over the three-year project, there were clear seasonal changes in monkfish relative abundance, with monkfish caught across all of the survey area in the summer but only in deeper waters at the edges of the bank in the winter. Inshore offshore migrations were not apparent. Although monkfish catch was higher at the deeper survey stations throughout the year, this shift was more pronounced during the winter, spring, and fall. The selected model, which incorporated month, depth, and bottom temperature, accounted for the seasonal shifts in the location and relative abundance of monkfish observed during this study.</p><p>Bottom temperature and depth are recognized as important determinants of fish distributions [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although monkfish are found across a wide range of temperatures, previous studies reported that they are most abundant where bottom temperatures range from 4&#x02013;14&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our study had similar results, with the majority of monkfish caught when bottom temperatures ranged from 5&#x02013;14&#x000b0;C. An apparent preference for moderate water temperatures was most obvious during the fall, when sampled bottom temperatures were warmest, and in the winter and spring, when bottom temperatures were cold.</p><p>Although monkfish are also found across a wide range of depths, previous research has noted a preference for waters deeper than 70 meters on the Scotian Shelf [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and relatively deeper than sampled stations during the NEFSC trawl surveys [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We consistently caught more monkfish at stations with depths greater than 60 meters, with over 50% of the catch at stations with depths greater than 70 meters for all months but June and July. The movement of monkfish from shallow waters during summer months into deeper waters during other seasons has been noted for the SFMA and the Scotian Shelf, and both studies suggested that monkfish migrated due to changes in thermal habitat [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This study also suggests that movements are driven by seasonal changes in bottom temperature. Similar seasonal migrations of Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>) have been associated with tracking prey [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and although monkfish are opportunistic feeders [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], prey availability may influence their distributions as well. Because seasonal shifts were observed for both adult and juvenile monkfish, migrations are not clearly linked to reproduction.</p><p>The observed catch was greater than 20 monkfish in just under 0.8% of the survey tows, but the final pair of models did not predict these rare extreme values. The values of the predictors for these catches were similar to those observed during the more frequent smaller catches. It is likely that monkfish catch is influenced by variables we could not include in the model. For instance, we recently conducted seasonal dredge surveys and co-located benthic video surveys in Southern New England waters and observed that monkfish catch in scallop dredges was strongly correlated to benthic substrate type (sand, gravel, or rocky substrates), with monkfish caught primarily on sandy substrate (unpublished data). Similar preferences for fine sediments (sand and silt) have been noted previously [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Previous analysis of monkfish distribution in the Northwest Atlantic, based on NEFSC bottom trawl surveys, concluded that monkfish are not common in shallower waters on Georges Bank [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, this survey regularly caught monkfish on Georges Bank at depths of &#x0003c; 50 meters, notably during summer months, with catch numbers per tow that often exceeded NEFSC spring and fall survey catch numbers per tow across the NFMA and the entire survey range. Although the CFF bycatch survey was conducted in the NFMA, the seasonal trend observed in this study agrees more closely with previously reported distribution patterns for monkfish in the SFMA [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Richards et al. (2008) summarized monkfish catch data from the NEFSC bottom-trawl surveys in 1948&#x02013;1949 and 1963&#x02013;2007. During winter and spring months, monkfish catch numbers were higher at deep stations, while catch was distributed across all station depths during summer months. In fall months, catch was higher in deeper waters in the SFMA, while monkfish were caught across all sampled depths in the NFMA. Seasonal distribution patterns reported for the northern area are effectively those observed in the Gulf of Maine [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], so it is not surprising that monkfish seasonal patterns in CAI and CAII are more similar to those observed in the southern parts of Georges Bank that lie within the SFMA.</p><p>Monkfish catchability in the NEFSC survey trawl is low relative to commercial trawl gear and commercial and survey scallop dredges [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Our results suggest that uncertainties in the stock assessment that arise from the low bottom trawl catch numbers may be compounded by systematic changes in the relative efficiency of the trawl with bottom temperature. The catch ratio between the two gears is a rough estimate of the relative efficiencies of the two gear types, and the NEFSC trawl/CFF dredge ratio decreased with decreasing bottom temperatures, indicating that monkfish catchability may be particularly low in the bottom trawl relative to the scallop dredge at lower temperatures. Water temperature is known to affect fish swimming speed, herding behavior, and response time to approaching gear [<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0206829.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, a change in relative efficiencies is not surprising, but the difference by gear type is puzzling and calls for further investigation to validate this result with a larger sample size.</p><p>The need for additional research on all aspects of monkfish biology is widely recognized. The NEFSC seasonal bottom trawl surveys catch few monkfish, adding uncertainty to stock assessments. Furthermore, because the long-term NEFSC seasonal surveys include few stations in each survey strata and they are conducted during only two seasons, important seasonal distribution patterns may be undocumented. Our research indicates that increasing the use of dredge surveys to collect data on monkfish would be a positive step toward improving monkfish assessments. Moreover, current assumptions about a low abundance of monkfish on Georges Bank, as well as the appropriateness of including Georges Bank monkfish in a management unit dominated by Gulf of Maine fish, may need to be reevaluated. If monkfish movements are driven by changes in bottom temperatures, their distributions may shift in response to climate change, increasing the need for improved monkfish assessment strategies to effectively manage the species in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank our colleagues at CFF for their participation in the bycatch study over the years.
