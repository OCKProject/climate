 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NEFSC has conducted seasonal bottom trawl surveys along the northeastern coast of the United States since 1963 using standardized trawls modeled after commercial gear [

  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref023">23</a>]. To assess differences between data from the CFF bycatch and the 2009–2014 NEFSC trawl surveys that are used to for monkfish management, we plotted the size frequency data from the seasonal bycatch survey and the NEFSC spring and fall bottom trawl surveys conducted in the areas covered by the bycatch survey (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To generally assess trends between monkfish catch in the trawl and dredge, we identified pairs of CFF dredge and NEFSC trawl stations that were spatially and temporally close (depth ≤ 7 meters apart, distance ≤ 6.5 km apart, sampling date ≤ 7.5 days apart). Catch numbers were adjusted for swept area based on the average swept area for the bycatch survey tows and the reported global mean swept area for trawl survey tows [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref024">24</a>]. In addition to comparing the adjusted catch numbers, we analyzed changes in the catch ratio (trawl/dredge) at each station pair with the average station depth and bottom temperature for all pairs with catches greater than zero for one gear type.
