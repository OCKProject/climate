 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the seasonal bycatch survey, monkfish relative abundance in the closed areas on Georges Bank increased markedly during summer and early fall months. Over the three-year project, there were clear seasonal changes in monkfish relative abundance, with monkfish caught across all of the survey area in the summer but only in deeper waters at the edges of the bank in the winter. Inshore offshore migrations were not apparent. Although monkfish catch was higher at the deeper survey stations throughout the year, this shift was more pronounced during the winter, spring, and fall. The selected model, which incorporated month, depth, and bottom temperature, accounted for the seasonal shifts in the location and relative abundance of monkfish observed during this study.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bottom temperature and depth are recognized as important determinants of fish distributions [

  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref041">41</a>]. Although monkfish are found across a wide range of temperatures, previous studies reported that they are most abundant where bottom temperatures range from 4–14°C [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref003">3</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref034">34</a>]. Our study had similar results, with the majority of monkfish caught when bottom temperatures ranged from 5–14°C. An apparent preference for moderate water temperatures was most obvious during the fall, when sampled bottom temperatures were warmest, and in the winter and spring, when bottom temperatures were cold.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although monkfish are also found across a wide range of depths, previous research has noted a preference for waters deeper than 70 meters on the Scotian Shelf [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref016">16</a>], and relatively deeper than sampled stations during the NEFSC trawl surveys [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref003">3</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref041">41</a>]. We consistently caught more monkfish at stations with depths greater than 60 meters, with over 50% of the catch at stations with depths greater than 70 meters for all months but June and July. The movement of monkfish from shallow waters during summer months into deeper waters during other seasons has been noted for the SFMA and the Scotian Shelf, and both studies suggested that monkfish migrated due to changes in thermal habitat [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref016">16</a>]. This study also suggests that movements are driven by seasonal changes in bottom temperature. Similar seasonal migrations of Atlantic cod (
  <span class="italic">Gadus morhua</span>) have been associated with tracking prey [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref042">42</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref043">43</a>], and although monkfish are opportunistic feeders [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref002">2</a>], prey availability may influence their distributions as well. Because seasonal shifts were observed for both adult and juvenile monkfish, migrations are not clearly linked to reproduction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed catch was greater than 20 monkfish in just under 0.8% of the survey tows, but the final pair of models did not predict these rare extreme values. The values of the predictors for these catches were similar to those observed during the more frequent smaller catches. It is likely that monkfish catch is influenced by variables we could not include in the model. For instance, we recently conducted seasonal dredge surveys and co-located benthic video surveys in Southern New England waters and observed that monkfish catch in scallop dredges was strongly correlated to benthic substrate type (sand, gravel, or rocky substrates), with monkfish caught primarily on sandy substrate (unpublished data). Similar preferences for fine sediments (sand and silt) have been noted previously [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous analysis of monkfish distribution in the Northwest Atlantic, based on NEFSC bottom trawl surveys, concluded that monkfish are not common in shallower waters on Georges Bank [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref003">3</a>]. Nevertheless, this survey regularly caught monkfish on Georges Bank at depths of &lt; 50 meters, notably during summer months, with catch numbers per tow that often exceeded NEFSC spring and fall survey catch numbers per tow across the NFMA and the entire survey range. Although the CFF bycatch survey was conducted in the NFMA, the seasonal trend observed in this study agrees more closely with previously reported distribution patterns for monkfish in the SFMA [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref003">3</a>]. Richards et al. (2008) summarized monkfish catch data from the NEFSC bottom-trawl surveys in 1948–1949 and 1963–2007. During winter and spring months, monkfish catch numbers were higher at deep stations, while catch was distributed across all station depths during summer months. In fall months, catch was higher in deeper waters in the SFMA, while monkfish were caught across all sampled depths in the NFMA. Seasonal distribution patterns reported for the northern area are effectively those observed in the Gulf of Maine [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref003">3</a>], so it is not surprising that monkfish seasonal patterns in CAI and CAII are more similar to those observed in the southern parts of Georges Bank that lie within the SFMA.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monkfish catchability in the NEFSC survey trawl is low relative to commercial trawl gear and commercial and survey scallop dredges [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref003">3</a>]. Our results suggest that uncertainties in the stock assessment that arise from the low bottom trawl catch numbers may be compounded by systematic changes in the relative efficiency of the trawl with bottom temperature. The catch ratio between the two gears is a rough estimate of the relative efficiencies of the two gear types, and the NEFSC trawl/CFF dredge ratio decreased with decreasing bottom temperatures, indicating that monkfish catchability may be particularly low in the bottom trawl relative to the scallop dredge at lower temperatures. Water temperature is known to affect fish swimming speed, herding behavior, and response time to approaching gear [
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref044">44</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0206829.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206829.ref046">46</a>]. Therefore, a change in relative efficiencies is not surprising, but the difference by gear type is puzzling and calls for further investigation to validate this result with a larger sample size.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The need for additional research on all aspects of monkfish biology is widely recognized. The NEFSC seasonal bottom trawl surveys catch few monkfish, adding uncertainty to stock assessments. Furthermore, because the long-term NEFSC seasonal surveys include few stations in each survey strata and they are conducted during only two seasons, important seasonal distribution patterns may be undocumented. Our research indicates that increasing the use of dredge surveys to collect data on monkfish would be a positive step toward improving monkfish assessments. Moreover, current assumptions about a low abundance of monkfish on Georges Bank, as well as the appropriateness of including Georges Bank monkfish in a management unit dominated by Gulf of Maine fish, may need to be reevaluated. If monkfish movements are driven by changes in bottom temperatures, their distributions may shift in response to climate change, increasing the need for improved monkfish assessment strategies to effectively manage the species in the future.</p>
