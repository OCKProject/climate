  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref024">24</a>]. Retrospective predictions of the cod stock capture much of the observed interannual variability (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3a</a>), but are particularly successful in capturing the multi-year to decadal stock fluctuations. Prediction skill on predominantly multi-year time scales is evident by low correlations between high-pass filtered (5-year cut-off) predictions and observations. The multi-year skill is consistent with previous studies finding low-frequency fish stock variability in the subpolar North Atlantic and Nordic Seas to be associated with hydrographic variability [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean temperature anomalies affect the cod stock in several ways, including through recruitment, individual growth, and predator and prey abundance [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref002">2</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref024">24</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref042">42</a>]. The statistical relationship identified here represents the sum of all these, and, although the importance of specific mechanisms cannot be ascertained, we will in the following elaborate on some of them.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Starting at birth, the total larval mortality decreases when temperatures increases as the development time for cod eggs—from when they spawn to when they hatch—decreases, and, consequently, the accumulated time the larvae spend in the early and most vulnerable life stages is reduced [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref043">43</a>]. Within the range of temperatures experienced in the Barents Sea, temperature furthermore has a significant positive effect on growth rates of cod [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref020">20</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref044">44</a>]. Another direct effect of increased ocean temperatures is an increase in the suitable feeding area, which offer release from food competition and cannibalism through extended overlap with prey and better adult stock productivity [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref001">1</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indirectly, temperature affects early life stages and recruitment processes of the Barents Sea cod in complex ways, predominantly through grazing on the zooplankton species 
  <span class="italic">Calanus finmarchicus</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref045">45</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref046">46</a>]. Ocean temperature and the abundance of 
  <span class="italic">C. finmarchicus</span> in the Barents Sea are linked by their mutual dependence on the inflow of Atlantic water from the Norwegian Sea; a strong inflow associated with increased ocean temperatures and increased advection of zooplankton from upstream production regions [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref043">43</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref046">46</a>]. In addition, as the ocean temperature increases and the sea ice extent is reduced the annual net primary production increases, leading to increased biomass and production of zooplankton and, hence, a larger fish stock [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref025">25</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref047">47</a>]. Primary production has accordingly been used in prediction models of cod recruitment in the Barents Sea [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref022">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although lower than for cod stock biomass, the skill in predicting cod recruitment is similar to that obtained by [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref021">21</a>] for the period 1947–1995 using ocean temperatures in the Barents Sea (Kola section) 2 years in advance as predictor. A stronger and more predictable relationship between hydrography and total stock biomass than with recruitment (cf. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3</a>) is consistent with total stock biomass variability reflecting the integrated (multi-year) effects on fish stocks, and, hence, being less sensitive to year-to-year differences in early life-history dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref048">48</a>]. The total cod stock biomass furthermore mainly reflects adult cod dynamics. The adult cod population is most sensitive to changes in the extent of the suitable feeding area [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref049">49</a>], which closely corresponds to the size of the Atlantic water domain [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref004">4</a>]. The size of the Atlantic domain, i.e., the ice-free area of the Barents Sea, is in turn largely a delayed response to the inflowing Atlantic water [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref017">17</a>], consistent with temperature-driven cod distribution and population changes [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref004">4</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to hydrography, it has also been widely attempted to relate ecosystem variability in the Nordic and Barents Seas, including fish stocks, to large-scale atmospheric circulation [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref050">50</a>] and in particular to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic region [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref051">51</a>]. However, the correlation between the winter NAO index [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref051">51</a>] and the Barents Sea cod stock biomass is low and not significant (for all lead times) for the time period considered here. The NAO is also considered to be largely unpredictable for lead times longer than a year [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref052">52</a>] and therefore cannot be used for multi-year predictions as presented here.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A major source of uncertainty in statistical predictions is whether the identified relationships hold when projected into the future [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref053">53</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref054">54</a>]. Changes in fishing pressure can for example lead to a mismatch between predicted and observed cod stock (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3d</a>). After the introduction of a harvest control rule for cod in 2003 and the subsequent introduction of measures to avoid underreporting of catches, the harvest rates stabilized at a low level from 2007 onwards [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref030">30</a>]. The harvest rates are expected to remain stable in the future [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref030">30</a>], but as any changes in fishing pressure can lead to prediction biases, different levels of fishing pressure should be considered when further developing predictions for cod stock biomass.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a significant part of future changes in the Barents Sea cod stock can be skilfully predicted based on upstream ocean variability. The 7-year prediction horizon is based on the poleward propagation of hydrographic anomalies along the Atlantic water pathway toward the Barents Sea (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g001" href="#pone.0206319.g001">Fig 1</a>). The specific temperature-fish stock relations that the predictions presented here are based on are specific to the Barents Sea cod, but the methodology applied should be applicable to other regions and stocks affected by delayed ocean climate signals. Dynamical prediction models have demonstrated particular multi-year forecast skill of ocean temperature in the subpolar North Atlantic [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref010">10</a>]. Whether this ability to predict the ocean environment translates into predictable fish stock responses has not yet been much assessed, but there are indications that the skill extends to large marine ecosystems on the adjacent coastal shelves [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref007">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both our statistical long-term predictions and the short-term ICES predictions show a gradual decline in the cod stock over the next few years. This is the opposite of the development expected over this century from future climate change projections. In a warming world, higher ocean temperatures and reduced sea ice extent may result in favorable conditions for increased biological production and a northward migration of fish stocks [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref055">55</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref056">56</a>]. This apparent discrepancy between decadal cod stock changes (captured by our predictions) and future projections results from large internal variability in the Barents Sea climate system, expressed by periods of decadal temperature decrease and sea ice growth superimposed on a gradual warming trend [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref057">57</a>]. Multi-year predictions, like those presented here, thus fill the gap between short-term operational predictions and century-scale climate change projections.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Integrating the identified relationship between upstream climate variability and cod stock into management frameworks could enable the possibility of better fisheries management advice on a longer time scale than today. Seasonal forecasts are already widely used in management, predominately informing on the spatial distribution of fish stocks [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref013">13</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref014">14</a>]. Similarly, multi-year to decadal forecasts can be used to inform stakeholders and decision makers on expected longer-term changes in fish stocks. For the Barents Sea specifically, the warming and loss of sea ice that took place between 2004 and 2012 could have been predicted [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref058">58</a>], and this information could have been used to predict the northward expansion of boreal fish species that occurred over the same period [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref004">4</a>]. Such prior knowledge could enable the fisheries community to better survey, exploit, and manage these resources [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref059">59</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref060">60</a>]. However, we note that although this study has focused solely on cod, the management of fish stocks in the Barents Sea needs to have a multi-species perspective [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref061">61</a>].
