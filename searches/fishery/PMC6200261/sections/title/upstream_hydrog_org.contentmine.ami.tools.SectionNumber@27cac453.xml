 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lagged peak correlations between hydrographic time series along the Atlantic water pathway (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g001" href="#pone.0206319.g001">Fig 1b</a>) and the Barents Sea cod stock (total stock biomass; TSB) are summarized in 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206319.t001">Table 1</a> (note that correlations are most often also significant 1 year before and after the peak lag). As previously reported, higher temperatures in the western Barents Sea (BSO) correspond to higher cod stock biomass with a lag of 2–3 years [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref021">21</a>]. Temperature variations in the Atlantic inflow across the Greenland–Scotland ridge (FSC and IFR) precede Barents Sea temperatures by 2–4 years, and, consistently, cod stock biomass by 7 years. The correlations and lags between salinity time series, and between salinity and cod stock, are comparable to those inferred from temperature (
  <a rid="pone.0206319.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206319.t001">Table 1</a>), suggesting that the predictive link between the subpolar North Atlantic and Barents Sea is of advective origin and related to Atlantic water circulation changes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Atlantic inflow to the Nordic Seas has been associated with variations in the strength and shape of the SPG [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref040">40</a>]. This is reflected in a 2–3-year lag between the SPG index and Atlantic inflow temperatures (
  <a rid="pone.0206319.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206319.t001">Table 1</a>), and a 4-year lag between SPG and BSO temperatures. The correlations and lags are similar if we consider the AMO index, which reflects basin-scale ocean temperature variations in the North Atlantic [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref033">33</a>]. There is a slight tendency for cod stock biomass to be more related to the upstream AMO index than the more local time series (BSO). This might be because the fish stock tends to be more influenced by lower frequency variability better captured by area-averaged indexes. In summary, observed hydrographic variability in the subpolar North Atlantic and in the Atlantic inflow branches to the Nordic Seas leads cod stock variations in the Barents Sea by approximately 6–8 years.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is also a significant correlation between upstream hydrographic variability and cod recruitment. Consistent with the 7-year lag between upstream hydrography and total stock biomass, the maximum correlation between recruitment and hydrography in FSC and IFR is found for a 5-year lag (
  <span class="italic">r</span> ∼ 0.4), whereas recruitment leads stock changes by 2 years. The latter reflects that the contribution from a year-class to TSB becomes noticeable from the age of 4-5 years.
