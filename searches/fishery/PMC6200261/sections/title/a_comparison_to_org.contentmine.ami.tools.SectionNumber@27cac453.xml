 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our predictions of TSB are now compared with short-term (1–3 years) predictions provided annually by the ICES AFWG (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3c</a>), and which takes into account both survey indexes, physical environment and prey abundance in predictions of recruitment [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref030">30</a>]. The comparison is done for the time period 1983–2017 when ICES predictions are available. The ICES predictions with a 1-year lead time are better than our 7-year predictions, but do not outperform the lagged persistence forecasts (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g002" href="#pone.0206319.g002">Fig 2c</a>). For 2-year and 3-year lead times the ICES AFWG prediction skill is less than that achieved by considering upstream SST at a longer lead time. Unlike the ICES predictions, our long-term prediction also beats the persistence benchmark for lead times longer than one year. We note that the skill of our prediction model for the time period 1983–2017 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g002" href="#pone.0206319.g002">Fig 2c</a>) is the same if the statistical model is trained only with data prior to 1983. The predicted cod stock anomalies from ICES AFWG also show a stock decrease for 2018 and 2019 with similar magnitudes as our long-term predictions (
