 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the identified lagged correlations between upstream hydrography and Barents Sea cod stock (TSB; 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206319.t001">Table 1</a>), prediction models with a 7-year prediction horizon are constructed. The following predictor variables were considered, individually and in combination, and all leading cod stock TSB by 7 years: SPG and AMO indexes, and temperature and salinity from FSC and IFR (denoted 
  <span class="italic">TS</span>
  <sub>gsr</sub> when combined). We note that the aim of the statistical prediction models is not to perfectly model cod stock variability using all available information (including for example fishing mortality or TSB in previous years), but to assess the predictive ability of upstream hydrographic anomalies. Moreover, TSB or fishing mortality do not add predictive information on the 7-year prediction horizon assessed here.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temperature and salinity of the Atlantic inflow to the Nordic Seas are good predictors of cod stock TSB, but the skill is further increased if the AMO index is included (
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.79; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g002" href="#pone.0206319.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</a>). Prediction skill is lowest if the prediction model is based only on SPG temperatures. Skill computed for fitting and independent periods are similar for all models, suggesting that prediction skill is real and not artificial. The robustness of the regression coefficients is further illustrated by the limited spread of the different predictions from the cross-validation procedure (gray shading in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3a and 3b</a>). The TSB time series is significantly autocorrelated at lead times of 1–2 years, and lagged persistence forecasts accordingly show skill at short lead times. The skill of our predictions nevertheless outperforms that of lagged persistence forecasts for lead times longer than 1 year (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g002" href="#pone.0206319.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</a>; the persistence forecast corresponds to the observed value of the year prior to the forecast).

   <p>(a,b) Prediction skill for the different cross-validated multiple linear regression models used to predict the Barents Sea cod stock biomass (TSB). The different hydrographic predictors are indicated on the x-axes (see 
    <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">Materials and methods</a> for definitions). The bars show the median value from the cross-validation procedure, whereas the vertical black lines show the inter-quartile range. The horizontal black dashed lines are the lagged persistence (LP) forecasts at different lags, i.e., LP7 is the 7-year lagged persistence forecast. See text for abbreviations. (c) A skill comparison between our 7-year prediction and short-term predictions provided by ICES AFWG (1–3 years, abbreviated IC1–3; green dashed lines) for the time period 1983–2017. The green shading is the inter-quartile range obtained by sub-sampling of the data (see Data and

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future predictions based on hydrographic data from the Nordic Seas Atlas show a slight decline in cod stock toward year 2019, although values are still above the long-term (1950–2012) average. Using observed Atlantic water salinities from the Faroe–Shetland Channel (IROC) between 1957–2017 and the AMO index as predictors the correlation between observations and retrospective predictions is 0.73. Future predictions show a further decline in the cod stock toward 2024 (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3e</a>), but are less successful in reproducing the interannual variance (as measured by the Brier score; 
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.27). The larger uncertainty in the predictions is also seen from the wider spread in the cross-validated regression coefficients (gray shading). Nevertheless, our predictions are more skilful than that of random chance and lagged persistence forecasts for any lead times (not shown).
