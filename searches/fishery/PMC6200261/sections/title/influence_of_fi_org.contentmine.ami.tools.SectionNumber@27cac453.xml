  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref023">23</a>]. The statistical prediction models do not include explicit information on fishing pressure. However, as the statistical predictions are trained on historical cod stock data, fishing pressure and its influence on cod stock development is implicitly included in the models. To assess the influence of changes in fishing pressure on our cod stock predictions we compare the prediction error (observed minus predicted) with cod harvest rate anomalies (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3d</a>). It is seen that periods of persistent underestimation by our model (positive error) often correspond to low harvest rates (
