Abbreviations are defined in the inset legend. (b) Time series of observed Barents Sea cod stock (total stock biomass; TSB) and temperature anomalies from the Nordic Seas Atlas [
  <a rid="pone.0206319.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref029">29</a>] along the Atlantic water pathways used as upstream hydrographic predictors. The AMO and SPG indexes are defined in Material and methods. All anomalies are relative to 1950â€“2012. The average travel times of observed hydrographic anomalies from the subpolar North Atlantic (represented by AMO/SPGi) to the Nordic Seas (FSC/IFR) and to the Barents Sea, and their lagged influence on the cod stock, are indicated (cf. 
  <a rid="pone.0206319.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206319.t001">Table 1</a>).
