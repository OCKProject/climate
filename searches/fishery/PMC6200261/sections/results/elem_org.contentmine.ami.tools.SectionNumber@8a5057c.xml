  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lagged peak correlations between hydrographic time series along the Atlantic water pathway (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g001" href="#pone.0206319.g001">Fig 1b</a>) and the Barents Sea cod stock (total stock biomass; TSB) are summarized in 
   <a rid="pone.0206319.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206319.t001">Table 1</a> (note that correlations are most often also significant 1 year before and after the peak lag). As previously reported, higher temperatures in the western Barents Sea (BSO) correspond to higher cod stock biomass with a lag of 2–3 years [
   <a rid="pone.0206319.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref001">1</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0206319.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref021">21</a>]. Temperature variations in the Atlantic inflow across the Greenland–Scotland ridge (FSC and IFR) precede Barents Sea temperatures by 2–4 years, and, consistently, cod stock biomass by 7 years. The correlations and lags between salinity time series, and between salinity and cod stock, are comparable to those inferred from temperature (
   <a rid="pone.0206319.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206319.t001">Table 1</a>), suggesting that the predictive link between the subpolar North Atlantic and Barents Sea is of advective origin and related to Atlantic water circulation changes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Atlantic inflow to the Nordic Seas has been associated with variations in the strength and shape of the SPG [
   <a rid="pone.0206319.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref040">40</a>]. This is reflected in a 2–3-year lag between the SPG index and Atlantic inflow temperatures (
   <a rid="pone.0206319.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206319.t001">Table 1</a>), and a 4-year lag between SPG and BSO temperatures. The correlations and lags are similar if we consider the AMO index, which reflects basin-scale ocean temperature variations in the North Atlantic [
   <a rid="pone.0206319.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref033">33</a>]. There is a slight tendency for cod stock biomass to be more related to the upstream AMO index than the more local time series (BSO). This might be because the fish stock tends to be more influenced by lower frequency variability better captured by area-averaged indexes. In summary, observed hydrographic variability in the subpolar North Atlantic and in the Atlantic inflow branches to the Nordic Seas leads cod stock variations in the Barents Sea by approximately 6–8 years.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is also a significant correlation between upstream hydrographic variability and cod recruitment. Consistent with the 7-year lag between upstream hydrography and total stock biomass, the maximum correlation between recruitment and hydrography in FSC and IFR is found for a 5-year lag (
   <span class="italic">r</span> ∼ 0.4), whereas recruitment leads stock changes by 2 years. The latter reflects that the contribution from a year-class to TSB becomes noticeable from the age of 4-5 years.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate based cod stock predictions</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the identified lagged correlations between upstream hydrography and Barents Sea cod stock (TSB; 
   <a rid="pone.0206319.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0206319.t001">Table 1</a>), prediction models with a 7-year prediction horizon are constructed. The following predictor variables were considered, individually and in combination, and all leading cod stock TSB by 7 years: SPG and AMO indexes, and temperature and salinity from FSC and IFR (denoted 
   <span class="italic">TS</span>
   <sub>gsr</sub> when combined). We note that the aim of the statistical prediction models is not to perfectly model cod stock variability using all available information (including for example fishing mortality or TSB in previous years), but to assess the predictive ability of upstream hydrographic anomalies. Moreover, TSB or fishing mortality do not add predictive information on the 7-year prediction horizon assessed here.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temperature and salinity of the Atlantic inflow to the Nordic Seas are good predictors of cod stock TSB, but the skill is further increased if the AMO index is included (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.79; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g002" href="#pone.0206319.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</a>). Prediction skill is lowest if the prediction model is based only on SPG temperatures. Skill computed for fitting and independent periods are similar for all models, suggesting that prediction skill is real and not artificial. The robustness of the regression coefficients is further illustrated by the limited spread of the different predictions from the cross-validation procedure (gray shading in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3a and 3b</a>). The TSB time series is significantly autocorrelated at lead times of 1–2 years, and lagged persistence forecasts accordingly show skill at short lead times. The skill of our predictions nevertheless outperforms that of lagged persistence forecasts for lead times longer than 1 year (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g002" href="#pone.0206319.g002">Fig 2a and 2b</a>; the persistence forecast corresponds to the observed value of the year prior to the forecast).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future predictions based on hydrographic data from the Nordic Seas Atlas show a slight decline in cod stock toward year 2019, although values are still above the long-term (1950–2012) average. Using observed Atlantic water salinities from the Faroe–Shetland Channel (IROC) between 1957–2017 and the AMO index as predictors the correlation between observations and retrospective predictions is 0.73. Future predictions show a further decline in the cod stock toward 2024 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3b</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predictions using the identified 5-year lag between hydrography and cod recruitment show some success in terms of correlations (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3e</a>), but are less successful in reproducing the interannual variance (as measured by the Brier score; 
   <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.27). The larger uncertainty in the predictions is also seen from the wider spread in the cross-validated regression coefficients (gray shading). Nevertheless, our predictions are more skilful than that of random chance and lagged persistence forecasts for any lead times (not shown).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A comparison to operational predictions</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our predictions of TSB are now compared with short-term (1–3 years) predictions provided annually by the ICES AFWG (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3c</a>), and which takes into account both survey indexes, physical environment and prey abundance in predictions of recruitment [
   <a rid="pone.0206319.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref030">30</a>]. The comparison is done for the time period 1983–2017 when ICES predictions are available. The ICES predictions with a 1-year lead time are better than our 7-year predictions, but do not outperform the lagged persistence forecasts (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g002" href="#pone.0206319.g002">Fig 2c</a>). For 2-year and 3-year lead times the ICES AFWG prediction skill is less than that achieved by considering upstream SST at a longer lead time. Unlike the ICES predictions, our long-term prediction also beats the persistence benchmark for lead times longer than one year. We note that the skill of our prediction model for the time period 1983–2017 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g002" href="#pone.0206319.g002">Fig 2c</a>) is the same if the statistical model is trained only with data prior to 1983. The predicted cod stock anomalies from ICES AFWG also show a stock decrease for 2018 and 2019 with similar magnitudes as our long-term predictions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3c</a>).

   <a rid="pone.0206319.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref001">1</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0206319.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0206319.ref023">23</a>]. The statistical prediction models do not include explicit information on fishing pressure. However, as the statistical predictions are trained on historical cod stock data, fishing pressure and its influence on cod stock development is implicitly included in the models. To assess the influence of changes in fishing pressure on our cod stock predictions we compare the prediction error (observed minus predicted) with cod harvest rate anomalies (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206319.g003" href="#pone.0206319.g003">Fig 3d</a>). It is seen that periods of persistent underestimation by our model (positive error) often correspond to low harvest rates (
   <span class="italic">r</span> = −0.68), harvest anomalies leading by 2 years. The zero-lag correlation is -0.47. A negative harvest rate anomaly thus results in a positive stock biomass anomaly the following years, which leads to an underestimated prediction.
