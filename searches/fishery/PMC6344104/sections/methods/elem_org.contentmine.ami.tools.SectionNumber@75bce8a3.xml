  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the method is computationally intensive, and also to reduce the risk of introducing spurious relationships in our predictions, we included only the drivers for which defensible linkages to the biological dynamics could be made. The ecosystem components (or variables) examined in this study were selected by carefully balancing considerations regarding management linkages, data availability, statistical robustness, and representation in spatial and temporal dimensions, following up on the 2017 Ecosystem Status Report Update for the Gulf of Mexico [
   <a rid="pone.0209257.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref025">25</a>]. The major categories of ecosystem components included in the analysis were climate drivers, physiochemical ecosystem pressures, lower trophic levels, recruitment deviation estimates for economically important species and population estimate for a piscivorous bird (
   <a rid="pone.0209257.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0209257.t001">Table 1</a>). We include an index of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which is influential in structuring dynamics at both ecosystem- wide and species-specific scales [
   <a rid="pone.0209257.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref026">26</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0209257.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref027">27</a>]. Like other modes of variability (e.g. El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation), the AMO has impacts on a large geographic scale via—atmospheric teleconnections, and has been hypothesized to have an influence on a range of North Atlantic fisheries and ecosystems [

   <a rid="pone.0209257.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref029">29</a>]. Thus, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the AMO may be the underlying driving force for many observed changes within the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem [

We did not include a separate ecosystem component for hurricanes, because they are a pulse disturbance system and this study is focused upon broad-geographic scale long-term presses on the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine economically important species responses in the model, we incorporated recruitment anomalies from their stock assessment models. We do not have measured recruitment values, so we have to use a model product (stock assessment output). Recruitment anomalies (i.e., the variance in recruitment strength estimated in the model not explained by the size of the spawning stock biomass) were used because they most closely represent overall stock productivity, which we expected would be the most directly measurable impact from climate. Certainly, climate drivers could affect other population processes such as growth or mortality, but estimates of these parameters are not available at the population level. Other available fisheries data such as catch data or abundance indices are not as feasible for use in our analysis; landings are heavily influenced by external management factors, and abundance indices typically contain high levels of observation error and are highly selective toward certain age classes within the population. Finally, it was most logical to expect that the effects of climate drivers on recruitment strength would be immediate (e.g., current temperature and hypoxia conditions would affect the current year of incoming recruits), any lagged effects were thought to be of minimal importance and this simplified the detection of relationships. The net primary productivity (NPP) is a parameter that serves as an index to the biological state of the GoM. Primary production can be altered due to changes in the physical and chemical environment, and thus these dynamics can influence fisheries production [

If there are no discrete parents, |Q| = 1; if there is more than one, then |Q| = a vector of the sizes of each discrete parent. If there are no continuous parents, |X| = 0; if there is more than one, then |X| = the sum of their sizes. Then

Each node in the DAG is characterized by a state which can change depending on the state of other nodes and information about those states propagated through the DAG. By using this kind of inference, one can change the state or introduce new data or evidence (change a state or confront the DAG with new data) into the network, apply inference and inspect the posterior distribution (which represents the distributions of the variables given in the observed evidence). Given a graphical structure, BNs naturally perform prediction using inference. Modeling time series is achieved by using an extension of the BN known as the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), where nodes represent variables at particular time slices [
   <a rid="pone.0209257.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref037">37</a>]. DBNs are graphical models of stochastic processes that allow for complex interdependencies between the acting variables [
   <a rid="pone.0209257.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref037">37</a>]. In this study, DBNs allow us to integrate heterogeneous data, specify conditional relationships between those data and make robust predictions of the temporal dynamics of the ecosystem components and their interactions with natural and anthropogenic stressors. DBNs can model the dynamics of a dataset through the use of a hidden variable (HV) that is a variable for which there are missing or unobserved data. When using dynamic state-space models, we can assume that there is an underlying hidden state that generates the observed data and that this hidden state evolves in time as a function of our inputs [
   <a rid="pone.0209257.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref037">37</a>]. A dynamic model represents the behavior of a system over time; however, many systems, including ecosystems, contain non-stationary dynamics. Hidden variables allow us to model these non-stationary system dynamics [
   <a rid="pone.0209257.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref038">38</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0209257.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref040">40</a>]. They are used to represent a change in the interactions of the observed ecosystem components over time. When the model is parameterized with data as in this case, the value of the hidden variable is set to maximize the fit of the model to the data (e.g. the log- likelihood). If the patterns of the observed ecosystem components change in the time series, e.g. the slope of a correlation between two components changes, the value of the hidden variables linked to these components changes. A hidden variable can be linked to one, multiple, or all, of the observed ecosystem components in the model. Then, the hidden variable value depends on all of the observed ecosystem components it is linked to, and a change in the pattern of the hidden variable indicates a change in the system interactions. This is highly useful in ecological analyses where non- stationary dynamics are common and complex ecological interactions change with time due to changing pressures e.g. global climate change [
