  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all cases, where the DDDBN did not perform best, it had a similar SSE to the best performing model variant. Interestingly, all of the lower level trophic ecosystem components (except for white shrimp) were most accurately predicted by the DDDBN. There were several upper trophic level fish species (e.g. cobia) that were predicted with relatively equal accuracy across all models. In addition, some ecosystem components were predicted more accurately compared to others across all model types (e.g. gray triggerfish). There were also some relatively high SSEs, e.g. menhaden and tilefish from the ARHMM. We examined the time-series of predicted variable values to determine if they were reproducing the inter-annual variability and long-term patterns observed in the data. We only show some examples but the time-series for all ecosystem components are available in the Supporting information (examples were selected for the main text based on their dependency relationships with SST). Note, we choose to use the two axes plots to best represent the temporal dynamics of the predicted ecosystem components. The DDDBN model had the most accurate predictions for the spring zooplankton, followed by the ARDBN (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g004" href="#pone.0209257.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</a>). We notice some of the higher magnitude observations, which both models failed to reproduce. Still, the DDDBN model was able to capture the zooplankton dynamics throughout time (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g005" href="#pone.0209257.g005">Fig 5A</a>), specifically reproducing the positive deviations in the early 2000s and the variations in more recent years, which reflects SST changes during this time period (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g001" href="#pone.0209257.g001">Fig 1B</a>). To recall, in the model, spring zooplankton is parameterized to be driven by SST off the coast of Texas and dissolved oxygen in the fall in waters off Louisiana and Texas (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g004" href="#pone.0209257.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</a>). Similarly, both models failed to capture some of the outliers, although we can see that the DDDBN model reproduced the temporal dynamics for this ecosystem component (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g005" href="#pone.0209257.g005">Fig 5B</a>). Specifically, the model reflected well the variations until the late 1990s and the decrease in early 2000s. Predictions from the DDDBN were sensitive to the input data, but overall the model was able to capture temporal trends of the different ecosystem components, e.g. increase in brown shrimp (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g005" href="#pone.0209257.g005">Fig 5D</a>) and decline in King mackerel (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g005" href="#pone.0209257.g005">Fig 5F</a>). The model was able to recreate the dynamics of the ecosystem components in time but in some cases it failed to reproduce individual year effects (e.g. year 1987 for spring zooplankton and King mackerel), which could be due to some noise in the data, sampling variation or a mechanism not included in the model. The red snapper was characterized with some variability throughout time (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g005" href="#pone.0209257.g005">Fig 5E</a>), but the model was able to recreate the temporal dynamics, except for some individual years.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We increased SST for input into the DDDBN model to examine potential GoM ecosystem responses to increasing temperature scenarios (1.0°C, 1.5°C and 3.0°C). We compared the projected outputs among the SST scenarios by examining the response of different ecosystem components. We explored the effect of temperature increase on ecosystem components that are either directly influenced by SST or indirectly influenced by SST through a single intermediary component, according to the network structure, shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g003" href="#pone.0209257.g003">Fig 3</a> (that is 11 out of the total 18 ecosystem components, which are shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g006" href="#pone.0209257.g006">Fig 6</a>). The results show some variability in the projected response of the examined ecosystem components to increasing SST. The most pronounced effect was a decrease in all lower trophic level ecosystem components, especially zooplankton and brown shrimp (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g006" href="#pone.0209257.g006">Fig 6</a>). The effect was not as pronounced and more variable in direction for the higher trophic level fish species. The largest effect in upper trophic levels was on King mackerel.

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g006" href="#pone.0209257.g006">Fig 6</a>, based on the magnitude of response. The spring zooplankton biovolume, following the 1.0°C and 1.5°C increased SST scenarios, was predicted to be relatively stable prior to 2000 and lower than the DDDBN model after 2000 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g007" href="#pone.0209257.g007">Fig 7A</a>). A much stronger decline with increased variability was modeled throughout the study period under the 3.0°C increased SST scenario. Contrarily, fall zooplankton biovolume was reduced for the entire study period under all increased temperature scenarios, but inter-annual variability was similar to the DDDBN model. The decline was more pronounced and variability increased for the scenarios with larger SST increases (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g007" href="#pone.0209257.g007">Fig 7B</a>). Similarly, white (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g007" href="#pone.0209257.g007">Fig 7C</a>) and brown shrimp (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g007" href="#pone.0209257.g007">Fig 7D</a>) populations decreased under all increased SST scenarios with greater decreases predicted in the scenarios with greater increases in temperature. Brown shrimp decreased more than white shrimp in all SST scenarios. This might be the result of a direct SST effect on the brown shrimp but intermediary SST effect on the white shrimp through changes in the fall zooplankton dynamics. All SST scenario outputs appeared to show similar inter-annual variability and patterns to one another for both white and brown shrimp, but all showed increased variability compared to the baseline output and the variability increased with increasing SST.
