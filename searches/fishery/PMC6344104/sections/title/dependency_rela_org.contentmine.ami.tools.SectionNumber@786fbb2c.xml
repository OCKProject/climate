 <div class="title">Dependency relationships.</div>
 <p>The dependency relationships between all the measured ecosystem components and two unmeasured hidden variables (HV AMO and HV SST), learned from the hill- climb, and which were used to construct the DDDBN model. Only the bold links (regardless of color) were used to build the ARDBN. Colors were used to assist visualization of the network. Red colored nodes and arrows denote direct influence by SST. Nodes highlighted in yellow are indirectly influenced by SST. Green colored node and arrows denote direct influence by AMO. The strength of each identified link (i.e. the level of confidence) is also reported.</p>
