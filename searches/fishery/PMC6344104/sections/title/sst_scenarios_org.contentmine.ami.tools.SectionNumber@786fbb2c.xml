 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The best performing BN, determined from the model comparison, was used to predict how GoM ecosystem components might respond to changes in SST. Specifically, we examined how different ecosystem components respond to increases in SST, accounting for the heterogeneous nature of other driving factors and their changes over time. First, we predict the ecosystem components using historical observations. Then, we designed three SST scenarios to represent the potential impact of climate change. The scenarios investigated were a: 1.0°C, 1.5°C and 3.0°C increase in temperature across all three SST regions. We chose these temperatures to cover a range of potential short and long-term magnitudes of climate change. We manipulate the SST data by increasing it, according to the three scenarios. All other measured ecosystem components remain unchanged. Potential future changes in AMO were not included, because the AMO index is calculated from de-trended SST data [

Increasing SST, especially in the summer will likely lower DO by both decreasing the solubility of oxygen and increasing stratification. However, the magnitude of these changes in DO under the three different SST scenarios is uncertain and thus we did not explicitly include changes in DO in the SST scenarios. Thus, the data input for testing each scenario model was the increased SST data alone. The training part of the model learning was unchanged and done on the original measured data and two unmeasured hidden variables. Thus, we keep the historically driven interactions between the ecosystem components and examine their modeled trends under potential changes in SST. The SST scenario models were statistically validated through the same bootstrapping technique described above to obtain a measure of uncertainty.
