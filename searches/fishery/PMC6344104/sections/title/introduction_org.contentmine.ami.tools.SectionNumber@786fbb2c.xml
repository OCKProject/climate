 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is an ecologically and economically productive ecosystem, generating over 2.6 million metric tons of commercial fishery landings in 2016 and supporting nearly half the recreational fishing catch in the entire United States [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref001">1</a>]. The ecosystem is exposed to a number of pressures including: coastal development, oil spills, hurricanes and major hypoxia formation on the continental shelf of Louisiana and Texas. Many of the primary human activities that affect coastal and marine environments occur in the GoM: extraction of living resources, transport and shipping, fossil fuel energy, coastal and land-based infrastructure and industry [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref002">2</a>]. These activities result in a number of pressures being placed upon the GoM ecosystem that are both exogenic unmanaged pressures and endogenic managed pressures. These pressures occur against a background of more chronic stressors related to climate change, which include gradual changes in temperature and ocean acidification. The delineation of pressures into exogenic and endogenic requires resource managers and scientists to define those that are manageable within the system from those pressures that cannot be managed, but whose consequences must be accounted for, such as temperature changes due to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref002">2</a>]. Analyses and models have shown that the GoM is already experiencing increasing sea surface temperatures and that these increases are expected to continue and intensify throughout the 21st century [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref003">3</a>]; however, the changes are relatively muted in comparison to other parts of the globe [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref004">4</a>]. In other oceanic regions, the effects of long-term, temperature-driven changes on fish populations and fisheries are already apparent and well-documented. For example, in the Northwest Atlantic, there have been significant poleward shifts in major commercial species and their associated landings [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref005">5</a>]. In the GoM, a northern land mass prevents species from making poleward shifts, and thus, species must either move deeper, die out, or adapt when temperatures increase beyond their tolerance levels. Indeed, shifts in depth distributions and the tropicalization of fish communities have already been documented in the GoM [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref006">6</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref007">7</a>]. However, effects from increasing temperatures are not as well documented or understood in the GoM as in other marine ecosystems. The lack of documented effects from climate change results in the GoM receiving less attention for understanding ecosystem and fishery responses to climate change. Moreover, the unique geography of the GoM, its high biological diversity, and the range of complex and interacting pressures make it challenging to predict the overall impact of climate change on the ecosystem. These all highlight the need to begin building a knowledge base for predicting how the GoM will respond to the impending effects of climate change. In situations, where all of the pertinent mechanistic relationships between drivers and responses cannot possibly be understood, it is valuable to employ data-driven approaches. Significant progress has been made in developing ecological models that use traditional statistical approaches to understand the relationships between a number of interacting variables [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref008">8</a>], and more recently, the number of all-inclusive models from physics through to higher level species is increasing [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref009">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, when these models are parameterized using data, it is usually assumed that the ecosystems are in a steady state. Thus, the underlying relationships that give rise to the data are assumed to not be changing. This assumption is incorrect in many cases, as it is known that ecosystem structure and function can change even over relatively short time scales [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref010">10</a>]. Further, it is possible that such changes are driven by unobserved variables, i.e. ecosystem variables that we do not have data on, and being able to account for such signals is difficult but crucial for the protection and sustainable use of ecosystems. Indeed, it is recommended that forecasting models develop richer non-mechanistic appreciation of ecological interactions and predict beyond the range of observed values in combination with scenarios to express uncertainties and test policies [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref011">11</a>]. Predicting species response to ecosystem changes is challenging because of the natural variation in observations and uncertainty in potential associations. However, machine learning techniques have been proposed to be an appropriate approach with desired properties to address uncertainty in ecosystem prediction [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref012">12</a>]. Recently, Bayesian networks (BNs) have become a popular method in the area of biology that is capable of inferring network structures, while capturing nonlinear, dynamic and arbitrary combinatorial relationships [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref013">13</a>]. It has been shown that such probabilistic methods can provide estimates of the uncertainty associated with predictions and recover complex, spatially varying interactions from collected field data [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref014">14</a>]. The way BNs manage uncertainties is through developing alternative model structures and accounting for these uncertainties in the distribution of probabilities across the BN nodes and their states [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref015">15</a>]. Given a graphical structure, BNs naturally perform prediction using inference that allows us to ask “what if?” type questions of the data. For example, one could ask, what is the probability of seeing a change in zooplankton, given that we have observed a change in the distribution of temperature and/or primary productivity? Formerly, BNs have been applied to reveal gene regulatory networks using gene microarray data [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref016">16</a>]. Other BN uses include weather prediction, medical diagnosis and image processing [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref019">19</a>]. BNs have proven quite useful to predict outcomes for situations where we do not fully understand or have data on the underlying mechanisms. Due to the flexibility in application and lack of dependence on a 
  <span class="italic">priori</span> assumptions about mechanistic relationships, BNs are becoming increasingly popular for modeling uncertain and complex domains such as ecosystems and environmental management [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref020">20</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref022">22</a>]. In an environmental study context, BNs represent probabilistic dependencies among species and ecosystem factors that influence the variables likelihood in an intuitive, graphic form [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref023">23</a>]. Therefore, expertise can utilize a quantitative indication of the range of possible scenarios consistent with the data to give strategic advice on potential ecosystem response. The use of BN methodology facilitates the communication of modeling results and the representation of a variety of perspectives as a means of modeling likelihoods of natural and anthropogenic effects [
  <a rid="pone.0209257.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0209257.ref024">24</a>]. In this study, we apply BN approaches to examine the potential responses of different ecosystem components (i.e. variables in the analysis that represent either physical processes thought to be important drivers of the ecology, or biological components; specifically, estimates of abundance or population productivity) to increases in temperature within the GoM marine ecosystem. Resource management in the GoM requires an understanding of how key species will respond to likely temperature increases to enable effective future management of the species and to prepare fishermen and their communities for likely ecosystem changes. First, we evaluate the predictive capabilities of a variety of dynamic BNs which reflect the different hypothesis of the GoM system and consider varying levels of complexity. In these models, we incorporate a number of hidden variables to account for uncertainty and any unmeasured effects. This includes a novel approach for modeling the Gulf ecosystem dynamics by accounting for multiple physical and biological associations and their changes over time. We examine the models’ accuracy in terms of their ability to reproduce observations of ecosystem components of interest. Then, the best performing model is applied to investigate how the GoM ecosystem will respond to increasing temperature, specifically examining whether ecosystem components are likely to be negatively or positively affected by temperature increases. Through the developed temperature scenarios, we explore the components trends in response to climate variation. Thus, we aim to gain further understanding of the underlying ecological mechanisms and the consequences on the different ecosystem components once some of these mechanisms are perturbed, which is essential in terms of providing advice on potential response of the ecosystem to the full suite of pressures. Here, by testing short-term predictability and variability on this marine ecosystem, we further build confidence in our ability to examine potential long-term impacts of environmental change that could inform strategies for coping with and adapting to climate change and variability.
