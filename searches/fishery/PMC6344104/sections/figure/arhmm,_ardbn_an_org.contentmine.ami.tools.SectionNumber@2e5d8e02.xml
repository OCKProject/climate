  <p>(A) An autoregressive hidden Markov model (ARHMM), where 
   <span class="italic">H</span> denotes an unmeasured hidden variable. 
   <span class="italic">X</span>1 …
   <span class="italic">XN</span> denote the measured ecosystem components from 
   <a rid="pone.0209257.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0209257.t001">Table 1</a>. (B) General structural form of the autoregressive DBN (ARDBN). Note, the autoregressive link is kept and an additional parent node is enforced to different children’s nodes. (C) General structural form of the data-driven DBN (DDDBN). Note, the autoregressive link is removed (except for the two hidden variables) and an additional parent node is enforced with the number of parents varying between the different children’s nodes. These are graphical representations to visualize the differences between the model variants. The actual links between the different 
   <span class="italic">X</span> nodes are presented in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209257.g003" href="#pone.0209257.g003">Fig 3</a>. Note, the network linkages and parameters do not change throughout time, the models are time-invariant.
