 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We coupled an existing model of Caribbean coral reef ecosystem dynamics to a model of human opinion dynamics. The resulting coupled socio-ecological model was used to explore how coral reef viability depends on nonlinear interactions between social and ecological factors individually and in combination, when opinion dynamics and reef dynamics are coupled to one another. To our knowledge, this is the first mathematical model to capture coupled socio-ecological dynamics of a coral reef ecosystem. Our model suggests that increasing human sensitivity to declining coral reef cover (for instance, through awareness programs) is the best way to support live coral and parrotfish densities. This model result is consistent with empirical findings that increased awareness of coral decline can help stimulate coral reef protection

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The added benefit of developing models in addition to using empirical studies is that models can help develop intuition for nonlinear feedbacks; test the logic of existing hypotheses that concern nonlinear feedback mechanisms; and suggest new ideas and new hypotheses. Here, we found that higher levels of injunctive social norms (i.e. social pressure) can also support conservationism, if the initial state of the population and other natural and economic factors already tend to support it. However, sometimes it can also be a double-edged sword since conservationism can be suppressed due to social pressure if it is not initially a dominant opinion. The system also tended to oscillate in boom-bust cycles, as human populations become complacent when coral reefs are robust, but react to support conservationism when they become endangered again. This is especially common for higher rates of social learning. This exemplifies a predicted dynamic that could not be identified without constructing a nonlinear mathematical model. Finally, the harmful effects of increasing the maximal fishing intensity were often partially counteracted by the conservationist response that higher fishing intensities stimulated in the population, such that conservationism was able to help sustain live coral cover even at high maximal fishing rates under some conditions.</p>

  <span class="italic">et al</span>. and Blackwod 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. When grazing is at a minimum, the models predict convergence to an equilibrium of algal overgrowth. Alternatively, when grazing is sufficiently large and critical fishing thresholds are not exceeded, all three models predict convergence to a desirable, coral-dominated state (the MFE-A is admitted in our case). In comparison to the previous ecological models, by coupling a human dynamic to the model, we have achieved a novel condition for recovery whereby both, fisheries and corals are capable of thriving and coexistence is achieved (MFE-NA).

 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is well-known that Caribbean coral reefs have suffered an extreme decline over the past few decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Declines in the parrotfish population have already been identified as a core concern, but additional stressors have also been identified, such as sedimentation and coral bleaching
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. The Caribbean coral reef ecosystem has shown little to no resilience since the decline of the 
  <span class="italic">Diadema antillarum</span> sea urchins despite the implementation of conservational strategies. This is not to say that conservation has not been fruitful, as it has been documented that within smaller sanctuaries, live coral cover has greatly increased due to conservation efforts such as marine protected areas (MPAs), compared to unprotected areas that can be targeted by fisheries
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Thus, there must not only be a stronger focus on parrotfish protection policies, but also, we require an increase in overall awareness of the coral reef ecosystem and incentives to protect in order to promote the recovery of the Caribbean coral reefs

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Our results agree with these proposed actions that increasing awareness and concern for declining coral reef cover in the general population might be the most effective and feasible way to do this.

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model assumed only two types of macroalgal growth that are the preferred food source of the dominant grazer but other algal growths have been documented in the reef ecosystem. Multi-species structure can influence model predictions. Hence, future models could include multiple species of algal grazers with differing effects on coral cover, different life histories, and different fishing rates. In the context of Caribbean coral reefs, was noticed by Mantyka and Bellwood in 2007
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span> that parrotfish specialize in the consumption of calcified macroalgae, whereas another local grazer–siganids–were typically much more selective. Experimental results by Burkepile and Hay
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span> illustrated the advantage of species diversity on herbivory, where a combination of parrotfish and surgeon fish can produce a stronger positive response on reef recovery compared to an ecosystem comprising solely of parrotfish. Specifically, within a ten month period, it was discovered that regions with greater herbivorous fish diversity increased coral cover by over 20%, whereas regions maintained by one or less herbivorous fish experienced declines in coral cover of up to 30%. The current model can improved to incorporate this diversity.

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is a common practice in theoretical biology to start with simple models and progress to more complex models over time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. The reasons are that (1) simpler models are easier to analyze and require less data to develop, (2) in many situations, simpler models can provide accurate predictions even though they do not include all the details of the system being modelled, and (3) lessons learned in developing the simpler model are helpful when developing more complex models that are harder to analyze and understand. However, simplifying assumptions can influence model predictions and must be highlighted for addressing in future models. For coral reefs, there is limited availability of long-term coral cover data, so the primary use of our model was to generate insights into possible nonlinear feedbacks, suggest new hypotheses and topics for further empirical research, and test the logical validity of hypotheses. For instance, a survey that compares the effects of social learning rates (rate at which individuals read or talk about coral reefs); injunctive social norms; and sensitivity to the amount of coral reef cover (i.e. how concerned individuals become as coral becomes rarer) on attitudes toward coral reef conservation might help refine the model. Not all stressors that currently affect the reefs have been explicitly incorporated into the model, such as sediment contamination. Similarly, the model does not explicitly account for climate change (coral bleaching) in the sense that the modelled human population does not respond adaptively to coral bleaching to take steps to prevent climate change. This was excluded as a state variable because the local and national populations we are modelling can influence parrotfish fishing in their waters, but cannot take effective unilateral action on climate change. However, climate change effects can be captured partially and implicitly in our model by varying parameters such as the coral death rate, 
  <span class="italic">d</span>. In the future, more sophisticated models could include specific climate change aspects such as interactions between multiple stressors like coral bleaching and growth of algal turf. Other extensions could include spatial structure, multi-species interactions, Allee effects, and more sophisticated fishery dynamics.

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While opportunities for future research are clearly numerous, the incorporation of human-environment feedback into a coral reef model showed how ecological and human factors act both individually and in combination to determine coral reef health, and also showed that these interactions can be surprising and nontrivial. Overfishing and reef degradation persists, despite efforts to mitigate them
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>, hence more research on the socio-ecological of coral reef ecosystems and public opinion is urgently needed. Such opportunities to expand this research offer great potential for generating biologically relevant results that can reshape and influence the dialogue around coral and parrotfish conservation in the Caribbean and elsewhere. Hence the model has generated compelling evidence that theoretical approaches to understanding socio-ecological interactions would be helpful in the efforts to restore coral reefs to their former, resilient status.
