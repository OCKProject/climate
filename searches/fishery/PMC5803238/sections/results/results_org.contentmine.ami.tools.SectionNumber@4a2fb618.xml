 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Time series of the model dynamics across a selection of parameter values illustrate the range of possible dynamics of this socio-ecological system. For instance, when the parrotfish growth rate 
  <span class="italic">s</span> is zero (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b</a>), dependent on the initial conditions, the system enters an undesirable equilibrium state of high macroalgal cover and no live coral. Conservationism is strong, but because the parrotfish population is not viable, the coral reefs cannot survive. However, under parameter conditions where parrotfish growth rate sufficiently outweighs the rate of parrotfish exploitation σ, the system is predicted to recover and achieve stability. The system stabilizes as a ‘Macroalgae-Free Equilibrium’ (MFE). This can occur with human assistance via marine protected areas as in the baseline scenario - MFE-A (
  <span class="italic">s</span> = 0.35, σ = 0.5), (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3(f)</a>) or without anthropogenic assistance, if the fishing rate even at maximal levels is not enough to overcome the parrotfish growth rate even in the absence of marine protected areas - MFE-NA (
  <span class="italic">s</span> = 0.3, σ = 0.05), Fig.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is also possible for the model to exhibit oscillations over long time horizons. During periods of sufficient conservationism in the human population, the system successfully recovers. During periods of sustained recovery, coral reef cover becomes high again, which means that parrotfish exploitation becomes attractive compared to continued conservationism (the human popula-tion becomes complacent about conservationism). As a result, conservation eventually becomes less popular and coral reefs correspondingly begin to decline again (
  <span class="italic">s</span> = 0.5, σ = 0.2) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3(d)</a>). In some cases, this oscillatory behaviour is predicted to wane, and the utility to protect permanently outweighs the utility to not protect, yielding an MFE-A over the long term (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3(e)</a>). Additional time series depicting other, less common dynamical regimes of the model appear in Appendix 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">B</a> of the supplementary information file, including variations of the catastrophic equilibrium for parameter values away from baseline values.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore model dynamics more systematically we generated a series of parameter planes. A parameter plane shows how model dynamics vary under changes in two different model parameters. The plane has a model parameter on each axis, and indicates the dynamics that occur for each possible pair of parameter values. For each parameter plane, all parameters were held at their baseline tables except for the two parameter values being varied in the plot. Using Matlab, we varied the values of the selected parameters across the range depicted in the parameter planes. Time series were generated for each pair of values under a range of initial conditions for 
  <span class="italic">M</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> and 
  <span class="italic">x</span>, and their long-term states were identified. Gnuplot was used to render the parameter planes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the range of parrotfish population doubling time reported in FishBase
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>, we derived a range of realistic growth rate values 
  <span class="italic">s</span> from 0.16/year to 0.50/year. Hence, parameter planes varying 
  <span class="italic">s</span> were taken to range from 0/year to 0.6/year. Fishing rates are highly variable and since our objective was to gain qualitative insights, we chose the fishing rates to capture the full range of possible outcomes from very little fishing to fish population collapse. Population collapse in the model occurs when the maximal fishing rate exceeds the population growth rates (if conservationist opinion is weak and the fish population is low). Hence, the range for the maximal fishing rate σ also runs from 0/year to 0.6/year. Ranges for 
  <span class="italic">κ</span>, 
  <span class="italic">J</span> and 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span> were chosen to include enough representation of values on either side of the baseline value to capture a variety of possible dynamics.

  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> where they are divided into three primary regimes corresponding to healthy coral reefs without the need for human assistance (which is the least realistic scenario, given modern-day maximal fishing intensities); healthy coral reefs with human assistance; and dead corals.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model dynamics under variation in the maximal fishing rate s and the parrotfish growth rate s depend on the relative size of these two competing parameters (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4(a)</a>). When the growth rate exceeds the fishing rate, then the coral is able to maintain itself in a healthy state without human influence, and the system follows a trajectory stabilizing to the unassisted macroalgae-free equilibrium (MFE). However, when the fishing rate exceeds the growth rate, a number of outcomes are possible. For instance, when the growth rate is too low, the coral simply dies off completely, or the system oscillates in all of its variables (regime H). When the parrotfish growth rate is higher, it is possible for coral to persist in a healthy state with human assistance, but other dynamical regimes also occur in this part of parameter space, such as oscillations once again (regime H, B). Finally, regardless of the fishing rate, when the growth rate is too small (
  <span class="italic">s</span> ≈ 0), the corals collapse along with the parrotfish population. If the fishing rate σ is also too small, the final state of the ecosystem becomes solely dependent on the initial state, converging to the bistable regime.

 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under varying levels of the social learning rate 
  <span class="italic">κ</span>, the model dynamics indicated strong dependence on the relative sizes of the maximal fishing rate σ and the parrotfish growth rate 
  <span class="italic">s</span>. At the baseline value of the fishing rate, when the parrotfish growth rate is sufficiently high, coral is able to follow a trajectory towards the unassisted macroalgae-free equilibrium (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4(b)</a>). Conversely, at the baseline value of the growth rate, low fishing rates cause the system to follow a trajectory to the unassisted macroalgae-free equilibrium (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4(c)</a>). In the absence of growth, the model predicts coral collapse (
  <span class="italic">Dead coral (i)</span>), regardless of the initial conditions of the ecosystem. Alternatively, at the baseline growth rate, a significant increase in maximal fishing intensity causes the ecosystem to transition from unassisted macroalgae-free equilibrium to assisted macroalgae-free equilibrium (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4(c)</a>). In addition, if the system exhibits small (but not too small) parrotfish growth, it does not predict coral collapse. So long as growth is present, conservation causes the ecosystem to adopt an oscillatory trajectory (regime H) or the MFE-A equilibrium (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4(b)</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation of the strength of injunctive social norms 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span> revealed its impact on model dynamics in the context of varying the maximal fishing rate σ (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4(d)</a>) and parrotfish growth rate 
  <span class="italic">s</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4(e)</a>). At baseline parrotfish growth, when the maximal fishing rate sufficiently overwhelms the strength of social norms, corals are able to survive under human assistance, following a trajectory towards the assisted macroalgae-free equilibrium (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4(d)</a>). This occurs because social norms in support of conservationism can maintain the popularity of conservationism, as the population tends to conform to the majority opinion. When fishing rates are lower, then the coral is able to survive either with or without human assistance, depending on the value of 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span>. Alternatively, at baseline fishing rates, a wide variety of possible outcomes are observed for various values of the strength of social norms 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span> and the growth rate 
  <span class="italic">s</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4(e)</a>). For sufficiently low strength of social norms, the corals maintain a trajectory towards the unassisted macroalgae-free equilibrium. As the strength of social norms increases, the model predicts ecosystem dynamics to shift towards a bistable regime governed by either the assisted or unassisted macroalgae-free equilibrium. This occurs because social norms can also operate to suppress conservationism, if it was not sufficiently popular at first in the population. This effect can be clearly observed where a significant increase in the strength of social norms at sufficiently high levels of parrotfish growth (but not maximal growth) can force the system into a tristable state, following a trajectory towards either macroalgae-free equilibrium, or towards a catastrophic state with live parrotfish density (Regime E). The opposite effect can observed under periods of low parrotfish growth. Under certain initial conditions, social norms can operate to enhance conservationism, causing ecosystem dynamics to shift towards the assisted macroalgae-free equilibrium. Finally, for sufficiently effective social norms, and sufficiently low parrotfish growth, corals are still able to thrive with human support. If social norms become too influential, the ecosystem can either maintain its coral integrity, or be driven into a state completely devoid of macroalgae or corals, with efforts in conservation protecting the parrotfish community (Regime D), but unable to restore corals.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model dynamics under variation in human sensitivity to coral reef rarity 
  <span class="italic">J</span> and the maximal fishing rate σ depend on the relative sizes of these two parameters, and dynamics again display a complicated dependence on the parameter values (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4(f)</a>). When the fishing rate and sensitivity terms are sufficiently low, corals are able to dominate and the ecosystem converges to the unassisted macroalgae-free equilibrium. As the maximal fishing rate increases, the system produces different behaviour. For sufficiently small sensitivity, corals die out and the ecosystem follows a trajectory to either a catastrophic equilibrium with living parrotfish and no protection 
  <span class="italic">(Dead coral (ii))</span> or the catastrophic equilibrium with no parrotfish, and no protection 
  <span class="italic">(Dead coral (iii)</span>. For sufficiently high sensitivity, corals are able to sustain themselves in a healthy state due to human intervention, and the ecosystem stabilizes at the assisted macroalgae-free equilibrium. Lastly, for sufficiently low fishing rates and sufficiently high sensitivity, the system transitions into a bistable regime governed by both macroalgae-free equilibria. High sensitivity can force the population to adopt conservationism, despite the resilient state of the coral reefs. Depending on the initial state, efforts in conservation can become perpetually enforced, driving the system to converge to the assisted macroalgae-free equilibrium.
