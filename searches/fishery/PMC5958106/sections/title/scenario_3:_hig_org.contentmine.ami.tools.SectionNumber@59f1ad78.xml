 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scenario 3: Highly conservative</div>
 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this scenario the ecological optimal area (11213.13 Km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) is slightly larger than the economic optimal one (10313.52 Km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Unlike the economic optimal area, the ecological optimal area is located in deeper waters, which are harder to reach by most small-scale fisheries. This scenario recorded the lowest similarity statistics between both optimal areas (I = 0.85; D = 0.73) where the overlapped area had an extension of 7936.44 Km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, which corresponds to 58.4% of the total area (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, if the ecological area were entirely closed to fishing, fishers would lose 82.5% of their fishing grounds (11213 Km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), corresponding to a loss of 75.3% (R$ 13844) of their total annual profit. Notwithstanding, if only the ecological area that does not overlap with the economic one were closed to fishing, fishers would lose 24.1% of their fishing grounds (3276 Km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), which represents a loss of R$ 3130 of their total annual profit (17%).
