 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vulnerable habitats define critical areas for species, as the ones where they spawn, breed, feed, and/or grow to maturity. Effectively protecting them is an important demand that conservationists have in order to help restore sustainable exploitation of marine fishes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. However, identifying specific vulnerable areas is challenging because the habitat requirements of most species are still poorly understood
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date most approaches in marine conservation are based on identifying the habitat requirements of one species at a time, which is known as the single-species approach. This has resulted in extremely large areas being recommended for protection, which is usually difficult to implement in most contexts
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>, especially given the social and economic relevance of fishing. Therefore, a compromise needs to be sought in order to identify solutions that minimize both socioeconomic losses and the total amount of habitat needed for a given level of protection, while still encompassing as many species as possible.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To that end, rather than allocating vulnerable habitats on a species-specific basis, a possible solution could be to establish some criteria that encompass a variety of species and then determine what combinations of sites meet those criteria for all species. Obviously, depending on the criteria used, solutions will likely include a range of different species habitats with varying sizes for the areas to be protected.</p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One such criterion could be the simple identification of the main habitats used by a single species of ecological interest. However, this could result in inadequate choices, because such a broad approach makes it impossible to prioritize habitats for conservation and management
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. A likely better alternative for choosing areas to be protected is to spatially identify ecological and/or biological criteria that could help replenish a variety of relevant species simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, vulnerable habitats based on one or multiple species rarely become protected areas or achieve any sort of conservation status mostly due to conflicting interests with human activities, especially fishing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Such conflicts are not always driven by large companies’ profits and short-term gains, because fisheries also feed two and a half billion people around the world and provide over 200–260 million jobs directly and indirectly
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Therefore, fisheries are an important aspect of food security and livelihood maintenance, especially in developing tropical countries. In these countries, the activity is mainly carried out by artisanal fishers that use simple technologies and have little autonomy to reach farther fishing grounds, although this by no means exempts them from negatively impacting stocks
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Hence, given both the economic importance of fisheries and their negative ecological impact, the best conservation approach would be a compromise between ecological and economic goals
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several spatial zoning approaches that try to simultaneously ensure biodiversity and minimize negative impacts on stakeholders have been proposed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. However, these approaches generally rely on “data-rich” fisheries, whereas in developing countries data tend to be poorly documented and inadequately managed due to lack of research funding for monitoring and analysis
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Conventional analytical tools that require well-informed and detailed datasets (
  <span class="italic">e</span>.
  <span class="italic">g</span>. Zonation and Marxan) are not applicable in “data-poor” fisheries and hence reliable statistical tools that perform well with limited information still need to be developed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we propose a framework suited for data-poor situations to help researchers and managers decide on optimal conservation areas for intensively fished species that take into account the economic relevance such species have for a given society. To do so, we used three different ecological criteria (species resilience, vulnerability and trophic level) to identify vulnerable habitats for fisheries target species using data from multi-specific artisanal fisheries in Brazil. We then identified the most profitable areas and overlapped these with the ecologically optimal sites using different thresholds. Ultimately, we computed fishers’ economic losses by simulating the implementation of spatial closures in the identified areas. We assumed that the acceptance of a protected area would vary depending on the degree of overlap and possible economic losses for fishers. Therefore, conservation measures could be better tailored to increase acceptance and to accommodate different levels of compromise, where biological concerns are integrated with economic demands.</p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The proposed framework could be a powerful approach, even in data-poor fisheries, for reconciling the globally available environmental data with Bayesian models capable of dealing with limited information while simultaneously accounting for different sources of uncertainty
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Unlike other spatial zoning tools, the proposed decision-supporting mechanism could be considered a flexible white-box approach and be easily adapted to both terrestrial and aquatic contexts.
