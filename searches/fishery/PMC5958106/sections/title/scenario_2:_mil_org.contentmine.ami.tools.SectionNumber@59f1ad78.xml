 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to the scenario 1, in this situation the economic optimal area (9016.37 Km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) is larger than the ecological optimal one (7867.98 Km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). Here, the majority of the optimal areas are located in deeper waters, although some locations are closer to the coast (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Similarity statistics highlight a reasonable level of overlapping between the two areas (I = 0.85; D = 0.76). The estimated overlap area was 5333.43 Km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, which corresponds to 46.3% of the total fishing area (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the ecological area were entirely closed to fishing, fishers would lose 68% of their fishing grounds (7839 Km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). This would correspond to a loss of 55.2% (R$ 8673) of their total annual profit. Nevertheless, if only the ecological area that does not overlap with the economic one were closed to fishing, fishers would lose 21.8% of their fishing grounds (2506 Km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), representing a loss of R$ 1538 of their total annual profit (9.8%).
