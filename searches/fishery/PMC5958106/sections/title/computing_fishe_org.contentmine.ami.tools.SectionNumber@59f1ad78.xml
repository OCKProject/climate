 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the optimal areas identified by the three different threshold outlined in the previous section, different trade-off scenarios were simulated to compute fishers’ economic losses.</p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each scenario, profit maps were generated for all the modeled species found in the selected optimal areas and in the overlapped area. Provided that some fishing grounds may contain numerous individuals of a particular species with low economic importance and few individuals of another species with high economic importance, profit maps were computed as a weighted average between the species abundance and their profit. For each scenario fishers’ economic losses are then represented by the estimated profit values that would be obtained from the respective selected areas, in the event that some of these areas were closed to fishing (See stage 4 and 5 of Fig.
