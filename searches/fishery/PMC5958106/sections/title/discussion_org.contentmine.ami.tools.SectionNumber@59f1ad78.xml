 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We propose a spatial decision tool framework that takes into account both a diverse set of ecological criteria to identify vulnerable habitats for multiple species simultaneously and the economic relevance that these species have to fishers. Identifying such areas is a first step toward developing more agreeable sustainable fisheries management plans that protect marine resources while also providing the means for local livelihoods. Specifically, under the current used criteria, the designed vulnerable habitats offered a reasonable compromise between ecological and economic goals. Such compromises may be harder to reach when species vulnerability and economic subsidies that promote overfishing (
  <span class="italic">e</span>.
  <span class="italic">g</span>.: oil subsidy) are higher
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. However, given that fish depletion may severely decrease human well-being
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>, and that rebuilding fish stocks can be costly in the short term
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>, middle grounds between conservation goals and economic exploitation could still be the best option, even under bleak perspectives, such as when fisheries are highly subsidized.
 </p>
 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of our simulated trade-offs showed partial convergence between ecologically and economically optimal areas in all scenarios. About 50% of the total ecologically optimal areas overlapped with the economically optimal areas in all cases. This was expected as the most valuable species are often the ones at higher trophic levels, which usually means they also show low resilience and high vulnerability.</p>
 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among all the different scenarios, the third one was the most reliable from a conservationist point of view as it would preserve areas in which the probability of species abundance is higher than 75%. However, if the ecological area were entirely closed to fishing, it would be rated as the worst from an economic perspective due to the highest economic losses for the fishers.</p>
 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies have shown that protected areas may need to cover at least 20–30% of the area of concern to be an effective tool in fisheries management
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. In the case of the scenario 3, the higly conservative, if only the ecological area that does not overlap with the economic one were closed to fishing, approximately 41.4% of the ecological area could be completely protected, whereas 58.6% would be only partially protected with an economic loss for each fisher of almost 17% of their annual profit. In this case, even though it was the worst scenario with respect to economic losses, a reasonable trade-off between economic and ecological demands could still be reached. Scenario 2, the middly conservative one, represented the best compromise between ecological and economic benefits as it implied in the lowest economic losses while still encompassed areas of high species abundance. However, the identified vulnerable habitats of this scenario are predominantly located in deep waters, where some vulnerable species, such as 
  <span class="italic">Centropomus</span> spp, will not be found. Therefore, this presents an expected trade-off when balancing ecological and economic goals, i.e., the area proposed to be protected will hardly ever be able to cover all the conservation aspirations, and some vulnerable species might be left behind such as 
  <span class="italic">Centropomus</span> spp. Conversely, scenario 1, the less conservative, is the only one that preserves shallow waters where some of the most vulnerable species are abundant (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">Scomberomorus brasiliensis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">hippos</span>, Shark group and 
  <span class="italic">Dasyatis spp</span>.). Yet, this scenario recorded the worst trade-offs among ecological and economic demands, as it is the one containing the lowest probabilities of species’ abundance and also one presenting the highest losses for fishers (~55% annual profits).
 </p>
 <p id="Par54" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under varying degrees of overlap, different management options could be proposed to reconcile conservation measures with human uses. For example, spatial-temporal closures of the ecological optimal area could be proposed. Partial protection for the overlapped area could be implemented by: (i) allowing fishing for only a limited number of vessels and for a restricted period of time during the year (
  <span class="italic">e</span>.g.: during the non-reproductive period of the most vulnerable species); or (ii) by splitting the overlapped area into two sub-areas for pulse fishing during alternate periods. That is, while fishing is allowed in one area, the other is let alone to recover
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. However, even though harvesting closures are a common measure within contemporary community-based and co-management frameworks, managers have to consider that periodic closures may confer fisheries benefits for some taxa or in certain conditions but its efficiency for the management of all types of fisheries remains uncertain
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par55" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another perspective to be considered is that areas of both ecological and economic relevance could be more easily managed because they require minimal additional community engagement for success
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. In these cases the community could be directly interested in protecting the resources because one could easily quantify the economic value of the conservation measures. Indeed, a two-way engagement process could be achieved through adaptive co-management and social-learning processes that engage both scientists and local community members
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. Key ingredients to this approach should include collaboration with stakeholders, mainstreaming of scientific information (
  <span class="italic">e</span>.g., enhanced communication with communities through maps, scenarios, etc.), education and awareness-raising strategies to inform local communities about ecological values that they do not currently recognize, and incentive programs (
  <span class="italic">e</span>.
  <span class="italic">g</span>., grants, payments for ecosystem services, auctions for conservation contracts) to further support conservation actions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par56" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is noteworthy, however, that in all cases community and institutional capacities are determinant factors that need to be evaluated 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. Community capacity refers to the rules, procedures and values that people hold, which predispose them to work collectively for mutual benefit
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Institutional capacity is the ability of government agencies to provide public goods and services and ensure that laws and regulations will be enforced. Several methods have been proposed to compute community and institutional capacities
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. A feasible tool could be to carry out interviews with the local community to identify the degree of acceptance of a possible spatial-temporal closure of the ecological optimal area (community capacity), and look at how much the government budget is dedicated to conservation measures (institutional capacity).
 </p>
 <p id="Par57" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditionally, conservation planning is based on a systematic and scientific assessment of patterns that take into account only ecological criteria. Such proposals have become more accurate over time, and in areas where they have been effectively implemented they show positive signs of species protection and recovery. However, in countries where enforcement is lax and conservation 
  <span class="italic">per se</span> can be a short-term burden to the poor, unless associated to compensatory mechanisms, they tend to not succeed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Therefore, the proposed approach could minimize the conflicting goals between economic and ecological interests. This can be achieved firstly by minimizing the vulnerable habitat proposed to be protected, due to the multi-species approach, and secondly by identifying areas where some compromise would need to be made.
 </p>
 <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, it should be stressed that none of our presented models accounted for ontogenetic shifts of the evaluated species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>, a caveat attributed to the data. Without appropriate biometric data, we assumed that the resultant spatial distribution ranges accounted relatively well for the species occurrence throughout their different life stages. However, it is known that species usually have different habitat requirements along their life history. For example, most species have different nursery areas than those where they will occur later in their development due to changes in their resource requirements
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. However, our framework accommodates the incorporation of this type of information (
  <span class="italic">e</span>.
  <span class="italic">g</span>. competition, interaction, dispersal, and ontogenetic shift), whenever they are available, in a straightforward way. Basically, it would require the update of distribution maps to include, for instance, the ontogenetic movements of fisheries target species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The framework we presented here faces the challenge of combining actions that have been successful elsewhere with a new spatial-economic approach that uses novel techniques and available on-line data for any ecosystem and, especially, for data-poor situations. It is important to constantly refine and evaluate management measures as more information is acquired (on life history features, for instance) or as new situations emerge (e.g., climate change). Therefore, it is important to have such straightforward frameworks that could easily evolve into refined management alternatives.</p>
 <p id="Par60" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the usual conservation methods fail to reach compliance, new approaches may be key to find solutions that could be mutually beneficial to both conservation and fisheries, thus resulting in higher acceptance rates by fishers in the short-term, while still assuring that stocks will stand a chance to recover in the long run.</p>
