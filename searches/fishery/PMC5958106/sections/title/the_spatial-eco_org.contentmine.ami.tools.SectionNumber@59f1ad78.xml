  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>: (1) setting a group of ecological/biological criteria to identify ecological optimal areas; (2) setting an economic criterion to identify economically optimal areas; (3) using Bayesian models to identify and predict species distribution; (4) overlapping the ecologically and economically optimal areas to identify the possible levels of conflict between conservation and economic interests using different thresholds, and (5) computing fishers’ economic losses for each proposed scenario assuming that the ecologically optimal area will be closed to fishing.
