    "Understanding the patterns of genetic diversity and adaptation across species' range is crucial to assess its long-term persistence and determine appropriate conservation measures. The impacts of human activities on the genetic diversity and genetic adaptation to heterogeneous environments remain poorly understood in the marine realm. The roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus) is a small catadromous fish, and has been listed as a second-class state protected aquatic animal since 1988 in China. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of population genetic structuring and genetic adaptations to local environments, RAD tags were sequenced for 202 individuals in nine populations across the range of T. fasciatus in China. The pairwise FST values over 9,271 filtered SNPs were significant except that between Dongying and Weifang. All the genetic clustering analysis revealed significant population structure with high support for eight distinct genetic clusters. Both the minor allele frequency spectra and Ne estimations suggested extremely small Ne in some populations (e.g., Qinhuangdao, Rongcheng, Wendeng, and Qingdao), which might result from recent population bottleneck. The strong genetic structure can be partly attributed to genetic drift and habitat fragmentation, likely due to the anthropogenic activities. Annotations of candidate adaptive loci suggested that genes involved in metabolism, development, and osmoregulation were critical for adaptation to spatially heterogenous environment of local populations. In the context of anthropogenic activities and environmental change, results of the present population genomic work provided important contributions to the understanding of genetic differentiation and adaptation to changing environments."
