 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three cases lacked evidence of all types of trade-offs. In both Papah훮naumoku훮kea Marine National Monument and Raja Ampat MPA network, all ecological outcomes were stable or improving, while evaluated social outcomes in the Raja Ampat MPA network were also improving [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref051">51</a>]. No user group was coded for the Papah훮naumoku훮kea Marine National Monument because the whole area is completely no-take and there is no significant direct resource user. However, indigenous Hawaiians are now able to access the area for cultural purposes but currently no data exist for this use. Conversely the Seaflower MPA had declines for two ecological outcomes, but lacked data for the other outcomes, meaning a comprehensive assessment of trade-offs in this case was not possible.
