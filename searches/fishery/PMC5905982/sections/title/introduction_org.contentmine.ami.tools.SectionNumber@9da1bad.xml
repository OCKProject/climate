 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Society increasingly expects protected areas to achieve a diverse set of objectives, ranging from conserving biodiversity to improving local livelihoods and mitigating the impacts of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref001">1</a>]. Yet with increased expectations comes a challenge: it is rarely possible for protected areas to be successful across all these domains. Although there is a desire to characterize protected areas as universally beneficial for the environment and people (i.e., “win-win”), conservation initiatives involving multiple parties and limited resources often involve trade-offs as the norm, rather than the exception [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref002">2</a>]. Trade-offs can occur among management objectives, ecosystem services, stakeholders, and values [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref003">3</a>] and involve “gains for one ecosystem service or group of people, resulting in losses for others” [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref003">3</a>]. The desirability of different objectives, services or values is subjective and can vary with the perspective of different stakeholders. Trade-offs can be explicit management decisions, or arise as an unintended consequence of conservation actions, and can be understood in disparate ways, influenced by social norms and life experiences [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref002">2</a>]. The evaluation of trade-offs is important because it facilitates a more complete consideration of the impacts of conservation initiatives, the lack of which can alienate important partners and reduce support for conservation [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref004">4</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">International conservation policies, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, have supported the expansion of the global protected area network over the last decade (e.g., Aichi Biodiversity Targets [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref005">5</a>]), including large marine protected areas (LMPAs) [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref006">6</a>]. Expectations for the social and ecological performance of these large areas, some of which exceed one million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, are immense. For example, they have been described as “our best hope for arresting the global decline in marine biodiversity” [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref007">7</a>]. It has been hypothesized that LMPAs may be able to avoid livelihood trade-offs that frequently occur in smaller MPAs because they are better able to accommodate resource use within their boundaries and thus have less impact on communities, and also have greater ecological benefits including protecting wide-ranging species [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref010">10</a>]. However, there is considerable debate concerning the benefits of LMPAs (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref012">12</a>]), partially arising from an absence of systematic evaluations of their performance (but see [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref013">13</a>]). Although insights regarding trade-offs in smaller MPAs may be informative, LMPAs have different management challenges than smaller MPAs, including a greater diversity of habitats [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref014">14</a>], multiple agencies with overlapping statutory responsibilities and jurisdictions, a more diverse and often remote constituency, and enforcement challenges [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref015">15</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref017">17</a>]. Therefore there is a need to evaluate the occurrence of trade-offs in LMPAs to identify opportunities to improve their effectiveness across multiple outcomes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite calls for the analysis of trade-offs in conservation [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref002">2</a>], empirical studies involving multiple outcomes are rare (but see: [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref013">13</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref018">18</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref019">19</a>]). Trade-offs can occur within ecological or social systems or between them, and can be assessed through a variety of approaches, including theories and models [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref020">20</a>], empirical evaluations of specific types of trade-offs (e.g., temporal trade-offs [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref021">21</a>]) and between different beneficiaries [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref022">22</a>]. Mouchet and colleagues [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref023">23</a>] drew upon the trade-off frameworks used in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref024">24</a>] and the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref025">25</a>] to develop a typology identifying three general types of trade-offs that emerge in social-ecological systems. First, supply trade-offs are those which involve two or more ecological resources or ecosystem services. An example is the rapid change in relative abundance of groundfish (i.e. Atlantic Cod) and invertebrates (i.e. shrimp, crab) along the coast of Newfoundland in Canada [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref026">26</a>]. Second, supply-demand trade-offs are those involving an ecological resource or ecosystem service and the well-being benefits they provide to communities or stakeholders (i.e., between the ecological and social outcomes). Overfishing is a classic example of a supply-demand trade-off in which livelihood benefits are maintained or enhanced at the expense of resource conditions. Third, and finally, demand trade-offs are those involving social outcomes among different groups of stakeholders. For instance, conservation initiatives may provide benefits for recreational fishers or tourism operators, but might displace fishers that have traditionally relied upon those areas for their livelihoods.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we evaluate whether trade-offs occur in LMPAs. We assess several social and ecological outcomes across a set of well-established LMPAs using a consistent coding approach. Trade-offs were classified using the typology from Mouchet et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref023">23</a>] and then plausible trade-off mechanisms were evaluated to elucidate how trade-offs may be occurring. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of opportunities for addressing different types of trade-offs.
