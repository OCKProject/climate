 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">LMPAs were selected based on four criteria: 1) biodiversity conservation as a primary goal; 2) large: defined as &gt;10,000km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (several magnitudes larger than the median size of MPAs (3.3km
  <span class="sup">2</span>; [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref006">6</a>])); 3) five years of active management: defined as having a management plan and some implementation for at least five years; and 4) sufficient data on outcomes. We identified LMPAs that met our first three criteria from MPAtlas.org [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref027">27</a>], and then conducted a preliminary literature search to determine whether there was evidence of management actions (i.e. environmental monitoring, enforcement). We considered there to be sufficient data for coding outcomes when there were published peer-reviewed or grey literature sources that assessed ecological and/or social outcomes. Globally, 16 MPAs met the first two criteria, four of which were later excluded because they either lacked active management or adequate data on outcomes (Greenland National Park, Dominican Republic Marine Mammal Sanctuary, Franz Josef Land, Pelagos Sanctuary). Our final sample of 12 MPAs range in size from 11,859 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (Raja Ampat MPA Network) to 362,073 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument), and in age from 10 years (Raja Ampat MPA Network) to more than 40 years (Svalbard Eastern Nature Reserves and Great Barrier Reef;
