 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found the typology of trade-offs [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref023">23</a>] to be useful in conceptualizing and assessing trade-offs between different ecological resources (supply trade-offs), trade-offs between ecological resource conditions and the well-being of resource users (supply-demand trade-offs), and trade-offs between the well-being outcomes of different resource users (demand trade-offs). Scrutinizing these potential trade-off relationships enables a nuanced understanding of the complexities of who and what benefits from LMPAs. We suggest that LMPAs planners and managers should consider trade-offs that are likely to occur and look to monitor across a range of social and ecological outcomes so that any negative impacts can be foreseen and managed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found evidence of all three types of trade-offs in our sample of 12 LMPAs, highlighting the importance of considering and mitigating trade-offs where possible. Much like smaller MPAs, supply-demand trade-offs were observed frequently as managers face challenges in balancing fisheries catches (and hence impacts on fishers) with the long-term sustainability of fish stocks. These types of trade-offs tend to develop when policymakers prioritize conservation at the expense of the well-being of user groups [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref053">53</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref054">54</a>], or alternatively, allow resources to decline in order to maintain or enhance the social and economic well-being of user groups [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref034">34</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref055">55</a>]. However, it has also been noted that such trade-offs may be short in duration [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref056">56</a>] as fish stocks either recover and contribute to ‘win-win’ outcomes, or continue to decline with subsequent impacts on the well-being of user groups (i.e. ‘lose-lose’ outcomes). In fact, LMPAs may be more susceptible to supply-demand trade-offs if fishers face difficulties in accessing the spill-over benefits that commonly develop in smaller MPAs [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref057">57</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref059">59</a>]. Supply-demand trade-offs involving tourism and their consequent disturbance of marine vertebrates have also been observed in smaller MPAs [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref060">60</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref061">61</a>]. Although tourists appear to have had a limited impact on outcomes in our sample of LMPAs, tourism can be a contributor to conservation [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref062">62</a>], but there are growing concerns about the potential impacts of increases in marine tourism, particularly in remote areas [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref063">63</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supply trade-offs between resources and demand trade-offs between user groups have typically received less attention in the conservation literature than supply-demand trade-offs. Nonetheless, our study suggests that such trade-offs are salient in the context of LMPAs. First, supply trade-offs among resources appeared to develop when managers faced decisions about how to allocate limited resources (time, effort, political capital) among different ecological resources. For instance, managers in the Galapagos Marine Reserve appear to have allowed the collapse of brown sea cucumber in order to maintain support for broader conservation initiatives. Supply trade-offs in smaller MPAs, meanwhile, often involve endangered species, which are neglected by managers because of the size and scope of the conservation challenge [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref033">33</a>]. Indeed, many endangered species are highly sensitive to incidental take (bycatch) as a non-target species, in both industrial [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref064">64</a>] and small-scale fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref065">65</a>], making it difficult to avoid impacts without affecting the well-being of fishers. Second, demand trade-offs between user groups also occurred in the Galapagos Marine Reserve, where tourism interests have generally benefited at the expense of fishers, problems which have also been found in smaller MPAs [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref066">66</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref068">68</a>]. Finally, although we found evidence of all three types of trade-offs within LMPAs, we also found divergent outcomes, which appear to be driven by larger-scale social, economic, and ecological drivers, such as international market pressures, international treaties, land-based activities, and climate change. Thus, in accessing trade-offs in a management context, it is critical to be cognisant of the potential of divergent outcomes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasingly climate change impacts will also influence how trade-offs manifest [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref069">69</a>]. While climate change will likely negatively affect many ecological resources and the well-being of their users, some impacts and associated adaptation/management responses will enable some ecological resources or user groups to benefit (e.g., squid fisheries in the North Sea [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref070">70</a>]). Indeed, climate change is increasingly used to justify management decisions that prioritise particular supply-demand and demand trade-offs, for instance designation of no-go areas to enhance ecological recovery post-impact, or prohibition or modification of particular fishing gears thought to impact important ecological functional groups (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0195760.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref071">71</a>]).
