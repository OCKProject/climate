 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found varying outcomes in all LMPAs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195760.g002" href="#pone.0195760.g002">Fig 2</a>). Radar plots revealed potential trade-offs in nine of the twelve cases. These included seven cases with possible supply trade-offs, eight with possible supply-demand trade-offs, and four with possible demand trade-offs. Evaluation of trade-off mechanisms in these cases found evidence to explain three supply trade-offs, four supply-demand trade-offs, and one demand trade-off. Trade-offs appeared to develop as a result of 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> management decisions, and everyday resource use decisions. Divergent outcomes were attributed to a variety of external factors such as international conservation measures, and land-based pollution.

Missing data (either where there was no user so an outcome was not appropriate, or no data present) were not plotted as points on the radar chart and the lines connect the points where data were present. Outcome abbreviations used in radar plot: Eco = ecosystem health change; WBEco = well-being change of the user of the ecosystem health indicator; WBFish = well-being change of the user of the fisheries indicator; Migratory = migratory species change; Fish = fisheries change.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supply trade-offs among ecological outcomes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the seven cases with differences in ecological outcomes, three involved changes in migratory species and other environmental outcomes (fisheries and ecosystem health). In Wakatobi National Park and Cenderawasih Bay National Park, the migratory species (green turtle) was declining, whereas other ecological indicators remained stable. This trade-off is likely the result of management decisions to prioritize other aspects of the environment in a context of limited resources. The governance system does not appear to be adequate for vulnerable species, particularly green turtles where historical overexploitation in Indonesia has increased their vulnerability to incidental take in small-scale fisheries [
   <a rid="pone.0195760.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref043">43</a>]. Conversely, in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park, the migratory species (southern right whale) was increasing, while other ecological indictors were declining. This MPA protects calving grounds for the southern right whale, but the species is also benefiting from wider protection methods—primarily the global moratorium on whaling led by the International Whaling Commission, indicating a divergent outcome rather than trade-off.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three cases had differences between the fishery and the other ecological outcomes (ecosystem health and migratory species), but only one of these appeared to involve a trade-off mechanism. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve, regulations in the brown sea cucumber were not enforced and the species is now considered commercially extinct [
   <a rid="pone.0195760.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref044">44</a>]. This fishery faced strong demand from globalised markets, providing strong incentives for fishers to exploit resources for short-term economic gain. The fishery had also previously experienced high levels of conflict (see [
   <a rid="pone.0195760.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref045">45</a>]), which contributed to management decisions to avoid potential conflicts with fishers, rather than ensuring the sustainability of invertebrate fisheries. In contrast there is no reason to suspect that declines in the Sub-Antarctic fisheries (Heard and McDonald, Macquarie) are related to the other ecological outcomes because the decline reflects management decisions to begin harvesting formerly unexploited stocks rather than a trade-off between priorities. Nonetheless it is worth noting that these fisheries have adopted strict management measures, including technological and operational requirements, 100% observer coverage, and seabird bycatch limits to minimise trade-offs between fisheries and migratory seabirds. In the remaining case—the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park—the different outcomes were between ecosystem health change and the fisheries and migratory species changes. In this MPA, coral cover has declined significantly, despite the re-zoning of the marine park in 2004, mainly due to land-based impacts and climate change, which are not directly within the scope of the MPA governance system [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supply-demand trade-offs between ecological and social outcomes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the eight instances where social and ecological outcomes differed, seven involved fisheries and dependent fishers. Four of these appear to be trade-offs, driven by management decisions and everyday resource use decisions. For example, in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, extensive no-take zones (33% of the MPA) have contributed to increased fish biomass [
   <a rid="pone.0195760.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref047">47</a>], but have increased costs for fishers who remained in the fishing industry by reducing the availability of fishing grounds [
   <a rid="pone.0195760.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref048">48</a>]. In Wakatobi National Park, the Bajau are the main users of marine resources and fishing is central to their culture, but they have been marginalised by state and NGO initiatives in the MPA [
   <a rid="pone.0195760.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref049">49</a>]. Likewise, in the Central California National Marine Sanctuaries, new gear restrictions, permits and mandatory on-board observers, have affected the economic viability of groundfish fisheries.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Demand trade-offs among social outcomes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential demand trade-offs were observed in four cases. Three involved different user-groups (Svalbard Eastern Nature Reserves, Central California National Marine Sanctuaries, Galapagos Marine Reserve), and one involved the same user-group but different ecological resources (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park). However, only one of these appears to be a trade-off (Galapagos Marine Reserve). Tourism has been actively promoted and is increasing in both the Galapagos Marine Reserve and Svalbard Eastern Nature Reserves, while fishers have faced declines in well-being. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve economic incentives were provided to sea cucumber fishers after the collapse (and closure) of the fishery to encourage alternative livelihoods related to tourism [
   <a rid="pone.0195760.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref050">50</a>]. In contrast, there is no direct link between the shrimp fishery and tourism in the Svalbard Eastern Nature Reserves, as declines in fisher well-being reflect decreases in the value of shrimp landings. Other examples of divergent outcomes include the Central California National Marine Sanctuaries, where academic research has benefited from increased long-term commitments to research within the MPA, infrastructure and funding opportunities. Conversely, the restrictions placed on groundfish fishermen have led many to exit the fishery, but because management plans of the Sanctuaries do not aim to reduce the number of California groundfish fishermen and they are not in direct competition for resources with academic researchers, it is considered a divergent outcome.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lack of evidence of trade-offs</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three cases lacked evidence of all types of trade-offs. In both Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument and Raja Ampat MPA network, all ecological outcomes were stable or improving, while evaluated social outcomes in the Raja Ampat MPA network were also improving [
   <a rid="pone.0195760.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0195760.ref051">51</a>]. No user group was coded for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument because the whole area is completely no-take and there is no significant direct resource user. However, indigenous Hawaiians are now able to access the area for cultural purposes but currently no data exist for this use. Conversely the Seaflower MPA had declines for two ecological outcomes, but lacked data for the other outcomes, meaning a comprehensive assessment of trade-offs in this case was not possible.
