 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to driving population declines, increasing evidence suggests that fishing induces widespread alterations to life-history characteristics within harvested stocks. Rapid phenotypic shifts have been driven by the non-random nature of human fishing effort, which preferentially removes the oldest and largest individuals from any given population [

  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref002">2</a>]. Intensive size-selective mortality generates directional selection pressure that favors individuals with smaller body-sizes [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref003">3</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref009">9</a>] and those that reach reproductive maturity at smaller body-size and younger age [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref010">10</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref013">13</a>]. Selective pressures from fishing can be strong enough to produce population-wide declines in asymptotic length, growth rate, and size- and age-at-maturation within contemporary timescales [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref004">4</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many fishes, decreased female body-size in mature females correlates with reduced larval size-at-hatch, growth rate, feeding rate, and viability [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref014">14</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref015">15</a>]. Additionally, females that reach sexual maturity at a young age breed for shorter periods and produce fewer, smaller eggs compared to conspecifics that mature later in life [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref016">16</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref017">17</a>]. Declines in the abundance of old, large, highly-fecund individuals are therefore among the primary drivers of reductions in harvestable biomass in exploited stocks [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref018">18</a>]. Decreased population size coupled with diminished reproductive capability can result in fishery collapse, best exemplified by the near disappearance of Atlantic cod (
  <span class="italic">Gadus morhua</span>) in southern Labrador and eastern Newfoundland, Canada, in the late 1980s; an event preceded by the widespread induction of reduced size- and age-at-maturation [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref008">8</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref020">20</a>]. Highlighting the long-term consequences of human-induced alterations to stock characteristics, 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">morhua</span> populations in the region have struggled to recover despite a fishing moratorium enacted in 1992 [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref021">21</a>]. Only recently, after 25 years of fishing regulation and protection, have some 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">morhua</span> stocks displayed evidence of a significant rebound in population sizes [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref022">22</a>], although they remain well below historical averages. Considering the rapid and devastating impacts of size-selective harvesting on the long-term viability of harvested populations, it is critical that life-history shifts be included in the design and assessment of programs aimed at managing fishery resources [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref023">23</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref024">24</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At present, a common component of coral-reef fishery management efforts are no-take marine reserves or marine protected areas (MPAs); spatially explicit zones in which fishing and other exploitative activities are prohibited. Between ~6,000–9,000 MPAs have been established worldwide, covering ~14.2 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (3.9%) of the total ocean surface, with ~1.93 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (0.53% of ocean surface) being fully no-take areas [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref025">25</a>]. As no-fishing zones, MPAs eliminate size-selective fishing effort and the resulting directional selection pressure, theoretically arresting further proliferation of fishing-induced phenotypes within their borders [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref026">26</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref028">28</a>]. Deleterious shifts in phenotypic frequencies may even be reversed by MPAs, as ecological forces generate selection gradients that favor larger body-size and greater age- and size-at-maturation [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref026">26</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref027">27</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref029">29</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref030">30</a>]. Controlled selection experiments have demonstrated that populations are able to restore historical body-size frequency distributions in 6–12 generations after the cessation of size-selective harvest [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref031">31</a>]. It is unknown, however, if the processes observed in laboratory trials can occur in wild fisheries, or if they will be mitigated by natural predation and external influences, including habitat degradation and fishing pressure, outside of protected areas [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref032">32</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability of MPAs to promote increased reproductive output per unit biomass is critical to their ability to meet their stated biological and economic objectives. Among the most important proposed benefits of MPAs is recruitment subsidy, the process by which excess larvae produced by healthy populations inside MPAs are transported to adjacent areas, increasing ecological resilience and improving fishery yields [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref033">33</a>]. Consequently, MPAs must not only increase fish density, but also the relative fecundity of individuals within their borders, as relatively small populations inside MPAs must be able to supplement individuals lost to fishing in much larger spatial areas. Assessments of MPAs have demonstrated increased fish density, biomass, species diversity, and average body-size and age within MPAs compared to fished reefs [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref034">34</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref038">38</a>]. Additionally, beneficial shifts in population structure towards the predominance of large-bodied individuals within MPAs have been observed in a multitude of reefs worldwide [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref035">35</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref036">36</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref039">39</a>]. However, it is unclear whether these observed trends are primarily the result of increased longevity in protected populations or are driven by shifts in phenotypic characteristics inside MPAs. Although studies have indicated that average batch fecundity may be increased inside MPAs compared to adjacent areas [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref040">40</a>], egg production has also been shown to vary spatially due to a variety of influences unrelated to fishing pressure including water temperature and prey availability [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref041">41</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref042">42</a>]. As a result, the ubiquity with which MPAs promote shifts in phenotypic frequencies within their borders remains in question.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In light of the growing anthropogenic pressure being placed on marine fisheries and the increasing use of MPAs as a management tool, a more thorough understanding of the effects of MPAs on fishery resources is essential. This study was designed to assess disparities in fitness-relevant phenotypes between protected and fished populations of three exploited reef-fish species in the Philippines. To do this, we use empirical data to compare the average asymptotic body size, growth rate, and length and age at 50% maturity of conspecific reef fish populations inside and outside of MPA borders.</p>
