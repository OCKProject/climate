 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A direct comparison of life-history characteristics in three reef fishes revealed considerable variation in fitness-relevant phenotypes of conspecifics, with disparities in asymptotic length (L
  <sub>inf</sub>) and/or growth rates (
  <span class="italic">K</span>) being observed in each species within at least one MPA when compared to fished reefs. This result suggests that MPAs can promote shifts in the frequency of large-bodied fish within their borders with relative consistency across a multitude of species. The impact of MPA establishment on maturation schedules in protected populations, however, was much less consistent. Although estimates of length at 50% maturity (L
  <sub>50</sub>) were larger inside two MPAs for 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">multifasciatus</span> and one MPA for 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nigrofuscus</span>, L
  <sub>50</sub> values were not significantly different for 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">striatus</span> in any MPA. In addition, age at 50% maturity (A
  <sub>50</sub>) differed only between the Bani MPA and fished reefs for 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">striatus</span>, but was lower inside the MPA than in fished reefs. That fish inside MPAs did not delay maturation until later ages may mitigate some of the potential reproductive benefits of larger asymptotic length and larger size at maturation. However, the increase of large-bodied, larger-maturing individuals is still likely to result in an overall increase in relative reproductive potential inside MPAs compared to adjacent, fished reefs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The age of MPAs appeared to play a substantial role in whether phenotypes differed between protected and harvested populations. Significantly larger L
  <sub>inf</sub> values were observed predominantly in the two oldest MPAs (San Salvador [26 years; 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nigrofuscus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">multifasciatus</span>], and Taklobo Farm [26 years; 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nigrofuscus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">striatus</span>]), although 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">striatus</span> also exhibited higher asymptotic length inside the Bani MPA (9 years). These results support theoretical predictions regarding the temporal scale required for populations inside MPAs to demonstrate phenotypic recovery, with demonstrable changes in life-history frequencies requiring many years to appear [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref031">31</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref049">49</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref050">50</a>]. The size of MPAs, however, did not seem to be a contributing factor to phenotypic variation between sites. Populations in which life-history traits differed from fished reefs were found in both the largest (San Salvador [127 ha]) and smallest (Taklobo Farm [2 ha]) MPAs in the study, suggesting that long-term protection can promote beneficial changes across a range of MPA sizes. This result is unexpected, as movement into fishing grounds increases the selective force of fishing on protected populations, thereby dampening the benefits of protected areas [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref028">28</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref051">51</a>]. Species with small territories such as 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">striatus</span> (12m
  <span class="sup">2</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref052">52</a>]), are not likely to traverse MPA boundaries even in the smallest MPAs examined here. In contrast, individuals of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nigrofuscus</span> are known to conduct daily feeding and spawning migrations from sheltered sites that can range from 300m [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref053">53</a>] to 1.5km [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref054">54</a>], and 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">multifasciatus</span> roams areas up to 245m
  <span class="sup">2</span> daily [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref055">55</a>], making it unlikely that populations of these species are distinct between MPAs and fished reefs. It is also possible that the age and size of MPAs play synergistic roles in promoting phenotypic shifts in exploited populations. For example, increases in L
  <sub>inf</sub> for 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">nigrofuscus</span> were greater in the San Salvador (127 ha; 26 years) MPA than the Taklobo Farm MPA (2 ha; 26 years), and asymptotic length of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">striatus</span> was higher in the Bani MPA (50 ha; 9 years) than in the Taklobo Farm MPA. The effects of MPA size and age on the life-history variations will likely vary based on the genetic, plastic, and density-dependent processes controlling phenotypic shifts occurring inside MPAs [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref006">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is considerable debate regarding the mechanism underlying phenotypic changes observed in exploited fish stocks. Specifically, the relative contributions of environmentally- or density-dependent phenotypic plasticity and fixed genetic alterations remain in question [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref056">56</a>]. Although fish body-size and maturation are plastic in many species [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref031">31</a>], the intensive harvest rates and size-selectivity of fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref005">5</a>] and demonstrated heritability of life-history traits in fishes [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref003">3</a>] provide the necessary conditions to produce genetic shifts in growth and maturation patterns [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref057">57</a>]. Additionally, alterations to life-history traits have been shown to correlate with concurrent shifts in allelic frequencies [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref052">52</a>], suggesting that phenotypic shifts in wild fish stocks have some genotypic basis. The distinction between phenotypic plasticity and genetics is critical to the recovery potential of exploited populations. Genetic changes are expected to be slower and more challenging to reverse than plastic responses [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref058">58</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref060">60</a>], affect fundamental population dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref061">61</a>], and impact resilience to environmental stress [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref062">62</a>]. However, genetic shifts will be necessary for beneficial traits to extend to fished reefs through spillover and recruitment subsidy [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref026">26</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref028">28</a>]. Consequently, genotypic responses within MPAs would represent long-term benefits throughout interconnected populations, while plastic changes would only manifest inside MPAs, and may be rendered null if protection is ceased.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that the populations examined here are interconnected through both pelagic larval stages and adult movement patterns, genetic stratification between MPAs and fished reefs is unlikely. This suggests that observed phenotypic changes inside MPAs are more likely the result of plastic responses to the removal of fishing mortality. Conversely, the prevalence of life-history shifts in older MPAs indicates that multiple generations are required for alterations to growth rates and body sizes to occur, supporting a genotypic basis of growth and maturation phenotypes. It is also possible that extended periods of protection may be necessary for populations to reach densities great enough to induce plastic responses, in which case density-dependent growth may be primarily responsible for changes in life-history characteristics. Density-dependent mechanisms would help to explain life-history shifts in the Taklobo Farm (2 ha) and Bani (50 ha) MPAs, but not in the larger San Salvador MPA (127 ha). It is also conceivable that variations in environmental parameters such as habitat or food availability between MPAs and fished areas may be responsible for observed shifts in growth patterns [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref044">44</a>]. However, no distinct differences in coral cover or algal prevalence were observed between sites during the course of the study. Alternatively, increased growth and egg production inside MPAs may have been driven by differential stress levels between fished and protected populations, as fish flight initiation distance is positively associated with fishing pressure and decreases significantly inside MPAs [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref063">63</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref064">64</a>]. Populations undergoing constant fishing pressure therefore spend more time avoiding fishing mortality and less time actively foraging, limiting the amount of potential energy that can be allocated to growth and reproduction. This interpretation is consistent with studies that have suggested that fishing pressure actively selects against bold behavioral types, which are often associated with increased reproductive output [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref065">65</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although it appears that 
  <span class="italic">A</span>.

  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">striatus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">multifasciatus</span> have exhibited positive responses to MPA establishment, species-specific analyses across a wide range of taxa will be critical in determining the overall effect of MPAs on reef-fish communities, as there are many factors that may modulate the phenotypic impacts of MPAs. First, family-level susceptibility to fishing pressure [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref066">66</a>], as well as recovery rates of individual fish families [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref067">67</a>], differ significantly. Second, harvest intensity varies greatly depending on the species in question and the locality of the study [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref066">66</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref068">68</a>]. Differential harvest rates will affect the degree to which fishing-induced phenotypic shifts occur within a population, which will not only determine current population sizes and reproductive potential, but also the rate at which fisheries are likely to recover after the cessation of harvest pressure [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref015">15</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref069">69</a>]. Third, responses to protection depend on species-specific movement and behavioral patterns, economic value, body size, habitat depth range, and schooling behavior [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref051">51</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref070">70</a>]. Fourth, rates of evolutionary change have been shown to vary across conspecific fishery stocks that exhibit different somatic growth rates [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref071">71</a>]. As a result, the rates and magnitude of life-history shifts are likely to differ not only across taxa, but also between disparate populations of any given species. Finally, traditional MPA theory predicts greater biological benefits from older and larger MPAs, necessitating the inclusion of the size and age of MPAs in assessments of their impact on fish life-history traits. Future empirical investigations and modelling studies will be critical in advancing our understanding of how populations will respond to spatially explicit cessation of harvest mortality, and how MPAs might best be employed to maximize their benefit to fishery stocks.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The restoration of healthy fishery populations is not only important for resource management, but is also essential for future ecological sustainability in Philippine coral reefs. Fishing pressure is considered a driving force behind deleterious ecological shifts within marine ecosystems [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref072">72</a>], as the preferential removal of commercially targeted species significantly reduces functional diversity in exploited reefs [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref073">73</a>]. Size- and age-truncated fishery stocks recover more slowly after fishing moratoria, as high reproductive investment at small size and early age diminish relative population growth under natural mortality scenarios [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref058">58</a>], increasing the vulnerability of fisheries to environmental stress. MPAs have demonstrated the ability to act as buffers against mass mortality from isolated events [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref074">74</a>], but their ability to combat population collapses against repeated, unpredictable environmental perturbations is less understood. As global climate patterns become increasingly variable, it is essential that MPAs promote the development of robust, highly fecund populations that can better withstand environmental heterogeneity [
  <a rid="pone.0193426.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0193426.ref075">75</a>]. Here, we have provided evidence of disparities in phenotypic frequencies between conspecific fish populations inside and outside of MPAs. Continued studies are necessary to improve our understanding of how ubiquitous these trends are across various MPAs, and whether phenotypic shifts will be substantial enough to promote long-term population resilience in harvested coral-reef fishes in the face of mounting anthropogenic pressures.
