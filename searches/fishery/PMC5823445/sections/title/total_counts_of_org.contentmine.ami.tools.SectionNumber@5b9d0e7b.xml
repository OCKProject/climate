 <div class="title">Total counts of all individuals collected from MPAs and fished reefs.</div>
 <p>Fish are divided by gender (male [M] or female [F]) and by site. Individuals listed as unknown (U) either had their gonads significantly damaged during collection, or were juveniles, making gender identification unreliable. The term “T” denotes the total number of fish caught in any given category.</p>
