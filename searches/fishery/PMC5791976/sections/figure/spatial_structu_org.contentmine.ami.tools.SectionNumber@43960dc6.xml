  <p>Small-scale management units (SSMUs) are numbered, and subareas and boundary areas identified (figure adapted from [
   <a rid="pone.0191011.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref013">13</a>]). Part of SSMU 1, south of the dashed black line, was not modelled. Circles denote summer movement of krill between neighboring areas in movement scenarios, and grayscales demonstrate the strength of flow between the areas: black indicating areas receiving dominant inflow, grey for minor inflow, and white circles showing no inflow.
