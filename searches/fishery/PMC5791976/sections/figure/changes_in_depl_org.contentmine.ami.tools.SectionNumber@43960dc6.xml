  <div class="title">Changes in depletion risk due to fishing for krill, penguins, and seals.</div>
  <p>Changes in modeled SSMU-specific risk of falling below the 75% depletion threshold (i.e. depletion risk) over the 21
   <span class="sup">st</span> century for krill biomass (A, yellow), penguin abundance (B, green), and seal abundance (C, orange). Larger, light-colored circles represent scenarios for RCP 2.6, and smaller, dark circles are those for RCP 8.5 (note that almost all points for krill under RCP 2.6, larger lighter yellow in A, overlap one another at the origin, indicating no impact). Positive movement along the x-axis between a light circle and a dark circle denotes increased risk from RCP 2.6 to 8.5. Points along the 1:1 line imply similar risk with or without fishing, and positive movement along the y-axis for a light to a dark circle denotes increased risk from fishing. Arrows highlight large changes, and are labeled at the RCP 8.5 point for several SSMUs. Blue arrows indicate increased risk attributed to fishing, and orange arrows indicate increased risk attributed to differences in the climate-change pathways. Equivalent figures for whales and fish are in
