 <div class="title">Effects of rising temperature on krill biomass by SSMU.</div>
 <p>Average change (over the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century) in mass of individual krill (
  <span class="italic">wbar</span>) under RCP 2.6 (lighter blue) and 8.5 (darker blue) as a percentage of the original mass (0.46g) by SSMU. Current subarea catch limits apply to each of the three boxes indicating the Antarctic Peninsula (SSMUs 1–8), and the southern (SSMUs 9–12) and northern (SSMUs 13–15) Scotia Sea, which are included to highlight large-scale differences in growth potential. The change in individual mass averaged across all SSMUs is at far right (hatched colors). Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean across simulations in a scenario, capturing the uncertainty introduced by the four parameterizations.
