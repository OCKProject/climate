 <div class="title">Overall outcomes of warming for krill and their predators.</div>
 <p>Marginal impacts and risks for krill and krill-dependent predators given the effects of warming on krill growth (RCP 2.6 in green shades, RCP 8.5 in orange shades), fishing (blue), and both warming and fishing (darker green and darker orange), as modeled over the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century. The top panel shows mean marginal impact (i.e., the ratio of average krill biomass or predator abundance over the last 30 years of each simulation, 2069â€“2099, relative to an analogous simulation from the reference scenario), and the bottom panel, B, depletion risk for krill and their predators (i.e. the risk falling below 75% of biomass or abundance in the reference scenario, again averaged over final 30 years). Results are the mean proportion (A) and total percentage (B) across all SSMUs. Error bars in A represent the standard deviation from the mean across all simulations in a scenario, capturing the uncertainty introduced by the four parameterizations.
