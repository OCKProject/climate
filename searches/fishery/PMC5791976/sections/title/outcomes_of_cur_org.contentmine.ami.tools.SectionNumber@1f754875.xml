 <div class="title">Outcomes of curtailing fishing for penguins by SSMU.</div>
 <p>The effects of curtailing fishing 20 (green circles), 45 (yellow circles), and 70 (red circles) years into the simulation period on depletion risks given penguins for (A) RCP 2.6 and (B) RCP 8.5. Points along the dashed 1:1 line indicate that curtailing fishing had no effect. Points below the dashed 1:1 line indicate a decrease in depletion risk owing to a cessation in fishing. Populations with discernable differences in risk when fishing was curtailed at different times are labeled at the 70-year point by SSMU.</p>
