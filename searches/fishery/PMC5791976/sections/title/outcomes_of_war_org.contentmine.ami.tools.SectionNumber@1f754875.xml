 <p>Marginal impacts on krill biomass (A), penguin abundance (B), and seal abundance (C), owing to the effects of rising temperature on krill growth from RCP 8.5 by the end of the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century. Areas without color indicate species groups are not modeled as recruiting there. Results for RCP 2.6 and for whales and fish under RCP 8.5 are shown in
