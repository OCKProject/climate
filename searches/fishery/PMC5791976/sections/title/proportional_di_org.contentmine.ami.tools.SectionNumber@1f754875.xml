 <div class="title">Proportional distributions of krill catch by SSMU.</div>
 <p>Proportions used in earlier versions of the model are under “Previous Model” (Table 2 in [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref013">13</a>]). The updates used here, “Current Model”, are derived from catches taken during the 2009–2015 fishing seasons and under limits at finer spatial scales specified by current management [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref016">16</a>]. Both include the proportional distribution of fishing across SSMUs (“Annual Distribution”), and then how this proportion was distributed seasonally within each SSMU (“Seasonal Distribution”). Therefore, annual distribution sums to one by column, seasonal distribution by row (“Summer” + “Winter”).
