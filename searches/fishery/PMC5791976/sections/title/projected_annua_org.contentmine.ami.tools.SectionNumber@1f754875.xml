 <div class="title">Projected annual marginal impacts to assess lasting impacts of fishing on predator groups.</div>
 <p>The annual marginal impacts plotted each year (x-axis) across model scenarios when fishing is stopped immediately (green), after 20 years (orange), after 45 years (gray), after 70 years (yellow), or never, for penguins (A), seals (B), whales (C), and fish (D). Left column is for RCP 2.6, and right is RCP 8.5.</p>
