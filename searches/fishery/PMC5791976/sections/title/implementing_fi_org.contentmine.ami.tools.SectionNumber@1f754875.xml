 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model includes several “fishing options” that define candidate management strategies based on both the overall level of catch and the proportional distribution of catches among the SSMUs (see [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref013">13</a>]). We used the “historical fishing” option to define a management strategy based on current catch limits for the krill fishery. We specified an overall harvest rate throughout the model arena of 0.01, which represents the current catch limit of 620,000 t per year in the Scotia Sea [

  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref016">16</a>], we specified that no more than a set proportion of the overall harvest could be removed from each of SSMUs 1–8 combined (25% limit), SSMUs 9–12 combined (45% limit), and SSMUs 13–15 combined (45% limit). We simulated the spatial distribution of catches among SSMUs based on the average distribution of actual catches between 2009 and 2015, first among SSMUs annually, and then within each SSMU seasonally (
