 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a spatially explicit ecosystem model developed in R [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref019">19</a>], described by Watters et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref013">13</a>], and with a sensitivity analysis provided by Hill &amp; Matthews [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref020">20</a>]. Briefly, this minimally realistic model uses delay-difference equations to describe the dynamics of krill and four krill-dependent predator groups (penguins, seals, whales, and fishes). The model includes two time-steps (seasons) per year, and spatially represents 15 SSMUs in the Scotia Sea (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191011.g001" href="#pone.0191011.g001">Fig 1</a>). We modeled the post-larval abundance of krill in each SSMU as a function of stochastic recruitment and area-specific mortality and movement. At the beginning of each time step, the numbers of krill in an SSMU are converted to biomass using an estimate of the mean mass per individual krill, 
  <span class="italic">wbar</span>. In the case where krill have moved into an SSMU from other areas of the model, 
  <span class="italic">wbar</span> is the abundance-weighted mean mass of the mixture.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Predators and the fishery consume from the area-specific krill biomass estimated at the beginning of each time step, and competition arises when biomass is insufficient to satisfy the combined demand. If the average mass of an individual krill changes because of rising temperatures (see below), this can alter the biomass of krill available.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, the fishery for Antarctic krill operates almost exclusively in the area represented in the ecosystem model, which is divided into the 15 SSMUs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191011.g001" href="#pone.0191011.g001">Fig 1</a>; see [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref017">17</a>]). Following Watters et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref013">13</a>], we treated each predator group breeding in an SSMU as an independent population. The model also includes three boundary areas that supply krill to the SSMUs from the Bellingshausen Sea, Weddell Sea, and northern Drake Passage (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191011.g001" href="#pone.0191011.g001">Fig 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We employed most of the ecological parameters and model structures described by Watters et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref013">13</a>] and their approach for addressing key uncertainties in our understanding of the ecosystem. This included the four parameterizations developed by Watters et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref013">13</a>], which bracket plausible values for rates of krill movement between SSMUs (no movement and movement as passive drifters) and sensitivities of predators to krill availability (hyperstable and linear). Two elements of the model were revised. First, we updated the distributions and seasonality of foraging effort by penguins, whales, and seals using recent tracking data [
  <a rid="pone.0191011.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref021">21</a>]. Second, we adjusted the model to include time-series variation in the average mass of individual krill (see below).
