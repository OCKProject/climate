   <div class="title">Changes in depletion due to fishing for whales and fish.</div>
   <p>Changes in modeled SSMU-specific risk of falling below the 75% depletion threshold (i.e. depletion risk) over the 21
    <span class="sup">st</span> century for whale (A, grey) and fish (B, blue) abundance owing to scenarios with and without fishing for the RCP 2.6 (large, light circles) and RCP 8.5 (small, dark circles) scenarios. Positive movement from light to dark circles along the x-axis denotes increased risk from RCP 2.6 to 8.5. Points along the 1:1 line imply similar risk with or without fishing, with positive movement from light to dark circles along the y-axis denoting increased risk from fishing. All points for whales and most for fish overlap at the origin, indicating no impact.

   <div class="title">Proportional distributions of krill catch by SSMU.</div>
   <p>Proportions used in earlier versions of the model are under “Previous Model” (Table 2 in [
    <a rid="pone.0191011.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref013">13</a>]). The updates used here, “Current Model”, are derived from catches taken during the 2009–2015 fishing seasons and under limits at finer spatial scales specified by current management [
    <a rid="pone.0191011.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191011.ref016">16</a>]. Both include the proportional distribution of fishing across SSMUs (“Annual Distribution”), and then how this proportion was distributed seasonally within each SSMU (“Seasonal Distribution”). Therefore, annual distribution sums to one by column, seasonal distribution by row (“Summer” + “Winter”).
