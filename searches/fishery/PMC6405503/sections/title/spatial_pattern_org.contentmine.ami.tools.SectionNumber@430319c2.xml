 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small sea urchins were present in maerl and kelp holdfast within all the 55 studied stations (Appendix 
  <a rid="ece34963-app-0002" ref-type="app" href="#ece34963-app-0002">B</a>), indicating that successful recruitment of sea urchins occurred across the 1,500 km study area. On average, small sea urchins were found within kelp holdfasts (8.0 mm ± 0.60) and in maerl beds (8.0 mm ± 0.69), while larger specimens were among cobblestones (25.0 mm ± 0.61) and on bedrock (29.0 mm ± 0.37). Sea urchin size (i.e., test diameter) was highly variable across the study area and not well explained by our explanatory variables (position at the coast, substrate, sampling year) in our selected mixed GAM (

  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0006">6</a>). However, sea urchin size was significantly higher on bedrock compared to the cobblestone substrate (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), but not significantly influenced by position at the coast (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.069, Figure
