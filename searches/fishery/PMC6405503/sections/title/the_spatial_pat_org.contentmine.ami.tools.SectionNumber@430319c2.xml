 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial pattern of kelp recovery</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both sea urchins (
  <span class="italic">S. droebachiensis</span>) and kelp (
  <span class="italic">L. hyperborea</span> and 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span>) were found in all 11 sampling areas along the coast, although kelp was at very low occurrences in Troms mid and Porsanger (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0003">3</a>, Appendix 
  <a rid="ece34963-app-0001" ref-type="app" href="#ece34963-app-0001">A</a>). This implies an increased kelp recovery since 2007 (reported by Norderhaug &amp; Christie, 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0046">2009</a>), but persistence of the barren zone in Troms. In the southern recovery zone, kelp was observed at 51%, 86%, and 90% of the stations at Vega, Arctic Circle, and Salten, respectively (Appendix 
  <a rid="ece34963-app-0001" ref-type="app" href="#ece34963-app-0001">A</a>). In the northern recovery zone (i.e., Kirkenes), kelp forests were observed at 71% and 68% of the stations visited in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The remaining sampling areas, representing more than 1,200 km of the coast, were still dominated by sea urchin barrens, even though 
  <span class="italic">L. hyperborea</span> occurred at some of the most wave‐exposed shallow locations. Pearson's correlation coefficient between kelp and sea urchins for the whole study area, and for the southern, barren, and northern zone, respectively, was as follows: −0.82, −0.79, −0.85, and −0.72, indicating a negative correlation between the two in all areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The GAM showed that the probability of finding kelp strongly related to the position along the coast (
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 5.66, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.0002). The probability dropped from approximately one in the southern kelp recovery area to close to zero between −200 (Troms south) and 200 (Porsanger; Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0004">4</a>). From Porsanger toward the northern recovery area (Kirkenes), the probability of kelp increased sharply. The model with year included (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.25) was equally good as the one without (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.13, ΔAIC = 0.2). The opposite pattern was found for the sea urchins (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0004">4</a>), but here, the model without year (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.18) was selected in favor of the one with year included (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.18), based on AIC values (ΔAIC = 10.7).
