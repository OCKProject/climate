 <p>This project was mainly funded by a Flagship program at the Fram Centre in Norway. Data collection was also supported by the Norwegian Environment Agency through funding of several kelp and sea urchin projects, NIVA, and the projects EPIGRAPH, KELPEX (NRC grant 255085) and OPTIMAKELP (NRC grant 280732). We thank Sverre Nilsen, Hans Kristian Strand, and Knut Sivertsen for cooperation during parts of the field work, and the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries for providing crab landing data.</p>
