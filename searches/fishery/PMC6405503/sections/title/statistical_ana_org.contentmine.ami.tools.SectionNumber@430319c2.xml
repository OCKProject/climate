 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 3.5.0, R Core Team, 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0054">2018</a>). For analyses testing linear relationships (correlations between cod and crab landings), the lm function in the 
  <span class="italic">stats</span> library was used. Spatial patterns of kelp and sea urchin and sea urchin sizes, as well as sea urchin densities, were tested using generalized additive models (GAMs), which allow for nonlinear relationships where a nonparametric function is estimated for each predictor, to achieve the best prediction of the dependent variables. This was done using the library 
  <span class="italic">mgcv</span> (Wood, 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0082">2017</a>). For binomial responses (kelp and sea urchin probability), logit link functions were used. For count responses (sea urchin density), a Poisson distribution was assumed with a log link function. The remaining analyses assumed a normal (Gaussian) distribution; thus, an identity link function was used. When different candidate models were tested, the Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small samples (AICc, Burnham, Anderson, &amp; Huyvaert, 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0007">2010</a>) was used to select the best model. To relate crab abundance to the occurrence of urchin barrens, we tested the proportion of barren vs. kelp recovery sites within areas with and without crab landings, using Pearson's chi‚Äêsquared tests, applying the prop.test() function in the 
  <span class="italic">stats</span> library.
