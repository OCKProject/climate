 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During initial surveys in the kelp recovery zones, we noticed that kelp recovery was limited to bedrock and that nearby cobble substrate remained overgrazed by sea urchins. This pattern could be a result of kelp preferentially settling on bedrock and not on cobble bottoms. However, Scheibling and Hamm (
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0060">1991</a>) found in a caging experiment that cobblestone habitats create spatial refugia for urchins that decrease predation by crabs. Based on this, we explored the sea urchins’ use of bedrock and cobblestone, which provide different levels of predator refuge for sea urchins and thus may indicate the influence of predators (Clemente et al., 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0010">2013</a>; Falk‐Petersen et al., 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0019">2011</a>). This was done at 185 stations within the kelp recovery zones in the south (i.e., Vega in 2012 and the Arctic Circle in 2011) and in the north (i.e., Kirkenes in 2012; Appendix 
  <a rid="ece34963-app-0001" ref-type="app" href="#ece34963-app-0001">A</a>). All three areas have high crab landings (cf. the analysis of temporal and spatial patterns of changes in predator abundances below).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea urchins were found on all cobblestone stations in each of the three areas (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0005">5</a>). The frequencies of sea urchins on stations with open bedrock were 25% at Vega, 9% at the Arctic Circle, and 0% at Kirkenes. In Kirkenes, recovered kelp forests were found on 100% of the bedrock stations whereas 100% of nearby cobblestone stations were dominated by sea urchins in high densities (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0005">5</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in occurrence of kelp and sea urchins between the sampling areas and between substrate types were tried tested in a binomial generalized linear model (GLM), but since there was no variation in the response in cobble substrate (sea urchin presence and kelp absence in all stations), the results are shown without any statistics.</p>
