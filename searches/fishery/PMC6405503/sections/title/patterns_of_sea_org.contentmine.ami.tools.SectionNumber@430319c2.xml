 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Patterns of sea urchin recruitment success</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite differences in temperature and nutrient supply, Fagerli et al., 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0018">2015</a> found that growth parameters for sea urchin populations from sea urchin barrens and kelp forests in the southern kelp recovery zone (Vega, 54°N) and the northern barren zone (Hammerfest, 70°N) were similar. Based on this premise, we investigated the sea urchin population structure using density and test size frequency as proxies for recruitment success and survival at 55 stations within the kelp recovery and barren zones (see station list in Appendix 
  <a rid="ece34963-app-0002" ref-type="app" href="#ece34963-app-0002">B</a>). Occurrence of small juveniles in cryptic habitats indicates recruitment, and the occurrence of adults indicates survival from juvenile to adult stage.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All stations were at shallow depths (&lt;10 m) and were defined as one of four different habitat types: bedrock (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 24), cobblestone (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 15), maerl (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 10), and kelp holdfasts (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 6; see Appendix 
  <a rid="ece34963-app-0002" ref-type="app" href="#ece34963-app-0002">B</a>), where sea urchins are known to recruit (NIVA, unpublished data). By SCUBA diving, sea urchin density was estimated at each station by counting the number of individuals within 10 replicate frames of 50 × 50 cm (for bedrock or cobblestone bottoms), 4 replicate 20 × 20 frames (for maerl), or within four haphazardly collected kelp holdfasts (in areas with kelp forests). Sea urchins on bedrock and cobblestone were counted in situ
  <span class="italic">. </span>Sea urchins in maerl and holdfasts were collected while still within the substrate, then picked loose, counted, and size measured on land. For size frequency analysis of sea urchins at the bedrock and cobblestone stations, the first 200 individuals found within the frames were collected and the individual test diameter was measured with calipers on land. Sea urchins recruiting in kelp holdfasts were not converted to densities, as it is difficult to get exact data of area for this substrate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea urchin size variation was also analyzed using mixed GAM at the level of individual sea urchins (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 5,505), using station ID as a random factor to correct for possible nonindependence between individuals sampled from the same station. Six candidate models included different combinations of position at the coast, substrate, and year, and the interaction between the two latter. As holdfast and maerl did not provide sufficient data at several intervals along the coast (Appendix 
  <a rid="ece34963-app-0002" ref-type="app" href="#ece34963-app-0002">B</a>) and thus resulted in huge confidence intervals, these two substrate types were excluded from the analyses of sea urchin size along the coast, and only cobblestone and bedrock were used.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea urchin density (number of individuals per m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) was tested for potential regional differences and substrate effects. Substrate types and zones (southern and northern recovery zone and barren zone) and their interaction were included in the model. Holdfast was excluded in this analysis, since density was not measured for this substrate type. Two candidate models were tested: one with additive effects, and one including an interaction between substrate and zone.
