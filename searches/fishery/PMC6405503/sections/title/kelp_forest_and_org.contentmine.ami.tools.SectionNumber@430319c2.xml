 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kelp forest and sea urchin distribution patterns</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A key pattern in the conceptual model of the large‐scale kelp recovery along the Norwegian coast (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0002">2</a>) is that kelp recovery is occurring along the mid‐ and northern coasts of Norway. We hypothesize that this is due to reduced grazing by lowered densities of sea urchins, allowing kelp to recolonize the barrens (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0002">2</a>; Sea urchin ↔kelp). To explore the distribution patterns of kelp forest and sea urchins, we used a spatially comprehensive dataset of kelp (
  <span class="italic">L. hyperborea </span>and 
  <span class="italic">S. latissima</span>) and green sea urchin (
  <span class="italic">S. droebachiensis</span>) recordings from surveys performed between 2008 and 2012, from more than 1,500 km of the mid‐ and northern Norwegian coast (65–71°N, Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0003">3</a>). This part of the coast is morphologically complex with many islands and fjords. Kelp and sea urchin recordings were conducted at 11 sampling areas with 15–376 stations per area (average = 114, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 104), depending on boat time available, weather conditions, and presence of rocky habitat, totaling 1,249 stations, each with one replicate point observation (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0003">3</a> and Appendix 
  <a rid="ece34963-app-0001" ref-type="app" href="#ece34963-app-0001">A</a>). The depth range was between 0 and 28 m (average = 6.4, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 4.8). The survey covered the three counties, Nordland, Troms, and Finnmark, from the 2007 southern limit of kelp recovery around Vega in the Norwegian Sea (Norderhaug &amp; Christie, 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0046">2009</a>) and northeast to the Russian border in the Barents Sea (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0003">3</a>). All stations were situated on stable hard substrate, either bedrock or cobblestone/boulder (Wentworth, 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0076">1922</a>, further called “cobblestone”), in areas that were previously grazed barren grounds with high densities of (visible) adult sea urchins (~20–50 individuals per m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) (Sivertsen, 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0064">1997</a>; Skadsheim et al., 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0066">1995</a>). The stations were in sheltered and moderately wave‐exposed areas (exposure value swm &lt; 500,000, Bekkby, Rinde, Erikstad, &amp; Bakkestuen, 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0003">2009</a>, Gundersen et al., 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0023">2011</a>). More wave‐exposed areas are generally not subject to sea urchin grazing (Rinde et al., 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0056">2014</a>). The three southernmost sampling areas, Vega, Arctic Circle, and Salten, represent “the southern recovery zone,” identified by Rinde et al. (
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0056">2014</a>). The “northern recovery zone” was defined by the bounds of Kirkenes area, which was the only location with kelp recovery this far north in the present study. The seven sampling areas in between the two recovery zones (Lofoten, Troms south, Troms mid, Hammerfest, Porsanger, Kongsfjord, and Varanger) represent “the barren zone.” To explore the relationship between kelp and sea urchins, we calculated Pearson's correlation coefficient between the two variables (available as presence and absence data for each study site), for both the whole data set, and for each of the three zones (the two recovery areas and the barren zone). The surveys were performed between 2008 and 2012. Note that this spatially extensive dataset was compiled from many different surveys and projects, and different areas were covered each year, so the data are not balanced in space and time (see time schedule for field recordings in Appendix 
  <a rid="ece34963-app-0001" ref-type="app" href="#ece34963-app-0001">A</a>).

Presence of kelp and sea urchins is not mutually exclusive, and the total percentage might therefore exceed 100% in some areas. The number of stations in each sampling area is shown in brackets. The three climatic stations (Bud, Skrova, and Ingøy) are shown as light blue dots. Counties are shown as blue and violet sections along the coast. The borders between the barren ground area and the northern and southern kelp recovery area are indicated by dark red lines

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kelp and sea urchin abundance data were recorded from small boats using geographic positioning system (GPS) and underwater cameras equipped with depth sensors, giving us a view of the seabed with the extent of 1–2 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>. With few exceptions, the camera view either revealed pure dominance of kelp (i.e., kelp present, sea urchin absent) or pure dominance of sea urchins (i.e., sea urchin present, kelp absent). Only at a few stations, both species were present, possibly indicating a transitional state (i.e., hysteresis, Ling et al., 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0038">2015</a>, Figure 
  <a rid="ece34963-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34963-fig-0001">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To create a single variable that captured the relative position of each station along the coastline (i.e., instead of using the two highly correlated variables latitude and longitude), we calculated the position at the coast as the linear distance from each station to a reference point around Troms mid (68.7°N, 20.4°E), with negative distances to sites south of this reference point and positive distances to sites east of it. We identified this reference point using a piecewise regression analysis using the 
  <span class="italic">segmented</span> R library (Muggeo, 
  <a rid="ece34963-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34963-bib-0045">2008</a>), correlating the station's latitude against longitude, which fits the coastline very well (single breakpoint = 20.44, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span>
  <sub>adj</sub> = 0.98). This variable was then used to capture the spatial variation in the analyses of kelp and sea urchin presences, as well as sea urchin size distribution, along the coast.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial patterns of kelp and sea urchin presences along the Norwegian coast were explored using mixed GAMs. Two binomial models related the presence of kelp and sea urchins to the position at the coast. Two candidate models were tested in each case, with and without year as a categorical covariable. A random factor was included to account for nonindependent observations within each sampling area.</p>
