In this study, we surveyed the perceptions of conservation among local stakeholders who participated in protected area (PA) management following a reform towards community-based conservation in Norway. We analyzed the link between perceptions of threats to conservation values, prioritized management actions and trust in PA governance, and assessed how these perceptions aligned with the stakeholders&#x02019; preferred overarching conservation approach and their support for PAs. Conservation perceptions differed mostly between property owners and representatives of nature conservation (such as NGOs). Property owners perceived modern farming, grazing and hay making, and securing the interests of rights holders as a priority. They had a lower support for PAs and favored a conservation approach focusing on &#x0201c;people and nature&#x0201d;. Representatives from nature conservation prioritized management actions to increase biodiversity and reduce land development, had higher trust in environmental authorities and identified motorized vehicle use as a threat to conservation values. They had a high support for PAs and favored a conservation approach that mitigates threats from human activity (i.e. &#x0201c;nature despite people&#x0201d;). The nationwide reform aimed at increasing support for PAs, but 31% of the members of the stakeholder advisory councils were willing to downgrade or degazette PAs for the benefit of economic development, which is much more than general population surveys. However, the level of trust in local governance was less polarized among the members of stakeholder advisory councils compared with the former state governance, which suggests that that the community-based conservation reform has the potential to improve collaboration and conflict mitigation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsr&#x000e5;d</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>230330/E50/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Vera Helene Hausner</principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by CultES &#x02013; Assessing spatially explicit cultural ecosystem services for adaptive management in the Alpine North, Norwegian Research Council (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Forsiden/1173185591033">https://www.forskningsradet.no/no/Forsiden/1173185591033</ext-link>) nr. 230330/E50/2014.

Introduction</title><p>Community-based conservation that places decision-making power with lower-level authorities and involves local stakeholders in conservation management, is thought to increase support for conservation through greater sensitivity to local conditions and perceptions [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Community-based conservation is loosely defined as &#x02018;&#x02018;natural resources or biodiversity protection by, for, and with the local community&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and includes acts of decentralization i.e., when the government grants decision making power to local governing bodies [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Community-based conservation is characterized by a bottom-up process where decision making starts at the local level and involves interactions at multiple levels [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Closeness to those affected by conservation is believed to increase decision makers&#x02019; understanding of local conditions and needs, which in turn can increase trust and improve perceptions of- and support for conservation [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In 2009, the Norwegian government decided to implement a nation-wide community-based conservation strategy for protected areas. This shift in governance entailed a transfer of management authority from the government to local conservation boards [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and these conservation boards are obligated to consult with local stakeholders [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The community-based conservation reform was the result of years of conflicts between national conservation agencies and local stakeholders [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the rationale behind the reform was to reduce tension by creating a sense of ownership to the protected areas [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Prior to the reform, reports had recurrently pointed out that conservation values (i.e., the reasons for protecting the areas, such as biodiversity, threatened species or habitats, science, recreation or cultural heritage) in protected areas were threatened [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which was another reason for the change in governance [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>People&#x02019;s perception of the conservation problem is central to their attitudes to different conservation strategies [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For instance, people living in or next to protected areas in three European countries differed in their views of nature, such as whether nature is fragile or resilient, stable or dynamic and whether nature and culture are related or opposites [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Viewing ideal nature as untouched was associated with preferences for stricter regulations and exclusion whereas viewing nature as a product of people-nature interactions was associated with the need for land management [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly, the view of nature, its use and ability to regenerate was a core issue in the long-standing conflict over a North-American national park (Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota), along with opinions about who should have management responsibility (i.e., local and state control or federal) [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These aspects are also central to conservation conflicts in Norwegian protected areas [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Support for protecting land is more likely if the way conservation is conceptualized and communicated by decision-makers and practitioners resonates with people (i.e., makes conservation seem natural and familiar) [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Four main approaches to conservation (&#x0201c;nature for itself&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;nature despite people&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;nature for people&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;people and nature&#x0201d;) have developed over time, according to Mace [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], all of which are in use today. These approaches are likely to resonate differently among local stakeholders, as they do among conservation scientists and practitioners [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>PAs started as (so-called) nature-centered conservation and were initially conceptualized as islands of wilderness protected from human interventions [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This is the key conservation strategy within the &#x0201c;nature by itself&#x0201d; approach that dominated conservation thinking prior to the 1960s [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the 1970s-1980s the &#x0201c;nature despite people&#x0201d; approach emerged from the realization of the increasing environmental impacts of human activity. With this approach focus shifted towards reversing or reducing threats to species and habitats from humans through population monitoring and management [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. With the &#x0201c;nature despite people&#x0201d; approach the idea of PAs broadened to include PA networks (emphasizing ecological representation and the facilitation of species movement between PAs) and PAs in relation to the landscape, focusing on how buffer areas affect conservation values inside PAs [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>More recently approaches that, instead of seeing humans as a threat to nature, recognize that people are a part of nature have emerged. The &#x0201c;nature for people&#x0201d; approach focuses on how ecosystems are essential for human welfare through the goods and services provided by nature. An ecosystem services approach to PAs could generate support for PAs through a greater understanding of the many different types of benefits provided by these conservation areas [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and by focusing on the value of these benefits [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For example, local benefits generated from nature-based tourism in protected areas could potentially increase support for conservation. The &#x0201c;people and nature&#x0201d; approach also brings in people as an integral part of nature, but here conservation is perceived as managing social-ecological systems where people, culture and institutions are connected to nature through their use, modification and care for nature [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A social-ecological approach looks at PAs as land use embedded in multifunctional landscapes [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It incorporates social science in conservation planning alongside ecological knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] to better understand the complexity of human-nature dynamics, with the goal of developing policy that accounts for these dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>By understanding perceptions (i.e. the way people observe, understand, interpret, and evaluate conservation) we can gain knowledge of the reasons for local support or resistance to environmental governance and management [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The purpose of our study was to investigate the perceptions of conservation among local stakeholders involved in protected area management following the nationwide community-based conservation reform. A recent review of existing knowledge of attitudes towards protected areas in Norway shows that while support for protection is high in the general population, less is known about the local attitudes and perceptions of conservation [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>In this study, stakeholders&#x02019; perception of the conservation problem was operationalized as perceived threats to conservation values, their prioritized management actions and trust in the actors involved in PA governance. First, we asked: what are the relationships between stakeholders&#x02019; perceived threats, management priorities and trust in PA governance? Secondly, how are these perceptions related with stakeholders&#x02019; preferences for overarching conservation approaches (following Mace [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) and their level of support for protected areas (based on their attitudes towards PA loss or degradation for economic activity). Finally, we discuss the implications for PA management following the 2009 community-based conservation reform.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>1.1 The nationwide community-based management reform</title><p>Conservation has been largely top-down since the start of the conservation movement in Norway in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In the 1990s, local management of protected areas was first put on the political agenda by landowner organizations [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This was triggered by a national plan to create a number of new protected areas and expand existing ones, a plan that affected both productive and private land [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In 2009 the Norwegian Parliament approved a nationwide community-based conservation reform through a budgetary proposition [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The reform was a result of a successful mobilization of local politicians and a continuation of a general practice of delegating responsibilities from the central to the local level in Norway [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>Before the reform different local governance arrangements were tested [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] with varied results [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The overall conclusion was that despite high local political commitment, local management responsibility did not manage to increase support for conservation in the local communities [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Evaluations also pointed out that there were few opportunities for real participation of stakeholders and other governmental agencies, and few arenas for conflict resolution [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>1.2 The main actors in community-based conservation</title><p>Local conservation boards were established as a result of the reform and these currently hold management responsibility for protected areas, a responsibility previously held by the government bureaucracy at the regional level (the County Governor; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215437.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The members of these boards are for the most part local and regional politicians proposed by the municipalities and the County Parliament, and representatives proposed by the Sami Parliament. The conservation boards are officially appointed by the Environmental Agency&#x02013;the professional bureaucracy at the national level. These boards currently manage single PAs or clusters of PAs, aided by park managers with conservation expertise employed as a result of the reform. The conservation boards are in charge of decisions regarding permit-applications, budgets, management plans, plans for management measures and other tasks [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The reform has resulted in the involvement of around 500 local and regional politicians in PA management and the employment of approximately 54 park managers. In total, 36 out of 39 Norwegian national parks as well as a substantial portion of protected landscapes and other protected areas are now governed locally.</p><fig id="pone.0215437.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0215437.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The main actors in Norwegian protected area governance before and after the reform.</title><p>Local conservation boards are currently in charge of the daily decision-making.

For instance, the boards must forward all their decisions to the County Governor and the Environmental Agency and report to the County Governor annually. The County Governor should ensure that conservation boards&#x02019; decisions follow the Nature Diversity Act and can appeal them on behalf of the government. Management plans and plans for management measures must be approved by the Environmental Agency. The Ministry of Climate and Environment is the supreme political authority for protected areas and can change the conservation boards&#x02019; mandate and retract the delegated authority if they do not comply with the overall goals of management [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The Environmental Agency and the Ministry can overturn conservation boards&#x02019; decisions if they consider them invalid (Public Administration Act &#x000a7; 35), but this has rarely been done in practice [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>The conservation boards&#x02019; statutes give them room to decide on how to organize stakeholder participation through advisory councils and who to involve. The only requirement is that they appoint stakeholders that represent different interest groups in the protected area(s), and that they have at least one annual dialogue meeting with the stakeholder advisory council. Reports from these meetings are generally made publicly available online. Interest groups can include property owners and other rights holders (e.g., reindeer herders), commercial interests (e.g., tourism, hydropower industry), nature conservation&#x02014;(e.g., Friends of the Earth, people employed at national park centers), recreation- (e.g., the National Trekking Association, Forum for Nature and Outdoor Recreation), hunting &#x00026; fishing organizations (e.g., Norwegian Association of Hunters and Anglers) and village associations.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>1.3 The status and conservation policy of Norwegian protected areas</title><p>The goals of Norwegian protected areas are to maintain natural variation of habitat types and landscapes, biodiversity, areas for small-scale outdoor recreation, natural and cultural history, ecological connectivity and reference areas (Nature Diversity Act &#x000a7; 33). Norway also has international commitments to conserve biodiversity through protected areas, for instance through the ratification of the UN Convention of Biological Diversity [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Each protected area has a set of rules (protection regulations) tailored to the local conditions during PA establishment. Non-motorized, low-impact access, small-scale harvesting and grazing are allowed in most protected areas [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Motorized vehicle use is mainly regulated through permits, whereas land development inside protected areas is generally either not allowed or also regulated through permits [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Property owners should be informed and involved during the process of protected area designation (Nature Diversity Act &#x000a7;&#x000a7; 41&#x02013;46) and they are financially compensated for the restrictions on use (Nature Diversity Act &#x000a7;51). They also retain hunting and fishing rights.</p><p>In the years leading up to the reform, reports from the County Governor showed the conservation values of an increasing proportion of protected areas were threatened by at one or more human activities [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The main threats to protected areas were alien species (mainly non-native species of wood), land abandonment, motorized vehicle use, other forms of traffic, land development and pollution [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

The stakeholders represented on the advisory councils vary somewhat between areas, since the conservation boards are relatively free to decide. In some areas stakeholder advisory councils were present before the reform and continued under the new management authority. We invited all the members of 11 different stakeholder advisory councils to participate; one large advisory council covering 14 protected areas in Northern Norway and ten councils covering 42 protected areas in the south (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215437.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215437.s001">S1 Table</xref>).

The participants could rate nine categories of threats and their level of trust in the seven main actors involved in protected area governance on a five-point Likert scale from very low to very high, in addition to a no opinion option. They could further select between 16 management actions and check those that would be their main priorities if they held management responsibility (they could check all the management actions that applied to them, but we asked them to limit their answer to three). An open category where the participants could add other threats and priorities was also available. The threat categories that the participants were asked to evaluate were similar to the categories of activities reported to be negatively affecting conservation values in Norwegian protected areas prior to the initiation of a nationwide community-based conservation reform in 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These threats also correspond to standard threat categories known to affect conservation targets [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The priority questions were developed to elicit differences in perceptions among the participants about what should be protected along the nature-culture continuum and perceptions of the acceptable degree of human use (i.e., use vs protection) based on previous work on Norwegian protected areas [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>As the community-based conservation reform aspired to increase support for protected areas we inquired about the participants&#x02019; attitudes towards PAs. We used a standard survey question developed and used by the European Commission to assess people&#x02019;s attitudes towards conservation in their general population Eurobarometer survey [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The question focuses on the willingness to accept tradeoffs between conservation and economic development. The Eurobarometer survey results provides a benchmark for comparison in the absence of knowledge of stakeholders&#x02019; attitudes prior to the community-based conservation reform.</p><p>To assess preferences for overarching conservation ideas we asked the participants to select one of four conservation approaches developed from Mace [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (i.e., &#x0201c;nature for itself&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;nature despite people&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;nature for people&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;people and nature&#x0201d;; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec001">Introduction</xref>) that mostly agreed with their own view of how conservation should be approached, including a no opinion option. A survey approach to the preferred rationale for nature conservation has been applied by others [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. A caveat with this approach is that it reduces quite broad topics in conservation into four survey items, whereas participants&#x02019; views may be more nuanced. A lack of fit between perceptions and survey items may also be relevant for other questions in this study, but to reduce this risk we have included open categories, as mentioned. We also feel that a lack of understanding should be captured by the no opinion option provided.</p><p>At the end of the survey we asked for demographics (gender, age, education) and that they report how they perceived the survey (i.e., easy &#x00026; understandable, demanding &#x00026; understandable, demanding &#x00026; difficult to understand, and an open category where they could comment more extensively).

members. The survey took place from mid-March to June 2016. All the 201 participants on the advisory councils received an e-mail with instructions and a link to access the survey online and had three weeks for completion. The survey initially included a mapping section. To reduce the effort required by the participants and to increase the response rate, we decided to send the survey a second time only with the questionnaire. Participants could request a paper copy, which we sent per mail with prepaid postage. After the second three-week deadline passed, we telephoned those who had not completed the questionnaire as a reminder and sent a text message to those that we did not reach by telephone.</p><p>An ethical review of our project was approved by the Norwegian Centre for Research Data which is the Data Protection Official for Research for all the Norwegian universities and research institutes (LINKAGE No. 39396; nsd.uib.no/). We complied with the ethical rules under the Personal Data Act. Participants had to sign a consent form to participate in the study. This form stated the purpose of the study, informed that participation was completely voluntary and that participants could withdraw from the study at any time. It also explained how the data would be stored and reported, and that participation was completely anonymous. We also provided contact details and encouraged participants to notify us or the Data Protection Official about any concerns (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215437.s016">S2 Text</xref> for the consent form (in Norwegian)).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>2.3 Statistical analyses</title><p>First, we explored survey responses by interest group, as well as overall percentages where relevant. Second, we tested, using chi-squared tests and the Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test (when cell counts were lower than 5), if perceptions (threats, priorities and trust), conservation approaches and participant demographics (age, gender and education) were related with attitudes to PA loss or degradation. Third, we assessed the interrelationship between stakeholders&#x02019; perceptions of protected area management with a Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA), which included four groups of variables; namely interest group (9 variables), management priorities (16 variables), perceived conservation threats (9 variables) and trust in management authorities (7 variables).</p><p>Multiple factor analysis (MFA) can be used with groups of variables, continuous or categorical that are collected on the same unit of analysis (e.g., individuals). The aim is to discover the main underlying structure in the data that is grouped into sets of variables [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In other words, by using MFA we could include multiple indicators/items for each of the four groups of variables (e.g., stakeholder representation, trust, perceived threats and priorities) to discover how they are interrelated. This allowed us to identify the major patterns among stakeholders with respect to who they represent, what they perceive as threats to conservation objectives, how they would prioritize management, and which protected area authority they trust the most to represent their interests.</p><p>MFA is based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA) when groups of variables are quantitative and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) when they are qualitative. To standardize the influence of each set of variables they are weighted by dividing their values by the square root of the first eigenvalue obtained in the PCA/MCA [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The results of an MFA are multiple independent factors that each explain a decreasing proportion of the total variation [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. There are several ways of selecting the number of dimensions that adequately reflects the variability in the data. We adhered to the rule of thumb that suggests selecting the dimensions with eigenvalues larger than 1 [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], which means that the dimension accounts for as much or more variance as a single variable.</p><p>The variables included in the MFA are presented in <xref rid="pone.0215437.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We made small adjustments to the survey responses for the purpose of the statistical analysis, which are described in the following. For the few participants who reported interest groups other than the ones specified, we were able to merge them with existing categories. The open category related to management actions did not reveal actions that were not captured by the specified items. Imputed values were inserted for missing observations in the threat, trust and attitude categories (either because the participant chose the &#x0201c;no opinion&#x0201d; category or they did not to respond to the question). We used the median response as the imputed value. For the threat category we imputed 51 out of 747 answers. For the trust category we imputed 25 out of 581 answers. For the attitude question we imputed 7 out of 83 answers. In an MFA, the distance from the origin reflects the contribution of the variable to the dimension, i.e. increasing distance increases the contribution. Using the median as the imputed value will accordingly have little effect on the end results. Recognizing that threat and trust are ordinal variables we treated them as continuous and not categorical in this study, which was also done by Young et al. [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], as this almost doubled the variation explained in the first two dimensions while providing approximately the same results (see supporting information for MFA output with trust and threat as categorical variables, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215437.s014">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215437.s005">S5 Table</xref>).</p><p>To interpret the resulting factor maps it is important to take into account how well the variables are represented by the MFA dimensions (cos<sup>2</sup>) and how much they contribute to the construction of the dimensions. Variables with a high cos<sup>2</sup> (where 1 is the maximum) signifies that the element is well projected on the axis and that the distances between these elements can be interpreted [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. We highlighted or plotted variables when the sum of the cos<sup>2</sup> of the first two dimensions were equal to or larger than 0.5. The contribution of variables in accounting for the variability of a dimension are expressed in percentage. If the contribution of the variables is uniform, the expected value (%) would be 1/(number of variables)*100 [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Variables with a contribution larger than this cutoff are considered important in contributing to the dimension [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. For the factor map with continuous variables we plotted all variables and highlighted those that were well represented (cos<sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; = 0.5) and had a high contribution (more than expected if the contribution of variables was uniform). For the factor maps with the categorical variables we plotted these variables and removed the others (those with a low contribution and/or cos<sup>2</sup> &#x0003c; 0.5) to aid interpretation as these figures contained many variables. The variables with the highest contribution to the first dimensions are responsible for the main variation in the dataset [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>To visualize how attitudes and conservation approaches were related to the axes, we included them as supplementary variables. Supplementary variables are projected on the axes but are not involved in the construction of the dimensions. We also tested the relationship between the resulting MFA dimensions and attitudes to PA loss or degradation and conservation approaches using ordinal and multinomial regression (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215437.s015">S1 Text</xref>).</p><p>The MFA was performed with the packages FactoMineR ver. 1.36 [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and factoextra [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and using the statistical software R [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>3.

Discussion</title><sec id="sec018"><title>4.1 Stakeholders&#x02019; perceptions &#x00026; attitudes following the reform</title><p>The community-based conservation reform seems to have had relatively little effect on one of its main goals&#x02013;increasing local support for protected areas, as local stakeholders&#x02019; attitudes towards PA loss or degradation were much more favorable than those found in general population surveys. For instance, the proportion who accepted the loss or degradation of protected areas was higher among our study participants than among European citizens surveyed in 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The survey included 25 573 respondents from various social and demographic groups in 28 European countries. Here PA loss or degradation was only acceptable to 9%, partly acceptable to 42% whereas 45% thought PA loss or degradation should be forbidden [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] (compared with this study where 31% found PA loss and degradation acceptable, 42% partly acceptable and 25% not acceptable). Similarly, Seippel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] found that 8.8% of Norwegians opposed biodiversity protection, 50% were neutral and 40.7% supportive (however the results are not directly comparable since the questions were posed differently in the two studies). We did not measure participants&#x02019; attitudes before the reform we cannot say if attitudes were less supportive than this and have improved as a result of the reform.</p><p>The perception of woodland expansion (i.e., the reforestation of cultural landscapes caused by climate change and altered land use practices) as a threat to conservation values found traction with many interest groups. This assessment was also reflected in their management priorities as many would prioritize facilitating livestock grazing and hay making. These perceptions align with the favorable attitudes towards livestock grazing among local people residing next to protected areas in Norway [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and with Norwegians&#x02019; an affinity towards cultural landscapes [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. They contrast with perceptions in other parts of the world where livestock grazing in PAs can be highly contentious due to livestock-wildlife interactions [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In Norway the loss of livestock to large carnivores (wolves, bears, lynx and wolverines) causes conflict, but this issue is decoupled from discussions about conservation policy in PAs as large carnivore conservation follows a different regulatory- and zonation scheme.</p><p>Stakeholders&#x02019; trust in the PA management authority that operated before the reform was highly polarized compared with the current conservation boards. Overall, trust in the three governance actors appointed as a result of the reform, namely conservation boards, stakeholder councils and protected area managers was relatively high. Having similar views of appropriate forums for management and dispute resolution is valuable for conflict management [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and the results suggest that PA management may be in a better position to promote collaboration after the reform.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>4.2 Lack of support &#x00026; management implications</title><p>Conservation can mean different things to different people [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. For instance, accepting PA loss and degradation for economic development does not necessarily mean that stakeholders do not support biodiversity conservation, where conservation can be broadly defined as &#x0201c;actions that are intended to establish, improve or maintain good relations with nature&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Instead, it can imply that they prefer to preserve biodiversity through other means than protected areas. For many of the property owners in this study, PA management should focus on the threat of woodland expansion and facilitate human activity to combat this development. They were less concerned with activities such as land development and motorized vehicle use. Restricting some forms of human activity (e.g., land development, motorized vehicle use, pollution) is however, central to the current conservation policy in Norwegian PAs and the efforts made by the Norwegian government to improve support for PAs through community-based conservation without changing these PA regulations seems to have had little impact.</p><p>The lack of support for PAs among stakeholders could partly be due to the participatory process, which has been awarded relatively little attention compared with the reform&#x02019;s ambitious goals of creating local ownership [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Conservation boards are, as mentioned (section 1.2), only required to have one meeting a year with the stakeholder advisory councils and some have not even met this requirement. The direct contact between stakeholders and conservation board members is modest and currently, conservation board members have a much more favorable evaluation of the functioning of stakeholder advisory councils than the stakeholders who serve on them [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. It is well known that participatory processes done as a formality without the intention of informing decision making can be counterproductive [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].</p><p>Also at the heart of conservation conflicts is the fair distribution of costs and benefits between local people whose culture and livelihoods are tied to land use restricted by PAs and people elsewhere who benefit from the fulfillment of national and global conservation objectives. Adequate economic compensation can be a part of the solutions. For instance, economic compensation for voluntary forest conservation has been supported by forest owners in Norway in later years [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], who receive a relatively good price for their land and are free to accept or reject the offer made. Economic compensation may however be rejected by local people who find other values, such as heritage, more important. Economic compensation can also crowd out intrinsic, self-sustaining motivation for environmental behavior [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].</p><p>Other studies have found a lack of support for conservation to be associated with Norwegians&#x02019; views of nature as resilient rather than fragile, a lack of trust in science, favorable attitudes towards local-decision making, dependency on natural resources, gender, age and education (women, young and educated people more in favor) [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. We confirm some of these results as large portion of property owners and livestock farmers (stakeholders that are likely to have higher resource dependency) were less supportive protection and had lower trust in higher-level environmental authorities. We did not find an effect of gender, age and education on attitudes in our study. This could be due to the relatively low sample size of our study compared with the studies cited herein that showed an effect.</p><p>If the goal is to reflect the attitudes of the general population and maintain a balanced representation of conservation and local interests on the stakeholder advisory councils, then attention to representation in PA management seems warranted. Other studies have shown how women and men use nature differently [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] and have different preferences for land management [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], suggesting that the current underrepresentation of women might have an impact on decision making. Political affiliation is also related with attitudes towards conservation [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Future studies should look at the perceptions and attitudes among the political representatives on the local conservation boards to assess potential implications of political representation vs stakeholder representation in decision-making.</p><p>Considering that a lack of resources was a key factor for poor conservation outcomes before the reform and that the initial trials of local management also showed little improvement in the local perception of conservation [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], the advice of the Environmental Agency to maintain responsibility at the regional level (County Governor), employ park managers stationed locally, establish advisory councils and increase financial and administrative resources [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] seems pertinent. On the other hand, institution building at the local level takes time [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Studies show that the local conservation boards (i.e., local and regional politicians) are good at considering local needs and adhering to conservation regulations at the same time [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, focusing on the participatory process appears to be the way forward in order to create a greater understanding and support for the current PA policy.</p><p>Recently, attention has been devoted to relational values as a new way of motivating people to engage in conservation actions [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Recent research show that relational value statements that emphasize kinship with plants and animals, stewardship and responsibility to nature as well as to other humans resonate broadly across stakeholder groups [<xref rid="pone.0215437.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. As many stakeholders in this study seemed supportive of a relational approach, exploring the potential of relational values as a point of departure for engaging the stakeholder advisory councils in PA management in the future seems like a fruitful avenue.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215437.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Overview over the number of members and the gender balance on the advisory councils.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215437.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215437.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>The representation of interest groups on the advisory councils.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215437.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215437.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Overview over participant demographics and membership characteristics.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215437.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215437.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>The quality of representation and contribution of the variables in the mixed MFA (where trust and threat variables were continuous).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215437.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215437.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>The quality of representation and contribution of the variables in the all-categorical MFA.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215437.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215437.s006"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>Participants&#x02019;
