 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Hawaii DPS of humpback whale was delisted by NMFS in 2016 based on its strong population growth and the mitigation of key threats (NMFS 2015). Whales in this population use the waters surrounding the main Hawaiian Islands for mating and calving and migrate to feeding in areas off Southeast Alaska and northern British Columbia. The size of the population in Hawaiian waters increased from 800 individuals in 1979 to more than 10,000 individuals in 2005, with the recent population growth rate estimated around 6% (NMFS 2015). ESA listing in 1970 prompted conservation measures in Hawaii and Alaska to reduce key threats to recovery. ESA regulations restricted vessels in Hawaiian and Alaskan waters from approaching whales within 100 yards, prohibited disrupting normal behaviors, and required slower vessel speeds to reduce the likelihood of ship strikes and minimize human disturbance [

ESA listing also prompted coordinated federal and state efforts to reduce whale entanglements in fishing gear through the Hawaiian Islands Disentanglement Network and Alaska Response Network. The threatened status of humpback whales also provided impetus for the designation of the 1,400 square-mile Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary in 1992 to protect humpback whales and their habitat [
