 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We collected information and population-level abundance estimates for ESA-listed marine mammal and sea turtle species from published papers and government reports. Main data sources included NMFS and USFWS technical memorandum and administrative reports, U.S. marine mammal stock assessment reports, species recovery plans, five-year status reviews, and primary sources from peer-reviewed scientific journals (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s006" href="#pone.0210164.s006">S1 Dataset</a>). When possible, we collected abundance data up to 2017 or to the most recently available population-level estimate. For populations that occur and reproduce in both U.S. and foreign waters, we used datasets from surveys that occurred in waters and nesting/foraging grounds under U.S. jurisdiction.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population abundance estimates came from a variety of survey methodologies (aerial, land, and ship-based surveys), mark-recapture population modeling, extrapolated data based on sex ratios, and photo-identification models (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s006" href="#pone.0210164.s006">S1 Dataset</a>). For marine mammals, population abundance comprised the total number of individuals including adults, juveniles, and pups or calves. For sea turtles, we used number of nests on nesting beaches, number of nesting females, or number of individuals in foraging grounds to determine population trends. The number of nesting females and number of nests are common metrics for monitoring and evaluating population status of sea turtles [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimate bias and errors in population abundance obtained from data sources were variable among populations and even within the same population over time. For example, survey effort and methodologies changed over time and population estimates have been calculated using different approaches over the years for the same population (e.g., traditional population abundance models, Bayesian population models, or habitat-based density models). Thus, when available, each data point was accompanied with information on data collection methodology, error information (e.g., coefficient of variation), and data estimation reliability (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s006" href="#pone.0210164.s006">S1 Dataset</a>). Time-series of population abundance for each species were carefully constructed to ensure all annual data points were derived from adequate and quantitative methodologies with comparable survey efforts.
