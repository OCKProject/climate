 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We reviewed the NMFS and USFWS’s endangered and threatened species database 
  <span class="italic">(Environmental Conservation Online System)</span> and selected all 62 marine mammal and sea turtle “species” currently listed or delisted under the ESA (
  <a rid="pone.0210164.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0210164.t001">Table 1</a>, and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s001" href="#pone.0210164.s001">S1 Table</a>). Under the ESA, the term “species” includes subspecies and distinct population segment (DPSs) (16 U.S.C. § 1532(16). A DPS is defined as a vertebrate fish or wildlife population or a group of populations that is discrete from other populations of the species and is considered significant in relation to the entire species [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref046">46</a>]. For example, the humpback whale (
  <span class="italic">Megaptera novaeangliae</span>) is currently divided into 14 DPSs under the ESA, of which four DPSs are listed as endangered, one DPS as threatened, and nine DPSs were recently delisted and are considered not at risk [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref047">47</a>]. For the designated DPSs of ESA-listed marine mammal and sea turtle species, see

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the potential influence of ESA conservation measures on population recovery, we selected populations of extant marine mammal and sea turtle species listed or delisted that meet five criteria: (1) from species listed before 2012 to provide a minimum timeframe of post-listing population data for conservation measures to be applied; (2) occurrence and reproduction in U.S. waters, i.e., excluding species or populations that occur and reproduce (e.g., nesting for sea turtles) in foreign waters/grounds where the ESA provides fewer protections [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref048">48</a>]; (3) with enough reliable abundance data to determine population-level trends, i.e., at least three data points within 10 years, which is generally recommended for determining population change in ESA endangered and threatened species [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref049">49</a>] and has been used for marine mammals [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref050">50</a>] and sea turtles [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref051">51</a>]; (4) with population data covering at least 40% of the ESA listing period, which we considered adequate for determining population trends after ESA listing; and (5) with populations that numerically represents over 50% of the abundance of the listed species, subspecies, DPS, or marine mammal stock and sea turtle regional management unit (RMU) within U.S. jurisdiction. For example, most green sea turtles of the North Atlantic DPS within U.S. jurisdiction nest in Florida and thus nest counts in Florida were used to represent this DPS. To delimit a population in our study after data selection, we used abundance data consistently collected over time in U.S. waters (including nesting/foraging grounds) in geographically delimited areas such as DPSs under the ESA, stocks under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and RMUs for sea turtles [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref052">52</a>] (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s003" href="#pone.0210164.s003">S1</a>–
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s005" href="#pone.0210164.s005">S3</a> Figs). As a result, population trend calculations are likely representative of the status of the listed species, subspecies, DPS, stock or RMU within U.S. jurisdiction even though these may be comprised of several populations. We identified 31 representative populations that met our selection criteria, totaling 23 and 8 populations of 14 marine mammal and 5 sea turtle species, respectively (
  <a rid="pone.0210164.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0210164.t001">Table 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s001" href="#pone.0210164.s001">S1 Table</a>). Of the 43 marine mammal and sea turtle ESA-listed species (including subspecies and DPSs) that did not meet our selection criteria, 72% do not occur or reproduce in U.S. waters. For approximate geographic distribution of each population, see

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also evaluated changes in species protection status. Species can be listed under the ESA as endangered or threatened. The ESA defines an endangered species as “in danger of extinction throughout all or significant portion of its range” while threatened species are “likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout all or significant portion of its range” (16 U.S.C. § 1532(6) and (20)). For several species, the protection status (i.e., endangered or threatened) changed since the species was first listed at the global population level, and a few species were divided into DPSs (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s001" href="#pone.0210164.s001">S1 Table</a>). For the purpose of our study, we used the most current ESA protection status but the original year that the species was protected (
