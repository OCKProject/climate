 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population abundance of the Western DPS of Steller sea lion, which ranges from Eastern Gulf of Alaska to the Western Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref118" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref118">118</a>], significantly increased over the past 13 years (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210164.g003" href="#pone.0210164.g003">Fig 3</a>). This species has shown a tremendous population recovery despite years of overexploitation (for their fur, meat, and oil), indiscriminate killing, and decades of habitat degradation, ship strikes, and fishery interactions [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref119" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref119">119</a>]. Abundance estimates of the Western DPS declined from 140,000 to 110,000 individuals between 1960 and 1979 in rookeries and haul-outs across Southwest Alaska [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref119" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref119">119</a>]. Total counts continued to decline at 15% per year in the late 1980s, prompting NMFS to list the Western DPS as threatened throughout the entire range in 1990 (NMFS 2008) and to uplist it to endangered in 1997 because of continued declines during the 1990s [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref120" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref120">120</a>]. Population abundance stabilized in the early 2000s [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref121" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref121">121</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref122" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref122">122</a>] with the lowest population estimate in 2003 [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref118" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref118">118</a>]. Notably, population abundance significantly increased at 2.34% per year from 2003 to 2015 (
  <a rid="pone.0210164.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0210164.t003">Table 3</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conservation efforts under both the ESA and the MMPA such as designation of protective zones, critical habitat designation, fishery regulations for prey species, and local regulations around major rookeries and haul-outs have likely contributed to the population recovery success [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref119" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref119">119</a>]. NMFS implemented several fishery management measures (e.g., area closures, catch and harvest limits, reduction of disturbance due to fishing) in the Alaska groundfish fisheries in 2003 (Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska) around major haul-outs and rookeries within the designated critical habitat [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref123" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref123">123</a>]. These regulations, designed to reduce competition for prey between commercial fishing and Steller sea lions and increase prey availability, are thought to have contributed to increased prey abundance and a rebound of the DPS [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref119" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref119">119</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref124" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref124">124</a>]. In fact, counts have increased at an average of 2.17% (juveniles and adults) and 1.76% (pups) per year from 2000 to 2015, although geographical variation exists due to migration among subpopulations [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref118" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref118">118</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref125" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref125">125</a>].
