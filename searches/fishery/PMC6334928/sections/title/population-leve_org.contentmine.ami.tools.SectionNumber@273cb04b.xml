 <div class="title">Population-level trajectories of sea turtles listed under the ESA.</div>
 <p>Trend lines (gray area: 95% confidence interval) are loess curves with span of 0.5 to aid in visual representation. Grey dots are estimated number of nests, except number of nesting females (green turtle, Hawaii population), and number of individuals (green turtle, Guam population). Panels are organized by decreasing length of time listed. Dashed vertical red lines indicate the year of ESA listing. For population selection criteria see
