 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess population trajectories after listing we used several types of models including linear models (
  <span class="italic">lm</span>), generalized linear models (
  <span class="italic">glm</span>), generalized least square models (
  <span class="italic">gls</span>), or generalized additive models (
  <span class="italic">gam</span>) in which population abundance estimates were modeled by running time in years (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s002" href="#pone.0210164.s002">S2 Table</a>). Because population trends were species specific, we used several family distributions and error links for each of the population-level models (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s002" href="#pone.0210164.s002">S2 Table</a>). For each population, we performed a comprehensive exploratory analysis using all model types and possible combinations of families and links with and without a log transformation of the abundance estimates. In several 
  <span class="italic">gls</span> models we added correlation and variance structures to account for potential temporal autocorrelation among years and variation in the data (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s002" href="#pone.0210164.s002">S2 Table</a>). Improvement in model fit was evaluated through theoretical model inference based on Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref055">55</a>], and comparing adjusted regression (r-squared) parameters when available [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref056">56</a>]. Final model selection was based on a multi-model inference approach using AICc corrected for small samples [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref057">57</a>]. See 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec016" href="#sec016">supporting information</a> for final model details (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210164.s002" href="#pone.0210164.s002">S2 Table</a>). All calculations and graphing were performed in R version 3.3 [
  <a rid="pone.0210164.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210164.ref058">58</a>] using the packages
