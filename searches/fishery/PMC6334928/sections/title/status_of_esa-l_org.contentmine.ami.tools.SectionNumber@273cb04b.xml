 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Protection status for 10 out of the 31 representative populations analyzed in our study changed since they were first listed, with eight of the 10 improving in status. Four ESA-listed species were downlisted by NMFS and USFWS from endangered to threatened: the Mexico DPS of humpback whale in 2016; the Florida manatee (
  <span class="italic">Trichechus manatus latirostris</span>) and the Antillean manatee (
  <span class="italic">Trichechus manatus manatus</span>) subspecies in 2017; and the North Atlantic DPS of green sea turtle in 2016 (
  <a rid="pone.0210164.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0210164.t001">Table 1</a>). Four ESA-listed species were delisted because NMFS determined they have recovered: the Eastern North Pacific stock of gray whale (
  <span class="italic">Eschrichtius robustus</span>) in 1994, two DPSs of humpback whales (Hawaii and West Indies) in 2016, and the Eastern Pacific DPS of Steller sea lion in 2013 (

  <span class="italic">Eumetopias jubatus</span>) in 1997, and the Central West Pacific DPS of green sea turtle in 2016 (
