 <div class="title">Trends and magnitude of change of selected marine mammal and sea turtle populations protected under the ESA.</div>
 <p>Population (Pop.) trends (significantly increased ↑, non–significant change →, significantly decreased ↓) are based on population-specific models and time periods are shown. Current population trends (% per year) and magnitude of population change (%) were calculated based on available data after listing. First and last population abundance estimates for the time period are shown for reference. DPS: Distinct Population Segment; NWR: National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
