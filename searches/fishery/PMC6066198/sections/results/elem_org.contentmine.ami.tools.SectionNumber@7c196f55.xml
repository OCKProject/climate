 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 163 sharks and rays were observed on the stereo-BRUVs, across 8 different species: 
  <span class="italic">Carcharhinus melanopterus</span> (n = 71), 
  <span class="italic">Triaenodon obesus</span> (n = 39), 
  <span class="italic">Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos</span> (n = 31), 
  <span class="italic">Aetobatus ocellatus</span> (n = 18) 
  <span class="italic">Negaprion acutidens</span> (n = 2), 
  <span class="italic">Taeniura lessoni</span> (n = 1), and 
  <span class="italic">Urogymnus granulatus</span> (n = 1). On average, 1.33 (SE = 0.12) reef sharks were recorded per 60 minute replicate. The largest shark observed was 
  <span class="italic">N</span>. 
  <span class="italic">acutidens</span> at 209 cm and the smallest was 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">amblyrhynchos</span> at 56.7 cm (fork lengths). The average fork length across all locations for 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">amblyrhynchos</span> was 77.2 cm (SE = 27.8), 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">melanopterus</span> 80.9 cm (SE = 12.2) and 
  <span class="italic">T</span>. 
  <span class="italic">obesus</span> 88.6 cm (SE = 16.2).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Semi-structured interview data provided additional context for the ecological surveys. Some fishers at Kolombangara and Parara said that they had seen shark fishers setting buoys in the past, and when buyers were present in Gizo they could be seen over 20 times a year. Fishers at both Vavanga and Parara noted that there had been little shark fishing activity over 2016 and 2017 because there had been no buyers of fins, though they did note there had been some fishing towards the end of 2015. On Gatokae and Vangunu, interviewees had seen shark fishermen occasionally in the past but did not think it to be a current threat. No interviewees perceived it to have been an issue over the past 3–5 years. No interviewees mentioned consumption of sharks for food, which is not surprising given that two of the communities belong to the Seventh Day Adventist church, whose teachings forbid the consumption of shark.</p>
