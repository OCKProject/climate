 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three species of reef sharks observed, 
  <span class="italic">Carcharhinus melanopterus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Triaenodon obesus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos</span>, were combined for statistical modelling as sample sizes were too small to undertake single species analysis. Rays were also removed from statistical modelling due to low numbers of individuals. To calculate prey biomass, fish families that were known to be the prey of reef sharks were extracted from the stereo-DOV data and included: Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Carangidae, Chaetodontidae, Haemulidae, Holocentridae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Monacanthidae, Mullidae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Scombridae and Zanclidae [

  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref047">47</a>]. Fishes of all sizes were included in calculations of prey biomass, as 99.5% were below 50 cm in length and therefore likely to be predated upon.
