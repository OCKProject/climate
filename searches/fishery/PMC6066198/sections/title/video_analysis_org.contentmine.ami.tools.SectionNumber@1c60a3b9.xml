 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identification and relative abundance estimates of sharks, rays and reef fish species were made by viewing video footage in the program EventMeasure (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.seagis.com.au/event.html" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.seagis.com.au/event.html</span>). A MaxN was recorded for each shark and ray species observed during each 60 min BRUV deployment and was used as a measure of relative abundance. For the DOVs, all fish species observed within the 5 x 50 m transect were counted, identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and measured. The fork length of fish and sharks was measured using stereo footage in EventMeasure and used to calculate biomass (kilograms) with length-to-weight regressions from FishBase [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref038">38</a>]. Procedures for video analysis followed Goetze et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref031">31</a>], and data were extracted from EventMeasure software and checked following Langlois et al [

  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.seagis.com.au/transect.html" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.seagis.com.au/transect.html</span>) following the method outlined in McLean et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref040">40</a>]. A 5 x 4 grid was overlaid on a high definition image for every individual BRUV deployment. The dominant habitat type and relief was characterised within each rectangle using the CATAMI classification scheme [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref041">41</a>]. Habitat was selected from the broad habitat types: hard corals, macroalgae, unconsolidated (sand/rubble), consolidated (rocky bottom) and soft corals. Grid rectangles that were oriented to open water were classified as ‘no biota’ and removed before analyses. If grid rectangles were not marked as open water, an estimate of relief was also made and categorised from 0–5 based on the scheme in Wilson et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref042">42</a>], providing the mean relief for each deployment. Data were extracted from TransectMeasure software and checked using R code available in Langlois [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref043">43</a>].
