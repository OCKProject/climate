 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Semi-structured interview data provided additional context for the ecological surveys. Some fishers at Kolombangara and Parara said that they had seen shark fishers setting buoys in the past, and when buyers were present in Gizo they could be seen over 20 times a year. Fishers at both Vavanga and Parara noted that there had been little shark fishing activity over 2016 and 2017 because there had been no buyers of fins, though they did note there had been some fishing towards the end of 2015. On Gatokae and Vangunu, interviewees had seen shark fishermen occasionally in the past but did not think it to be a current threat. No interviewees perceived it to have been an issue over the past 3â€“5 years. No interviewees mentioned consumption of sharks for food, which is not surprising given that two of the communities belong to the Seventh Day Adventist church, whose teachings forbid the consumption of shark.</p>
