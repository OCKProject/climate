 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Worldwide, many shark and ray populations are declining as a result of overexploitation by fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref003">3</a>]. Most shark species are slow growing, take several years to reach sexual maturity, and produce few young, making them highly vulnerable to overfishing [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref004">4</a>]. Globally, total shark mortality needs to be reduced in order to rebuild depleted populations [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref005">5</a>], but conservation needs vary dramatically between nations [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref006">6</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref007">7</a>]. Remote island nations face a number of challenges in addressing concerns about shark population status, including access to rigorously collected data and resources to manage fisheries. Despite this, there is a small but growing body of knowledge on the status of sharks in these areas [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref009">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishing pressure in the Solomon Islands is largely driven by population pressure and market access, which have significant impacts on targeted fish and invertebrate communities [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref011">11</a>]. Subsistence fishers in the Solomon Islands traditionally target shallow-water estuarine and reef fish, with only the occasional shark kept for local consumption or sale [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref012">12</a>]. However, sharks are directly targeted by some industrial longline vessels and caught as by-catch when targeting tuna [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref013">13</a>]. These commercial fisheries primarily target sharks for their fins as they can be dried and stored, creating a profitable fishery despite sporadic markets and infrequent opportunities for international export [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref013">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indigenous people of the Solomon Islands, like other Melanesian countries, have complex systems of customary marine tenure (CMT) under which fishing rules can be flexibly applied and adjusted to regulate access to marine resources [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref014">14</a>], though the nature of CMT systems and those involved in decision-making vary across the country [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref015">15</a>]. Since the 1990s, community-based resource management (CBRM) and community-based co-management approaches have been promoted to build on CMT arrangements to manage small-scale coral-reef fisheries, including reef sharks [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref016">16</a>]. While CBRM measures around the western Pacific have demonstrated some success in maintaining fish populations [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref017">17</a>], protection of highly vulnerable and mobile shark populations is likely to require additional top-down controls, such as no-take areas or catch bans [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref018">18</a>]. Some top down controls are being considered by the Solomon Islands Government, who have developed a draft National Plan of Action for sharks. For example, the draft plan makes recommendations for: catch restrictions where monitoring data indicate populations are threatened; and consideration of moratoria during breeding seasons or no-take areas over known breeding habitats (S. Jupiter, pers. comm.).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) offer a non-destructive alternative to fishing surveys (e.g. longlines), while providing similar estimates of shark abundance [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref019">19</a>]. The maximum number of each species seen at any one time during a video (MaxN; [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref020">20</a>]) provides a conservative estimate of abundance, though limits BRUV surveys to relative estimates rather than densities. The use of bait increases the proportion of predatory species observed [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref021">21</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref023">23</a>] and overcomes the issue of small sample sizes, often associated with the use of diver-based surveys when sampling sharks [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref024">24</a>]. BRUVs have been used to survey a wide variety of sharks, across a broad range of locations, to answer a diverse range of ecological questions [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref025">25</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref030">30</a>]. However, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the entire fish assemblage, a combination of both BRUVs and diver-based surveys is recommended, particularly for questions related to herbivorous and invertivorous fishes [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref023">23</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref031">31</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At present, very little data are available on shark populations in the Solomon Islands, and specific scientific surveys to document shark and ray diversity and distribution have not been completed [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref032">32</a>]. In support of national efforts to manage sharks, we assess the relative abundance and biomass of reef sharks across four locations in the Solomon Islands using stereo baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVs). Stereo-BRUV surveys of shark and rays have been completed across the Indo-Pacific (e.g. Fiji [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref026">26</a>], Indonesia [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref030">30</a>] and New Caledonia [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref033">33</a>]), which will allow our results to be placed into context. We aimed to provide a baseline of the relative abundance and diversity of reef sharks and rays and assess the major drivers of reef shark abundance/biomass in the Solomon Islands, including the influence of habitat type/complexity, depth, location and prey biomass (collected using diver-based surveys).
