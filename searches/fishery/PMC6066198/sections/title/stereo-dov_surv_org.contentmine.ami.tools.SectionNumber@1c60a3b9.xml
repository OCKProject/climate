 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stereo diver operated video (stereo-DOV) is more effective for sampling herbivorous and invertivore species (which make up a large proportion of reef shark diets [

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200960.g001" href="#pone.0200960.g001">Fig 1</a>). All sampling sites were randomly stratified along the barrier reef edge, targeting coral-reef habitat. At each site six 5 m by 50 m belt transects separated by 10 m were completed at depths between 8 and 12 m (to approximately match the average depth of BRUV surveys), following the methods outlined in Goetze et al. [
