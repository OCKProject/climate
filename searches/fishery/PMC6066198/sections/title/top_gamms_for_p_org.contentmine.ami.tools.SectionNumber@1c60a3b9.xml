 <p>Difference between lowest reported corrected Akaike Information Criterion (ΔAICc), AIC weights (ωAICc), variance explained (R2) and effective degrees of freedom (EDF) are reported for model comparison. Model selection was based on the most parsimonious model (fewest variables) within two units of the lowest ΔAICc as shown in bold.</p>
