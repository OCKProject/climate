 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We provide the first assessment of the relative abundance, biomass and diversity of reef sharks and rays for the Solomon Islands where this information is historically lacking [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref032">32</a>]. When compared to studies using the same methodology, our observation of 1.33 reef sharks per hour was above the average of comparable habitats in the western Indo-Pacific both inside and outside of no-take marine reserves in Fiji (Protected: 0.8, Fished: 0.3; [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref026">26</a>]) and Indonesia (Protected: 0.8/0.6, Fished: &lt;0.1; [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref030">30</a>]), and well above other areas globally where severe overfishing has occurred (i.e. the Eastern Red Sea; &lt;0.01 sharks per hour [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref029">29</a>]). However, relative abundance estimates were lower than remote areas of the Pacific, where reef sharks have not been exploited (e.g. remote areas of New Caledonia &gt;2.5 sharks per hour [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref033">33</a>] and Palmyra Atoll; 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">melanopterus</span> &gt;2 sharks per hour [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref062">62</a>]). Combined, these results suggest that reef shark populations in the Solomon Islands are relatively healthy when compared to nearby countries, yet likely to have been impacted by fishing given they are not comparable to remote areas without fishing pressure.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The diversity of reef sharks (as observed using baited video) was dominated by three species: 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">melanopterus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">T</span>. 
  <span class="italic">obesus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">amblyrhynchos</span>. These coral-reef Carcharhinidae are found commonly throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref063">63</a>], and while ongoing collapses of reef shark populations have been documented in some areas [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref064">64</a>], this varies greatly depending on the location [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref027">27</a>]. We found that location was the most important factor influencing reef sharks across the Solomon Islands, which was primarily driven by a significantly greater abundance and biomass of sharks in the more remote locations of Gatokae and Vangunu.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The biomass of reef sharks at Kolombangara was similar to Parara/Gizo, and combined with abundance results, suggests that sharks were more numerous but not larger. It is common to record different results between abundance and biomass with finfish data [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref065">65</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref067">67</a>]. Here, the increased abundance of sharks but not size within the customary managed area of Kolombangara may be due to the fact that larger sharks generally have larger home ranges [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref068">68</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref070">70</a>]. This would increase the time spent in areas where sharks are more easily targeted, making these larger sharks more vulnerable to fishing mortality when compared to smaller sharks with a higher site-residency [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref071">71</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have shown that prey biomass [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref026">26</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref072">72</a>] and coral-reef health [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref027">27</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref073">73</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref074">74</a>] are important drivers for the abundance of reef sharks. These factors were not the primary drivers for reef shark abundance or biomass observed in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands, and instead location was the most important factor. It is likely that the difference in locations was primarily driven by proximity to increased fishing pressure around the Gizo area, however further work is needed to confirm this. Studies in the Caribbean have shown that fishing pressure can be a more important driver of reef shark abundance when compared to environmental factors [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref025">25</a>]. While we would expect both prey density and habitat to have an impact on shark populations in the Solomon Islands, it is likely that fishing pressure is having a greater effect and a relatively healthy coral-reef environment throughout the Western Province has contributed to this result. We also acknowledge that we have only used finfish density as a proxy for reef shark prey, and while benthic fishes make up the largest proportion of their diet [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref046">46</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref047">47</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref075">75</a>], a recent review suggests that reef sharks also consume a large proportion of cephalopods and crustaceans [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref035">35</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref072">72</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a number of physical and structural differences that vary across regions [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref076">76</a>] that may have explained additional variation in reef shark abundance and biomass. For example, studies have shown that temperature [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref077">77</a>], productivity [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref008">8</a>], wave energy and broad-scale structural complexity [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref078">78</a>] can all impact on the distribution of reef sharks and fish. These factors were not examined here as detailed information was not available (i.e. fine scale bathymetry) or they were expected to vary across the different species of sharks that were grouped together (e.g. broad-scale habitat preferences for 
  <span class="italic">T</span>. 
  <span class="italic">obesus</span> vs. 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">amblyrhynchos</span>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shark fishing for fins has a long history in Western Province [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref013">13</a>], and at certain times is likely to have occurred around all sites covered by this survey. Small-scale, inshore shark fishing operations are permitted under Solomon Island laws, while commercial offshore operations are banned. However, shark fin buyers do occasionally operate in Gizo and the capital Honiara. The sites off Kolombangara, Parara and Gizo islands are close to potential buyers in Gizo (between 5 and 25 km) and fishers on Parara and Gatokae islands have reported sporadic, small-scale longline operations targeting mainly grey reef sharks close to the reef edge.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of sharks in the CPUE and interview data across all survey locations suggests local fishers preferentially target shallow-water estuarine and reef fish, and keep only the occasional shark for local consumption or sale [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref012">12</a>]. It is possible that this is a driver of the relatively healthy population of reef sharks observed in these surveys. The low level of exploitation for reef sharks across our sites may also be due to the cultural importance of sharks in parts of the Solomon Islands, where they are sometimes regarded as embodiments of gods, guardians and protectors [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref032">32</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref079">79</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref080">80</a>]. However, more recently the traditional symbolism and values that were associated with sharks and rays has begun to lose its significance and international markets for shark meat and fins are believed to occur in small-scale fisheries throughout the Solomon Islands [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref032">32</a>]. In terms of the potentially greater abundance of sharks in Kolombangara, it is notable that the Gizo and Parara sites are close to large populations of non-indigenous fishers who are known to target sharks. This is further supported by the fact that the reefs in Kolombangara are directly adjacent to communities and are therefore more actively and easily policed. It is possible that fishing pressure from non-local fishers is impacting on shark abundance at some of these sites, though further targeted research is needed to assess this.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We provide the first assessment of reef sharks and rays across the Western Province of the Solomon Islands using stereo-BRUVs. While reef shark abundance and biomass were relatively high when compared to neighbouring countries in the Indo-Pacific (although below those of remote areas), a significantly lower abundance of reef sharks at sites around Parara and Gizo indicate that fishing pressure may be impacting on populations in these areas. A broader scale study across a larger range of locations and habitats (i.e. lagoons and mangroves) would provide important information to assist in the conservation and management of sharks and rays across the Solomon Islands. Sampling effort in this study was limited to a snapshot of the relative abundance and biomass of sharks and rays, however, these levels are unlikely to vary significantly across seasons due to the high site fidelity of reef sharks [
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref077">77</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref081">81</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0200960.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0200960.ref082">82</a>]. Our results provide a baseline that suggests reef shark population in the Solomon Islands are still relatively unexploited, providing an opportunity for improved conservation and fisheries management to protect existent populations.
