These villages only represent a subset of the population of fishers that may target sharks in our survey areas and there are additional villages, as well as non-indigenous fishers, who are known to target sharks, which were not captured by this sample.

The community researchers weighed and measured all fish and invertebrates brought back to the village, and noted details of the catch (time spent fishing, location, method). We also conducted semi-structured interviews with five expert fishers at each site in March 2017, to provide context for the shark survey data.
