At present, very little data are available on shark populations in the Solomon Islands and scientific surveys to document shark and ray diversity and distribution have not been completed. We aimed to provide a baseline of the relative abundance and diversity of reef sharks and rays and assess the major drivers of reef shark abundance/biomass in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands using stereo baited remote underwater video. On average reef sharks were more abundant than in surrounding countries such as Fiji and Indonesia, yet below that of remote islands without historical fishing pressure, suggesting populations are relatively healthy but not pristine. We also assessed the influence of location, habitat type/complexity, depth and prey biomass on reef shark abundance and biomass. Location was the most important factor driving reef shark abundance and biomass with two times the abundance and a 43% greater biomass of reef sharks in the more remote locations, suggesting fishing may be impacting sharks in some areas. Our results give a much needed baseline and suggest that reef shark populations are still relatively unexploited, providing an opportunity for improved management of sharks and rays in the Solomon Islands.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000870</institution-id><institution>John D. and Catherine T.

Most shark species are slow growing, take several years to reach sexual maturity, and produce few young, making them highly vulnerable to overfishing [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Globally, total shark mortality needs to be reduced in order to rebuild depleted populations [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but conservation needs vary dramatically between nations [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Remote island nations face a number of challenges in addressing concerns about shark population status, including access to rigorously collected data and resources to manage fisheries. Despite this, there is a small but growing body of knowledge on the status of sharks in these areas [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Fishing pressure in the Solomon Islands is largely driven by population pressure and market access, which have significant impacts on targeted fish and invertebrate communities [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Subsistence fishers in the Solomon Islands traditionally target shallow-water estuarine and reef fish, with only the occasional shark kept for local consumption or sale [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, sharks are directly targeted by some industrial longline vessels and caught as by-catch when targeting tuna [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These commercial fisheries primarily target sharks for their fins as they can be dried and stored, creating a profitable fishery despite sporadic markets and infrequent opportunities for international export [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The indigenous people of the Solomon Islands, like other Melanesian countries, have complex systems of customary marine tenure (CMT) under which fishing rules can be flexibly applied and adjusted to regulate access to marine resources [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], though the nature of CMT systems and those involved in decision-making vary across the country [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since the 1990s, community-based resource management (CBRM) and community-based co-management approaches have been promoted to build on CMT arrangements to manage small-scale coral-reef fisheries, including reef sharks [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While CBRM measures around the western Pacific have demonstrated some success in maintaining fish populations [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], protection of highly vulnerable and mobile shark populations is likely to require additional top-down controls, such as no-take areas or catch bans [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Some top down controls are being considered by the Solomon Islands Government, who have developed a draft National Plan of Action for sharks. For example, the draft plan makes recommendations for: catch restrictions where monitoring data indicate populations are threatened; and consideration of moratoria during breeding seasons or no-take areas over known breeding habitats (S. Jupiter, pers. comm.).</p><p>Baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) offer a non-destructive alternative to fishing surveys (e.g. longlines), while providing similar estimates of shark abundance [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The maximum number of each species seen at any one time during a video (MaxN; [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) provides a conservative estimate of abundance, though limits BRUV surveys to relative estimates rather than densities. The use of bait increases the proportion of predatory species observed [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and overcomes the issue of small sample sizes, often associated with the use of diver-based surveys when sampling sharks [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. BRUVs have been used to survey a wide variety of sharks, across a broad range of locations, to answer a diverse range of ecological questions [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the entire fish assemblage, a combination of both BRUVs and diver-based surveys is recommended, particularly for questions related to herbivorous and invertivorous fishes [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>At present, very little data are available on shark populations in the Solomon Islands, and specific scientific surveys to document shark and ray diversity and distribution have not been completed [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In support of national efforts to manage sharks, we assess the relative abundance and biomass of reef sharks across four locations in the Solomon Islands using stereo baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVs). Stereo-BRUV surveys of shark and rays have been completed across the Indo-Pacific (e.g. Fiji [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], Indonesia [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and New Caledonia [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), which will allow our results to be placed into context. We aimed to provide a baseline of the relative abundance and diversity of reef sharks and rays and assess the major drivers of reef shark abundance/biomass in the Solomon Islands, including the influence of habitat type/complexity, depth, location and prey biomass (collected using diver-based surveys).</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p>Sampling occurred between October 17&#x02014;November 1, 2015, in four main locations: western Kolombangara Island (<italic>Kolombangara)</italic>, north-western Parara and Gizo islands (<italic>Parara/Gizo</italic>), southern Vangunu Island (<italic>Vangunu</italic>), and eastern Gatokae and adjacent smaller islands (<italic>Gatokae</italic>) in the Western Province, Solomon Islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200960.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The sites encompass a range of geographic and ecological features. Kolombangara, Gatokae and Vangunu are high, steep volcanic islands with major river systems and associated sediment outflow. The southwestern reefs adjacent to Kolombangara have a narrow fringe and steep drop-offs. Most of the sites sampled around Parara and Gizo islands are sheltered from large wave exposure, with the exception of the five sites on the western barrier reef off Parara Island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200960.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Sites surveyed off Vangunu were along a submerged barrier reef with a crest at ~12 m. Sites surveyed off Gatokae were moderately protected from wave exposure by a headland, while additional sites were sampled on the protected leeward side of smaller, adjacent islands (Kicha, Malimali, Mbulo). The reef surveyed at Kicha has been informally protected from fishing since 2010, although only two deployments were completed here so protection status was not factored into the analysis.</p><fig id="pone.0200960.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0200960.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Map of survey locations across the Western Province of the Solomon Islands.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0200960.g001"/></fig><p>While the particulars of social context vary, all of the sites are held under CMT by associated tribal groups, and usage rights are broadly dispersed across tribe members. Usage rights for subsistence and artisanal fisheries are broadly open access, while large-scale commercial operations (e.g., bait fishing operations during the late 1990s; c.f., [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) are negotiated at the tribal level. Several communities adjacent to the survey sites belong to the Seventh Day Adventist church, meaning there are edicts against the harvesting and consumption of shark, while others have customary links to sharks and do not harvest for those reasons. Because of the physical location of the communities (adjacent to the reefs), it is likely that those on Kolombangara are better able to monitor and restrict access to reefs when compared to Parara and Gizo.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Sampling techniques and video analysis</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Stereo-BRUV surveys</title><p>We used stereo-BRUVs to quantify reef shark abundance, biomass and habitat at the four locations across the Western Province of the Solomon Islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200960.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

At each location, sampling sites were randomly stratified along the barrier reef edge, with five stereo-BRUVs haphazardly deployed on coral-reef habitat at random depths between 10 and 25 m. The location of each BRUV replicate was not randomly assigned due to a lack of prior knowledge (i.e. bathymetry) for the locations surveyed. Adjacent deployments were separated by a minimum of 500 m to reduce the likelihood of sharks moving between replicates. Systems were left to film for 60 minutes, with bait consisting of 1 kg of skipjack tuna (<italic>Katsuwonus pelamis</italic>) in a plastic-coated wire mesh basket that was suspended 1.2 m in front of the two cameras. The tuna was chopped into small pieces to promote dispersal of the bait plume. For details and design of stereo-BRUV systems, see Harvey and Shortis [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A total of 108 hr of stereo-BRUV footage was collected across the Western Province, with 28 hr in Parara/Gizo, 24 hr in Kolombangara, 30 hr in Vangunu and 36 hr in Gatokae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200960.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Stereo-DOV surveys</title><p>Stereo diver operated video (stereo-DOV) is more effective for sampling herbivorous and invertivore species (which make up a large proportion of reef shark diets [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) when compared to BRUVs, so were used to survey reef fish and provide an estimate of prey density across the same locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200960.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

To accommodate for over-dispersion and correlation in the data, we extended the application of this class of models by including sites as a random effect [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Model selection was based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC; [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]) and AIC weights (wAIC; [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). A full subsets method was used to fit models of all possible combinations up to a maximum of three variables to prevent overfitting. Models containing variables with correlations &#x0003e;0.28 were excluded from the analysis to eliminate strong collinearity in line with recommendations from Graham [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]; this can cause problems with over-fitting and make interpretation of statistical results difficult.

The wAIC, which represents probabilities or weights of evidence for each model, was used to facilitate interpretation of the best models.

A Tweedie model is an extension of compound Poisson model derived from the stochastic process where a gamma distribution is used for the counted or measured objects (i.e., number or mass of fish) and has an advantage over delta-type two-step models by handling the zero data in a unified way.

When compared to studies using the same methodology, our observation of 1.33 reef sharks per hour was above the average of comparable habitats in the western Indo-Pacific both inside and outside of no-take marine reserves in Fiji (Protected: 0.8, Fished: 0.3; [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) and Indonesia (Protected: 0.8/0.6, Fished: &#x0003c;0.1; [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]), and well above other areas globally where severe overfishing has occurred (i.e. the Eastern Red Sea; &#x0003c;0.01 sharks per hour [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). However, relative abundance estimates were lower than remote areas of the Pacific, where reef sharks have not been exploited (e.g. remote areas of New Caledonia &#x0003e;2.5 sharks per hour [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Palmyra Atoll; <italic>C</italic>. <italic>melanopterus</italic> &#x0003e;2 sharks per hour [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]). Combined, these results suggest that reef shark populations in the Solomon Islands are relatively healthy when compared to nearby countries, yet likely to have been impacted by fishing given they are not comparable to remote areas without fishing pressure.</p><p>The diversity of reef sharks (as observed using baited video) was dominated by three species: <italic>C</italic>. <italic>melanopterus</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>obesus</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>amblyrhynchos</italic>. These coral-reef Carcharhinidae are found commonly throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and while ongoing collapses of reef shark populations have been documented in some areas [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], this varies greatly depending on the location [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

These factors were not the primary drivers for reef shark abundance or biomass observed in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands, and instead location was the most important factor. It is likely that the difference in locations was primarily driven by proximity to increased fishing pressure around the Gizo area, however further work is needed to confirm this.

These factors were not examined here as detailed information was not available (i.e. fine scale bathymetry) or they were expected to vary across the different species of sharks that were grouped together (e.g. broad-scale habitat preferences for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>obesus</italic> vs. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>amblyrhynchos</italic>).</p><p>Shark fishing for fins has a long history in Western Province [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and at certain times is likely to have occurred around all sites covered by this survey. Small-scale, inshore shark fishing operations are permitted under Solomon Island laws, while commercial offshore operations are banned. However, shark fin buyers do occasionally operate in Gizo and the capital Honiara. The sites off Kolombangara, Parara and Gizo islands are close to potential buyers in Gizo (between 5 and 25 km) and fishers on Parara and Gatokae islands have reported sporadic, small-scale longline operations targeting mainly grey reef sharks close to the reef edge.</p><p>The lack of sharks in the CPUE and interview data across all survey locations suggests local fishers preferentially target shallow-water estuarine and reef fish, and keep only the occasional shark for local consumption or sale [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is possible that this is a driver of the relatively healthy population of reef sharks observed in these surveys. The low level of exploitation for reef sharks across our sites may also be due to the cultural importance of sharks in parts of the Solomon Islands, where they are sometimes regarded as embodiments of gods, guardians and protectors [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. However, more recently the traditional symbolism and values that were associated with sharks and rays has begun to lose its significance and international markets for shark meat and fins are believed to occur in small-scale fisheries throughout the Solomon Islands [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In terms of the potentially greater abundance of sharks in Kolombangara, it is notable that the Gizo and Parara sites are close to large populations of non-indigenous fishers who are known to target sharks. This is further supported by the fact that the reefs in Kolombangara are directly adjacent to communities and are therefore more actively and easily policed. It is possible that fishing pressure from non-local fishers is impacting on shark abundance at some of these sites, though further targeted research is needed to assess this.</p><p>We provide the first assessment of reef sharks and rays across the Western Province of the Solomon Islands using stereo-BRUVs. While reef shark abundance and biomass were relatively high when compared to neighbouring countries in the Indo-Pacific (although below those of remote areas), a significantly lower abundance of reef sharks at sites around Parara and Gizo indicate that fishing pressure may be impacting on populations in these areas. A broader scale study across a larger range of locations and habitats (i.e. lagoons and mangroves) would provide important information to assist in the conservation and management of sharks and rays across the Solomon Islands. Sampling effort in this study was limited to a snapshot of the relative abundance and biomass of sharks and rays, however, these levels are unlikely to vary significantly across seasons due to the high site fidelity of reef sharks [<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200960.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Our results provide a baseline that suggests reef shark population in the Solomon Islands are still relatively unexploited, providing an opportunity for improved conservation and fisheries management to protect existent populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200960.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Questions asked during semi-structured interviews.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200960.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200960.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Raw data from BRUV and DOV surveys.</title><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200960.s002.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>These surveys were conducted in the customary waters of tribes on Kolombangara, Parara, Gatokae and Vangunu islands.
