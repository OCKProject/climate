 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All data were transcribed and examined using thematic analysis [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref074">74</a>]. Data were initially coded to characterize key elements of Shawi food security following the theoretical framework to explain food security under environmental changes. We then posteriorly characterized themes related to climate change vulnerability dimensions at the community level. 
  <span class="italic">Exposure</span> characterized climatic risk to the food system (proxied here by weather and seasonality), 
  <span class="italic">sensitivity</span> included social, environmental and economic drivers, and 
  <span class="italic">adaptive capacity</span> considered individual, collective or external coping and response efforts. Initial themes from this framework were critically analyzed using an inductive pathway approach [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref058">58</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref060">60</a>] to identify key adaptive trajectories that potentially threaten short and long term adaptive capacity of Shawi households and communities. We then used narrative analysis for interpretation and presentation of the data [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref075">75</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref076">76</a>]. Narratives were contrasted with main themes identified in early stages to localize speakers’ information within the vulnerability framework. Narrative analysis allowed us to separate the researchers’ definition on the duality of 
  <span class="italic">food security-food insecurity</span> from Shawi cultural definitions and perspective[
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref077">77</a>]. Narrative analysis also enhanced the process of language transcription from Shawi–Spanish-English by offering opportunities to re-evaluate and re-visit what participants 
  <span class="italic">actually</span> intended to communicate[
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref075">75</a>]. We additionally drew on information from relevant literature about Shawi (primarily in Spanish) to validate, triangulate, and/or complement results.
