 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">External sources of food comprised a variety of food types sourced outside of household or community production, typically received through external governmental aid or to a lesser extent through purchase.

  <span class="italic">Juntos</span> conditional cash transfer program, the

  <span class="italic">regatones</span> generally sold salty fish. One of our study communities had a small local store, and we observed eggs (not locally produced), canned tuna, cookies, rice, sugar, candies, beer and cigarettes were for sale. One key informant explained that neither cassava nor plantain was sold in the local store because “
