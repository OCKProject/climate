 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is affecting food systems globally, with implications for food security, nutrition and the health of human populations[

  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref002">2</a>]. Despite a growing body of research characterizing climatic impacts on food systems, research has predominantly focused on the macro level (global or regional) and climate impacts on agriculture [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref001">1</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref006">6</a>]. Less is known about how human populations react to climatic impacts on food security at the local level, and how climate and weather interact with other drivers of health [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref010">10</a>]. The ways in which climate change risks impact food security and human nutrition are mediated by local food systems [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref012">12</a>], and these interactions will differ across contexts and are localized in nature, providing an important entry point for informing adaptation options and responses [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref013">13</a>]. Moreover, investigating in food security and food systems at a local level can aid in identifying (mal)adaptation trajectories that might endanger the long-term capacity of people to cope with and respond to climate change impacts[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indigenous peoples are particularly sensitive to climate impacts on food systems [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref016">16</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref018">18</a>]. Emerging research has documented the experiences of Indigenous peoples and their food systems in the context of climate variability and extreme events, highlighting the importance of concurrent cultural, social, and economic conditions that can undermine or support food security [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref019">19</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref021">21</a>]. Despite a growth in such research, however, the majority of studies have been conducted among Indigenous populations in high income countries [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref021">21</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref022">22</a>]. Research among Indigenous Amazonian peoples is nascent and has been identified as an important research gap- a research gap that will be particular important to fill in order to inform health-related climate change policies and climate-related health policy [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref021">21</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changing climatic conditions have already been reported in Amazonia, affecting the food security of local populations, however, consequences for Indigenous food systems are still largely unknown. Warming temperatures have been documented, with an average increase of 0.34C per decade recorded since 1980 [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref024">24</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref025">25</a>], along with more frequent and intense hydrological events [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref026">26</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref028">28</a>]. In the Peruvian Amazon, increasing temperatures and more severe prolonged seasonal flooding and droughts are affecting agriculture and fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref029">29</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref031">31</a>]. For Peruvian Indigenous Amazonian populations, however, initial research suggests that non-climatic drivers such as economic disadvantages and cultural marginalization are acting to magnify climatic impacts on food security [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref020">20</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref032">32</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref033">33</a>]. Given that some Indigenous Amazonian populations have consistently worse nutritional outcomes compared to non-Indigenous populations in the region [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref034">34</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref036">36</a>], climate change impacts on local food systems threaten to exacerbate health disparities. Yet this are of research is only nascent, and our understanding of how Indigenous Amazonian food systems interact with climatic and non-climatic changes to affect food security, nutrition, and ultimately human health is limited.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We contribute to filling this research gap by characterizing the complex food system, including the interacting climatic and non-climatic determinants of food security, and identify potential maladaptation trajectories within one Peruvian Indigenous Amazonian population. In doing so, we seek to promote consideration of long -term local food system adaptation of food systems in a changing climate.</p>
