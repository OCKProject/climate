 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants reported facing several years of food insecurity characterized by a decreasing availability of wild animal food sources. Food insecurity was attributed to a combination of socio- and environmental factors affecting local food systems, namely: a rapidly expanding population, changing settlement patterns, and natural resource degradation affecting river shorelines and wildlife.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Younger key informants noted that they did not remember a time when game and fish were abundant. Older adults and elders consistently reported a marked decrease in game and fish, noting that these changes have occurred over the past 20–30 years. For example, one adult woman reflected:</p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>When I was a child, I remember my parents had enough game. I saw it. Even when I was an adolescent I had food, but when I got married and my oldest child was born [24 years ago], I noticed the difference. Sometimes you find food [game], others times you don’t</p>
  <p>(AA016 female, 44 years old).</p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key informants and photovoice participants consistently reported that the population and number of new Shawi communities is increasing, with implications for availability and access to wild animal food sources:</p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>When I was a child, there was animal food every day. Although, we had some [meat] at least until I was fifteen years old. Then more people started to appear and they eat the animals</p>
  <p>(AA014, male, 34 years old).</p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elders, in particular, agreed that an increasing local population was associated with decreasing animal food sources. They also attributed animal food availability in the forest to a shifting settlement pattern—from more dispersed to more centralized—with higher densities of people competing for access to animal sources of food. A perception of disrespect of Shawi norms was reported by Elders when discussing the expanding population. One Elder key informant explained:</p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>Only my family used to live in this zone, we had to walk far to find another house. This is the reason that we used to have a lot of bushmeat. Before, nobody crossed your path. If a person crossed your path, it means that you did not deserve respect and were a source of conflict. It was like a rule. These days, [rules] have disappeared; there are no rules. Everyone walks the same path that you are walking</p>
  <p>(AA011, male 70 years old).</p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, more people were carving out new plots, in many cases via deforestation along the river shore. Deforestation and erosion of river edges has been associated with changing river structure (wider and shallower), and have been leading to new habitats that are not suitable for larger fish. In response to difficulty catching fish, participants reported that there was increased use of poisoned fishing techniques that involve 
  <span class="italic">barbasco</span> (e.g. rotenone poison based) which were exacerbating damage to the river ecosystem. As presented in 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0205714.t002">Table 2</a>, 
  <span class="italic">barbasco</span> utilization was typically intended to promote collective fishing activities and at certain time of the year when fish were more abundant. Key informants reported concerns that overutilization of poisonous plants might further diminish the availability of remaining wild river resources.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local authorities concurred with these trends during results dissemination meetings, noting that food security in communities was affected by an increasing population reflected in the creation of new villages. In addition, authorities explained that accessing cash income to pay for school was a key driver of deforestation, with implications for natural resource degradation. Despite this, education was widely perceived as an important option for livelihoods diversification and food security in the future.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shawi youth participants in the photovoice exercise were also aware of the very low food security that their households were experiencing. They referred to the impact that more people might have on the availability and access of wild food sources in the future. Shawi youth expressed a desire to have fewer children than their parents (1–2 vs 4–5 children). They specifically asserted that they wanted to “
  <span class="italic">feed their children better</span>”. During the photovoice workshop one youth expressed:
 </p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>
   <span class="italic">In the future</span>, 
   <span class="italic">there will not be bushmeat</span>, 
   <span class="italic">we probably will handle more money</span>. 
   <span class="italic">We are going to be fine</span>. 
   <span class="italic">We are going to have fewer children</span>, 
   <span class="italic">in that way we will be able to feed them better [a piece of game or fish for each kid]</span>. 
   <span class="italic">We will keep our crops like cassava and plantain</span>, 
   <span class="italic">of course if we plant and take care of them</span>.
