 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We worked with Shawi communities located along a river in the Balsapuerto district. To respect the confidentiality of respondents, and to prevent the possibility of reverse identification of individuals, we do not specify the name of the river or specific location of study communities. This paper reflects the results of qualitative research in two of the 18 communities along a river in this area (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Communities were selected after extensive consultation with Indigenous representatives at national and local levels, all of whom partnered with the researchers to develop an international research program, the Indigenous Health and Adaptation to Climate Change (IHACC) project. The two communities in the qualitative study were partner with based on their location between the most easily accessible (1hr road to the closest urban place) and the most distant community (2.0 hr road plus 6 hr on foot to the closest urban place) to reflect a diversity of access experiences in the region. Participants within communities were selected according to the location of their household to reflect a range of geographical access to the center of the community, where main educational and health services (if any) were located.</p>
