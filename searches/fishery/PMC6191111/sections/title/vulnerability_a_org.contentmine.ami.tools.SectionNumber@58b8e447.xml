 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We structure our research using a ‘vulnerability approach’, which is common in the natural hazards and human dimensions of climate change scholarship [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref046">46</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref048">48</a>]. This approach focuses on how various climatic and non-climatic factors interact to affect how people experience and respond to climatic risks and change, specifically drawing upon “contextual vulnerability” research that directs attention to the properties of the system and not climatic conditions 
  <span class="italic">per se</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref049">49</a>]. Various disciplines have contributed to the evolution of vulnerability research, and this approach has been used by public health researchers to investigate climate-sensitive health outcomes, to prioritize vulnerable populations, and to evaluate adaptation options [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref050">50</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref051">51</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vulnerability can be defined as “the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected” by the occurrence of climate change impacts[
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref052">52</a>], and comprises three main dimensions: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref053">53</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref054">54</a>]. Exposure captures the nature of the climatic risk affecting the system of interest, in this case the Shawi food system. Sensitivity encompasses the characteristics of the food system that mediate climatic effects (currently or potentially), and reflect non-climatic drivers of food security. Non-climatic drivers are understood as key physical and social determinants such as socioeconomic conditions and existing health inequities [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref010">10</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref055">55</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref056">56</a>]. Adaptive capacity represents the ability, resources, behaviours, or any other function of the food system that helps people respond to exposures and minimize impacts. In this sense, adaptive capacity is also an important 
  <span class="italic">space</span> where non-climatic determinants interact with climatic risks face-to-face to offer opportunities for adaptation or which might result in maladaptive pathways [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref057">57</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref058">58</a>]. Maladaptive pathways refer to processes or conditions that exacerbate the sensitivity of human populations (e.g. social exclusion) or reduces options (e.g. erosion of knowledge about environmental risks) to respond to future climatic events. In other words, ‘maladaptive pathways’ represent changes or trajectories that are neither social nor environmental sustainable[
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref059">59</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref060">60</a>]. The analysis of adaptive pathways, for example allows the identification of coping strategies to climatic or non-climatic stress that does not necessarily lead to sustainable long-term adaptations, which is crucial for populations that currently experience poor food security and social inequalities[
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref059">59</a>]. Adaptive capacity, exposure, and sensitivity are not mutually exclusive but are interconnected and interact across different spatial and temporal scales. The vulnerability approach recognizes the importance of sensitivity in driving the vulnerability of populations to climate change, thus highlighting the importance of non-climatic factors. For example, communities will be affected differently by identical flooding events (exposure) depending on the socio-economic conditions of each community and their support networks, the availability of backup support for resources, social conditions and a range of other non-climatic factors (sensitivity and adaptive capacity).
