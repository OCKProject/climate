 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maladaptive pathways emerged when Shawi social responses interacted with Peruvian socioeconomic policies. For example, Peruvian social and food policies could have unintentional consequences for Shawi food security and could potentially will increase the susceptibility of Shawi to climate change through the erosion of Shawi social cohesion and collective institutions. Similar work in Brazil, for instance, illustrated that even tough anti-poverty social programs that increased cash incomes did not lead to a significant increase of the adaptive capacity to respond to climatic risk, mainly because those programs did not address the multiple non-climatic drivers of long term social vulnerability [

  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref085">85</a>]. Additionally, Peruvian policies were reinforcing a proximal educational driver was is associated with the expectation of increasing incomes and diversifying livelihoods. Educational desire has emerged as a key proximal driver of vulnerability of Shawi food security. Education did not necessarily lead to job opportunities and yet is having a substantial impact on food insecurity. The sacrifices made for educational opportunities—prioritizing expenditure on education over food, facilitating deforestation to access cash, adjusting settlement patterns to be closer to schools, reducing access to wild foods, supplementing with non-Shawi food sources, and resulting in a loss of Indigenous knowledge among youth—have to-date shown little benefit in the form of increased job opportunities or improved food security for Shawi.

  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref087">87</a>], requires further investigation in the context of Indigenous Amazonian peoples. Access to formal education could serve to build social capacity (e.g. better health and poverty reduction) to respond to and recover from to any future climatic risk. Education can also increase the awareness about risk perceptions and can improve the ability to take actions when facing a disaster [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref087">87</a>]. Working with a population of low income settlements in El Salvador and Brazil, researchers found that the level of formal education affected the likelihood of living in a risky area and that those with more education identified greater options for recovery after a hazardous climatic event [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref088">88</a>]. This same investigation also found that education worked as a mechanism for recovery only where formal employment was available [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref088">88</a>]. This suggests that improving access to education in and of itself will not guarantee that communities will be more prepared to respond to climatic risks. For example, one study identified literacy as a key ability to access information and aid from governmental initiatives [
  <a rid="pone.0205714.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205714.ref089">89</a>]. For the Shawi, this would translate into the causal expectation that education would improve their Spanish and thus facilitate better access to governmental aid. However, this assumes that the benefits of education will outweigh any potential losses in local and Indigenous knowledge about preparedness and response to risk. Educational opportunities are likely critical for future generations of Shawi but should be developed in a way that does not erode existing coping mechanisms for food security and does not compromise food sources, for example culturally and nutritionally important food types [
