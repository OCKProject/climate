 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For Shawi participants, annual climate variability reflected in seasonal precipitation was critical to developing local food sub-system activities on the farm and in the forest. Even though they did not report on direct effects on the external food sub-system, precipitation was highlighted as having implications for attending school, which was a pre-condition to receive governmental aid. As climatic variability and change reflect long-term averages of meteorological variability, Shawi observations reflected weather and environmental changes that occurred locally and on shorter time scales, and that were, to varying degrees, affected by longer-term climate change.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Annual variability of precipitation was important for crop food production and affected forest food accessibility. The dry/summer season lasted from about May to September, while the wet/winter season lasted from October to April. Key informants explained that the dry (summer) season—when rainfall decreased—was a more productive time for crop cultivation. During the dry season, community members typically engaged in cleaning, burning and planting crops. Key informants explained that some rain was necessary to soften the soil to plan cocoa trees and palms species so that they will produce fruit in the winter months. Rice, maize, plantain and several fruit trees, however, required extended periods free of rain to allow for clear cutting and burning of vegetation for effective sowing of crops. In addition, during the dry season when water recedes and water bodies were shallower, it was reported that fish are easier to harvest. Walking on forest paths to travel distances and hunt wild animals was also easier during the dry season. In contrast, during the heavy rainy season (winter), crop production was poor, access to game and fish sources from the forest was difficult and fulfilling food aid eligibility requirements was often challenging (e.g. school attendance during heavy rains, transportation on muddy paths and crossed streams).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shawi participants have noticed warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation and reported concern regarding the potential effects on their farming sub-food system. Adult women in the photovoice sessions explained that when the rainy season comes early, they were unable to effectively clear and prepare the land for planting their main staple crops, cassava and plantain. Women used fire to burn their fields in preparation for planting; early or extended rains during the dry season interfered with this local crop preparation activity. Our results are consistent with reports from Shawi communities elsewhere, with observations of changing and increasingly unpredictable weather affecting land preparation, burning, and crop production[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Shawi reported knowledge regarding water river variability and what do to in response to flash flooding events that regularly affected their communities. Key informants reported that the local river experienced sudden level changes, with flash flooding typically occurring at some point in the beginning and at the end of the wet season, between September-October and March-April respectively. They described water increases that rapidly lead to water overflow, with flooding typically lasting a few minutes to a maximum of one hour, and reaching only few centimeters high, thus affecting low lands and some parts of the center of the community. Elder participants mentioned that they did not deforest, crop, or build their homes on these low lands or close to the edges of the river to prevent risk of flooding.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elders clarified that flooding was “
  <span class="italic">serious</span>” when the water covers fields (e.g. plantain, cassava, peanut, or maize); this level of flooding had the potential to damage crops and/or housing, as well as injure or kill domestic animals. The elders recalled the flood of 1995 as one of the most severe flood events in the last decade. In addition, key informants also reported that living and cropping in higher lands was seen as a better place for secure cultivation and safety during flood events. One female elder recalled what she and her family did during the 1995 flood:
 </p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>The water was up to our knees. Because it was during the daylight, we could run to the highest part of the community, carrying our possessions such as cloths and domestic animals. We did not lose anything important, only used mocahuas and callanas [clay locally made vessels], and our house was moved by the water flow only a bit</p>
  <p>(AA013, female).</p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another key informant reported that her family did not lose anything important during the 1995 flood. The water reached her house but did not affect her crops because her family always farmed on high ground. One younger participant declared that the 1995 flood reached his house while his parents were in the forest. He had to travel by canoe to cross the river and to reach the highest part of the community for safety.</p>
