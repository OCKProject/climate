 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The BOATS model represents the first-order features of global fish biomass and economic harvest using fundamental concepts of macroecology, life-history, and resource economics in a unified spatially-resolved framework. The economic module of BOATS is directly coupled to the biophysical model by means of the fishing effort, which responds dynamically to net profits at the grid scale. Given the complex nature of real-world ecosystems and of the social and economic processes that determine fishing effort and harvest, the ability of BOATS to explain a significant amount of the global spatial variability in harvest is promising, and makes it suitable for exploratory global studies of fisheries dynamics that include both human and environmental forcings.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A distinctive feature of this work is the use of a Monte Carlo approach to parse the uncertainty in the model parameters and to determine which parameter sets generate the best representations of present-day harvest from the Sea Around Us Project database. We find that although most parameter combinations among the probability distributions of our priors are unable to produce the observed fish harvest, the central values of the distributions are associated with a global harvest that is reasonably close to observations. By discarding unacceptable parameter combinations using a series of catch and biomass criteria, we arrive at an optimal ensemble of about 100 parameter combinations that perform well, while still retaining a substantial degree of parameter uncertainty. These optimal parameter combinations tend to include rates of natural mortality among the lower range of the sampling distribution, a result that deserves further attention given that natural mortality rates are difficult to constrain from observations. We also find that the temperature dependence of mortality is most often greater than the temperature dependence of fish growth, which has important implications in a warming ocean. Realistic global harvests can be achieved by parameter combinations that result in different biomass distributions, and range from solutions dominated by slowly-growing abundant biomass in high latitudes and coastal regions, to solutions dominated by fast-growing low biomasses in low-latitudes and open-ocean waters. These remaining uncertainties allow a potential range of responses of the global fishery to human and climate-driven perturbations, which could be further narrowed down by considering improved biomass-based observational constraints.</p>
