 <div class="title">Steady state biomass (A) and harvest (B) size spectra.</div>
 <p>Black solid, dashed, and dot-dashed curves represent unharvested small, medium, and large groups, respectively, whereas grey curves represent harvested spectra. Thick curves represent total biomass and harvest spectra. Curves are equilibrium solutions of simulations for a site in the East Bering Sea LME (64°N, 165°W) forced with annual average net primary production and temperature using a timestep of 15 days.</p>
