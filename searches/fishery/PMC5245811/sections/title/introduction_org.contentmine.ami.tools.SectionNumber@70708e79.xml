 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global oceanic wild fish harvest grew at a tremendous rate over the 20th century, increasing by approximately a factor of four between 1950 and 1990 [

  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref010">10</a>]. Meanwhile, rapid and ongoing changes in fishing technology [
  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref011">11</a>], the demand for fish products [
  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref012">12</a>], and regulation frameworks are driving changes in the distribution and intensity of fishing effort. Given future projections of increasing human population, and consequent pressure on food resources, it is critical to develop improved predictive understanding of how fisheries will evolve with interacting environmental and human drivers.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerical models of fishery-human interactions that can be coupled to representations of the environment, often called end-to-end models, have been extremely helpful to shed light on these issues [
  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref013">13</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref014">14</a>]. However, most of these models are designed primarily in order to study internal ecosystem dynamics, and often include complex parameterizations that are challenging to quantify, such as feeding relationships [
  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref015">15</a>]. In addition, most of these models are designed to represent the present-day community in a specific region, and therefore lack the generality and flexibility required to represent long-term structural changes such as those caused by new invasive species, climate-driven range shifts [
  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref007">7</a>], or fishing-driven evolution [
  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref016">16</a>]. The incomplete view provided by a patchwork of regional models also hampers studies of global food security, given the development of globally interwoven fishing fleets and fish-trading since the 1950’s.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alternative ecological models that are structurally simpler, founded on macroecological principles, and appropriate for a global range of conditions, have recently begun to allow the direct prediction of fish biomass from environmental variables [
  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref023">23</a>]. However, most of these models were designed to study fish, rather than fishing. As a result, fish harvests are generally prescribed in these models, rather than treating the fishing effort as an interactive component, which limits the consideration of economic factors such as changes in fishing technology, market conditions, and regulatory regimes. Furthermore, an extensive exploration of parameter uncertainty is challenging for most of these models due to complexity and/or computational cost, and the simulated fish species may not be equivalent to those harvested, making direct comparisons with observed historical harvest records difficult.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here we describe the economic component and general characteristics of the BiOeconomic mArine Trophic Size-spectrum model (BOATS), a computationally-efficient model which directly couples a size spectrum model of fish biomass with an interactive economic model on a spatially-resolved global grid. The ecological model, which is described in detail in [
  <a rid="pone.0169763.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0169763.ref024">24</a>], focuses on a small number of robust bioenergetic principles of marine ecosystems that are of direct relevance for fisheries and environmental change, predicting the growth of all commercially-harvested marine consumers, which we refer to as ‘fish’. The simulated fish spectrum is coupled directly to a prognostic model of fishing effort, at the same grid scale, that evolves over time in response to the local bioeconomically-determined profit. Because BOATS was designed to include only fundamental processes and relatively few parameters, parameter uncertainty can be addressed in a robust and comprehensive way by using a Monte Carlo approach. As discussed below, this allows us to select global parameter combinations that agree with observations at the scale of the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs), rather than being locally-tuned. We show that, after optimization, the ensemble has a high degree of skill, making it suitable for studies of first-order interactions between climate, the marine ecosystem and humans. We also point out the most important implications of the remaining parameter uncertainty.
