  <div class="title">SAUP reconstructed harvest as described by primary production, modelled unharvested biomass, and modelled harvest at the LME scale.</div>
  <p>Correlations are for the model variant from the Monte Carlo simulation that best represents the SAUP database. The circle color represents the average temperature of the LME, whereas the number represents the LME number (
