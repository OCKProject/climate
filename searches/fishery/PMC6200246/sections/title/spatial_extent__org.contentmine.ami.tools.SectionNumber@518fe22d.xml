  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g002" href="#pone.0205505.g002">Fig 2</a>) was adapted from the boundary of DFO’s Maritimes Region, one of DFO’s six administrative regions across Canada. This area encompasses the entire Scotian Shelf and is delimited by the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone in the south, the Canadian Maritime Boundary to the west in the Gulf of Maine, and DFO’s Newfoundland and Labrador Region’s Placentia Bay–Grand Bank Large Ocean Management Area (LOMA) in the east. The boundary was clipped to the 2000 m isobath, as the deepest known record of
