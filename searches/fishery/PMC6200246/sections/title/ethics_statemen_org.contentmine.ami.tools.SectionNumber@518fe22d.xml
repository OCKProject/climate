  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> collected by other research programs or data sources. From those studies, data collected using optical techniques were non-destructive, while data collected by commercial and research trawls involved bringing the sponges on deck where they would have been exposed to air and died. Generally dead sponges collected in the trawls were returned to the sea near the point of sampling. Samples collected by others during the research vessel multispecies surveys conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada were done so with authorization to engage in fishing and related activities on the Atlantic coast of Canada subject to the provisions of the Fisheries Act and Regulations bestowed by the Regional Director of Science, Science Branch, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Maritimes Region, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada.
