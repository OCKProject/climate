 <p>Observ. = Observations; Sensit. = Sensitivity, Specif. = Specificity. AUC represents an average across all 10 model folds, while the confusion matrix, class error, sensitivity and specificity result from a summation of the predicted outcomes in the 2 x 2 confusion matrix generated for each of the 10 model folds. Prevalence (0.07) was used as the probability threshold.</p>
