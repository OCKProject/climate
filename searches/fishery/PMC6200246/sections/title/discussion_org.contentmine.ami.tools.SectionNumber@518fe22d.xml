  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> in Emerald Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada. The 
  <span class="italic">Vazella</span> sponge grounds in Emerald Basin are globally unique for this species, which to date has not been reported to form large aggregations in other areas of its distribution, and are also unique for the northwest Atlantic where ostur-type sponges are typically the dominant sponge-ground type [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In response to the growing concern over the conservation status of deep-water sponges and the impact of anthropogenic activities such as bottom fishing to these communities [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref001">1</a>], several studies have used species distribution modelling to predict the distribution of deep-water sponges and identify the environmental conditions responsible for their formation and persistence at both regional (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref077">77</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref095">95</a>]) and basin-wide (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref064">64</a>]) scales. In our study, predicted probability of occurrence of 
  <span class="italic">V</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> was highest in Emerald Basin in waters shallower than 200 m depth, with a significant concentration located to the west of ‘The Patch’. A second notable concentration was predicted on the eastern flank of Sambro Bank. Although a threshold delimiting significant concentrations of 
  <span class="italic">V</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> from its broader distribution from presence probability outputs remains undefined, the two DFO Sponge Conservation Areas almost fully encompass these concentrations, where presence probability was predicted at 90% and higher (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g004" href="#pone.0205505.g004">Fig 4</a>). However, the significant concentrations of this species as indicated by kernel density analysis using biomass catch data remain largely unprotected (~3% protected; [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref043">43</a>]), as do the areas of potential suitable habitat (less than 1% protected) in the core of this species’ predicted distribution (i.e., the Scotian Gulf, Fundian/Northeast Channels and Gulf of Maine (minus areas of model extrapolation), an area equal to ~29,523 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>; see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g005" href="#pone.0205505.g005">Fig 5</a>). Although our model indicated higher probability of occurrence in areas with higher bottom fishing effort, this variable was the least important variable in the model, and examination of its spatial distribution showed few instances of highly localized zones of high effort overlapping with the sponges. The inability of this variable to split the presence and absence data (the determinant of its importance in the model) was reflected by the nearly equal mean fishing effort at the location of presence and absence points (5.08 ± 16.77 and 5.19 ± 16.90 hours, respectively). The low importance of fishing effort in determining the distribution of 
  <span class="italic">V</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> does not necessarily indicate that sponge grounds outside the conservation areas are not subjected to significant adverse impacts by trawling. Freese and colleagues [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref096">96</a>] found that just a single trawl pass through sponge biogenic habitat resulted in an average reduction in sponge densities of 45% compared to untrawled sponge habitat. Future modelling applications examining the cumulative impacts of trawling on the biomass or abundance of 
  <span class="italic">V</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> might provide further insight into the effects of bottom-tending gear on this species.

  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref098" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref098">98</a>] and areas of turbulent mixing at the interface between water masses [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref030">30</a>]. Two research groups [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref097" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref097">97</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref099" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref099">99</a>] suggested that the predicting factor of their distribution was an increased supply of food and resuspension of organic material caused by the breaking of these waves and turbulent mixing, consistent with the prominence of primary production variables in our predictive model. In contrast, aggregations of the glass sponge 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">carpenteri</span> in the northeast Atlantic occur within a relatively narrow environmental niche [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref100" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref100">100</a>] and are thought to be associated with areas not directly impacted by enhanced currents, but downstream of them where organic particulate carbon is transported via downslope currents [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">carpenteri</span>, the 
  <span class="italic">Vazella</span> sponge grounds in Emerald Basin occur in areas of low topographic relief, and are strongly linked to areas of warm (&gt; 5°C) and saline (&gt;34) bottom water (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g007" href="#pone.0205505.g007">7</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g008" href="#pone.0205505.g008">8</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g009" href="#pone.0205505.g009">9</a>). This water mass, identified as Warm Slope Water, originates from the Gulf Stream and represents the dominant flow feature in Emerald Basin. This water mass is characterized by low oxygen (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g009" href="#pone.0205505.g009">Fig 9</a>) and high nutrient concentrations directly above the sponge grounds compared to the overlying water (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g010" href="#pone.0205505.g010">Fig 10</a>). Examination of the long-term trends in bottom temperature and salinity (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g011" href="#pone.0205505.g011">11</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g012" href="#pone.0205505.g012">12</a>) dating back to 1870 indicated historically high inter-annual variability in the water mass characteristics of Emerald Basin. This variability occurs over multi-decadal timescales and is thought to be associated with a larger than average transport by the Labrador Current off Nova Scotia, which replaces Warm Slope Water with cold, fresh Labrador Slope Water leading to decreased temperatures and salinities within Emerald Basin [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref051">51</a>]. One of the first cold periods in the basin on record occurred in the mid-1960’s when bottom temperatures cooled to between 3 and 4.5°C (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g011" href="#pone.0205505.g011">Fig 11</a>; [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref051">51</a>]). Thirty years later, colder temperatures in the basin in 1997 also corresponded to a significant change in offshore slope waters likely caused by a southward flux of the Labrador Current [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref101" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref101">101</a>]. This multi-decadal variability is consistent with the influence of the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation, or AMO, a mode of natural variability occurring in the North Atlantic with a period of 60 to 80 years [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref102" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref102">102</a>]. Overall cooling in sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic from the late 1950’s to the early 1970’s, and overall warming from the 1980’s to the early 2000’s has been attributed to the AMO. The AMO is related to and interacts with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which is considered one of the most prominent circulation systems in the Atlantic Ocean and is responsible for heat transport from the South and North Atlantic to the subpolar and polar North Atlantic. Acceleration and deceleration of the AMOC generates a positive (warm) and negative (cold) phase of the AMO, respectively [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref103" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref103">103</a>]. Recent data suggests that the AMO is currently transitioning to a negative (cold) phase [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref104" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref104">104</a>]. Such variability indicates that caution should be taken when using species distribution models for long-lived species to define niche requirements under current climatic conditions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that the population of 
  <span class="italic">V</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> was first documented in Emerald Basin in 1889 [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref034">34</a>], we show that this species has persisted in the face of this climatic variability. While the exact temperature and salinity tolerance limits of 
  <span class="italic">V</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> remain unknown, these results may give insight into how this species will respond to future climate change. In tropical climates, rapid changes in water temperature have shown deleterious effects on the physiology of shallow-water sponges, affecting both their filtration rates and feeding behaviour, as well as their associated microbial component [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref105" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref105">105</a>], which can comprise between 40 and 60% of the total tissue volume of some species [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref106" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref106">106</a>]. Similarly, in deep-sea environments, Johnson and colleagues [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref107" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref107">107</a>] showed that sponge-dominated vulnerable marine ecosystems in North Atlantic areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) are expected to show deleterious responses to climate change pressures such as increasing temperature. Species distribution models can give useful insight into the potential effects of climate change through the prediction of species’ range expansion or contraction in different climate scenarios, even when the physiological requirements of a species are unknown [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref108" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref108">108</a>]. Such a process was not undertaken in the current study due to the unavailability of spatially-resolved data for the northwest Atlantic for future climate scenarios. We recommend this as future work in order to understand the impacts of climate change on this species and to develop appropriate measures for its continued conservation.
