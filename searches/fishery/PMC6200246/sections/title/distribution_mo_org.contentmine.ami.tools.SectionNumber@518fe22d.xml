 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As supporting research for a recent re-evaluation of the location of significant benthic areas of cold-water corals and sponges in Atlantic Canada and the Eastern Canadian Arctic (see [

  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref047">47</a>] employed random forest modelling to predict the distribution of corals and sponges across DFO’s Maritimes Region administrative boundary. That work documented exploratory methods, including modelling with balanced and unbalanced response classes, biomass regressions and generalized additive models. Predictive maps were developed for

  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref052">52</a>]. However, the relationship between these patterns and the distribution of the 
  <span class="italic">Vazella</span> sponge grounds has never been ascertained. We interpret the results of random forest modelling in light of the hydrographic conditions that govern Emerald Basin and the Scotian Shelf in order to make meaningful conclusions on the environmental conditions associated with these unique sponge grounds. We further examine historical oceanographic conditions to deduce any temporal patterns in the water masses surrounding this presumably long-lived species.
