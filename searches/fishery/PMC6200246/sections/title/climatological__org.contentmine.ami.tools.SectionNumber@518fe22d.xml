 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Long-term trends in bottom temperature and salinity in Emerald Basin were examined from two different sources: observational data from CTDs and ARGO floats collected in Emerald Basin between 1950 and 2015, and the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) version 2.2.4 reanalysis model. The goal of SODA is to reconstruct the historical physical history of the global ocean through the optimization of model physics, forcing, and available ocean data observations. Gridded monthly data were extracted from SODA for the time period 1871 to 2010 from a bounding box with a longitude of -63.5W, -63W by latitude of 43.5N, 44.0N. As the first record of

  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref034">34</a>], this timeframe can be used to describe the variability in conditions experienced by the 
  <span class="italic">V</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> population on the Scotian Shelf. Trends in temperature and salinity from SODA were displayed by season (winter: Jan. to Mar., spring: Apr. to June, summer: July to Sept., fall: Oct. to Dec.) and as annual averages.
