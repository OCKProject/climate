 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fine-scale hydrographic and biochemical conditions directly over the 
  <span class="italic">Vazella</span> sponge grounds were examined from four CTD profiles made on July 20, 2016 as part of a DFO science mission to characterize the environmental characteristics of these sponge grounds (see [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref089">89</a>]). Four continuous, full-depth profiles of temperature, salinity, fluorescence, density, and oxygen were made using a CTD and rosette with 24 10-L sampling bottles to collect water samples for the analysis following standard procedures [
  <a rid="pone.0205505.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0205505.ref090">90</a>] of silicate, nitrate, and phosphate through the water column to 10 m above the seabed. Note that nutrient data was only acquired for three of the four casts. CTD casts were made in the northeast corner of DFOâ€™s Emerald Basin
