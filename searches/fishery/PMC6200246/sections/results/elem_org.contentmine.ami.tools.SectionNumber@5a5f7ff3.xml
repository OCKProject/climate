  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> indicated that this species aggregates on the flanks of the two deep-water basins that comprise Emerald Basin, with the densest concentration located between the main and northern basins and to the west of the area known to fisherman as ‘The Patch’ (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g003" href="#pone.0205505.g003">Fig 3</a>). This concentration is mostly captured by DFO’s Emerald Basin

  <span class="italic">Vazella</span> Conservation Area. 
  <span class="italic">V</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> was found in lower concentrations along the saddle between Emerald and LaHave Banks in the Scotian Gulf, and in the Northeast and Fundian Channels leading to the Gulf of Maine. 
  <span class="italic">V</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pourtalesi</span> was generally absent from the shelf, Bay of Fundy, and in off-shelf waters to ~1850 m depth. The overall depth range of presence observations was 87 to 498 m (based on Canadian Hydrographic Service Atlantic Bathymetry Compilation, 500-m bathymetry). The deepest records were found along the shelf break at the mouth of the Scotian Gulf and in the Northeast Channel. The shallowest record of this species was from Misaine Bank at 87 m depth. While some records are associated with high-slope areas (11° in the Northeast Channel), the densest sponge grounds occurred in areas of low topographic relief (0.04 to 3.20° in Emerald Basin).

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g003" href="#pone.0205505.g003">Fig 3</a>). Generally, the surrounding shelf was predicted with either zero or low probability of occurrence. Smaller patches of high presence probability were found on the saddle between Emerald and LaHave Banks, and in the Northeast and Fundian Channels where sparse presence data are distributed. The shelf break to 2000 m in the western portion of the study area was predicted with moderate presence probability; however this area is considered extrapolated (i.e., outside the environmental envelope used to train the model) and thus the predictions here should be discounted (

Bottom Temperature Minimum was followed more distantly in terms of the mean decrease in Gini index by Summer Primary Production Maximum (i.e., the maximum bottom temperature per year at each location, averaged over the time series) and Surface Temperature Range (where range equals the difference between maximum and minimum values per year, averaged over the time series; a measure of variability). Generally, variables related to primary production held a high importance in the model. Bottom fishing effort was the least important variable in the model.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examination of both historical observational and modelled temperature and salinity data from the SODA model in Emerald Basin indicated that this area has experienced high inter-annual variability in these water mass characteristics. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g011" href="#pone.0205505.g011">Fig 11</a> shows the near-bottom temperature and salinity from CTD casts and ARGO float data collected between 1950 and 2015 from Emerald Basin. The temperatures experienced over this time period ranged from 4°C in the mid 1960’s to upwards of 12°C. A second cold period was experienced in the late 1990's. Salinity also followed the same pattern, with fresher waters associated with the cold water mass experienced in the mid 1960’s and late 1990’s. The cooler/fresher waters were observed at the start of the time series with a general increasing trend in temperature/salinity to present day. The longer time series of temperature and salinity generated by the SODA model (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g012" href="#pone.0205505.g012">Fig 12</a>) also showed strong inter-annual variability in the water masses in Emerald Basin. The cold/fresh water mass of the 1960’s as shown in the observational data was reproduced here, and a second cold period in the 1920’s was also indicated. Limited seasonality in near-bottom temperature and salinity was also shown.
