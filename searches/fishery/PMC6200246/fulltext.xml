In 2009, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) implemented two Sponge Conservation Areas to protect these sponge grounds from bottom fishing activities. Together, the two conservation areas encompass 259 km<sup>2</sup>. In order to ascertain the degree to which the sponge grounds remain unprotected, we modelled the presence probability and predicted range distribution of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> on the Scotian Shelf using random forest modelling on presence-absence records. With a high degree of accuracy the random forest model predicted the highest probability of occurrence of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> in the inner basins on the central Scotian Shelf, with lower probabilities at the shelf break and in the Fundian and Northeast Channels. Bottom temperature was the most important determinant of its distribution in the model. Although the two DFO Sponge Conservation Areas protect some of the more significant concentrations of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic>, much of its predicted distribution remains unprotected (over 99%). Examination of the hydrographic conditions in Emerald Basin revealed that the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> sponge grounds are associated with a warmer and more saline water mass compared to the surrounding shelf. Reconstruction of historical bottom temperature and salinity in Emerald Basin revealed strong multi-decadal variability, with average bottom temperatures varying by 8&#x000b0;C. We show that this species has persisted in the face of this climatic variability, possibly indicating how it will respond to future climate change.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000041</institution-id><institution>Fisheries and Oceans Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Program for Ecosystem-based Research and Advice (SPERA)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9983-8732</contrib-id><name><surname>Beazley</surname><given-names>Lindsay I.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>H2020 EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Project SponGES</institution></funding-source><award-id>679849</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rapp</surname><given-names>Hans Tore</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded through Fisheries and Oceans Canada&#x02019;s (DFO) Strategic Program for Ecosystem-Based Research and Advice (SPERA) project &#x0201c;Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Two Sponge Conservation Areas in the Maritimes Region: Identifying Patterns of Dispersal, Connectivity, and Recovery Potential of the Russian Hat Sponge Vazella pourtalesi&#x0201d; led by L.I.B. and the H2020 EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Project SponGES (Deep-sea Sponge Grounds Ecosystems of the North Atlantic: an integrated approach towards their preservation and sustainable exploitation) (Grant Agreement no. 679849).

According to the World Porifera Database there are over 600 hexactinellid species globally, of which roughly 70 occur in the North Atlantic [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Glass sponges are distributed along a large depth gradient, but are most abundant and diverse in the bathyal zone, i.e., at depths of 200&#x02013;3000 m [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. They are usually sparsely distributed on various types of substrate. However, in some areas a few species form dense populations, either monospecifically or as part of a more diverse, multispecies community. Examples in the North Atlantic include the monospecific grounds of <italic>Pheronema carpenteri</italic> in the northeast Atlantic between 650&#x02013;2000 m depth (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]); <italic>Poliopogon amadou</italic> on the Great Meteor seamount at 2700 m depth [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; <italic>Nodastrella asconemaoida</italic> on the bathyal coral reefs of Rockall Bank at 580 m depth [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; and the species <italic>Asconema foliata</italic> and <italic>Schaudinnia rosea</italic> found in the multispecific tetractinellid sponge grounds on the Flemish Cap and Grand Banks [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in the Denmark Strait [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and along the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>A lesser known dense population of glass sponges is formed by the rosellid <italic>Vazella pourtalesi</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] on the Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia, Canada (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g001">Fig 1</xref>). <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> was originally described by Schmidt [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] as <italic>Holtenia pourtalesii</italic> from material collected in the Florida Keys between 282 and 583 m depth. The same author described a second species (<italic>H</italic>. <italic>saccus</italic>) for the same area, but re-examination of the type material of both species provided evidence of their conspecific status [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A few years after the first description of this species was made, Honeyman [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] described the collection of a hexactinellid sponge in the late 1880&#x02019;s from the Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia, Canada that resembled a &#x0201c;Cap of Liberty&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;brought up from a depth of 80 fathoms, at a distance of 40 miles south of Sambro&#x0201d;. The collection was regarded as unique at the time. Over a century later in 2001, the specimen was identified as <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> by glass sponge taxonomist H.M. Reiswig [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], who reinstated the genus in his 1996 revision [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The occurrence of a dense aggregation of these sponges on the Scotian Shelf (referred to as the &#x02018;<italic>Vazella</italic> sponge grounds&#x02019; herein) was noted in the late 1990&#x02019;s during interviews with local fishermen that were conducted to ascertain the types of fish and invertebrates found on the seabed off Nova Scotia [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Fisherman described these sponges as &#x0201c;Russian Hats&#x0201d; that filled the nets when fishing for pollock and redfish [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In 2001, the first <italic>in situ</italic> video footage of the <italic>Vazella</italic> sponge grounds in Emerald Basin was collected. The densities observed on the seabed (up to 16 individuals per m<sup>2</sup>), its relatively shallow depth distribution (75&#x02013;275 m), and its large size (up to 110 cm in height) relative to previously examined specimens (up to 9.2 cm in height; [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) rendered this aggregation globally unique. Aside from the specimens collected off Florida, to date <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> has only been reported from one other location, the Azores, where a single specimen was collected amongst several specimens of <italic>Pheronema carpenteri</italic> at 845 m depth [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0205505.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0205505.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Glass sponge <italic>Vazella pourtalesi</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in Emerald Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada.</title><p>Image is a framegrab from video collected using the ROV ROPOS in 2017.

As a result, high bycatch of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic>, with records upwards of 9000 kg, has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) took the first step towards elevating the conservation status of the population of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> in 2004, when an area commonly referred to as &#x02018;The Patch&#x02019; by local fisherman was recognized as an ecologically significant area. This recognition was based on the rarity/uniqueness of the <italic>Vazella</italic> sponge grounds present in the area and their fragility/sensitivity to fishing impacts [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Information from fishermen, bycatch records from commercial fisheries, and <italic>in situ</italic> scientific observations were used to delineate hotspots of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> in The Patch and nearby areas in Emerald Basin and Sambro Bank [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This ecologically significant area was later modified in its extent to encompass a larger portion of Emerald Basin and was formally identified as an Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA) by DFO in 2006 [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Under the directive of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 61/105, this species also received status as a vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) indicator in 2008 by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO; [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]).</p><p>In 2009, DFO introduced the Policy for Managing the Impacts of Fishing on Sensitive Benthic Areas (SBA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/benthi-eng.htm">http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/benthi-eng.htm</ext-link>) as part of the Sustainable Fisheries Framework policy suite, aimed at achieving a more ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. The SBA Policy was created for the purpose of aiding DFO in &#x0201c;managing fisheries to mitigate impacts of fishing on sensitive benthic areas or avoid impacts of fishing that are likely to cause serious or irreversible harm to sensitive marine habitat, communities and species&#x0201d;, and is the main tool used by DFO to mirror in domestic waters its commitment under the UNGA 61/105 to identify and protect vulnerable marine ecosystems on the high seas from bottom-contact fishing. To assist with the identification and mapping of SBAs, DFO held a national advisory process (NAP) that included both scientists and stakeholders on the &#x02018;Occurrence, Susceptibility to Fishing, and Ecological Function of Corals, Sponges, and Hydrothermal Vents in Canadian Waters&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The uniqueness of the <italic>Vazella</italic> sponge grounds on the Scotian Shelf, the biogenic habitat it forms, and its fragility and risk of serious or irreversible harm from fishing qualified it for protection under the SBA Policy, and as a result, the habitat occupied by <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> emerged during the 2010 NAP as a clear conservation priority for the Department. Through kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis of research vessel trawl catch this habitat was determined to occupy an area of ~8,000 km<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This approach does not take into account environmental variables and is based solely on the co-location of catches with high sponge weights, and the transition between the area occupied by those catches and those surrounding catches outside of the sponge grounds (see [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] for description). Following the NAP, the Groundfish Enterprise Allocation Council (GEAC) implemented a voluntary closure to protect the sponges from mobile gear (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/publications/cs-ce/page09-eng.html">http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/publications/cs-ce/page09-eng.html</ext-link>).

The inner shelf is dominated by outflow from the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Labrador Current through Cabot Strait, which bifurcates to feed the Nova Scotia Current that moves westward along the inner shelf and a shelf-edge flow that moves along the western side of the Laurentian Channel and outer shelf [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. On the outer shelf the Labrador Current has a more direct influence through flow across the Laurentian Channel from the southern Newfoundland Shelf. Offshore, warm North Atlantic Central Water sits below the cold shelf-edge flow and the warm and cold water masses variously mix to create a region of slope water with identifiable Labrador Slope Water (4&#x02013;9&#x000b0;C) and Warm Slope Water (9&#x02013;12&#x000b0;C) signatures [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This warm slope water moves onshore to fill the inner basins of the Scotian Shelf and the Gulf of Maine in the west. Intermittent incursions of Warm Slope Water through the Scotian Gulf result in relatively warm waters in the basins year round compared to the surrounding shelf, with temperatures typically in the range of ~8&#x02013;10&#x000b0;C below ~100 m depth. The Warm Slope Water entering the basins is not only typically warmer and more saline, but similar to areas of upwelling at the shelf-break front it is also nutrient-rich relative to shelf water [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>Emerald and LaHave Basins are also under the intermittent influence of two cold-water currents. The Nova Scotia Current is centred at about 150 m depth and flows over the northern part of Emerald Basin and bends southward to fill LaHave Basin. In addition, an onshore meander of the shelf-edge current flows northward over Western and Emerald Bank to join a weak anti-cyclonic gyre that flows around the inner-shelf basins [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Additionally, Emerald Basin is subjected to high tidal variability and mixing compared to other areas on the shelf [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The possible influence of this tidal mixing on the retention of particles and food in the basins has not been fully described. Azetsu-Scott and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] described the presence of intermittent, intermediate nepheloid layers (i.e. layers of water that contains high amounts of suspended sediment) 10&#x02013;30 m thick between 140 and 210 m depth in the main basin of Emerald Basin, approximately 90 m above the sea bed. Such nepheloid layers are often caused by biological patchiness in the water column, intrusion of turbid water, turbulence caused by bottom current stress, and/or by internal waves [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Azetsu-Scott and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] suggested that these intermediate layers were caused by resuspension of particles by internal tides along the saddle between Emerald and LaHave Banks, and further transport by variable flows and the mean circulation of the Scotian Gulf. Resuspension by intrusion of slope water was thought to be important during the winter months when strong eastward winds and upwelling events cause strong, onshore flow and significant flushing of Emerald Basin [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This flushing is the likely cause of the disproportionate amount of the organic matter derived from marine, versus terrestrial sources, in Emerald Basin compared to other areas of the shelf [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>The surficial geology and sediment stratigraphy of Emerald Basin and the Scotian Shelf has been well described based on acoustic techniques and bottom samples [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], from which broad-scale categorical maps have been generated [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].

The DFO multispecies trawl survey is stratified random (by depth) and conducted using primarily Western IIA trawl gear. The average distance of these tows is ~ 3.17 km. Absence records were created from null (zero) catches that occurred in the same surveys. Commercial bycatch data between 1997 to 2007 from the Fisheries Observer Program was further post-processed and validated for accuracy (see [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] for more details), while the data from 2010 to 2015 was extracted directly from the Maritimes Fishery Science Database managed by DFO. Commercial trawls are much longer in duration and may follow bottom contours and/or retrace their footprint through the course of a 10+ km tow.

A 1 x 1 km grid matching that of the environmental data was placed over the study area and the presence-absence data were reduced to one record per cell, with a presence taking precedence over an absence if both occurred in the same cell. This gave a total of 215 presences (102 from the DFO trawl surveys, 47 from DFO benthic science surveys, and 66 from the FOP) and 2867 absences for the model.</p><p>The inclusion of response data with different rates of detection or "catchability", spatial bias, and spatial resolution may introduce bias in species distribution models. For instance, the optical surveys used in this study were targeted towards areas of interest (i.e., areas of known sponge distribution), have a high rate of detection, low spatial coverage and high resolution, compared to the RV trawl survey and commercial bycatch data which aggregate the catch across larger areas (i.e., ~3 km and ~10+ km, respectively). Use of null data from the research vessel survey only will introduce another form of bias in terms of false negatives due to poor catchability, but as the absence data dominate the records and are generated from a random stratified survey, we consider any such biases to be negligible compared to those of the presence data. Ideally, models would be conducted with a single data type with random stratification across the study area (i.e. in this instance, using only those records from the RV trawl surveys). Given the scarcity of presences in the trawl survey data and differing spatial coverage from the optical surveys and commercial data, we chose to accept the biases incurred from combining all three datasets. We note however that the resulting predictive surfaces may be driven by such biases, particularly towards areas of aggregation of the optical survey and commercial bycatch data, which are not accompanied by absences records. Similarly, we caution against over-interpreting the boundaries of suitable and unsuitable habitat predicted by the model as a result of this spatial bias.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study utilized data on the invertebrate sponge <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> collected by other research programs or data sources.

forest classification [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] was used to predict the probability of occurrence and range distribution of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> based on the 215 presence and 2867 absence records and 35 predictor variables as described above (<xref rid="pone.0205505.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Random forest is a non-parametric machine learning technique where multiple trees are built using random subsets of the response data. Each tree is fit to a bootstrap sample of these data, and the best predictor at each node is that which splits the response data so that maximum homogeneity is reached in the child nodes. Models were fitted using the &#x02018;randomForest&#x02019; package [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] in the statistical computing software program R version 3.3.1 [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Default values were used for RF parameters, and the default 500 trees were constructed.</p><p>Model performance was assessed in R using 10-fold cross validation. In this process the response data are split into 10 folds of equal size, and a model is trained on a combination of 9 folds and validated on the remaining fold. The process is repeated 10 times, giving 10 repetitions for which accuracy measures are derived. Sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of accurately predicted presences) and specificity (the proportion of accurately predicted absences) were derived by summing the predicted outcomes across the 2 x 2 confusion matrices generated for each of the 10 model folds. Low sensitivity represents high omission error (i.e., false negative rate), while low specificity indicates high commission error (i.e., false positive rate). The response dataset for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> is characterized by a higher number of absences relative to presences (i.e., unbalanced species prevalence, where prevalence is the proportion of presences in relation to the total dataset). Classification accuracy in random forest is prone to bias when the categorical response variable is highly imbalanced [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. This is due to over-representation of the majority class in the bootstrap sample leading to a higher frequency in which the majority class is drawn, therefore skewing predictions in that favour [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Given the highly imbalanced nature of the response dataset, a threshold defining above which a class probability is considered a presence is often used to convert the class probabilities into predicted outcomes that are then summarized in the 2 x 2 confusion matrix. We used prevalence, or the probability of presences in the training dataset, as the threshold defining when a species is considered present [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The discrimination capacity of the training model was determined by calculating the average Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, or AUC, across all 10 model folds. The AUC is considered threshold-independent and is calculated from a combination of the true positive rate and false positive rate (1-specificity). AUC equals the probability that the model will rank a randomly-chosen presence instance higher than a randomly-chosen absence instance [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], where values &#x0003e; 0.9 indicate excellent model performance, 0.8&#x02013;0.9 very good, 0.7&#x02013;0.8 good, 0.6&#x02013;0.7 fair, 0.6&#x02013;0.5 poor, and &#x0003c;0.5 no better than random.</p><p>Using R&#x02019;s &#x02018;predict&#x02019; function, a model trained on all of the data (215 presences and 2867 absences) was used to predict the probability of presence of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> across the entire study area, creating a 1 x 1 km raster grid surface of predicted presence probabilities. Additionally, the probabilistic map was converted into a discrete map showing areas of suitable and unsuitable habitat using the prevalence threshold, where cells with probabilities less than the threshold were considered unsuitable habitat, and those greater considered suitable. The true skill statistic (TSS), which maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity and is considered to have all the advantages of the kappa statistic but is independent of prevalence [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], was also considered in this study. It was very similar to the prevalence threshold (0.11 versus 0.07 for prevalence) and resulted in only a slightly reduced area predicted as suitable habitat. For <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic>, a long-lived species vulnerable to fishing impacts, our goal was to reduce the omission error (where the model predicts an absence where a presence is located) as much as possible and therefore we applied the prevalence threshold in preference to the TSS.</p><p>Ecological context of the model was aided by predictor variable importance and response curves (partial dependence plots). The importance of the predictor variables in the classification model was assessed using the &#x02018;importance&#x02019; function of package &#x02018;randomForest&#x02019;, which calculates the Mean Decrease in Gini index, or Gini impurity for each variable. When the response data are split into two child nodes based on a randomly-chosen variable, the data in the two descendent nodes are more homogeneous than that of the parent node. This difference in homogeneity between parent and child nodes is measured by the Gini index, where the increase in homogeneity equals a decrease in Gini value. The sum of all decreases in Gini index for each variable in each tree is averaged across all trees in the model. The variable with the highest mean decrease in Gini value is considered the most important variable in the model.</p><p>Response curves showing the partial dependence on the top six predictor variables were generated using the &#x02018;partialPlot&#x02019; function in R. For classification random forest, these partial dependence plots show the marginal effect of a predictor variable on the class probability. The other predictor variables are held constant at their mean observed value. Partial dependence plots are useful in showing general trends in model accuracy&#x02019;s dependence on the predictors [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. For classification models, the <italic>y</italic> axis ranges from -&#x0221e; to &#x0221e; and quantifies the log-odds of a positive classification for the total range of values in <italic>x</italic>. Log-odds are logarithmic transformations of the probabilities for values in <italic>x</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. These values were transformed to the original presence probability scale using: <italic>p</italic> = <italic>exp</italic>(<italic>y</italic>)/(1 + <italic>exp</italic>(<italic>y</italic>)), where p = the probability of presence, and y is the log-odds of presence, the standard output from the partialPlot function.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Fine-scale hydrographic conditions over the <italic>Vazella</italic> sponge grounds</title><p>Fine-scale hydrographic and biochemical conditions directly over the <italic>Vazella</italic> sponge grounds were examined from four CTD profiles made on July 20, 2016 as part of a DFO science mission to characterize the environmental characteristics of these sponge grounds (see [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]).

The goal of SODA is to reconstruct the historical physical history of the global ocean through the optimization of model physics, forcing, and available ocean data observations.

The <italic>Vazella</italic> sponge grounds in Emerald Basin are globally unique for this species, which to date has not been reported to form large aggregations in other areas of its distribution, and are also unique for the northwest Atlantic where ostur-type sponges are typically the dominant sponge-ground type [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].</p><p>In response to the growing concern over the conservation status of deep-water sponges and the impact of anthropogenic activities such as bottom fishing to these communities [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], several studies have used species distribution modelling to predict the distribution of deep-water sponges and identify the environmental conditions responsible for their formation and persistence at both regional (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]) and basin-wide (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]) scales. In our study, predicted probability of occurrence of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> was highest in Emerald Basin in waters shallower than 200 m depth, with a significant concentration located to the west of &#x02018;The Patch&#x02019;. A second notable concentration was predicted on the eastern flank of Sambro Bank. Although a threshold delimiting significant concentrations of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> from its broader distribution from presence probability outputs remains undefined, the two DFO Sponge Conservation Areas almost fully encompass these concentrations, where presence probability was predicted at 90% and higher (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g004">Fig 4</xref>). However, the significant concentrations of this species as indicated by kernel density analysis using biomass catch data remain largely unprotected (~3% protected; [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]), as do the areas of potential suitable habitat (less than 1% protected) in the core of this species&#x02019; predicted distribution (i.e., the Scotian Gulf, Fundian/Northeast Channels and Gulf of Maine (minus areas of model extrapolation), an area equal to ~29,523 km<sup>2</sup>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Although our model indicated higher probability of occurrence in areas with higher bottom fishing effort, this variable was the least important variable in the model, and examination of its spatial distribution showed few instances of highly localized zones of high effort overlapping with the sponges. The inability of this variable to split the presence and absence data (the determinant of its importance in the model) was reflected by the nearly equal mean fishing effort at the location of presence and absence points (5.08 &#x000b1; 16.77 and 5.19 &#x000b1; 16.90 hours, respectively). The low importance of fishing effort in determining the distribution of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> does not necessarily indicate that sponge grounds outside the conservation areas are not subjected to significant adverse impacts by trawling. Freese and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] found that just a single trawl pass through sponge biogenic habitat resulted in an average reduction in sponge densities of 45% compared to untrawled sponge habitat. Future modelling applications examining the cumulative impacts of trawling on the biomass or abundance of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> might provide further insight into the effects of bottom-tending gear on this species.</p><p>Aggregations of sponges typically occur along continental slopes and seamounts [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] and have been linked to areas of slope that facilitate the propagation of internal tidal waves [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] and areas of turbulent mixing at the interface between water masses [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Two research groups [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] suggested that the predicting factor of their distribution was an increased supply of food and resuspension of organic material caused by the breaking of these waves and turbulent mixing, consistent with the prominence of primary production variables in our predictive model. In contrast, aggregations of the glass sponge <italic>P</italic>. <italic>carpenteri</italic> in the northeast Atlantic occur within a relatively narrow environmental niche [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and are thought to be associated with areas not directly impacted by enhanced currents, but downstream of them where organic particulate carbon is transported via downslope currents [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Similar to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>carpenteri</italic>, the <italic>Vazella</italic> sponge grounds in Emerald Basin occur in areas of low topographic relief, and are strongly linked to areas of warm (&#x0003e; 5&#x000b0;C) and saline (&#x0003e;34) bottom water (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g009">9</xref>). This water mass, identified as Warm Slope Water, originates from the Gulf Stream and represents the dominant flow feature in Emerald Basin. This water mass is characterized by low oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g009">Fig 9</xref>) and high nutrient concentrations directly above the sponge grounds compared to the overlying water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Examination of the long-term trends in bottom temperature and salinity (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g011">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g012">12</xref>) dating back to 1870 indicated historically high inter-annual variability in the water mass characteristics of Emerald Basin. This variability occurs over multi-decadal timescales and is thought to be associated with a larger than average transport by the Labrador Current off Nova Scotia, which replaces Warm Slope Water with cold, fresh Labrador Slope Water leading to decreased temperatures and salinities within Emerald Basin [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. One of the first cold periods in the basin on record occurred in the mid-1960&#x02019;s when bottom temperatures cooled to between 3 and 4.5&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205505.g011">Fig 11</xref>; [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). Thirty years later, colder temperatures in the basin in 1997 also corresponded to a significant change in offshore slope waters likely caused by a southward flux of the Labrador Current [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This multi-decadal variability is consistent with the influence of the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation, or AMO, a mode of natural variability occurring in the North Atlantic with a period of 60 to 80 years [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Overall cooling in sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic from the late 1950&#x02019;s to the early 1970&#x02019;s, and overall warming from the 1980&#x02019;s to the early 2000&#x02019;s has been attributed to the AMO. The AMO is related to and interacts with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which is considered one of the most prominent circulation systems in the Atlantic Ocean and is responsible for heat transport from the South and North Atlantic to the subpolar and polar North Atlantic. Acceleration and deceleration of the AMOC generates a positive (warm) and negative (cold) phase of the AMO, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Recent data suggests that the AMO is currently transitioning to a negative (cold) phase [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Such variability indicates that caution should be taken when using species distribution models for long-lived species to define niche requirements under current climatic conditions.</p><p>Given that the population of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> was first documented in Emerald Basin in 1889 [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we show that this species has persisted in the face of this climatic variability. While the exact temperature and salinity tolerance limits of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> remain unknown, these results may give insight into how this species will respond to future climate change. In tropical climates, rapid changes in water temperature have shown deleterious effects on the physiology of shallow-water sponges, affecting both their filtration rates and feeding behaviour, as well as their associated microbial component [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], which can comprise between 40 and 60% of the total tissue volume of some species [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Similarly, in deep-sea environments, Johnson and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] showed that sponge-dominated vulnerable marine ecosystems in North Atlantic areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) are expected to show deleterious responses to climate change pressures such as increasing temperature. Species distribution models can give useful insight into the potential effects of climate change through the prediction of species&#x02019; range expansion or contraction in different climate scenarios, even when the physiological requirements of a species are unknown [<xref rid="pone.0205505.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Such a process was not undertaken in the current study due to the unavailability of spatially-resolved data for the northwest Atlantic for future climate scenarios. We recommend this as future work in order to understand the impacts of climate change on this species and to develop appropriate measures for its continued conservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205505.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Presence and absence response data of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>pourtalesi</italic> collected between 1997 and 2017.</title><p>Data source are DFO's multispecies trawl survey, DFO optical surveys, and commercial catch data from the Fisheries Observer Program (FOP).
