 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We selected four basin-wide climate indices for model inputs (fig. S4). These were the MEI, PDO, NPGO, and North Pacific SST. The extended MEI was the calendar year means of the bimonthly index of SST and sea surface height anomalies in the tropical Pacific from 1890 to the present (

  </a>). The PDO series are the calendar year means of the bimonthly index values of the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of SST and sea surface height from 1890 to the present [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information]. The NPGO series are the calendar year means of the monthly index values from 1950 to the present of the second EOF of SST and sea surface height (

  </a>). The Extended Reconstructed SST v4 (ERSST) is the global monthly SST data set from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) (

   <span class="italic">54</span>
  </a>). We averaged a subset grid of the region encompassing the maximum study species foraging range (10째 to 44째N, 140째 to 235째W) and calculated calendar year means to build the series. To address ecosystem responses to climate changes, we generated lagged climate series, where climate data from a given time period (
  <span class="italic">t</span>) are used to model the trophic data from the following time period (
  <span class="italic">t</span> + 1). Because the trophic signature turnover in feathers is a subannual process, we used a 1-year lag.
