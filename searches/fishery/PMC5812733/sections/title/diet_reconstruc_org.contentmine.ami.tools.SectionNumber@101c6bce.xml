 <div class="title">Diet reconstructions show a shift from fish to squids.</div>
 <p>Bayesian mixing model outputs that reconstruct diet composition longitudinally using CSIA-derived TP (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>) and prey item TL (fig. S6) for individual species (
  <span class="bold">A</span> to 
  <span class="bold">H</span>) and averaged across species (
  <span class="bold">I</span>). We combined four taxa into two diet groups due to TL similarities. The resulting groups encompass six taxa comprising the majority (&gt;80%) of diet volume (
