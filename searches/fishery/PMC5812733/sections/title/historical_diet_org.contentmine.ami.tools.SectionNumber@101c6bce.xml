 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used hierarchal Bayesian mixing models [R package MixSIAR; (
  <a rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" href="#R51">
   <span class="italic">51</span>
  </a>)] to visualize shifts in diet proportions of prey sources across time. In this model, the TP values in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a> are the mixture biotracer response as a function of prey item assimilation, where the TL of six prey items was the source biotracer input. Year was as a continuous random effect. Uncertainty in source data TL was built in using mean and SE of the TL from the literature and FishBase. We used a process error structure to account for variation in seabird TLs (
  <a rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" href="#R52">
   <span class="italic">52</span>
  </a>). This structure permits consumers to sample in different locations from each prey source distribution, and subsequent variation in consumer tracer values is accounted for in this sampling process. We fixed discrimination factors to 1 because TL magnification from prey to predator is 1.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We generated informative Dirichlet priors with the weight of an uninformative prior from the mean prey contribution estimates across the eight seabird species (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>). The sum of the Dirichlet hyperparameters is equivalent in weight to the number of source groups (that is, four for four source groups; fig. S5). We ran the mixing model for three chains over 100,000 iterations, removing 50,000 for burn-in and thinning by a factor of 50. Gelman-Rubin diagnostics assessed convergence.
