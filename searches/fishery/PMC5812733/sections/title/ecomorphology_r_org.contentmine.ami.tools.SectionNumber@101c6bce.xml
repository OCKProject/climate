 <p>Wing tracing silhouettes (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) and various aerodynamic metrics for seabirds in this study (
  <span class="bold">B</span> and 
  <span class="bold">C</span>). Observed foraging distances in the North Pacific, plotted as (
  <span class="bold">D</span>) northern latitudinal limits and (
  <span class="bold">E</span>) absolute distances from breeding areas. LAAL have a relatively high wing area per body mass (B) and relatively high aspect ratio per wing loading (C), enabling extended forage bouts at sea (D and E). Conversely, BRBO has a relatively high wing loading per wing aspect (C), limiting its pelagic flights (D and E). Species color codes are retained through all panels.
