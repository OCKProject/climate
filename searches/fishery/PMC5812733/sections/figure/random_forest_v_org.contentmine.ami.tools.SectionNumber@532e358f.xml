  <div class="title">Random forest variable importance and partial dependence plots.</div>
  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Ranked predictors by measure of the variable importance. Variable importance is the measure by which the model mean square error (MSE) is reduced if the variable is randomly permuted. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Partial dependence plots for the top 12 predictors in order of variable importance. The plots show the TP response relative to a predictor when all other predictors are mediated for. Yellow subpanels are ecomorphological traits, green subpanels are reconstructed fishery predictors, and blue subpanels are climate inputs. (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) Partial dependence surface plots; all color designations hold except for the red subpanel, which is a cross-sectional interaction. Notable (B) partial dependence plots are the high TLs observed for species with low wing loading, years of low jacks and scads catch, periods of high squid capture, and periods of high NPGO index values. On the surface plots (C), relatively high TPs are observed for species with low wing loading and high forage distances, periods of high SST, and lower PDO index values.
