    "Background:Xenophysogobio boulengeri and X. nudicorpa are the only two species within the genus Xenophysogobio (Cyprinidae, Cypriniformes), and both are endemic to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. In recent years, due to human activities, the natural resources available to both species have declined sharply. Sympatric species with overlapping niches inevitably compete for their habitats, and genetic structure and diversity can reflect population history and their potential for adaptation to changing environments, which is useful for management decisions. Methods:In the present study, microsatellite DNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers were used to investigate the patterns of population genetic structure for X. boulengeri and X. nudicorpa. Microsatellite DNA data, jointly with traditional summary statistics including F ST and F is, were used to assess the population genetic structure by structure analysis. The mtDNA sequences were then used to examine these patterns through time to detect demographic history. Results:Xenophysogobio boulengeri and X. nudicorpa exhibited high levels of genetic diversity in Yangtze River populations, except for two populations of X. nudicorpa in the Jinsha River, which were low in mtDNA diversity. X. boulengeri showed genetic homogeneity among populations, whereas X. nudicorpa appeared to have significant geographic genetic divergence. Both species experienced a late-Pleistocene sudden population expansion in Yangtze River populations, but not in the Jinsha River populations of X. nudicorpa. Discussion:The genetic homogeneity of X. boulengeri populations might result from similar population expansion events and environment features. The geographic genetic subdivision for X. nudicorpa between the Jinsha and Yangtze Rivers might be caused by the geographic isolation in the middle Pliocene, as well as climate and environmental heterogeneity."
