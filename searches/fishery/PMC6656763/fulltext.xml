We have determined that PIPA is a spawning area for skipjack (<italic>Katsuwonus pelamis</italic>), bigeye (<italic>Thunnus obesus</italic>), and yellowfin (<italic>Thunnus albacares</italic>) tunas. Our approach included sampling larvae on cruises in 2015&#x02013;2017 and using a biological-physical model to estimate spawning locations for collected larvae. Temperature and chlorophyll conditions varied markedly due to observed ENSO states: El Ni&#x000f1;o (2015) and neutral (2016&#x02013;2017). However, larval tuna distributions were similar amongst years. Generally, skipjack larvae were patchy and more abundant near PIPA&#x02019;s northeast corner, while <italic>Thunnus</italic> larvae exhibited lower and more even abundances. Genetic barcoding confirmed the presence of bigeye (<italic>Thunnus obesus</italic>) and yellowfin (<italic>Thunnus albacares</italic>) tuna larvae. Model simulations indicated that most of the larvae collected inside PIPA in 2015 were spawned inside, while stronger currents in 2016 moved more larvae across PIPA&#x02019;s boundaries. Larval distributions and relative spawning output simulations indicated that both focal taxa spawned inside PIPA in all 3 study years, demonstrating that PIPA is protecting viable tuna spawning habitat.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Ecology</kwd><kwd>Biooceanography</kwd><kwd>Biooceanography</kwd><kwd>Marine biology</kwd><kwd>Marine biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CINAR Cooperative Fellow Award NA14OAR4320158</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Tropical tunas are extremely valuable worldwide as a source of protein and income. Skipjack tuna alone provide approximately 50&#x02013;60% of annual global tuna catches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Pacific island nations earn a large proportion of their gross domestic product (GDP) from tuna, many by selling fishing licenses to the commercial fleets of foreign nations to operate in their exclusive economic zones (EEZ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. One of these island nations is the Republic of Kiribati, which comprises 34 islands with a total land area of 810 km<sup>2</sup> and an EEZ of 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup>, across 3 archipelagos that span 4.7&#x000b0;N to 11.4&#x000b0;S and 150.2&#x000b0;W to 187&#x000b0;W: the Line Islands, the Phoenix Islands, and the Gilbert Islands. For this low-lying ocean nation, tuna fishing by foreign commercial fleets is incredibly important to the economy: for example, from 2006 to 2015, fishing license revenue represented 39.5% of GDP on average, ranging from 19.2% to 93.5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Some of the variance in fishing license revenue can be attributed to the El Ni&#x000f1;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles. El Ni&#x000f1;o conditions tend to cause skipjack tuna, which dominate the catch in Kiribati waters, to move from the western Pacific warm pool into the central Pacific, and particularly into the Phoenix Islands region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The year of highest contribution of fishing licenses to GDP, 2015, was an El Ni&#x000f1;o year, and Kiribati reported fishing license revenue of USD 148.8 million<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Despite heavy reliance on tuna license revenues, approximately half of the Kiribati EEZ in the vicinity of the Phoenix Islands archipelago&#x02014;and 11.3% of their total EEZ&#x02014;is currently a no-take marine protected area (MPA) with UNESCO World Heritage Designation. The Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) is one of the largest marine protected areas in the world at 408,250&#x02009;sq. km. Created in 2008 as a mixed-use MPA, and closed entirely to all commercial extractive activities in January 2015, PIPA comprises 8 atolls, 2 shallow submerged banks, at least 14 seamounts, and a large area of deep ocean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This MPA was established to protect the many endangered and endemic species that live within its boundaries, as well as to protect the migratory birds, mammals, and sea turtles that pass through the area. Populations of previously exploited species, such as giant clam and coconut crab, have been recovering since the establishment of the MPA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In addition to biodiversity goals, the PIPA Management Plan lays out the hope that, if well-enforced, PIPA may protect tuna breeding stocks and potential spawning grounds. Although enforcing a no-take policy in an area the size of PIPA can be difficult, Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from ships indicates that virtually all fishing activity did indeed stop after January 1, 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, detected fishing days in (non-PIPA) Kiribati waters from AIS data actually increased from 2014 to 2015, indicating that fishing vessels moved out of PIPA but continued to fully subscribe fishing permit days for use in other parts of the Kiribati EEZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. With effective enforcement inside PIPA, but heavy fishing pressure outside<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, there may be value in protecting tuna spawning grounds, and potential for regional economic gain via &#x0201c;spillover effects&#x0201d; that may materialize once the closure has been in place long enough. Spillover effects occur when time- and/or area-closures result in increased biomass around MPA margins, which then moves outside the protected area where it can benefit regional fisheries, and these effects have been detected across a number of taxonomic groups and a range of MPA sizes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. For tunas in PIPA, it was assumed that fisheries protection of a large area where spawning occurs could have recruitment and biomass benefits in surrounding Kiribati waters and beyond, but tuna spawning activity within PIPA has not yet been confirmed.</p><p id="Par5">Tropical tuna species that are likely to use the waters in PIPA for foraging and spawning include skipjack (<italic>Katsuwonus pelamis</italic>), yellowfin (<italic>Thunnus albacares</italic>), and bigeye (<italic>Thunnus obesus</italic>). Skipjack tuna are most abundant within 20&#x000b0; of the equator, but are found as far north as 40&#x000b0;N<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Yellowfin tuna are concentrated in equatorial waters and prefer temperatures above 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Bigeye tuna, the largest and most valuable of the tropical tunas, have a range that extends from 40&#x000b0;S to 40&#x000b0;N<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Albacore tuna (<italic>Thunnus alalunga</italic>) may also pass through the region, but because of its subtropical to temperate habitat preferences, this species accounts for&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1% of the tuna catch in Kiribati<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

The only other broad-scale sampling effort for larval tunas in the Pacific Ocean was carried out by the Japanese from 1956&#x02013;1981.

Moreover, this finding held during both El Ni&#x000f1;o and neutral conditions. The overall pattern of larval distribution and abundance was similar across years, and backtracking simulations suggested that spawning locations near PIPA were also similar across years. Larval studies are valuable because they reveal both adult presence and spawning activity without removing adults or interrupting spawning behavior. Therefore, this study can help us understand the role that PIPA plays in tuna conservation, while adhering to the no-take policy of the protected area management plan.</p><p id="Par18">The larval tuna abundances that we recorded in PIPA, at non-zero catch stations, range from 0.004 to 42.5 larvae per 10&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>, or approximately 0.008 to 85 larvae per 1000&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup> (assuming that larval habitat is the upper 50&#x02009;m). Past work on larval tuna distributions in the Pacific is limited, but the abundances presented here are within the range of previous studies. For example, the 1950&#x02013;1952 surveys by NOAA in the pelagic tropical Pacific found 1&#x02013;16 yellowfin tuna larvae per 1000&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup> and 0.5&#x02013;25 skipjack tuna larvae per 1000&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup>&#x02009;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The other example of broad-scale larval surveys in the tropical Pacific, undertaken by the Japanese from 1956&#x02013;1981, observed larval yellowfin at densities of less than 1 per 1000&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup> and skipjack tuna larvae at densities of 0.1&#x02013;5 per 1000&#x02009;m<sup>3</sup>&#x02009;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Our results fit well into the established literature on larval studies in the tropical Pacific, suggesting that spawning in PIPA likely contributes to recruitment in central Pacific tuna stocks.</p><p id="Par19">Although July of 2015 had the warmest and lowest chlorophyll-a conditions that were seen in the month of July between 2003 and 2018 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), the overall pattern of abundance of tuna larvae did not change substantially between 2015 and the other sampling years (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The largest inter-annual difference was the much lower range of abundances in 2017. However, this coincides with lower effort in 2017, particularly in the northeast quadrant of PIPA. If we compare only the locations where sampling occurred in all three years, then abundances reported for 2017 are quite similar to the other two years.</p><p id="Par20">Although we observed consistency in the overall patterns of larval abundance across years, there were differences in the details of those patterns. We expected to find higher larval abundances under low chlorophyll El Ni&#x000f1;o conditions because of the preference of <italic>Thunnus</italic> spp. tunas for spawning in highly oligotrophic waters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The observed abundance of <italic>Thunnus</italic> spp. larvae was indeed higher&#x02014;but patchier&#x02014;in 2015 than in 2016. In 2016, there were more positive stations but abundance was generally lower at each station (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d,e</xref>). In 2015, barcoding results suggest the presence of both yellowfin and bigeye tunas, but in 2016 only bigeye tuna were identified (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Unfortunately, species identification with DNA barcoding was not possible for 74% of the <italic>Thunnus</italic> spp. larvae collected in 2016, so the possibility remains that yellowfin occurred in 2016 as well. (The quantity of pure ethanol brought in 2016 was insufficient for preserving the high amounts of plankton that occurred. As such, DNA was often degraded in these samples, or denatured ethanol&#x02014;a poor DNA preservative&#x02014;was used instead.) Although surface temperatures were cooler in 2016, the entire area of PIPA had surface temperatures above 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), well within the preference range of yellowfin tuna<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. If there were truly no yellowfin larvae in our 2016 collections, it could indicate that bigeye tuna distribution and spawning activity is less responsive to changes in the surface waters than these aspects of yellowfin tuna biology. This, in turn, could be explained by observations that bigeye tuna often occupy colder waters and greater depths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and forage on deeper-dwelling organisms than do yellowfin tuna<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Another important component of interannual variability is the influence of currents on the pattern of relative spawning output. The backtracked reproductive output maps show little movement of eggs and larvae across the boundaries of PIPA during El Ni&#x000f1;o conditions (i.e., 2015), and greater movement during neutral conditions. For example, the areas of highest relative spawning output for skipjack tuna were outside PIPA to the north in both 2015 and 2016 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>), but the observed large catch locations were outside PIPA in 2015 and inside in 2016. This is due to weaker currents accompanied by a northerly position of the mesoscale circulation feature in 2015 compared to stronger currents and a more southerly mesoscale feature in 2016. In both 2016 and 2017, there is a westward current flowing near the middle latitude of PIPA. This is in line with observations of the westward-flowing southern branch of the South Equatorial Current, which is centered around 3&#x000b0;S and weakens during El Ni&#x000f1;o events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">We used larval catch, ages, and estimated mortality rates to take a novel approach to larval backtracking. In addition to showing that many of the tuna larvae originated from spawning activity in PIPA, we also shed light on spatial variability in spawning output. However, it is important to note that these results are based only on the observed collections and, as such, the backtracking results should be thought of as presence-only&#x02014;spawning may have occurred in more of the domain, with larvae transported to locations where we did not sample. Furthermore, the results of individual-based modeling are quite sensitive to the choice of hydrodynamic model. We used HYCOM, a data-assimilative hindcasting model that generally replicates large-scale patterns in the ocean, and we find that it matches CTD data from PIPA reasonably well (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). However, further work on hydrodynamic models for the tropical Pacific would improve the reliability of larval dispersal, connectivity, and backtracking simulations that are often used in MPA design and assessments.</p><p id="Par23">Studies of larval tuna abundance and its interannual variability can contribute substantially to our understanding of tuna spawning, stock productivity, and the role of large MPAs like PIPA in tuna conservation. While our results show that tuna are spawning inside of PIPA, the lack of other larval tuna studies in the tropical Pacific limits our ability to contextualize the role of PIPA in overall stock productivity. The only broad-scale larval tuna studies in the tropical Pacific ended between 40<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and 70 years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Still, given the remoteness of PIPA, as well as its size, this work represents a significant contribution to the scientific understanding of tuna spawning in open waters of the Pacific and to the use of protected areas by highly migratory species.</p><p id="Par24">Recently, several studies have focused on the role of protected areas, including large-scale MPAs, in the conservation and management of highly migratory species. Around the long-standing Gal&#x000e1;pagos marine reserve, there is evidence of &#x0201c;spillover effects&#x0201d; in the yellowfin tuna purse seine fishery, indicating that the protected area is increasing recruitment locally&#x02014;whether by protecting a fairly resident population or by attracting very large temporary aggregations of yellowfin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In a different management context, temporary closures of the striped marlin long-line fishery in Baja California coincided with rapid increases in fish abundance, again with some uncertainty about whether the increase is driven by high recruitment of a local population or import of individuals from outside the closed area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In a counter example, it was deemed unlikely that a proposed MPA at Ascension Island (tropical Atlantic) would lead to population benefits for the yellowfin tuna population; although individuals spent several months at a time foraging around the island, they were not found to be reproductively active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In an example from a highly migratory species with a very different life cycle, tagging studies on green turtles in the Chagos Archipelago MPA indicate that turtles spend a very small proportion of time inside the MPA, using it for nesting but not for foraging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In all of these examples, the value of the protected area comes from the combination of adult presence and reproductive activity.</p><p id="Par25">We have demonstrated that there are reproductively active individuals within PIPA, but a critical piece of missing information that would allow for a better assessment of the protection afforded by PIPA would be the residence times of adult tuna. Otolith chemistry, which is related to natal origin using geographically-based water properties, suggests that both yellowfin and bigeye tuna populations in the tropical Pacific are structured on large regional scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Likewise, tagging data suggest stock structure and regional retention on large spatial scales for bigeye tuna<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> and that yellowfin tuna will remain in an area similar in size to PIPA for periods of weeks to months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. A global synthesis of dart tag data indicated that all three tropical tuna species are capable of both rapid large-scale movements and regional fidelity or periodic returns to feeding and spawning locations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. This evidence suggests that, if foraging conditions in PIPA are attractive, adult tuna could spend enough time there to benefit from the protection in order to spawn numerous times before becoming vulnerable to fishing again. A tagging study specifically focused on adult tuna movements in the vicinity of PIPA would further elucidate the scale of PIPA&#x02019;s impact on tuna population productivity.</p><p id="Par26">In addition to short-term contributions to sustainable management, PIPA may be important for the conservation of tuna populations affected by climate change. Several papers have predicted that climate change will have neutral effects or benefits for tuna fisheries in island nations in the central Pacific Ocean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Climate projections indicate that tuna abundances in PIPA, and in Kiribati in general, will increase because warming in the western Pacific warm pool will drive the population distribution of skipjack tuna towards the east<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Likewise for bigeye tuna, climate change projection models predict that adult abundances will increase in the eastern Pacific and will decrease in the western and central Pacific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Part of the reasoning is that climate projections indicate that spawning habitat for skipjack tunas in the western Pacific will decrease substantially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Thus, under certain climate scenarios, PIPA may have a disproportionate opportunity to bolster reproductive stocks if surface water temperatures cause adults to spend more time within the MPA boundaries.</p><p id="Par27">The Phoenix Islands Protected Area is unique as a large, continuous MPA that encloses almost an entire archipelago and encompasses both shallow reef environments and deep pelagic waters. Larval studies, including the analysis of distribution, abundance, growth, and backtracking simulations, contribute to overall understanding of the species and/or the stock because events in early life can have an outsized impact on stock recruitment and productivity. However, linking a study of the distribution of tuna larvae in PIPA with the population dynamics of adult skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tunas in the central Tropical Pacific is difficult, and should be approached cautiously. The great power of the standard ichthyoplankton sampling scheme presented here is that it provides the baseline for a growing time series that, as annual sampling continues through at least 2022, will enable monitoring of tuna spawning inside PIPA. This time series may reveal interannual changes in the spawning output or shifts in its spatial distribution, providing insight into how tuna spawning in and around PIPA is likely to change under climate change conditions. Furthermore, the protection of large areas like PIPA, where the only major anthropogenic effects are from global-scale climate change, potentially enables us to disentangle climate-related impacts from the other multiple stressors that most ecosystems face. In addition to being a reservoir for biodiversity and biomass, mega-MPAs like PIPA are large-scale living laboratories that can help scientists better understand ocean ecosystems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Field sampling</title><p id="Par28">Sampling took place aboard the <italic>SSV Robert C.

Aged larvae ranged from 2.24 to 9.04&#x02009;mm in length and from 1 to 12 daily otolith increments. More details on otolith methods are in the SI.</p><p id="Par37">A least squares linear regression was fitted to the daily increment and length data for each year-taxon pair, as well as by taxon pooled across years (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). An ANOVA did not find a significant effect of year on larval length for skipjack tuna larvae (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.22), and there was a marginally significant effect for <italic>Thunnus</italic> spp. larvae (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06). We found that average growth rates over the first two weeks of life are 0.45 and 0.37&#x02009;mm per day for skipjack tuna larvae and <italic>Thunnus</italic> spp. larvae, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The size-at-age relationships derived from otolith analyses were used to assign the number of daily growth increments for larvae that were not aged.</p><p id="Par38">To inform backtracking, we needed to estimate ages in days post spawning. It takes 18&#x02013;30&#x02009;hours for tuna eggs to hatch at the observed temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Yellowfin and skipjack tuna larvae begin to lay down increments within 12&#x02013;24&#x02009;hours of hatching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Therefore, we added 2 days to convert the estimates of increment number into age of each larva in days post-spawning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Relative spawning output estimation</title><p id="Par39">For particle backtracking, we used the Connectivity Modeling System (CMS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> with velocities from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) Global hindcast experiments 91.1 and 91.2. The HYCOM data server provides daily currents at a horizontal grid resolution of 1/12&#x000b0;. For each station at which tuna larvae were caught, 1000 virtual particles were released at noon on the calendar day of sampling at the mean geographical position of all net tows for that station (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Virtual particles were released at 25&#x02009;m depth, and passively drifted at fixed depths: 10&#x02009;m depth for <italic>Thunnus spp</italic>. larvae and 25&#x02009;m depth for skipjack larvae. These depths were selected because they represent the mid-point of observed vertical distributions for these taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. The particles were tracked backwards in time for 15 days from collection date, with a model time step of 20&#x02009;minutes. The model includes stochastic kicks to simulate sub-grid scale diffusivity, and releasing 1000 particles ensures that the output will broadly sample that probability space.</p><p id="Par40">Using the simulation output, we built a dataset corresponding to all collected tuna larvae. For each larva, age in days post spawning was estimated using the pooled size-at-age relationships. In order to account for variance in size-at-age, we drew the estimated ages from a normal distribution with mean equal to the regression line for age-at-size and variance equal to the standard deviation of all of the residuals of age-at-size. We use this age for each larva to extract the positions of the 1000 virtual particles (from the corresponding simulation release point) on the estimated day of spawning. We calculated the 2-D frequency distributions of the 1000 particle positions at the estimated time of spawning, on a 0.05&#x000b0; latitude by 0.05&#x000b0; longitude grid, and defined this as the spatial probability density of spawning location for that larva.</p><p id="Par41">Instead of only backtracking larvae to estimate where they originated, we also sought to estimate the relative spawning output needed to yield the abundances and ages of larvae in our samples. To do this, it is necessary to scale the spatial probability density of spawning location by the number of eggs that would need to be spawned to lead to the observation of each larva, which depends on the age of the larva and the daily mortality rate. Instantaneous daily mortality rates (Z) for fish larvae strongly depend on temperature, and a meta-analysis across a wide range of latitudes, species, and ecosystems found that Z&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0256&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.0123&#x02009;T, where T is the temperature that larvae experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. We used the average temperature in the upper 50&#x02009;m at each station to calculate the Z for larvae collected at that station: for our data, Z ranges from 0.357 to 0.399&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. This yielded a realistic estimate of the number of eggs that must have been spawned in order to lead to the observed catch.</p><p id="Par42">For each larva, we scale the spatial probability density plot by the estimated number of eggs spawned, to generate the distribution of relative spawning output for that particular larva. We then sum the relative spawning output distributions across all larvae in a given year and taxon to produce maps that show the relative spawning output for the full collections of tuna larvae. Larval catch numbers and the resulting estimates of relative spawning output for each station are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
