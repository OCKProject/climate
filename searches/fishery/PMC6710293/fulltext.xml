The study has employed the descriptive design and a total of 305 samples from rural households (n = 159) and tourism-related enterprises (n = 146) were selected based on a stratified random sampling technique. Samples were drawn based on their direct attachment either in their livelihood and possess a responsibility to the study area. Data were collected through questionnaires, observation, focus group discussion, unstructured interview and secondary data was consulted. Exploratory factor analysis was used to extract dimensions for environmental awareness. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze data using SPSS version 23. Ten Socio-demographic variables of samples were used as an independent variable and environmental conservation dimensions as dependent variables. The result revealed that out of the 10 variables employed in the analysis, six variables were found significant. Hence, marital status, household size, income source, household income, membership to club and resident location were found to be significant. Qualitative analysis revealed wrong reports for political consumption driven little government attention and lack of integrated natural resource management policy and plan were major factors hindering conservation. A vivid and holistic destination management policy making with enough room to stakeholders' involvement shall be a prior task for the government for better conservation of the ecosystem and sustainable development.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Environmental science</kwd><kwd>Environmental management</kwd><kwd>Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve</kwd><kwd>Environmental conservation</kwd><kwd>Water hyacinth</kwd><kwd>Socioeconomic variables</kwd><kwd>Binary logistics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The problems of climate change and resource degradation has become crucial in order to make the environment sustainable. Conservation of the natural and man-made resources in this 21<sup>st</sup> century is not a voluntary choice for many countries and people within each country. Many of the protected areas were established to conserve global biodiversity and ensure a continuance of various ecosystem services that are of great importance in order to maintain ecological equilibrium (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Thuy et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Current scenario of the world environment adheres to the conservation of the resources adjacent to the socioeconomic human effects (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">UNECA, 2007</xref>).

The management of natural resource sustainably, disposing and keeping the waste generated to a minimum has become a priority over the last few decades (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">UNEP, 2004</xref>). Extreme dwindling of natural resources that created climate change, instability, socioeconomic and poverty variability is mostly due to severe drought and desertification (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">UNECA, 2007</xref>). Thus, various environmental conferences are held in different UN member countries at different times due to augmented global warming and climate change (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lamsal et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Conservation should be promoted to enhance local economic growth, socio-economic, political and ecological changes associated with tourism and conservation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Fletcher, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, those changes, in turn, can be made for the restructuring of the community at destination areas (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Vaccaro et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). In addition, a significant change of infrastructural, economic, demographic and administrative categories could also be derived for the conservation success (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Vaccaro et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Social science conservationists should be motivated besides natural science conservationists who could play a valuable role in socio-cultural, economic and human dimensions of the conservation science (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).

Conservation has been used as a tactic to gain political control (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mathis and Rose, 2016</xref>). It can also become a tool for economic development as it integrates landscape into the capitalist market which in return alters the cultural practices (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Adams and Hutton, 2007</xref>).

The rest of the respondents were engaged in fishery that accounts 10 or 6.8% and wage in the travel and tourism industry which accounts 6 (4.1%). In the rural HHs stratum, 50 or 31% of respondents were engaged in farming whereas 30(18.9%), 29 (18.2%), 27 (17.0), 10 (6.2%) were engaging in fishing, trade, production and sale of handicrafts and wage as major means of livelihood respectively.

Moreover, it verified that respondents especially those who are working on boat service stated that &#x0201c;money researchers and Save Lake Tana Forums came and promised; government talks much on media but nothing has come practical and the lake is suffering a lot, we are becoming hopeless seeing the loss our identity heritage and thinking about our recent future lives&#x0201d;. The reply is in line with the study of (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Legesse, 2017</xref>) which demonstrated there are no policies that government institutions could work or either policies and strategies are not specific that could be practical.</p><p id="p0270">During the survey, areas outlets of Bahir Dar City (Mango, Shum Abo, Shimibt as well as Abay Mado), chemical wastes into the lake from flowering farm investments between Bahir Dar and Zeghe, Kunzila, and Gorgora were found very in a serious problem of environmental degradation and pollution due to solid and liquid waste disposals in to the lake that affect both biodiversity and entire ecosystem. This finding is supported by the factors stated as the pattern of agricultural land use around the lake and Bahir Dar's bid for modernization and growth the factors that affect environmental sustainability and its value use of Lake Tana which identified in the study of (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Teshale et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Besides, Source pollution from urban waste and rural agriculture and degradation of biota in the catchment are the two main environmental threats to the Lake Tana ecosystem (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Emama Ligdi et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). The present research also found that illegal fishing, inadequate training, and monitoring exacerbated by the traditional agriculture, environmentally irresponsible waste disposal from investors and households and tourism practitioners were found as headaches of environmental conservation in the ecosystem.</p><p id="p0275">The insignificant correlation analysis in this study between environmental awareness and environmental concern is proved by the data collected through focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews. It revealed that people with little or no adequate knowledge together with consideration of natural sites as a means of pass-time and excitement together with aesthetic value result in resembling having positive attitudes and feelings towards the environment which is reflection concern or sense of ownership. Environmental protection in Lake Tana has also been facing anthropogenic threats which include recession agriculture, unplanned urbanization, rapid population growth, indiscriminate industrial and development activities, disposal of domestic and industrial toxic waste and free grazing (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Mohammed and Mengist, 2018</xref>). A piece of evidence witnessing is the response gained from Kunzila and Bahir Dar where people feel anger observing people who remove their litter and sewerages by different organizations into the lake. Such organizations which remove their littering into the lake include flower farms and hotels as explained though people lack scientific knowledge.</p><p id="p0280">Moreover, communities' resentment other than socioeconomic determinant factors was extended to the political conspiracy going on conservation. The regional and federal government didn't give due attention to the biosphere reserve conservation more than stage words. Due to lack of due attention to the ecosystem, policies and strategies are too general and failed to give a guideline for implementers, no or incapable institutions implementing even for laws available and overlapping and/or even contradicting objectives of different institutions (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Legesse, 2017</xref>). Such kind of overlapping and contradictions are for instance found between environmental protection and land administration bureau, culture and tourism bureau, agriculture and natural resource management bureau as well as the Institute of fish resources development and Lake Tana Basin development which was observed during the survey period. Hence, there is little cooperation and coordination among different institutions (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Legesse, 2017</xref>). In parallel, demand for labor and lack of technical support for implementing new conservation measure from experts were found the major factors influencing land conservation decisions in Debre Mewi Watershed near Lake Tana (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Zegeye et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Almost all respondents believed that political conspiracy and politically sourced institutional factors were also among the determinant factors which prohibit locals not to practice mainly removal of water hyacinth in which its coverage on the lake reached more than 50,000 ha as pinpointed by (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Asmare, 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Practical implications</title><p id="p0285">In order to make conservation effective and development of natural heritages sustainable, particularly in developing countries, conservation efforts should be institutionalized separately for protected area management. This is to broaden flexibility and information flow as well as to enhance governance networks among stakeholders (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Berdej and Armitage, 2016</xref>). The conservation of protected areas should integrate conservation with improving the local livelihood of the resident community. This helps to develop the ownership mentality and belongingness sustainably among local communities (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Chitakira et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Hence, conservation enterprises should also be organized to mutually enhance conservation and development. Community &#x02013; stakeholders&#x02019;- protected area council (COSPAC) should come into existence for sustainable conservation and utilization of resources in protected areas which is vital for the economically marginalized community. The integration of stakeholders will enhance peaceful management and coexistence for protected area better off (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Coenen et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). In addition, land zoning with an appropriate buffer zone and development area set back should be developed. Moreover, appropriate development policies and destination management plans should be developed. Such policy frameworks were highly recommended (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Researches in the future should focus on an area of schemes where conservation and sustainable development should be effective and heritage sites can be managed sustainable assuring communities' better off. This is due to the barriers of conservation are far beyond the socio-economic demands of the public. Thus, to overcome the loss, fragmentation and disturbance of wildlife and their habitats, invasion of exotic species, as well as over harvesting disturbance of wildlife habitats and environmental pollution and climate change become critical (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Yu, 2010</xref>). Moreover, decision-makers and planners might use also the runoff and sediments in of Lake Tana to implement pertinent land management measures and thereby reduce soil loss in the sub-basin and sedimentation of Lake Tana (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lemma et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Besides, pro-environmental policies and strategies should be designed and implemented (<xref rid="bib9a" ref-type="bibr">Berenguer et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0290">Environmental degradation, sedimentation and water hyacinth as well as waste disposal have appeared to be the major threats to Lake Tana Biosphere ecosystem. This is due to both natural and manmade factors whereby man-made factors seem to outweigh threats of it. Unto investigation of conservation practices and determinants, it is essential not only to conserve the natural ecosystem with its biodiversity species but also to save and sustain the lives of millions of people whose lives are dependent on the lake. Fishing, firewood and agricultural cultivation supported by trade, travel, and tourism are now the meanings of lives of people in and around the biosphere.</p><p id="p0295">Due to its vitality, environmental conservation in Lake Tana Biosphere was measured by environmental awareness, environmental concern and participation dimensions using valid and reliable items. Socioeconomic factors mainly marital status, household size, source of income, household income, membership to an environmental club and resident location were found significant determinant factors of environmental conservation at 5% level of significance measured in terms of environmental awareness, environmental concern, and participation. Gender for environmental concern in TEs stratum, livelihood adequacy for awareness, households income source and income level for participation in HHs stratum were found significant factors at 10% level of significance.</p><p id="p0300">Recommendations were made such that future researches in the study area and similar protected area should focus on how conservation and sustainable development of protected areas can be integrated. Besides, the studies on factors hindering or determining conservation should further address beyond socioeconomic factors since the determinants are not limited to those socioeconomic determinants covered in this study. Furthermore, researches and or development projects should not be on a separate basis. This is due to the fact that without supporting locals' livelihood or without providing economic incentives to the communities attached to the ecosystem, conservation projects should not be effective and conservation by ignorance of people around the protected areas is also unthinkable. In general, poor level of conservation in Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve is not limited to socioeconomic determinants but also exacerbated by lack of local environmental groups, little or no government attention, political wrong reports and using the ecosystem for gaining political profits and lack of pro-environmental policies and plans.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec8.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0310">Zemenu Bires, Sahil Raj: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0315">This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0320">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec8.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0325">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abate</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nyssen</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Moges</surname><given-names>M.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Enku</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimale</surname><given-names>F.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tilahun</surname><given-names>S.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Steenhuis</surname><given-names>T.S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Long-term landscape changes in the lake Tana basin as evidenced by delta development and floodplain aggradation in Ethiopia: reading the landscape using historic delta and floodplain changes</article-title><source>Land Degrad.
