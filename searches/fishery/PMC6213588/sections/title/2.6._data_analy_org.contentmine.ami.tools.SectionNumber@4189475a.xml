 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The findings of the numeric sociodemographic characteristics were presented with medians, while the category sociodemographic variables were presented in counts and proportions. The descriptive data of the informants were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). On the other hand, the extraction of the information from the interview was done through thematic analysis. This action was based on the techniques guide from Braun and Clark [
  <a rid="B22-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-nutrients-10-01455">22</a>]. First, the verbal data from the interviews were transcribed verbatim. The transcription process helped researchers familiarize themselves with the data [
  <a rid="B23-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-nutrients-10-01455">23</a>]. Then, the transcripts were read repeatedly in order to determine the breadth of the data. Normally, the repeated reading is followed by other processes such as note-taking and marking the ideas for the coding process that follows after. Through the familiarization of data conducted in the previous step, the coding process starts. In this study, the coding process was carried out manually using highlighters or colored pens. The codes identified from the data familiarization were matched up with the data extracted from individual transcripts. These transcripts were found to demonstrate the characteristics of the code. Each code that was identified, including the relevant data extracts, was kept in a separate computer file. Following that, the identified codes were categorized into potential themes/sub-themes, while the relevant coded data extracts were categorized into the identified themes/sub-themes.
