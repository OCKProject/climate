 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to ensure the authenticity of the information extracted from the informants, the plan to involve the heads of the villages or renowned individuals during data collection was implemented. Based on the observation prior to the test, the presence of the Tok Batin (heads of the villages) or renowned individuals helped to get rid of suspicion of information. Furthermore, translation services also helped smooth the process of the interviews. Both approaches reduced the potential biases among the informants, be it intentional or unintentional, such as providing inaccurate information due to misinterpretation of the questions. Triangulation was another valid method used to secure the information gathered from the interviews. Data triangulation (the involvement of all three main ethnic groups of OA) and environmental triangulation (the involvement of three study locations) were incorporated into the sampling methods [
