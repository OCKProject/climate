 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was found that the 
  <span class="italic">Orang Asli</span> in Malaysia were still burdened with the problems of obtaining sufficient clean water supply which explained the failure of the OA to achieve household food security. Water issues were labeled as the third theme under factors associated with household food insecurity among OA. To be specific, the water supply was reported to be inconsistent due to the blockage of the pipe system, especially after the rain. Besides, agricultural and logging activities became a concern as these activities contaminated the rivers or lakes which were known to be the primary water sources for the OA. The river became muddy especially after raining due to deforestation. Meanwhile, the OA were worried about the possible leakage of pesticides used for domestic agriculture activities into the rivers. This problem was reported by all ethnic groups in the present study.

   <p>“For me, if I want to declare the water supply that I got is clean is not true. (The water) may be considered moderately clean. The problem is due to land clearing and logging, water is affected and is no longer clean. When it rains, water looks muddy.”</p>

   <p>“Water supply? We are not satisfied with it. Because when some people performing logging activities, the water will be exposed to pollution. When it rains… during the dry seasons, the water looks a bit clear. However, when it rains, it looks a bit muddy. Therefore, it is hard for us to get obtain a clean water supply. Water supplies cannot be continued as sometimes the pipe is blocked during the rain and we need to go repair it. Therefore, the actual problem is the blocked pipe, not the water.”</p>
