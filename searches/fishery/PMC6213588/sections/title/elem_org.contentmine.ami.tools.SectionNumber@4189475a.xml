 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Factors Related to Household Food Insecurity</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meals of OA comprised mixtures of market and traditional food due to the variances in their food-seeking behaviors. Market food was purchased from nearby food outlets, including rice, flour, biscuits, tea, cereal, and green leafy vegetables. Traditional food was usually obtained through food-seeking activities and farming that included gathering edible fruits and vegetables (stinky bean, fern shoot, and natural herbs), fishing (local fish and prawn), hunting (wild boar, squirrel, and lizards), farming (tuber roots, rambutan, and durian), and raising poultry (chicken and duck). In brief, traditional food was obtained from their surrounding environment without involving money.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The thematic analysis revealed four potential themes which contributed to household food insecurity among the OA under traditional food systems. The aforementioned themes were the failure in agriculture, the ineffectiveness of traditional food searching methods, water issues, and weather.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2.1. The Failure in Agriculture</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of the failure in agriculture, the informants expressed their concerns of the agricultural products cultivated from their farms being under the threat from wild animals, such as wild boars, monkeys, and rats if not guarded properly. The wild animals that invaded the farms, not only stole the agricultural products, but also destroyed the plants. It was reported that this case was faced by the Senoi and Proto-Malay groups only. </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Informant 15: 
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>“The products were eaten by the foxes and the birds. Yes. Today, when I went there (farm), everything seemed fine. However, tomorrow or the day after, when I went there, the wild boars might have eaten the products. I guard my farm myself. I do the patrol around the farm. I find the rattans, cut the bamboos, to build a guard post. I guard it myself. There are animals out there which eat our products. Sometimes, when we plant tuber roots, the wild boars eat it. As for pumpkins, the insects from the forest eat them. The insects eat… the grasshoppers eat the shoots of the tuber plants until nothing is left behind.”</p>

   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the informants were concerned with the lack of arable land for them to carry out self-sustainable agricultural activities. Orang Asli did not possess the arable lands nearby and the lands were taken to run domestic agricultural activities and mining. The Senoi and Proto-Malay were the only groups who were reported to face this issue:</p>

    <p>“For example, I really do not own any piece of land. It is not belonged to me. Whatever farms you can see here are all belonged to the other people.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2.2. The Ineffectiveness of Traditional Food-Seeking Methods</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides the failure in agriculture, the ineffectiveness of traditional food seeking methods was found to be another theme which explained the failure of the OA to achieve household food security. This is because this method only depends on wild plants and animals from their surrounding environment. Furthermore, food gathering and hunting were described as time-consuming, dangerous, uncertain, and exhausting. Despite the hard work, traditional food-seeking activities did not always guarantee enough food. These factors were reported by all three ethnic groups involved during the interview. </p>

   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>“Searching for food is not easy. Sometimes, the food that we wish to find is available, but sometimes it is not. Especially when we go fishing. Sometimes the fish bites, and sometimes we have to go back home with empty hands.”</p>

   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to deforestation, the condition of the food insecurity among informants worsened due to the depletion of natural commodities in the forests. Forests provide habitat for various flora and fauna. Many species that OA depended on for food cannot survive due to loss of home. This factor was reported by all three ethnic groups (Senoi, Proto-Malay, Negrito). </p>

   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the demand for natural commodities, such as herbs, was no longer popular compared to the demand for these resources from decades ago. This led to the drop in the price of the natural commodities. This factor was reported by all three ethnic groups (Senoi, Proto-Malay, Negrito). </p>

   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The informants were also reported to abandon hunting activities due to the lack of the equipment needed. Weapons were needed to hunt big-sized animals (e.g., wild boar and deer). This problem was found to occur among all ethnic groups, namely Senoi, Proto-Malay, and Negrito. </p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2.3. Water Issues</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was found that the 
   <span class="italic">Orang Asli</span> in Malaysia were still burdened with the problems of obtaining sufficient clean water supply which explained the failure of the OA to achieve household food security. Water issues were labeled as the third theme under factors associated with household food insecurity among OA. To be specific, the water supply was reported to be inconsistent due to the blockage of the pipe system, especially after the rain. Besides, agricultural and logging activities became a concern as these activities contaminated the rivers or lakes which were known to be the primary water sources for the OA. The river became muddy especially after raining due to deforestation. Meanwhile, the OA were worried about the possible leakage of pesticides used for domestic agriculture activities into the rivers. This problem was reported by all ethnic groups in the present study.

    <p>“For me, if I want to declare the water supply that I got is clean is not true. (The water) may be considered moderately clean. The problem is due to land clearing and logging, water is affected and is no longer clean. When it rains, water looks muddy.”</p>

When it rains… during the dry seasons, the water looks a bit clear. However, when it rains, it looks a bit muddy. Therefore, it is hard for us to get obtain a clean water supply. Water supplies cannot be continued as sometimes the pipe is blocked during the rain and we need to go repair it. Therefore, the actual problem is the blocked pipe, not the water.”</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2.4. Weather</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This issue fell under the fourth theme which explained the failure of the OA to achieve household food security. To be specific, Malaysia experiences two monsoon seasons, namely the southwest monsoon (June to September) and northeast monsoon (November to March) as well as two inter-monsoon seasons (October and April to May). The southwest monsoon brings rain to the east coast while the northeast monsoon increases rainfall to the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia [
   <a rid="B24-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-nutrients-10-01455">24</a>]. The extreme rainy season was found to interrupt economic activities, such as rubber tapping, mining, and searching for natural commodities in the forests. Furthermore, heavy rain also led to the occurrence of floods which destroyed the farms cultivated by the OA. This problem was found to occur among all ethnic groups in the present study.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Informant 46: 
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>“Due to the raining season, we become jobless. It is hard to find a job. Some of the available jobs are related to farm works, such as rubber tapping. These jobs are usually pursued through contracts and recruits are unneeded due to rain. Workers are recruited only during dry seasons. This is why sometimes earning money is not an easy task for us.”</p>

    <p>“A bit tough when the rainy season arrives. Cannot earn money. For example, we want to search vegetables or want to harvest the banana for sale are also restricted, people (traders) do not want the products. In addition, people (traders) do not travel here to pick up the products.”</p>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, the extreme dry season reduced the chance of successful harvesting as crops or vegetables might die before the plants got to be full grown. This factor was also reported by all ethnic groups in the present study.</p>
