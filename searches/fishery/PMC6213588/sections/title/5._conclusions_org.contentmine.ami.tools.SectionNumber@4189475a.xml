 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the OA generally rely on the knowledge they inherit from their ancestors regarding nature for their survival. The traditional food systems are essential for the OA to obtain food for the daily consumption of the household members. However, due to the negative effects in the midst of urbanization, the availability of food in the natural environment to support their livelihood has been reduced. As a result, the OA have shifted to modern food systems, where food is purchased from the markets to fulfill their needs. According to the recent trend, the deterioration of the traditional food systems is due to five factors, which include the failure in agriculture, the ineffectiveness of traditional food-seeking methods, water issues, and weather. These are the important findings which have distinguished the contexts of the OAâ€™s household food insecurity from the contexts of the general population. Moreover, the findings of this study have proven that household food insecurity among the OA is an existing phenomenon, and a clear picture of the issue has been provided to demonstrate the unfortunate situation faced by this community. With this, it is recommended that local authorities and non-governmental organizations take this issue seriously due to the hazardous impacts it can bring to the health of its victims. Through a proper understanding of the household food insecurity among the OA, drastic measures could be taken by the responsible authorities in order to relieve the OA from this problem.</p>
