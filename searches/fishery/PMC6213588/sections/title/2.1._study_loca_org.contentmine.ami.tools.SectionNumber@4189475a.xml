 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The locations for this study were selected purposefully based on the number of the food assistant recipients under JAKOA. The list of food recipient names from each administrative region was obtained from the JAKOA state headquarters or the JAKOA administrative offices. The administrative regions were then divided into three groups, namely Senoi dominant, Proto-Malay dominant, and Negrito dominant. Then, one district was selected under each ethnic cluster. The villages from each district were also purposefully selected using the priority given to the particular villages with a high number of food assistant recipients.

Lastly, Rompin is a district located at the southeast corner of Pahang State, and Proto-Malay appears to be dominant in this region.
