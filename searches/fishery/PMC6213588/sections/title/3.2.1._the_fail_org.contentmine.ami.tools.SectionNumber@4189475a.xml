 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of the failure in agriculture, the informants expressed their concerns of the agricultural products cultivated from their farms being under the threat from wild animals, such as wild boars, monkeys, and rats if not guarded properly. The wild animals that invaded the farms, not only stole the agricultural products, but also destroyed the plants. It was reported that this case was faced by the Senoi and Proto-Malay groups only. </p>

   <p>“The products were eaten by the foxes and the birds. Yes. Today, when I went there (farm), everything seemed fine. However, tomorrow or the day after, when I went there, the wild boars might have eaten the products. I guard my farm myself. I do the patrol around the farm. I find the rattans, cut the bamboos, to build a guard post. I guard it myself. There are animals out there which eat our products. Sometimes, when we plant tuber roots, the wild boars eat it. As for pumpkins, the insects from the forest eat them. The insects eat… the grasshoppers eat the shoots of the tuber plants until nothing is left behind.”</p>

   <p>“It (wild boar) eats the tapioca. It eats the sweet potatoes. It eats the banana tree. If we plant the pineapple, it also eats the pineapple. Nowadays, there are many wild boars.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the informants were concerned with the lack of arable land for them to carry out self-sustainable agricultural activities. Orang Asli did not possess the arable lands nearby and the lands were taken to run domestic agricultural activities and mining. The Senoi and Proto-Malay were the only groups who were reported to face this issue:</p>

   <p>“For example, I really do not own any piece of land. It is not belonged to me. Whatever farms you can see here are all belonged to the other people.</p>

   <p>“Not enough land. Only have a small piece of land. Do not have new land because all have been cleared up to become the (domestic) farms.”</p>
