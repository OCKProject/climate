 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The findings provided evidence regarding the presence of household food insecurity among the OA, especially among those with the low socioeconomic background. Overall, the factors of household food insecurity under traditional food systems included the failure in agriculture, the ineffectiveness of traditional food seeking methods, water issues, and weather. Presence of challenges in conducting traditional food-seeking activities implies that food sovereignty of the OA was violated due to deforestation and pollution of the water sources. Orang Asli were found to have no control over their territories where they obtained their food (forests, rivers, lakes, and arable lands nearby their villages) from destruction as a consequence of the economic activities that were conducted by third parties [
  <a rid="B25-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-nutrients-10-01455">25</a>,
  <a rid="B26-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-nutrients-10-01455">26</a>]. This finding is important for a better understanding of the hardships faced by the OA so that counteracting policies can be implemented for an improved standard of living. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first factor of household food insecurity among the OA was the failure in agriculture. Most of the OA cultivated their own farms either at the nearby forests or beside their houses. However, their farms were always under the threat of wild animals, such as wild boars. A similar finding was reported by Zakari et al. [
  <a rid="B27-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-nutrients-10-01455">27</a>] as the occurrence of diseases and presence of insects in the farms were found to be related with household food insecurity among the farmers at Kollo district, Southern Niger. Besides, some informants reported that insufficient agricultural lands disrupted the OA’s self-sustainable agricultural activities which should have been done to support the needs of their household members. As a result, the vulnerability to food insecurity of the households that owned no or small agricultural lands increased. This happened as the nearby lands in the villages were taken over for the development of mining sites, logging sites, or cash crop plantations, such as palm oil trees and rubber trees [
  <a rid="B28-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-nutrients-10-01455">28</a>]. Similarly, insufficient agricultural land puts a limit on food availability for household members’ daily consumption, and it dwindles the economic income that can be generated from the cultivation of household farms [
  <a rid="B29-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-nutrients-10-01455">29</a>]. The importance of land in preventing household food insecurity by increasing the household income was reported by Kirimi et al. [
  <a rid="B30-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-nutrients-10-01455">30</a>] in Kenya, who pointed out that the ownership of lands for households was found to reduce the risk of poverty (low household income to fulfil the needs of the basic food and non-food necessities) and help the households overcome food insecurity. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Naturally, OA are well-known for their capability of finding their own food from their surroundings, either from the forests, rivers, or lakes. One of the factors which was believed to have led to the obstacles faced by the OA in finding sufficient food is the depletion of food resources. This is the result of deforestation due to logging activities, either conducted legally or illegally. Furthermore, Malaysia had reported an increasing forest loss from 2000 to 2012 [
  <a rid="B31-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-nutrients-10-01455">31</a>]. Not only that, insufficient proper equipment restricts the OA’s from carrying out hunting activities for food. Similar challenges were also found to occur to other groups of Indigenous People worldwide. For example, a study conducted on Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation from the Old Crow and Tlingit households in Teslin, Canada found that insufficient time and limited availability of traditional food were the factors that disrupted the continuation of hunting activities. Other factors that disrupted the continuation of hunting activities included the unaffordable price of harvesting tools, cultural loss, and the concern of contamination [
  <a rid="B32-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-nutrients-10-01455">32</a>]. In addition, the challenge faced by the Inuit communities at Pangnirtung, Nunavut, Canada was that their activity of food-searching around their surroundings was disrupted due to climate change, environmental degradation, market economy, globalization, acculturation, and nutrition transition [
  <a rid="B33-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-nutrients-10-01455">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were two main issues associated with water supply, namely the disruption of the water supply and the concern for the cleanliness of the water. The disruption of the water supply was mainly due to the lack of maintenance and blockage of personal water pipes by sand or dry leaves after the rain, which prevented water from flowing to the reservoir. The reservoir is where all the villagers obtain water. In the case of the cleanliness of water, the informants voiced their concern about the pollution of the river near their area due to logging and agricultural activities [
  <a rid="B34-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-nutrients-10-01455">34</a>]. A shift in the pattern of diseases among OA such as hepatitis A and B, tuberculosis, and dermatological and gastroenterological problems was related to the use of polluted water [
  <a rid="B35-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-nutrients-10-01455">35</a>]. Besides, many other diseases were associated with this pollution issue, which included skin diseases, diarrhea, dysentery, respiratory illnesses, anemia, and complications in childbirth [
  <a rid="B36-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-nutrients-10-01455">36</a>]. Therefore, water issues among the OA should be taken seriously in order to prevent these illnesses from spreading.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the recent years, Malaysia faced several episodes of extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, and heat waves [
  <a rid="B37-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-nutrients-10-01455">37</a>]. Provided that the OA’s quality of life is dependent on their surrounding environment, the weather is believed to be another factor which may determine the status of their household food security. Moreover, the interaction between extreme climate and the status of household food security was shown in Bahiigwa’s [
  <a rid="B38-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-nutrients-10-01455">38</a>] study, which demonstrated a fluctuating pattern in the prevalence rate of food insecurity in 1000 households from four geographical regions in Uganda (western, central, eastern, and northern). This was due to the lack of rainfall, pests and diseases, and excessive rain. Likewise, Niles and Salermo [
  <a rid="B39-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-nutrients-10-01455">39</a>] revealed that households from 15 countries in Latin America, Africa, and South Asia that faced climate shock had a higher likelihood to experience household food insecurity. Meanwhile, the Food and Agriculture Organization [
  <a rid="B40-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-nutrients-10-01455">40</a>] showed that climate had the potential to influence the quantities and types of food produced and the amount of the production-related income. At the same time, the extreme weather might have adverse impacts as it could destroy the transportation and distribution facilities, and it could increase the risk of food insecurity among the vulnerable groups within the community. Besides, unfavorable rainfall patterns and temperature were reported to lead to the decline in the availability of wild food that is needed by many families in the midst of food shortage. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several limitations to this study. The villages selected for this study were located where researchers could easily travel to by normal car. This indicated that the village location was connected to the nearby town by several roads. For this reason, the informants did not only depend on traditional food systems for food-seeking and gaining access to food markets. Therefore, one of the recommendations is that the OA from both remote and suburban villages should be involved in similar future studies. The other limitation of this research could be seen from the participants who were limited to female informants. In contrast, the involvement of male informants may improve the information obtained in a study through different question sets being used for male and female informants [
  <a rid="B20-nutrients-10-01455" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-nutrients-10-01455">20</a>]. To be specific, the questions for male informants could focus on the socioeconomic activities of the households, while the questions for female informants could focus on the dietary patterns of the household members. Another limitation of this study was the use of a translation service, which might affect the validity of information obtained from the informants. In this case, translators might unintentionally provide unnecessary hints to the informants at some point in the interview. In order to prevent such biases from occurring, translators should be properly trained prior to data collection, and they need to always be reminded to not provide additional explanation to the informants.
