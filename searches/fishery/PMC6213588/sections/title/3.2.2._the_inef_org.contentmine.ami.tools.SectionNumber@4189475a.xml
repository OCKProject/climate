 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides the failure in agriculture, the ineffectiveness of traditional food seeking methods was found to be another theme which explained the failure of the OA to achieve household food security. This is because this method only depends on wild plants and animals from their surrounding environment. Furthermore, food gathering and hunting were described as time-consuming, dangerous, uncertain, and exhausting. Despite the hard work, traditional food-seeking activities did not always guarantee enough food. These factors were reported by all three ethnic groups involved during the interview. </p>

   <p>“When my husband travels to the forest, there are a lot of challenges awaiting him, such as the presence of elephants, tigers, snakes, and centipedes.”</p>

  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“Searching for food is not easy. Sometimes, the food that we wish to find is available, but sometimes it is not. Especially when we go fishing. Sometimes the fish bites, and sometimes we have to go back home with empty hands.”</p>

   <p>“The road… the road is covered with mud. We need to go through the bushes too. Sometimes, the walking path is covered by stones. Climbing up and down, up and down the hills.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to deforestation, the condition of the food insecurity among informants worsened due to the depletion of natural commodities in the forests. Forests provide habitat for various flora and fauna. Many species that OA depended on for food cannot survive due to loss of home. This factor was reported by all three ethnic groups (Senoi, Proto-Malay, Negrito). </p>

   <p>“It (the fern shoot) is not available here, very hard to find. Want to eat (wild) vegetables, but it is not available. (The place with fern shoots is) only reachable by a motorcycle as it is far away. Do not have (wild vegetables here), if you find at surrounding here, (you) only manage to get a few, three or four sticks. Not enough to eat.”</p>

   <p>“Difficult. It was quite easy in the old days, but now, it is hard. Due to some people who conduct the mining activities, and because of that, the natural products of the forest are no longer available. At the side (of the forest) where people conduct the tin ore mining activities, the forest will be demolished.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the demand for natural commodities, such as herbs, was no longer popular compared to the demand for these resources from decades ago. This led to the drop in the price of the natural commodities. This factor was reported by all three ethnic groups (Senoi, Proto-Malay, Negrito). </p>

   <p>“It is not sold at high price, not very high and sometimes it is sold in low price. Take the herbs with medical value from the forest as an example, we get three Ringgit fifty cents for a kilogram. If we manage to get a few kilograms, we get a few dozen Ringgit.”</p>

   <p>“Only my husband knows about the price of the natural commodities. The price was only known before though. Nowadays, no one has been requesting for natural herbs. For example, people requested Tongkat Ali (a traditional medicine) only during the old days. It is no longer requested now.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The informants were also reported to abandon hunting activities due to the lack of the equipment needed. Weapons were needed to hunt big-sized animals (e.g., wild boar and deer). This problem was found to occur among all ethnic groups, namely Senoi, Proto-Malay, and Negrito. </p>

   <p>“I do not have an equipment for fishing. How can I go fishing? (Besides that, it is) hard to get wild animals. No gun is available for hunting. (We) do not have an equipment (for the activities).”</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Informant 50:

   <p>“It is because we do not have the equipment for fishing. We do not have the gun for hunting.”</p>
