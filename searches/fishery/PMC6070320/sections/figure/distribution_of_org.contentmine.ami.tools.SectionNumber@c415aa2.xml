  <div class="title">Distribution of industrial fishing effort by vessels flagged to nations from different income classes as measured using AIS data and convolutional neural network models.</div>
  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) The percent of fishing effort (measured in fishing hours) detected globally on the high seas and in all EEZs for vessels flagged to nations from four different World Bank income groups. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) The percent of AIS-detected industrial fishing effort in all EEZs, grouped by the World Bank income groups of the EEZs. Here, the category Domestic fishing is included, which refers to instances when a fishing country was fishing in its own EEZ. Other categories represent foreign fishing effort conducted within an EEZ by a nation flagged to one of the four World Bank income classes. “Invalid identity” refers to vessels with a Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number that did not accurately refer to an individual country. “Unclassified” refers to fishing entities that were fishing in an EEZ but did not have a World Bank income group. All data presented here are summarized from the year 2016.
