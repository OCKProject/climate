 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How nations share access to fish in the oceans significantly influences global food security, wealth distribution, competition between industrial and small-scale fisheries, and even international conflict. Globally, approximately 110 million metric tons of marine wild fish are caught annually, with an estimated annual value of over 171 billion USD for reported and unreported catch (

   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). Approximately 3 billion people receive 20% of their average intake of animal protein from aquatic animals, and in certain countries the per capita intake can be &gt;50% (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). Contributions to human health from seafood-derived nutrients other than protein may be even more important. It has been estimated, for example, that 845 million people are currently at risk of experiencing deficiencies of essential micronutrients including zinc, iron, and vitamin A, a number expected to increase if projected declines in fisheries catch potential and per capita fish supply continue into 2050 (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). Conflict over fishery resource sharing has also shaped historical patterns of regional stability and promises to continue to do so in the near future (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). The dynamics by which we divide up global fisheries resources also shape competition between large-scale, capital-intense industrial fisheries and small-scale fisheries, with cascading effects upon the health, prosperity, and well-being of the communities that depend on small-scale fisheries (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Describing fishing patterns in comprehensive and quantitative terms, both in national waters and on the high seas, is challenging due to the lack of open access to detailed records on the behavior of fishing vessels. However, advances in machine learning technologies and big data capacity now offer us access to high-resolution fishing vessel activity from 22 billion automatic identification systems (AIS) points, processed by the Global Fishing Watch platform using convolutional neural network models (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). We analyzed these data to generate a global, fishery-independent assessment of the amount of industrial fishing effort conducted by vessels flagged to higher-income nations (that is, World Bank categories “high income” and “upper middle income” combined) and lower-income nations (that is, World Bank categories “lower middle income” and “low income” combined). We concentrate this analysis solely on industrial fishing (defined here as all vessels &gt;24 m) (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>) because industrial fishing is the dominant fishery on the high seas, it is much more readily visible via AIS data than small-scale fishing, and it globally accounts for an estimated 84 million metric tons and 119 billion USD [3.1 times more biomass and 2.3 times more revenue than smaller-scale artisanal fishing (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>)].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyzing and communicating patterns of the distribution of fishing effort by different nations on the high seas are especially timely and important given the immediate opportunity to use these data to shape progress toward a United Nations treaty being developed for biodiversity on the high seas (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). Resources on the high seas are unique with respect to their governance, as they have been designated as international resources that are to be cooperatively managed. Currently, fisheries are overseen by regional fishery management organizations, but both geographic and taxonomic gaps in coverage exist (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>). New insight derived from these big data analyses of high seas fisheries can help decision makers at the United Nations identify how different policy interventions may affect high seas stakeholders and can highlight which states have the most opportunity and responsibility for the development of this emerging treaty (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding the distribution of fishing effort in a nation’s marine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is also useful for policy-making, especially in the context of access agreements that allow foreign fishing in a nation’s waters. Existing research has highlighted the fact that fleets from higher-income nations travel farther to fish after they deplete their own fish populations, increase their per capita fish intake, or otherwise experience increases in seafood demand (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). The increased capacity and improved technology characteristic of higher-income nations have also enabled these countries to build and operate their own distant water fishing fleets, and often to subsidize those fleets heavily (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>). Lower-income countries usually lack the same capacity to industrially catch their fish populations and thus frequently enter into fishing access agreements with these wealthier countries, sanctioning foreign fishing within their national waters. There are numerous challenges that have been raised concerning the sustainability and equitability of these arrangements. For example, the benefits projected to accrue from these partnerships, such as revenue and investment in local technology and infrastructure, have not always lived up to their promise (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>). In addition, lower-income nations have in some cases failed to adequately assess and manage their fisheries, including foreign exploitation (
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>). Addressing any shortcomings in these fishing access agreements has become even more pressing as concerns about food security have increased in the many areas of the world where people are nutritionally dependent on seafood and the sustainability of seafood supply is threatened by overfishing and climate change (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>). It is now imperative to have a clear view of who is controlling access to fish within a nation’s EEZ and whether fish as food are making it to the food insecure. Quantitative and open assessments of the degree to which foreign fishing occurs, particularly within the waters of lower-income nations, can help diverse stakeholders more thoughtfully engage in national-level conversations about fishery resource sharing.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The AIS-derived measures of fishing effort have proven uniquely insightful. They have been used for marine protected area surveillance (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>), to examine how environmental variability shapes fishing behavior (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>), to quantify the overlap between marine wildlife and fisheries (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>), and to assess the economic costs and benefits of high seas fishing (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). However, AIS presently does not detect all industrial fishing effort and has a number of limitations. As a means of quantitatively evaluating these potential biases and gaps, we (i) directly compared differences between fishing activity detected using AIS and traditional national-level published registries of industrial fishing vessels; (ii) compared patterns of fishing effort detected using the open AIS data and closed access proprietary vessel monitoring system (VMS) data voluntarily shared by a lower-income nation, Indonesia, which hosts the largest industrial fishing fleet of all lower-income nations; and (iii) compared our AIS-estimated fishing effort outputs against measures of fishing catch drawn from the Sea Around Us database (including newly updated high seas catch estimates) (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). Our examination of biases using these methods provides a first means to constructively contextualize and cautiously interpret these AIS-derived patterns.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The outputs from our analyses reveal profound heterogeneities in the distribution of AIS-detectable industrial fishing effort. Overall, these results present a valuable quantitative and open opportunity for diverse stakeholders to reexamine a number of important questions surrounding how marine fisheries resources are globally shared. Results such as this may assist in constructively designing policies for marine areas both within and beyond boundaries of national jurisdiction that promote responsible and equitable sharing of the wealth, food, and biodiversity found in our oceans.</p>
