 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an effort to begin to evaluate the level of vessel coverage afforded by the above reported AIS-derived measures of fishing effort, we compared the number of unique industrial fishing vessels categorized as actively fishing in the Global Fishing Watch vessel database to the total number of industrial fishing vessels recorded in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) vessel registry (

   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). During the period of our study, we detected a global total of 30,469 active vessels matching our definition of industrial fishing (that is, &gt;24 m in length). This figure represented 59% of the global total number of fishing vessels &gt;24 m logged in the FAO registry (fig. S5). Alignment of vessel counts between these two data sets was stronger for vessels flagged to higher-income nations than lower-income nations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we conducted the same AIS-based analyses including smaller-sized vessels (industrial fishing threshold defined at &gt;12 m instead of vessels &gt;24 m), our conclusion that higher-income vessels dominate industrial fishing on the high seas and within EEZs was only further confirmed (fig. S6). As a means of assessing and potentially adjusting for possible lower AIS detection rates of industrial fishing vessels in lower-income nations, we compared AIS-derived estimates of industrial fishing during 2016 to closed access VMS-derived estimates of industrial fishing from data shared voluntarily by Indonesia. Both the number of individual industrial fishing vessels and the amount of estimated fishing effort were found to be lower in AIS estimates than in VMS estimates for Indonesia (fig. S7). When these calculated AIS/VMS differences for Indonesia were used to create correction factors for lack of AIS vessel visibility for other lower-income nations (see Supplementary Materials and Methods), this increases the amount of projected lower-income fishing effort on the high seas and within the waters of lower-income EEZs (fig. S8). However, even when these VMS-informed corrections are included, these results do not qualitatively change the directionality or bulk conclusions of the patterns reported in the AIS-only results, namely, that vessels flagged to higher-income nations dominate industrial fishing effort on the high seas, within EEZs globally, within low-income EEZs (64%), and nearly dominate within lower middleâ€“income EEZs (48%).</p>
