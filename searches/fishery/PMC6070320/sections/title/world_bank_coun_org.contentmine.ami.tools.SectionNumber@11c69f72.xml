 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All unique vessels were assigned to one of four World Bank income group country categories: high income, upper middle income, lower middle income, or low income (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldbank.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.worldbank.org</span>; using 2016 classifications). Throughout, we refer to “higher-income nations” to collectively indicate nations classed as either high income or upper middle income. Likewise, we refer to “lower-income” nations when collectively indicating nations classed as lower middle income or low income. We adopt here World Bank practices of using the term “country” (interchangeably with nation and state) to refer to a statistically relevant economic data reporting entity, without any implication of political independence. The proportion of industrial fishing effort attributed to nations from different income categories was compared at the global level, and analyses were then subdivided between the high seas, EEZs, and ocean basins. Fishing effort observed on the high seas and each EEZ was aggregated by the flag state of vessels involved in fishing activity. EEZs without a designated World Bank income classification (high/upper middle/lower middle/low) were excluded from the analysis. The EEZs of state territories were not included because fishing agreements and policies vary widely between territory entities and their sovereign state (table S6). Any fishing vessel whose MMSI marine identification digits indicated that it was flagged to a territory was listed as an unclassified entity in this analysis. When a vessel’s flag state was the same as the EEZ it was fishing in, it was classified as domestic fishing. When the MMSI marine identification digits of a vessel did not correspond to a specific flag state or the MMSI number was incompletely reported, the vessel was classified as invalid identity. Ocean basin delineations were based on those of the International Hydrographic Organization; fishing activity that took place outside of these ocean basins (that is, the Red Sea) was not included when comparing fishing activity by ocean basin. The boundaries for both oceanic basins and EEZs were obtained from
