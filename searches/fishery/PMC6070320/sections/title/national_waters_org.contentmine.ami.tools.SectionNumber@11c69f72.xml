 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globally, vessels flagged to higher-income nations made up the vast majority (97%) of all industrial fishing effort detected in EEZs for 2016 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1A</a>). In the EEZs of higher-income nations, fishing effort was predominantly attributed to each nation’s domestic fishing fleet, making up 89% of fishing effort in high-income EEZs and 93% of fishing effort in upper middle–income EEZs. Conversely, domestic fishing made up very little of the overall fishing effort in lower-income nations. Eighty-four percent of the industrial fishing effort in lower-income EEZs was conducted by foreign countries, with the majority of this industrial fishing effort (78%) from vessels flagged to high- and upper middle–income nations. Most AIS-detectable industrial fishing effort that was observed within all EEZs was detected in the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean (60 and 35% of total fishing effort observed in all EEZs respectively; fig. S4). Patterns were consistent across the 2 years studied with nearly identical patterns recorded in 2015 (fig. S1B).
