 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new view afforded from this open AIS-based analysis of global fishing activity reveals stark levels of unevenness with respect to wealth class for industrial fishing effort. Globally, 97% of all industrial fishing effort detectable using AIS (on the high seas and within EEZs) comes from vessels flagged to higher-income nations—or 23 million total hours of industrial fishing effort in 2016. This same pattern of dominance by higher-income nations repeats itself on the high seas, within the EEZs of higher-income nations, and within the EEZs of lower-income nations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the high seas, 97% of all such fishing effort detectable by AIS is conducted by vessels flagged to higher-income nations. Dominance of this high seas industrial fishing effort at the level of flag nation was highly uneven. The vast majority (86%) of this effort can be attributed to only five higher-income countries/entities, in rank order (high to low; table S2): China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Spain. When China and Taiwan are analyzed together, they account for approximately 52% of the industrial fishing effort we detected on the high seas, which, by reference, is an amount approximately 12 and 27 times greater than the high seas fishing effort detected for the United States and Russia (two other large nations), respectively. The only two lower-income nations that ranked among the top 20 nations with the highest amount of AIS detectable industrial fishing effort on the high seas were Vanuatu and Ukraine (both lower middle–income nations). Vanuatu is a nation with an open vessel registry (colloquially known as a “flag of convenience”) that has been reported to include many vessels owned and controlled by higher-income foreign nations (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). The majority of the Ukraine fleet is owned by the Ukrainian government.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We observed strong dominance of vessels flagged to higher-income nations with respect to industrial fishing effort on the high seas in all ocean basins (fig. S2). The majority of the industrial fishing effort we identified on the high seas was observed in the Pacific Ocean, a pattern likely reflecting the intensity of tuna fisheries in the Pacific. Overall, these AIS-derived estimates for the distribution of industrial fishing effort on the high seas are qualitatively similar to other estimations created by key actors tracking industrial fishing on the high seas. For example, quantitative assessments of fisheries landings and estimations of the value of these landings likewise suggest that wealthy nations dominate fisheries resources on the high seas (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Very similar dominance patterns were reported in our analysis of the world’s EEZs, where the majority of AIS-detectable industrial fishing effort within national waters was executed by vessels flagged to higher-income nations. We emphasize, however, that a strongly divergent pattern emerges from our analyses of fishing effort density within the EEZs of higher- and lower-income nations. The vast majority of AIS-detected fishing effort within the EEZs of higher-income countries came from their own fishing fleets (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). Nearly the inverse was true for lower-income nations, where foreign fishing vessels (mostly flagged to high- and upper middle–income countries) dominated the industrial fishing effort in their EEZs. Most of the industrial fishing effort in lower-income EEZs was conducted by foreign countries, with the majority of this effort from vessels flagged to high- and upper middle–income nations. As an example of this dichotomy, the vast majority of the AIS-detected industrial fishing in high-income Spain’s EEZ (96%) was recorded from vessels flagged to Spain. In contrast, in low-income Guinea-Bissau, the vast majority of the industrial fishing effort we detected came from foreign flagged vessels (95%), including 45% from Spain (table S1). Globally, the three countries showing the greatest fishing activity in other nations’ EEZs were (from high to low) China, Taiwan, and South Korea. China and Taiwan together accounted for 44% of this global foreign fishing (table S3). We detected fishing effort from China alone in the marine waters of approximately 40% of all non-landlocked nations (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 60 distinct EEZs). China, Taiwan, and South Korea (from high to low) also carried out the highest amounts of foreign fishing effort recorded globally in lower-income EEZs, or approximately 63% of all such effort detected (table S4). There are certainly exceptions to the bulk pattern of higher-income dominance of fishing effort in lower-income EEZs. In some lower-income nations, such as India, there was virtually no detectable higher-income fishing within their EEZs. These patterns may be explained in part by national legislation prohibiting or limiting foreign fishing within such EEZs, but could also result from joint fishing regimes occurring within these EEZs.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The patterns of industrial fishing effort within EEZs derived using these AIS-based techniques reinforce and extend conclusions drawn elsewhere using other methodologies and data sources. For example, analyses of fisheries production and trade data reveal a persistent trend whereby wealthy nations fish in the waters of less wealthy nations, but not vice versa (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>). The relatively recent emergence of the capacity to track industrial fishing effort using AIS prevents examination of the history of this buildup. Elsewhere, however, it has been suggested that the ascendancy in dominance of more wealthy nations fishing within the waters of less wealthy nations (for example, Europe in Northwest Africa) has occurred within the last several decades (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our AIS-derived estimates of industrial fishing effort agree, in some but not all instances (table S1), with published catch reconstruction data (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>). Differences in governance appear to explain some of the deviation between these two data sources. For example, in high-income nations in the European Union, where laws and enforcement of AIS regulation in national waters are strong and compliance is expected to be high, we see high congruence among the top five countries in AIS and catch reconstruction estimates of fishing activity, and these top-ranked countries often contributed the vast majority of the overall effort (table S1) (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). However, in lower-income nations where enforcement of AIS regulations is sometimes, but not always, lacking, there were many examples of poor alignment. In Sierra Leone’s EEZ, for example, vessels from Italy and China were the top rank–ordered fishing entities recorded using AIS, making up 90% of this fishing effort, while reconstructed catch data estimated that the two most active nations, Sierra Leone (domestic fishing) and Russia, caught 93% of the total catch. Explanations for this discrepancy include the following: that industrial fishing vessels flagged to Russia and Sierra Leone were not transmitting AIS; that cancellation of a World Bank project in the region that occurred during this period may have reduced capacity for monitoring, control, and surveillance (MCS) activities (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>); an increase in illegal fishing displaced from Guinea’s EEZ to the north due to increased MCS there (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>); that top nations observed fishing using AIS (for example, Italy and China) were not reporting catch; or that there is extreme year-to-year volatility in the players involved in industrial fishing in Sierra Leone, which complicates comparisons of the 2014 catch data to the 2016 AIS-derived effort data. The difficulty of interpreting year-to-year volatility in Sierra Leone fishing activity was further increased by the Ebola outbreak that occurred in the region during this period, which necessarily diverted attention from traditional fisheries reporting and enforcement efforts and may have accelerated levels of foreign fishing (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). Another general explanation for some of the observed deviations between the AIS and catch reconstruction measures of industrial fishing in other contexts may derive from the fact that the catch reconstruction data will, in some cases, reassign catch from vessels flagged to a particular country to the nation of origin or ownership for the vessel. In the Seychelles, for example, catch from Seychelles-flagged, foreign-owned vessels was assigned in the catch reconstruction data to these foreign countries or to the category “unknown fishing country.” A large portion of the catch in the unknown countries category is likely to be from Spain, as large Spanish fishing companies own Seychelles-flagged fishing vessels or otherwise operate in the Seychelles under access agreements. Although three of the five top fishing nations were listed in both the AIS and catch reconstructed measures for the Seychelles, the amount of effort attributed to each nation varied. In the AIS measure of fishing effort within the Seychelles EEZ, Taiwan was responsible for 64% of the observed fishing effort followed by the Seychelles-flagged fleet with 25% of the observed fishing effort. Meanwhile, the catch reconstruction data listed “unknown fishing country” for 68.8% of all catch in the Seychelles, followed by Taiwan at 20%; the Seychelles-flagged fleet was listed in fourth place, responsible for 0.4% of all catch in their own EEZ.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In these AIS-based analyses of fishing effort, we did not attempt to differentiate between legal and illegal fishing effort. We wish, however, to directly call attention to the fact that illegal and unreported fishing constitutes an important fraction of the global industrial fishing effort that occurs worldwide. For example, by some estimates, IUU (illegal, unreported, and unregulated) fishing has historically accounted for, on average, 18% of global catch (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>). Determining, however, which of the vessels that we tracked in this analysis using AIS were legally permitted to fish in any given domain of ocean is hampered by a lack of transparency and disclosure for many fishing access agreements (
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>). Furthermore, while some illegal fishing is detectable using AIS data (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>), certainly much illegal and unreported industrial fishing is conducted by vessels lacking or improperly using AIS [often in contravention of International Maritime Organization (IMO) and national maritime regulations] and cannot be tracked. It is difficult to predict exactly if and how inclusion of illegal and unreported fishing behavior would affect the patterns we report. Many high-profile cases have been noted of higher-income nations illegally fishing in lower-income EEZs (for example, European and other more wealthy states illegally fishing in West Africa) (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). However, illegal fishing is perpetrated by vessels flagged to both higher- and lower-income nations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given our direct focus on industrial fishing, this analysis wholly omits any consideration for patterns of catch by artisanal or other small-scale fishing fleets. The focus on industrial fishing in this analysis should not be meant in any way to discount the importance of small-scale fisheries, particularly the vital role they play in coastal community health and food security. For example, it has been estimated that small-scale fisheries may contribute between 25 and 30% of global catch (
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>) and are the source of a large fraction of fish that make it into the diets of local and regional communities. The patterns that we highlight of extensive industrial fishing from vessels flagged to foreign wealthy nations in the EEZs of less wealthy nations are likely to directly affect the future of many artisanal fisheries. It is known in many regions that industrial fisheries can outcompete smaller-scale artisanal fishing, a potentially undesirable outcome in areas where small-scale fisheries use less fuel, are less ecologically damaging, and provide more food and jobs to local communities (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis also does not differentiate between gear types used by industrial fishing vessels. Self-reporting of gear type in AIS data suggests that our pooled analysis of global industrial fishing is dominated numerically (that is, proportion of unique vessels) by trawlers, purse seiners, and longline vessels. Certainly different gear types fish in different ways, which may complicate our estimations of fishing effort made using fishing hours; for example, the extreme time efficiency of purse seiners setting rapidly upon fish aggregating devices is not comparable to more time-intensive fishing methods, such as longline fishing. To investigate the sensitivity of our conclusions to this choice of fishing hours as our currency of measure for fishing effort, we reanalyzed our data measuring fishing effort in the time currency of fishing days. Effort analyses made using fishing days did not change the direction or pattern of our major conclusions for the high seas or within national waters (fig. S2).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We highlight here three major shortcomings of using AIS. First, international and national regulations for the use of AIS and enforcement of these regulations are insufficient in many parts of the high seas and in many EEZs. Many countries adhere to IMO requirements on AIS usage; however, the specifics by which these regulations are codified into national law vary widely, with examples of strict and lax regulation found among both higher- and lower-income nations (see table S5) (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>). Second, industrial fishing vessels in lower-income nations may be less likely to carry and use AIS for reasons unrelated to AIS policy. We note that we detected fewer vessels using AIS than are represented on FAO vessel registries and that there is less AIS visibility for vessels registered to lower-income nations (fig. S5). There are a variety of explanations for these discrepancies. For example, some vessels listed by the FAO may have been inactive during our study or regional officials may have overreported fleet sizes to emphasize local growth. By using VMS data derived from Indonesia, we were able to conservatively estimate upper bound corrections for AIS underreporting in lower-income nations (figs. S7 and S8). This correction, however, only increases the global contribution of lower-income fishing on the high seas by approximately 6% and within the EEZs of lower-income nations by 29%. A third potential weakness of AIS stems from reliance on a vessel’s reported maritime identification digits (MID) to identify flag state. These MID are typically self-reported and may be entered incorrectly. This also relates to the larger, well-known problem of flag states not always corresponding to the state of vessel control or owner residence [rates estimated at 22.4% based on one analysis (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>)], as many vessels operate with flags of convenience to take advantage of lower operational costs, less regulation, and reduced tax liability (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>). Consequently, many vessels that we class in this analysis as flagged to lower middle– or low-income nations may actually have economic ties that are more closely aligned with higher-income nations. A related important nuance not treated in our analysis is that we do not track the actual firms or companies that own or fund the vessels observed through AIS, despite the influence that these firms have over vessel behavior.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Collectively, some of these uncertainties and potential biases inherent to AIS data may act to overestimate fishing effort from higher-income nations (for example, reduced visibility of smaller vessels from lower-income nations), and some may act to underestimate higher-income nation fishing effort (for example, a large number of vessels originating from higher-income nations flagged to lower-income nations known as flags of convenience). Our general conclusion that vessels flagged to higher-income nations dominate industrial fishing on the high seas and within EEZs largely persisted when we aggregated effort by day instead of fishing hour (fig. S2), retested our conclusions using a smaller size threshold (that is, &gt;12 m) for defining industrial fishing vessels (fig. S6), and added a VMS-informed correction for undetected fishing effort in lower-income nations (figs. S7 and S8). Nevertheless, responsible interpretation of the new patterns we report using AIS requires direct consideration of all the aforementioned potential weaknesses and uncertainties.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These AIS-based analyses find that vessels flagged to higher-income nations dominate industrial fishing within the EEZs of lower-income nations. This observation requires explicit consideration in the analysis of development policy and strategy where fisheries governance intersects with food and nutrition policy, trade policy (export promotion, import substitution), wealth creation and economic growth, job creation, and technological innovation. There has been considerable productive and healthy debate concerning how the dominance of higher-income fishing in lower-income nations EEZs shapes these agendas (
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>). These perspectives are diverse and sometimes conflicting.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On one side, many researchers and managers have expressed unease concerning the potential vulnerabilities that may be created by concentrating dominance over fisheries in the hands of a few wealthy nations. These groups sometimes refer to this skew in control over marine resources as “ocean grabbing” or “marine colonialism” and connect the potential risks involved to those often associated with the practices of land or resource grabbing that occurs when wealthy foreign nations or foreign companies take control of terrestrial or agricultural resources or infrastructure in less-wealthy nations (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>). Concerns in these discussions about food sovereignty relate to the rights of local people to control their own food systems, including the ecological dynamics, production pathways, and markets underpinning these systems (
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>). These issues are particularly pronounced in nutritionally sensitive areas like West Africa. Guinea, a low-income nation that is heavily reliant nutritionally on seafood, presents an apt example. Approximately 75% of Guinea’s population (an estimated 10.1 million people) may be vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies in future scenarios with reduced access to seafood, making it one of the most nutritionally vulnerable countries in the world to losses of seafood (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). In this analysis, we estimate that over 80% of the industrial fishing effort we detected in Guinea’s EEZ came from China (table S1), a situation that presents potential challenges. Many argue that a rights-based approach focusing on the human right to adequate food would lead to greater retention of important nutritional resources in lower-income nations, ensuring healthier diets, reduced rates of malnutrition, and increased access to foods of cultural importance (
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>). Significant concern has also been raised about how corruption in some lower-income nations may facilitate misuse of fisheries access payments that prevent such cash from constructively aiding health, development, and growth goals of these nations (
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>). Policy options for meeting rising demand for fish in the Pacific region include actions such as diverting some of the tuna currently exported (and captured mostly by foreign fishing vessels) onto domestic markets of lower-income states (
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>). Another possible opportunity for intervention for stakeholders concerned about foreign dominance of industrial fishing in their national waters derives from the open nature of the data we report and the transparency it fosters. Access to these publicly accessible data feeds creates opportunities for all citizens in lower-income nations to put meaningful questions to their local leaders regarding sanctioned and unsanctioned foreign industrial fishing in their home waters.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Others have argued that allowing higher-income nations to dominate fisheries presents a desirable and efficient pathway for developing nations to turn their natural capital (for example, fish resources) into financial capital (for example, access fees, license fees, taxes, foreign exchange earnings). Building up a domestic industrial fishing fleet, maintaining it, and servicing it require port infrastructure, a trained workforce, processing and handling capacity, and considerable financial capital—all of which can be challenging to mobilize or lacking in many fish-rich lower-income countries. Kiribati provides an example of a country where arguments have been made for the efficiency of translating fish into cash. Kiribati is a lower middle–income nation for which we determined that 99% of the industrial fishing effort within its EEZs was delivered by foreign flagged vessels, with the majority of this effort (91%) coming from higher-income nations. Kiribati reported generating 121.8 million USD in 2016 by selling access to fishing rights in its EEZs, with similarly substantial revenues collected in surrounding years (
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>). Generally, it is not entirely clear that allowing industrial fisheries from wealthier countries to dominate offshore fisheries within less-wealthy nations’ EEZs always has negative food security impacts. The efficiencies of industrialized fisheries allow them to put large quantities of lower-cost fish onto the global market, and this results in a net import of lower-priced processed fish from wealthier nations to poorer nations that, in terms of overall per-capita supply, may help counterbalance the net movement of higher-priced fish from poorer to richer countries (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>). Much of the lower-value fish that is eventually exported back to lower-income nations are small pelagic fish that are particularly nutrient rich (for example, canned anchovetas, sardines, herrings, and mackerels), and while there is concern that an increasing proportion of these fish are going toward aquaculture and livestock feeds (
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
   <span class="italic">42</span>
  </a>), this may represent an important nutritional benefit to developing countries. The global industrial fishing fleet thus plays a part in maintaining and enhancing the contribution of fish to meeting micronutrient requirements in lower-income populations in developing economies (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The capacity to view and analyze large portions of publicly accessible data that reveal how the world divides up a major global resource, like marine fish, is unique. Analogous sources of detailed insight are not, unfortunately, available for other environmentally, socially, and economically important large transnational resource harvest domains, such as logging or mining. The results presented in this analysis represent data-driven hypotheses surrounding distributions of industrial fishing effort that can be thoughtfully considered during the ongoing high seas biodiversity treaty proceedings at the United Nations and by regional fishing management organizations. This information can help these leaders more effectively pursue shared goals for maximizing equity, food security, and sustainability on the high seas in the near future. These patterns also help to clearly identify which states may stand to win or lose from alterations to the current order of high seas biodiversity management and highlight how the hegemonic powers in high seas fishing can constructively assume more responsibility in leading toward this improved future. Observations of the apparent dominance of wealthy foreign nations in the EEZs of less-wealthy nations can similarly empower and inspire both citizens and leaders in these regions to have more constructive discussion about best pathways toward securing sustainable and equitable futures for their domestic fisheries. These data also provide an improved understanding of the scope for potential competition between foreign industrial fleets flagged to wealthy nations and domestic small-scale fisheries—competition that is known to create numerous challenges for affected small-scale fisheries and the stakeholder communities linked to these fisheries (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
   <span class="italic">42</span>
  </a>). The extent and lopsided nature of the dominance of higher-income flag states in industrial fishing can and should also inform ongoing conversations about how fisheries subsidies reform can potentially curb socioecological abuses associated with distant water fishing (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). Addressing all of these issues is a time-sensitive matter. Significant stresses are likely to be placed very soon upon the food future and political stability of many of the marine regions where we highlight greatest levels of imbalance in regimes of industrial fishing (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). Success in meeting these challenges on the high seas and within EEZs will matter both for the future of fisheries and the many stakeholders whose economic bottom lines, nutrition, and well-being depend on sustained long-term use of these resources.
