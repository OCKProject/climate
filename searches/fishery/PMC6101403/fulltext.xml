Globally, streams are expected to experience changes in temperature and flow regime. Previous work has indicated that these changes will likely affect fish distributions, but little work has been conducted examining population level effects of climate change on warmwater fish at the warmest portion of their range. We model several potential climate change-related stressors and the resulting effects on smallmouth bass <italic>Micropterus dolomieu</italic> populations in the Buffalo National River, Arkansas, USA, located near the southern extent of smallmouth bass range. Smallmouth bass are a popular recreational fish in the region and angler harvest likely contributes substantially to annual mortality. We created a simulation model parameterized with data collected from the Buffalo National River to evaluate the relative importance of climate stressors and angler harvest on smallmouth bass populations. Our simulations suggest that increases in springtime temperature and reductions in river discharge during the spawning period could increase recruitment, resulting in increases in adult abundance (8% higher). However, when increased flooding and drought probabilities are considered, our model indicates the Buffalo National River could experience large reductions in adult smallmouth bass abundance (&#x02265;50% decline) and increased probability of extinction compared to present levels. Simulations showed that harvest reduction could be a viable strategy to reduce the negative effects of climate change, but that even with complete closure of harvest, smallmouth bass population levels would still be well below present abundance (46% lower than present). Efforts to reduce flooding and drought effects related to climate change in the Buffalo National River could help offset the predicted reduction in the smallmouth bass population.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this work was provided by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.

Stream fishes may be particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. For example, climate change could affect stream fishes through changes in stream discharge patterns such as increased flooding chances [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Spring floods can lead to failed year classes of fishes in streams (e.g., smallmouth bass <italic>Micropterus dolomieu</italic>, [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; Salmonids, [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; shoal bass <italic>Micropterus cataractae</italic>, [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Flooding can affect smallmouth bass year class strength through nest destruction and fry displacement [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]-[<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Flooding can also lead to mortality through rapid changes in water temperature [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Timing of flooding can be important as the size of the fry can determine the response to the flood event [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]-[<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Though chances of flooding could increase due to climate change, in some regions, climate change is also expected to result in an overall reduction in precipitation which could lead to lower mean discharge levels [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recruitment of fish in many stream systems can be positively affected by low discharge levels during the spawning and rearing period which often enhances year class strength [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]-[<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Water temperature will also be affected by climate change and can influence growth and survival of stream fishes [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Changes in stream temperature could also lead to range restrictions or expansions [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because of the many potential effects of climate change on stream systems, it can be difficult to anticipate how stream fishes will be affected.</p><p>Harvest is also an important factor structuring stream fish populations. For example, harvest of stream black bass is an important contributor to mortality in streams open to exploitation (e.g., Suwannee bass and largemouth bass, [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; smallmouth bass, [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]-[<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Climate change will likely make managing harvested fisheries more complex and harvest regulations will need to be adapted as fish populations change [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]-[<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. High harvest levels, when combined with climate and anthropogenic related stressors, could lead to population declines [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As the world population grows, it is likely that fishing pressure will increase, potentially resulting in increased harvest levels that will need to be managed in conjunction with changing climate stressors.</p><p>Smallmouth bass are a warm-water riverine species broadly distributed throughout North America. The Ozark-Ouachita Interior Highlands of Arkansas lie at the southern extent of smallmouth bass native range. The southern region of the United States is projected to warm 3&#x02013;4&#x000b0;C by the year 2050 [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Along with the temperature change is an expected change in precipitation, including more extreme events leading to higher stochasticity and potentially an increase in flooding frequency and severity [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] even though average annual precipitation is projected to decrease slightly in parts of the southern region [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Precipitation patterns are likely to change seasonally and a decrease in precipitation is anticipated in the summer months [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], potentially leading to more severe and longer drought conditions [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. At this southern range extent, smallmouth bass populations may be vulnerable to population declines due to climate change as summer temperatures will likely reach levels that will affect growth and survivorship [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]-[<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], especially during summer drought conditions which are common in Arkansas streams and rivers [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]-[<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Smallmouth bass are at risk of being outcompeted in some lotic habitats by largemouth bass and spotted bass, which both have a competitive advantage over smallmouth bass at higher temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>To investigate the relative effects of angler harvest and climate change on the smallmouth bass population in the Buffalo National River, Arkansas (hereafter, Buffalo River) we created an age-structured population model to simulate various climate and harvest scenarios. The structure for the model was based on previous work comparing land use and climate change effects on lotic smallmouth bass in an Illinois river [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We used empirical data collected in the Buffalo River to create a Ricker recruit-spawner model modified with environmental parameters which was subsequently used to predict annual recruitment of age-0 smallmouth bass within a stage structured simulation model. Our objective was to compare the effects of climate change stressors (i.e., flooding and drought) and harvest mortality on smallmouth bass. We hypothesized that changing climate conditions would negatively affect smallmouth bass populations. In addition, we hypothesized that if current levels of harvest were maintained or increased in future climate scenarios, then smallmouth bass populations would further decline and extinction probability would increase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Empirical smallmouth bass data</title><p>The Buffalo River originates in the Boston Mountains region of Arkansas, USA and flows 238 km before entering the White River with a drainage area of 3,465 km<sup>2</sup>. Beginning in 1972, the National Park Service has protected approximately 90% of the river length. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission sampled smallmouth bass in the Buffalo River twelve years between 1992 and 2012 using boat electroshocking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Sites were sampled a single time each year and during each sample fish were measured to the nearest millimeter and weighed to the nearest gram. We selected a subset of data from sites sampled at least three years in the month of October, and during nighttime boat electrofishing. This left 15 samples, collected from four different sites over the course of six years (<xref rid="pone.0202737.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The sites were all located in the lower Buffalo River with approximately 24 miles between the most upstream (Rush) and the farthest downstream site (Elephant Head; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Specific habitat data for each sample was not collected, however, the lower reach of the Buffalo River is characterized by large, deep pools with gravel and boulder substrate, separated by relatively short riffles and runs. We selected only sites sampled during October in order to reduce bias associated with small age-0 fish recruitment to the sampling gear and also because autumn can be a reliable indicator of year-class strength for lotic smallmouth bass [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

We began each simulation with a very high abundance for each age group of fish (<xref rid="pone.0202737.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A break-in period followed before the model settled into a relatively stable abundance of each age group of fish around year ten. Preliminary runs of our simulation model indicated an under prediction of adult abundance in present climate simulations compared to empirical data. Therefore, we modified the number of age-0 smallmouth bass predicted by the Ricker recruit-spawner model by multiplying by four in all simulations. This resulted in very similar predicted abundances in the present climate simulation to the mean CPUE of adult smallmouth bass collected in empirical data.</p><p>We conducted ten different simulations where we examined different climate and harvest related scenarios. The first simulation was based on present climate conditions where June discharge and May temperature were taken from historical values for the Buffalo River area. Using the NOAA climate station and USGS river gage described above, we calculated a mean value and standard deviations based on May temperature from the years 1948&#x02013;2013, and a median value and standard deviation based on June discharge from the years 1940&#x02013;2013. The remaining nine simulations were set at future climate conditions for June discharge and May temperature. We determined future mean monthly May temperature and mean monthly June discharge values based on climate simulation results from an ensemble average of 30 downscaled climate models for an RCP 8.5 emissions scenario at mid-century (2050&#x02013;2074; USGS National Climate Change Viewer; [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Mean minimum and maximum temperatures output by the climate models were averaged and used to determine a future mean monthly May temperature with standard deviation. Because the Buffalo River is runoff dominated [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], we determined future discharge by modifying historical median discharge proportionally to the change in future projected precipitation (the mean is about 8% lower in June and 19% more variable).</p><p>We modeled two different types of drought simulations based on current and future projected drought frequency in the region. Summer drought conditions are presently common in runoff dominated rivers like the Buffalo River in this region [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]-[<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and climate change could lead to prolonged and more severe drought conditions in the region [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We modeled drought probabilistically where each simulated year had a chance of being a drought year (<xref rid="pone.0202737.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We based present drought chances on long term discharge data from the Buffalo River during summer months (June-September) where we defined a moderate drought year as being lower than 50% of mean discharge during the period of record (1940&#x02013;2013) and a strong drought year as being less than 25% of mean discharge. Natural mortality during moderate drought years was increased 50% above normal levels for all age groups and natural mortality during strong drought years was increased 75% above normal levels for all age groups. In future higher frequency drought simulations, we modeled expected future increases in drought in this region (moderate drought 5% more frequent and extreme drought 9% more frequent; [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p><p>We modeled two different types of flood simulations based on current and future projected flood frequency in the region. We simulated flooding during the spawning and rearing period and the associated mortality of age-0 fish. Though floods likely affect older age groups as well, it is more difficult to quantify those effects. Similar to drought, we simulated flooding probabilistically where every year had a chance to be a flood year. We based present flood probability on discharge data from the Buffalo River (1940&#x02013;2013) during June where we defined a flood event as an increase in mean June discharge of 100% above median discharge (about 10% of years from 1940&#x02013;2013). If a flood year occurred, mortality of age-0 fish was set at 90%. We modeled some scenarios as having a higher flood chance to simulate an increase in extreme precipitation events due to climate change. Though increases in extreme precipitation events are expected in this region, there are no models projecting the associated effects on numbers of flood events with high confidence in this region [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We chose to increase flood probability in a given year to 20% as an exploratory examination of future flooding potential.</p><p>We modeled two different harvest morality simulations. Though recent estimates of harvest of smallmouth bass in the Buffalo River are not available, we used harvest mortality estimates from similar Missouri Ozark rivers in our simulations (approximately 20% annual harvest mortality; [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Use of the Buffalo River has increased in recent years (a 240% increase in visitors from 2000 to 2016; [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) and is likely to increase in the future, potentially leading to higher harvest of smallmouth bass. Assuming no change in regulations and an increase in river use, we modeled a future harvest scenario as 75% higher than present harvest mortality (35% annual harvest mortality). Finally, we modeled a scenario where harvest of smallmouth bass is closed to facilitate a comparison of the importance of harvest and other mortality factors in affecting population levels.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Empirical data and Ricker recruit-spawner model</title><p>A total of 325 age-0 smallmouth bass and 994 adult smallmouth bass were retained for use in analyses.

Heavy precipitation events have increased over the past century, leading to more frequent high flow events [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency of severe storms that will affect short-term discharge variation [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and lead to more high flow events. However, high flow during any period of spawning and rearing is likely to negatively affect smallmouth bass year class strength [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This corresponds to our empirical data where a single year had a very high June discharge level (23.28 m<sup>3</sup>/s) and almost no age-0 smallmouth bass were collected that year. Overwinter discharge can also be an important predictor of smallmouth bass recruitment [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We chose not to include overwinter discharge or temperature in the juvenile fish reproduction model because overwinter survival is less of a concern at southern latitude populations as spawning occurs relatively early in the year, allowing time for a long growing season before winter [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]-[<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>Our simulations indicate that increases in drought frequency could strongly affect abundance of smallmouth bass in the Buffalo River. Previous work has documented a decline in body condition of smallmouth bass during summer months in some streams in the Ozark region, including the upper Buffalo River [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and it is likely that increasing stream temperature due to climate change will decrease growth potential of smallmouth bass during summer months [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Drought conditions can stress fish and result in population declines [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Drought in the Ozark-Ouachita Interior Highlands leads to pool isolation in runoff streams and pool isolation can increase competition and predation risk [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]-[<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Strong drought can cause severe abiotic conditions within pools [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and can lead directly to mortality of smallmouth bass through complete drying of pools [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our simulations, drought was the only stressor that affected every age class, leading to the strong effects we found.</p><p>Angler harvest is an important mortality component in exploited fish populations. A recent angler creel survey on the Buffalo River found almost no harvest of smallmouth bass, despite high levels of angler effort [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In contrast, work conducted in six Ozark streams in Missouri found that exploitation ranged from 7&#x02013;26% of the population with three rivers having exploitation rates over 20% [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We chose to model current exploitation near the high level found in Missouri streams as the Buffalo Creel survey authors urge caution in utilizing the estimates from the creel survey [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and the Buffalo River likely experiences as high or higher usage than the Missouri streams [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Missouri Ozark streams are closed to harvest for approximately three months in the spring, but there is no harvest closure in the Buffalo River, indicating that our present simulation harvest estimate is likely conservative. Our high exploitation scenario reflects increasing usage of the river in future years.</p><p>There are several limitations inherent in our modeling approach. We do not attempt to model some aspects of smallmouth bass population dynamics such as growth, intraspecific competition, migration, and dispersal. Our modeling also only takes into account a few of the potential effects of climate change. For example, we do not simulate habitat or land use changes that could occur over the coming century. However, a riparian buffer around the Buffalo River is protected by the National Park Service which may limit effects of land use change on the river. We also assume that relationships between May temperature and June discharge and smallmouth bass recruitment will be the same in the future as during the period that data was collected. The Buffalo River is a runoff stream and other stream types, such as intermittent or groundwater dominated, could have different responses to climate change than runoff streams (e.g., temperature, [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Another simplifying assumption occurs in the way we model harvest mortality. We do not take into account catch and release mortality that can be an important component of overall mortality [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In our closed harvest scenario in particular, catch and release mortality or sub-lethal effects would likely still occur, especially at high temperatures during summer months [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], which could reduce the effectiveness of eliminating harvest through changing regulations. An additional assumption of our model is that variables such as age-specific mortality vary independently each year.</p><p>Our model has a number of management implications. Our results indicate that increases in drought prevalence could have the strongest effects on smallmouth bass abundance. Management actions designed to mitigate the effects of drought could reduce these effects. For example, management in this region could be directed towards reducing water withdrawals [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], preserving spring inputs into streams, and increasing riparian canopy to reduce water temperatures and evapotranspiration [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Though we found that increases in flooding frequency had a much smaller effect on adult smallmouth bass abundance than drought, reducing flooding risk by decreasing channelization and protecting the riparian buffer could reduce the flashiness of streams [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The Buffalo River region is remote, reducing the risk of major land use changes over the coming century, but increases in development and agriculture usage in the watershed could further increase flooding chances and alter discharge during the spawning and rearing period, affecting fish populations [<xref rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>More restrictive harvest regulations could reduce the negative effects of climate change on smallmouth bass populations in the Buffalo River. Currently, the river has a twelve inch minimum length limit and a four fish bag limit. In future climate scenarios with high drought and high flooding probability, smallmouth bass populations were 52% lower in scenarios with high harvest and 30% lower in scenarios with present harvest levels as compared to a simulation without harvest included. In addition, removing harvest almost eliminated the chance of smallmouth bass population extinction occurring. Managers could consider restricting or eliminating bag limits for smallmouth bass if noticeable declines in adult smallmouth bass abundance occur due to climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that changes in May temperature and June discharge could benefit smallmouth bass recruitment, but increased flooding and increased drought conditions are likely to reduce adult smallmouth bass abundance below present levels in the Buffalo River. Reducing or eliminating harvest could prove a viable strategy to reduce the negative effects of climate change and lessen the risk of population extinction. Efforts to reduce flooding or drought effects within the Buffalo River could also reduce the negative effects on smallmouth bass populations. Future work is needed to further understand the effects of climate change on smallmouth bass populations at the southern range extent, especially in streams from differing flow regimes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0202737.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Standard errors for parameters from the Ricker recruit-spawner model.</title><p>Standard errors are calculated using the jackknife method.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0202737.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0202737.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Sensitivity analysis results.</title><p>Each parameter was varied &#x000b1;25% of the value solved for in the non-linear regression.
