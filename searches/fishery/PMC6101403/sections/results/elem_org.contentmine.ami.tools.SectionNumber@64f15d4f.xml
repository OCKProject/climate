  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 325 age-0 smallmouth bass and 994 adult smallmouth bass were retained for use in analyses. Catch per unit effort ranged from 0.03 to 0.41 for age-0 fish and from 0.11 to 0.99 for adult fish. Age-0 CPUE was most strongly related to May temperature (R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.15) and June discharge (R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.29) and these variables were included in the Ricker recruit-spawner model.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity analysis was performed on the four parameters within the Ricker model equation (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202737.s002" href="#pone.0202737.s002">S1 Fig</a>). These analyses indicated that parameter b, modifying adult abundance, was the most influential parameter in the model. A ± 25% change in b elicited a 39% decrease and a 29% increase in CPUE of age-0 fish predicted by the model when all other parameters were held at mean values. A ± 25% change in a resulted in a 13% decrease and a 15% increase in CPUE of age-0 fish. A ± 25% change in c resulted in a 10% decrease and a 12% increase in CPUE of age-0 fish. A ± 25% change in d resulted in a 16% decrease and a 19% increase in CPUE age-0 fish. Because of the indicated importance of adult abundance in structuring model results, we plotted predicted age-0 abundance by a range of adult abundance values to examine model behavior with the error ranges showing the range of results if b was varied ± 25% (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g005" href="#pone.0202737.g005">Fig 5</a>). The linear regression between predicted age-0 CPUE and observed age-0 CPUE indicated that our model adequately predicted the number of age-0 fish (p = 0.004, R
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.48).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future climate simulation predicted a 15% increase in abundance of adult smallmouth bass compared to present conditions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g006" href="#pone.0202737.g006">Fig 6</a>). This scenario only took into account changes in May temperature and June discharge, not increased flooding, drought, or harvest conditions. The only other scenario that predicted an increase in abundance of adult smallmouth bass from present conditions was the future high flood scenario (6% increase in adult CPUE; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g007" href="#pone.0202737.g007">Fig 7</a>). Simulations with increased drought chances predicted a large decline in adult abundance from present conditions (52% decline in adult CPUE for the high drought scenario; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g007" href="#pone.0202737.g007">Fig 7A</a>) and the scenario with high drought, high flood, and high harvest had the greatest change from present conditions for any modeled scenario (71% reduction in adult CPUE; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g007" href="#pone.0202737.g007">Fig 7A</a>). In the final scenario, harvest was eliminated in the model, resulting in a 46% decline in CPUE compared to the present climate simulation, less of a decline than any other scenario with high drought included (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g007" href="#pone.0202737.g007">Fig 7A</a>). The only scenarios where extinction occurred were scenarios that included high probabilities of drought. Extinction probabilities ranged from 0 in present climate conditions to 0.08 in the scenario with high drought, flood, and harvest (
