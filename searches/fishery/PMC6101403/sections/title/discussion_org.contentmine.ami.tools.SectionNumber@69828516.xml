 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulation model predicted an increase in abundance of adult smallmouth bass under future May temperature and June discharge conditions, but this population increase could be offset by other expected climate related changes in the region such as increased drought and flooding. Temperature and discharge during the spawning and rearing period have been shown to affect year-class strength of lotic smallmouth bass in other streams [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref005">5</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref013">13</a>], [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref035">35</a>]-[
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref037">37</a>]. Mean June discharge was found to be the best predictor of smallmouth bass recruitment in three Virginia Rivers and years with very high flows in June led to near year-class failures [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref005">5</a>]. Similarly, several sportfish species were negatively related to spring season discharge in four Florida rivers [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref044">44</a>]. Higher temperatures during spring and summer months can positively affect smallmouth bass recruitment through increased growth which can reduce predation risk and increase overwinter survival [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref045">45</a>]. Climate change is likely to result in an increase in May temperature and a decline in June discharge, both of which should benefit smallmouth bass recruitment, leading to higher adult abundances.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Flooding during the spawning and rearing period can devastate year classes of lotic smallmouth bass [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref005">5</a>] and other lotic black bass species (e.g., shoal bass, [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref007">7</a>]). Heavy precipitation events have increased over the past century, leading to more frequent high flow events [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref046">46</a>]. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency of severe storms that will affect short-term discharge variation [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref047">47</a>] and lead to more high flow events. However, high flow during any period of spawning and rearing is likely to negatively affect smallmouth bass year class strength [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref013">13</a>]. This corresponds to our empirical data where a single year had a very high June discharge level (23.28 m
  <span class="sup">3</span>/s) and almost no age-0 smallmouth bass were collected that year. Overwinter discharge can also be an important predictor of smallmouth bass recruitment [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref013">13</a>]. We chose not to include overwinter discharge or temperature in the juvenile fish reproduction model because overwinter survival is less of a concern at southern latitude populations as spawning occurs relatively early in the year, allowing time for a long growing season before winter [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref048">48</a>]-[

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulations indicate that increases in drought frequency could strongly affect abundance of smallmouth bass in the Buffalo River. Previous work has documented a decline in body condition of smallmouth bass during summer months in some streams in the Ozark region, including the upper Buffalo River [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref050">50</a>], and it is likely that increasing stream temperature due to climate change will decrease growth potential of smallmouth bass during summer months [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref028">28</a>]. Drought conditions can stress fish and result in population declines [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref051">51</a>]. Drought in the Ozark-Ouachita Interior Highlands leads to pool isolation in runoff streams and pool isolation can increase competition and predation risk [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref052">52</a>]-[
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref053">53</a>]. Strong drought can cause severe abiotic conditions within pools [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref054">54</a>] and can lead directly to mortality of smallmouth bass through complete drying of pools [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref030">30</a>]. In our simulations, drought was the only stressor that affected every age class, leading to the strong effects we found.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Angler harvest is an important mortality component in exploited fish populations. A recent angler creel survey on the Buffalo River found almost no harvest of smallmouth bass, despite high levels of angler effort [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref055">55</a>]. In contrast, work conducted in six Ozark streams in Missouri found that exploitation ranged from 7â€“26% of the population with three rivers having exploitation rates over 20% [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref021">21</a>]. We chose to model current exploitation near the high level found in Missouri streams as the Buffalo Creel survey authors urge caution in utilizing the estimates from the creel survey [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref055">55</a>] and the Buffalo River likely experiences as high or higher usage than the Missouri streams [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref043">43</a>]. Missouri Ozark streams are closed to harvest for approximately three months in the spring, but there is no harvest closure in the Buffalo River, indicating that our present simulation harvest estimate is likely conservative. Our high exploitation scenario reflects increasing usage of the river in future years.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several limitations inherent in our modeling approach. We do not attempt to model some aspects of smallmouth bass population dynamics such as growth, intraspecific competition, migration, and dispersal. Our modeling also only takes into account a few of the potential effects of climate change. For example, we do not simulate habitat or land use changes that could occur over the coming century. However, a riparian buffer around the Buffalo River is protected by the National Park Service which may limit effects of land use change on the river. We also assume that relationships between May temperature and June discharge and smallmouth bass recruitment will be the same in the future as during the period that data was collected. The Buffalo River is a runoff stream and other stream types, such as intermittent or groundwater dominated, could have different responses to climate change than runoff streams (e.g., temperature, [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref028">28</a>]). Another simplifying assumption occurs in the way we model harvest mortality. We do not take into account catch and release mortality that can be an important component of overall mortality [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref056">56</a>]. In our closed harvest scenario in particular, catch and release mortality or sub-lethal effects would likely still occur, especially at high temperatures during summer months [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref057">57</a>], which could reduce the effectiveness of eliminating harvest through changing regulations. An additional assumption of our model is that variables such as age-specific mortality vary independently each year.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model has a number of management implications. Our results indicate that increases in drought prevalence could have the strongest effects on smallmouth bass abundance. Management actions designed to mitigate the effects of drought could reduce these effects. For example, management in this region could be directed towards reducing water withdrawals [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref058">58</a>], preserving spring inputs into streams, and increasing riparian canopy to reduce water temperatures and evapotranspiration [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref027">27</a>]. Though we found that increases in flooding frequency had a much smaller effect on adult smallmouth bass abundance than drought, reducing flooding risk by decreasing channelization and protecting the riparian buffer could reduce the flashiness of streams [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref059">59</a>]. The Buffalo River region is remote, reducing the risk of major land use changes over the coming century, but increases in development and agriculture usage in the watershed could further increase flooding chances and alter discharge during the spawning and rearing period, affecting fish populations [
  <a rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202737.ref013">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More restrictive harvest regulations could reduce the negative effects of climate change on smallmouth bass populations in the Buffalo River. Currently, the river has a twelve inch minimum length limit and a four fish bag limit. In future climate scenarios with high drought and high flooding probability, smallmouth bass populations were 52% lower in scenarios with high harvest and 30% lower in scenarios with present harvest levels as compared to a simulation without harvest included. In addition, removing harvest almost eliminated the chance of smallmouth bass population extinction occurring. Managers could consider restricting or eliminating bag limits for smallmouth bass if noticeable declines in adult smallmouth bass abundance occur due to climate change.</p>
