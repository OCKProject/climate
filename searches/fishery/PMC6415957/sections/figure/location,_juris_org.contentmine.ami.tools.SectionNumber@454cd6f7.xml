  <div class="title">Location, jurisdiction, and vessel nationality of fish/fisheries overlap.</div>
  <p>The predicted overlap between industrial fishing effort and core habitats for seven species of (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) tunas (Pacific bluefin, yellowfin, and albacore tunas) and (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) pelagic sharks (white, shortfin mako, salmon, and blue shark). The scale in (A) and (B) indicates the log-transformed relative overlap values, which sum to 1 for each species and are summed across species in these multispecies plots. Solid lines on the maps denote the U.S. EEZ, and dashed lines indicate the EEZs of Canada and Mexico. (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) Jurisdiction of fisheries overlap (within an EEZ or on the high seas). (
   <span class="bold">D</span>) National contributions to high seas overlap: Bar length is equivalent to the percent of each speciesâ€™ total fisheries overlap that occurs in the high seas [i.e., gray bar in (C)].
