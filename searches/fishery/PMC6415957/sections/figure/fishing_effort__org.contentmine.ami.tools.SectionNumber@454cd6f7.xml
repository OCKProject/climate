   <span class="bold">E</span>) Registered nationality and primary fishing gear type for fishing vessels active in the northeast Pacific Ocean in 2015–2017. Color scales represent unique gear types in (A) to (D) and unique nations in (E). Vessels from 12 nations were detected in our study region (10°N to 60°N, 110°W to 180°W). Purse seiners and longliners are subdivided into two classes (tuna and non-tuna) based on permits from RFMOs. In (A), black lines denote EEZs and red lines show two large MPAs: Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (north; boundaries expanded from the inner line to the outer line in 2016) and Johnston Atoll of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (south). In (E), “Other” vessel types include trollers, squid jiggers, pole-and-line, and pot or trap vessels.
