 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 75% of pelagic sharks and 30% of tunas are threatened by overexploitation, yet many are still subject to intense fishing pressure (

   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). The movements and habitat preferences of many pelagic fishes include the use of the “high seas,” or the ~60% of global oceans that lie beyond any individual nation’s control (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>). This exposes pelagic populations to multinational fishing fleets and diffuses accountability across dozens of nations that collectively fish these shared waters (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>). In addition to jurisdictional challenges, many shark and tuna species are particularly susceptible to overfishing due to their relatively late ages at sexual maturity and tremendous commercial value; the global value of tuna and shark fisheries are estimated at $42 billion and $1 billion, respectively, which motivates ongoing overfishing of some species (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Currently, high seas [also known as areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJs)] fisheries are primarily managed by regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). The effectiveness of high seas fisheries management has been debated (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>); many high seas populations are depleted or overfished (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>), and RFMO agreements only pertain to participating member nations (
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). RFMOs have improved stock biomass when strong management measures such as quotas are adopted, yet 36% of RFMO-managed tuna populations and 61% of billfish populations globally have biomasses below target levels (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>). The United Nations’ recent commitment to create the world’s first legally binding treaty on global high seas conservation (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>) presents a historic opportunity to stabilize global pelagic fish populations (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>). However, a better understanding of high seas fisheries and their effects on pelagic species is needed to inform the priorities of this treaty, which will be formally negotiated until 2020. Although fishing is the strongest driver of declining population trends in sharks and tunas (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>), the distributions and relative pressures of high seas and domestic fishing fleets on many migratory species remain poorly understood (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>), making it unclear which species or regions may warrant prioritization in a high seas treaty.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global understanding of industrial fishing activity has traditionally derived from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) statistics or aggregated catch data (e.g., longlines are typically presented at 5° grid cell size, while purse seine data are often provided at 1° resolution) reported by RFMOs (
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">
   <span class="italic">16</span>
  </a>). A primary limitation of official datasets and finer-scale catch reconstructions from these data is that individual countries with competing national interests self-report data to international fisheries organizations, leading to misreporting that may compromise suitability for spatial management (
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>). For example, China’s distant-water fleet, among the world’s most active fleets, is estimated to underreport catch by one order of magnitude (0.4 million metric tons per year reported versus 4.6 million metric tons per year estimated in reconstructed catches) (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>). There are typically no punishments for nations that do not self-report shark catch data, and the effectiveness of measures to penalize misreporting of shark and tuna catch data varies by RFMO (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>). As a result, some official datasets contain sparse reported shark catches from major fishing fleets including China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>). Fisheries observer programs, government-mandated vessel monitoring systems, and vessel logbooks have provided higher-quality data on industrial fishing, although these data are only available for a small fraction of fishing fleets and are typically kept private by individual nations (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>). For example, over two-thirds of RFMO-managed fisheries lack regional observer programs, leading to continued uncertainties over the global impacts of pelagic fisheries in both national and international waters (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, analysis of a publicly accessible, globally available vessel transmission system known as the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has provided maps of global fishing effort at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, allowing the direct observation of over 70,000 industrial fishing vessels (
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). AIS can be used to observe 50 to 75% of all fishing vessels greater than 24 m despite known limitations (e.g., many smaller vessels do not transmit AIS detections and a small subset of vessels tamper with AIS devices), thus providing a high-resolution assessment of global fishing that is not reliant on self-reporting (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). This innovation facilitates novel investigation into the spatiotemporal dynamics of fishing effort, the influence of the physical environment in driving fisheries trends, and potential spatial overlaps with core habitats of commercially valuable and threatened pelagic species. Effectively quantifying overlap between marine predators and industrial fishing effort is essential for identifying regions of conservation concern (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>) and predicting bycatch hotspots for threatened species (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). AIS analysis provides an opportunity to independently inform fisheries management practices and conservation initiatives, including efforts to better manage the overexploited and data-poor high seas (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we used shipboard AIS signal analysis, electronic tagging datasets of pelagic species, and predictive habitat models to identify regions of overlap between commercial fishing effort and the core habitats [defined as the top quartile of monthly habitat model predictions following Hazen 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>) and Kappes 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>)] for seven species of pelagic sharks and tunas in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The northeast Pacific Ocean provides an ideal setting to investigate the interactions between pelagic fishes and fisheries due to the high commercial value of regional fisheries and the unprecedented amount of publicly available, fisheries-independent data available on habitat utilization by pelagic species; the Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP) program produced 876 tracks of our seven study species in this region (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). This biologging program also supported development of the predictive habitat models, which quantify relationships between animal movements and dynamic oceanographic variables and predict how species may respond to contemporaneous oceanographic conditions (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). Temporal differences between animal movement and fishing effort datasets (up to 5- to 10-year differences) are common in studies that examine overlap of fishing effort and species distributions (
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). AIS-derived maps of fishing effort are only available for recent years (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>), so most animal tracking datasets predate observations of fishing (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). We used habitat models (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>) to address this discrepancy by generating habitat predictions for the exact time period of our fishing effort observations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To inform how national and international management actions may address the impacts of fishing on these species, our primary objectives were to (i) map commercial fishing effort by tracking all fishing vessels that transmitted AIS signals in the northeast Pacific Ocean in 2015–2017, (ii) calculate fisheries overlap with the predicted core habitats of pelagic sharks and tunas using habitat models (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>), (iii) determine which species may require an international approach to conservation and management due to fisheries overlap in the high seas, and (iv) identify which nations’ fisheries most frequently overlap with these pelagic species. These analyses may be used to identify regions of concern for ongoing United Nations negotiations on the conservation and sustainable use of the high seas and to evaluate fisheries self-reporting by identifying where countries may be targeting or landing species that are not reported to management agencies.
