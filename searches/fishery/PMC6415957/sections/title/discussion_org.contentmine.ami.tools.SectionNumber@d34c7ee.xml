 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interactions between industrial fishing fleets and highly migratory species are directly relevant to international agreements pertaining to the management of the high seas and EEZs. We demonstrate how combining predictive habitat models for pelagic fishes with novel datasets on fishing vessel activity can better resolve these key interactions. Our results highlight regions and national fishing fleets that drive overlap between fishing activity and the core habitats of pelagic sharks and tunas (4 to 35% overlap across seven species). Six of our seven study species are listed as Near Threatened or Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, although salmon sharks are classified as a species of Least Concern and albacore and blue shark populations are above target population thresholds in the north Pacific Ocean (

   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>). Strategically reducing overlap between threatened species’ most crucial habitats and industrial fishing effort may be an important step toward their global population recoveries. However, “overlap” carries different significance for sustainably caught species; overlap for a sustainably fished population may indicate efficient fishing activity, while overlap for a threatened population may indicate a conservation concern.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seven study species vary greatly in their location of overlap with industrial fisheries, indicating which jurisdiction (national or international) may be most appropriate for a species’ management. For example, although salmon sharks regularly undertake migrations to the high seas, 94% of their predicted overlap with commercial fisheries occurs in coastal waters of the United States and Canada, suggesting that these two nations can implement meaningful conservation measures for this species without commitments from other nations. In contrast to patterns of domestic fisheries overlap, 87% of blue shark overlap and 46% of albacore tuna overlap occur in international waters. These results suggest that high seas conservation measures are crucially important if domestic efforts to manage these pelagic fishes are to be successful.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pacific bluefin tuna and the eastern Pacific population of yellowfin tuna are overfished (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>), and high seas quotas do not exist for any pelagic sharks despite the efficacy of quotas for increasing biomass of pelagic fishes (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>). International catch restrictions for pelagic sharks remain globally scarce, although the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), the international body that manages pelagic populations in the eastern Pacific Ocean, recently adopted promising measures that aim to reduce catch of silky sharks (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>). The degree of international overlap presented here further suggests that a legally binding high seas treaty could include language to improve management of these species. Large MPAs in national and international waters have been proposed as an additional tool for managing overfished populations of pelagic fishes, although their effectiveness for highly migratory species is debated (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>). We observe minimal fishing effort in two large MPAs in our study region (the Papahānaumokuākea and Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monuments within the U.S. EEZ), while we detect high rates of fishing effort in the regions beyond their boundaries, suggesting that well-enforced MPAs may help reduce overlap between pelagic fishes and fisheries. Further studies are necessary to better resolve the population-level impacts of large MPAs on mobile species, including potential edge effects related to those management zones.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that observing and potentially modifying the fishing activities of a limited number of nations can bring substantial improvements to the sustainability of fishing on the high seas. Although dozens of nations fish the high seas (
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>), just five nations from North America (Mexico and United States) and East Asia (China, Taiwan, and Japan) account for 94% of predicted overlap with core habitats of pelagic fishes in the high seas of the northeast Pacific Ocean. In the absence of a legally binding high seas treaty, the economic benefits of fishing on the high seas (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>) and the resulting impacts on pelagic fishes will likely continue to be disproportionately driven by a relatively small number of nations with the capacity and interests to fish these global commons. Identifying nations that contribute to patterns of overlap with pelagic fishes may reveal which national interests must be considered if international protected areas or other management strategies are to be cooperatively established in the high seas. In addition, given persistent underreporting of catch in self-reported datasets (
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>), AIS-derived patterns of overlap may be useful in detecting potential instances of national underreporting. For example, while China is estimated to underreport catch data to some RFMOs, particularly for sharks (
  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>), we find that Chinese fisheries account for the highest national overlap (36%) with core habitats of blue sharks in the high seas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We emphasize, however, that the overlap patterns we present pertain specifically to our study populations that were tracked extensively throughout the northeast Pacific Ocean (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). Populations in other oceanic regions may display different overlap patterns, and important hotspots of catch or bycatch overlap may fall outside the geographic scope of this study if our tagged populations did not occupy those areas (e.g., potential bycatch of white sharks in coastal Mexico) (
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>). Our analyses demonstrate how dynamic tools like predictive habitat modeling and high-resolution vessel tracking may be used to identify overlap patterns in these places where predictions are not currently available (
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>). The potential spatial bias caused by the initial tagging location was reduced in the synthesis analyses of tracks of Block 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>) by implementing a weighting scheme that assigned a higher weight to tracks of longer duration and to location estimates that occur later in a given track (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). Despite the application of this weighting scheme, our results may still be influenced by the coastal location of most tag deployments (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>), so our assessment of fisheries overlap on the high seas may be minimum estimates of potential overlap. We also note that mapping overlap is crucial for understanding which regions may warrant finite conservation attention (e.g., present efforts to manage salmon sharks should prioritize Alaskan waters over international waters, and white sharks may require more attention in international waters where hotspots of overlap are located), although our findings are best interpreted at a regional scale as opposed to the scale of individual pixels. As is often the case with broad-scale studies, predictions for individual cells may differ from more localized and geographically limited data collection. We further acknowledge that a species’ overlap with industrial fisheries is not necessarily equivalent to its catch rate or mortality, as different gear types may affect species to different extents. Reliable information on relative catchability, mortality, and post-release survival is unavailable for most species–gear type combinations (
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>), although future studies may better elucidate population-level impacts of overlap once this information is available.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cross-evaluating maps of fishing effort derived from AIS alongside datasets released by management organizations (e.g., fisheries observer datasets, self-reported catch and effort datasets) may provide the clearest view of industrial fisheries, as both classes of datasets have strengths and limitations. While we focused on developing AIS analyses to identify regional patterns of overlap between fishes and fisheries, future efforts may build on this work by uniting insights from both vessel tracking and management organization datasets. For example, modeling the relationship between RFMO datasets and vessel tracking datasets may be used to generate predictions for time periods or regions for which only one dataset is available. Similarly, comparing overlap indices with reliable catch and effort data may improve estimates and predictions of catch rates for underreported species.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both human and marine predators respond to a dynamic set of biotic and abiotic drivers (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>). The recent expansion of vessel tracking data, combined with the increasing sophistication of species distribution and habitat models derived from biologging datasets, can facilitate dynamic approaches to fisheries management, such as high seas closures that directly account for variable ocean conditions and predicted hotspots of overlap. Our approach uses habitat models that consider the relationship between animal movements and the biophysical drivers of those movements (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>). Similar efforts to better understand the processes governing human behavior, including both biophysical and bioeconomic drivers, will further improve future predictions of overlap between fishes and fisheries. As climate change is predicted to redistribute species richness in the north Pacific Ocean (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>), data-rich tools such as AIS analysis, telemetry, and dynamic habitat models may play a vital role in managing a changing ocean.
