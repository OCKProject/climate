 <div class="title">Regional comparison of the california sea urchin fishery.</div>
 <p>Comparing months across the California sea urchin fishery within Fort Bragg in northern California and the Channel Islands in southern California. Gray highlights: (a) the five months with limited fishing across the state of California (commercial sea urchin fishermen are allowed to fish four-days per week during these months); the rest of the year there is unlimited fishing; (b) the six months with the lowest quality (yield) from a processor in Fort Bragg 1991–1992 (Table B in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196864.s003" href="#pone.0196864.s003">S3 Appendix</a>), the location and time-frame which was examined to establish the four-day work weeks; July is excluded due to the fishery being closed during this period; (c) the six months with the lowest prices in Fort Bragg 1991–1992 (Table C in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196864.s003" href="#pone.0196864.s003">S3 Appendix</a>); (d) the four months with the lowest prices in Fort Bragg 2002–2011 (Table D in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196864.s003" href="#pone.0196864.s003">S3 Appendix</a>), (e) the six months with the lowest prices in the Channel Islands 2002–2011 (Table E in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196864.s003" href="#pone.0196864.s003">S3 Appendix</a>); (f) the six months with the lowest quality gonadosomatic index (GSI) in the Channel Islands 2009–2011 (Table B in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196864.s002" href="#pone.0196864.s002">S2 Appendix</a>) and (g) the five months with the highest spawning levels in the Channel Islands 2009-2011(Table A in
