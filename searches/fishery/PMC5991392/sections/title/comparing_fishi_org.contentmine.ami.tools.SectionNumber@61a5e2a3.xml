 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine potential differences in fishing behavior across regulatory time periods, we examined total effort and total landings. The CDFW requires commercial sea urchin fishermen to submit a landing receipt for each trip, which contains information including fishing location and weight of the entire catch landed at the dock before sea urchins are processed. Total effort was measured as the sum of landing receipts submitted to CDFW per month. Since there are no comprehensive data on hours spent diving per trip, CDFW often uses the number of receipts as a proxy for effort. Since divers occasionally report multi-day trips on one landing receipt, this estimate of effort is likely an underestimate of total days of fishing. Total landings were the sum of landings (in kilograms) reported to CDFW per month.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to compare fishing effort during the limited versus the unlimited fishing time periods, we examined statistical differences (using ANOVA) in CDFW monthly total effort and total landings during 2009â€“2011 within the Channel Islands between the two management periods (limited: June-October and unlimited: November-May). We also examined CDFW data from the port of Fort Bragg to assess whether there were fishing behavior differences across management time periods within the region where the limited-fishing season was initially based.</p>
