 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our third objective was to investigate how fishermen respond to variation in reproductive condition of red sea urchins. We explored patterns in fishing behavior, including whether fishermen on average harvest more in peak quality seasons and locations to garner better prices. We tested whether the industry’s effort, total landings, and value were correlated with the seasonal patterns in the demographic measure of GSI. If global prices vary widely, local quality in the product may play a minor role in determining prices. Conversely, if variation in urchin prices is driven mostly by urchin quality, as measured by GSI, rather than global fluctuations in supply and demand, seasonal and geographical patterns of GSI could give insight into both sea urchin demographics and the resulting behavior of fishermen.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested whether the seasonal reproductive stage, measured as GSI, was a good predictor of fishing behavior (effort and landings), red sea urchin price, and value using CDFW metrics. We used the fisheries data across the same years of our GSI samples (2009–2011) and across all available data from previous years of the fishery (1978–2008) with the rationale that seasonal fishing behavior was likely to be driven by knowledge of red sea urchin reproductive dynamics and the assumption that the red sea urchin’s reproductive cycle has remained relatively consistent over the years. We have evidence from a one-year study performed in the Channel Islands in 1975–1976 that GSI had a similar cycle [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the majority (72%) of our port sampling came from the western four blocks within the northern Channel Islands, we had more consistent monthly data from this area. We compared the average monthly GSI from these western samples to the monthly total effort, total landings, mean price, and total value data from these same locations using linear regression.</p>
