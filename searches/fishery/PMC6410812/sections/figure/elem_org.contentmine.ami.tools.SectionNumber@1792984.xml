   </span>. In the cross-participation network (
   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B</span>), node size represents the change in number of active vessels in the fishery between the 2 y (red, loss; green, gain; blue, no change); edge thickness corresponds to the change in the number of active vessels participating in each of the connected fisheries. In the net migration network (
   <span class="italic">C</span> and 
   <span class="italic">D</span>), node size represents the number of active vessels in the fisheries the year before catch-share implementation. Edge thickness (or weight) corresponds to the net number of vessels migrating from one fishery to another. The arrows are drawn to represent vessels exiting the fishery at the arrow origin and becoming active in the fishery at the arrow destination. When no arrows are visible, the flow is clockwise from origin to destination.
