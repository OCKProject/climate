 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We demonstrate that fishery policies have the potential to have spillover impacts beyond the target fishery; thus, the economic connectivity of fisheries is important to consider when designing and evaluating fishery management policy. Moreover, spillover impacts are likely to be heterogeneous, and therefore the economic, ecological, and institutional specifics of the network must be taken into consideration to avoid unintended consequences. Indeed, our analysis of Alaska fisheries networks shows that changes to economic connectivity and migration patterns coincide with the implementation of some, but not all, catch-share programs. Further, the scope of leakage and the degree to which other fisheries exhibit changes in economic connectivity differ across catch-share programs. The halibut and sablefish catch-share programs exhibit the largest scope and scale of leakage, followed by the BBKC and BSSC fisheries; in contrast, the AFA pollock and rockfish catch-share programs did not generate much (if any) leakage. Moreover, estimates for the rockfish program also tended to be opposite to those for other fisheries.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several potential explanations for the heterogeneous effects across catch-share programs, as leakage from a single-fishery policy will generally depend on socioeconomic, biological, and institutional factors. For instance, the degree to which fishers are able and willing to substitute between fisheries in response to a policy shock could depend on the type of gear used, the fishing area, and the species harvested in other fisheries. Previous work has shown that fishers in Alaska are more likely to jointly permit in fisheries that share the same area and gear (
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>); thus, policies implemented in fisheries that do not share gear type and fishing areas with many other fisheries are not likely to generate much leakage. This is true of the rockfish and AFA pollock fisheries, both of which harvest with trawl gear in the Bering Sea and Western/Central Gulf of Alaska, respectively, where there are relatively few other fisheries that use the same gear. In contrast, the halibut and sablefish fisheries use long-line gear and are primarily prosecuted in the Central/Eastern Gulf of Alaska, where there are several other fisheries that share the same gear. Indeed, the halibut and sablefish fisheries were relatively more connected to other fisheries than the AFA pollock and rockfish fisheries before catch-share implementation, suggesting a preexisting difference in substitution possibilities between the two sets of fisheries. Fishers’ ability to substitute between fisheries will also depend on the nature of the catch-share program, as well as the regulatory environment of other fisheries. For example, quota transferability restrictions—which exist to varying degrees in all Alaska catch-share programs—and/or limited entry regulations in other fisheries may act as barriers that impede policy spillovers from the target fishery. Similarly, sideboard limits—which limit the ability of catch-share participants to participate in other fisheries—also restrict catch-share leakage from occurring. In fact, the four catch-share programs with the least amount of leakage (i.e., BBKC, BSSC, AFA pollock, and rockfish) had some form of sideboard limits introduced alongside catch shares, suggesting that there was already some awareness in the management system of the potential challenges of spillovers. Finally, the extent of leakage from a catch-share program will also depend on the initial conditions of the catch-share fishery. For example, overcapacity was relatively less of a concern in the rockfish fishery, which may partially explain why estimates of the scope and scale of leakage for the rockfish fishery were either insignificant or opposite to those for the other catch-share fisheries.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis of catch-share leakage exploits network theory to understand policy impacts (
  <a rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" href="#r39">39</a>). However, further research challenges must be overcome before spillover effects from past and future single-fishery policies can be fully predicted and management goals that may be influenced by spillover evaluated. Chief among them is how to reconcile individual-, vessel-, and community-level analyses and outcomes that show the benefits and risks of fishery portfolio diversification (

  <a rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" href="#r31">31</a>) with the current scope of policymaking, which is typically the fishery. A better understanding of other types of leakage is also warranted, such as those related to social factors—e.g., employment and community well-being (
  <a rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" href="#r40">40</a>)—and distributional impacts—e.g., small- vs. large-scale operators. One opportunity is to explore linking these scales within EBFM frameworks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This work also raises questions about the appropriate scale for EBFM, specifically the possibility that there is a mismatch between the scales of ecological and economic connectivity. Our analysis includes all Alaska fisheries and is arguably one of the larger analyses of fishing policy outcomes to date. Although not investigated here, there is also evidence that spillover may occur between fishing regions or countries and therefore an even broader scope may be appropriate (
  <a rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" href="#r21">21</a>, 
  <a rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" href="#r41">41</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, more work is needed to integrate economic connectivity into models of socio-environmental systems more broadly. Although we emphasize system change in response to a particular policy (catch-share programs), the concepts and methods developed could be extended to other policy changes and also ecological changes, such as a rapid stock collapse or slower disturbances (e.g., climate change). Furthermore, the economic connectivity modeled here can be viewed as an analog to work on ecological system structure and linkages emphasized under EBFM (
  <a rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" href="#r4">4</a>); future work could link the economic and ecological networks (
  <a rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" href="#r42">42</a>), potentially also including other social factors—such as information sharing and governance—to develop integrated socio-environmental models suitable for assessing the impact of policy and/or ecological system shocks.
