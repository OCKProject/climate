  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212786.s001" href="#pone.0212786.s001">S1 Equations</a>), based on data from the coastal reference fleet. The estimated bycatch rate per trip was extrapolated to the total number of trips by all representative vessels registered by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. To obtain a more comparable estimator to other estimators in the literature, we also calculated seabird bycatch per unit effort (BPUE) as a stratified ratio estimator, specifically as the mean ratio of bycatch in number of birds per net in the reference fleet. However, as the official Norwegian fishery statistics has no overall information on the total number of nets set, we could not use this estimator to project to the total numbers of seabirds caught as incidental bycatch for the whole fleet.
