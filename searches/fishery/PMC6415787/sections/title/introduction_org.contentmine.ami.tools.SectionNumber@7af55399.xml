 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incidental bycatch in gillnet fisheries has caused some of the highest recorded mortalities of seabirds worldwide, and a recent review estimated that each year a minimum of 400,000 birds die as a direct consequence of this type of fishery [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref001">1</a>]. Increased mortality rates can potentially have serious effects on the population dynamics of seabird species as their life history strategies usually encompass long life spans and low annual reproductive output (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref002">2</a>]). This is especially concerning as the majority of seabird populations around the globe are in decline [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref003">3</a>], with the conservation status of many seabird species listed as highly threatened [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref004">4</a>]. However, the actual effect of the mortality from bycatch on seabird populations is usually unknown, although circumstantial evidence of a large general effect exists [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref005">5</a>]. The apparent lack of population-level effects of gillnet bycatch reported in the literature may be a consequence of multiple factors, but it seems that the gillnet fishery has largely been overlooked as a threat to seabird populations [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref006">6</a>]. Consequently, there is a large degree of uncertainty with respect to how seabirds are killed as incidental bycatch in many such fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref007">7</a>], and the current knowledge is based on short-term studies that are highly fragmented in space and time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A great range of factors are likely driving the general decline of seabirds, including direct and indirect effects of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref008">8</a>], commercial fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref009">9</a>], introduced mammals [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref010">10</a>], pollution and coastal development [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref004">4</a>]. Many of these factors might also act in synergy to intensify the negative effect on the populations [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref011">11</a>], which complicates management efforts to counteract the declines. Nevertheless, bycatch-induced mortality of seabirds is probably among the most manageable problems in the short term. Thus, it is important to get a good understanding of the extent and variation of incidental bycatch in the different fisheries. The research on incidental bycatch of seabirds has primarily focused on longline fisheries (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref012">12</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref014">14</a>]). This is also the case for much of the research on effective mitigation measures to reduce the bycatch of seabirds (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref015">15</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref016">16</a>]). There are, however, obvious gaps in our knowledge of where, how and why bycatch of seabirds in gillnet fisheries occurs, what the possible mitigation measures of such bycatch are (but see [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref017">17</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref019">19</a>]), and to what extent it affects the seabird populations.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analyses that aim to integrate multiple potential factors in a spatio-temporal perspective to explore seabird bycatch require rather large datasets, which probably explains why such analyses are scarce in the literature. Therefore, deriving more knowledge from long-term data series and larger scales is essential to provide better estimates of the number of seabirds killed, spatio-temporal trends in bycatch rates and population-level impacts. This is necessary to increase our understanding of the susceptibility of species and, eventually, identify effective mitigation measures.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we utilized a comprehensive time series dataset of complete catch records, involving a total of 43 fishing vessels over a 10-year period, to investigate and estimate rates of incidental bycatch of seabirds in the Norwegian coastal gillnet fishery. The sampled fishing fleet represents a large-scale fishery that spans the entire Norwegian coast (58–71°N) and is fundamentally similar to other small-boat gillnet fisheries around the globe. These are fisheries that in general are widespread and common. The main goal of the study was to contribute to the global knowledge base on seabird bycatch by 1) presenting bycatch rates from areas and fishing equipment with few prior observations; 2) exploring spatio-temporal patterns of the bycatch, and the extent to which these patterns were associated with the type and use of fishing equipment; and 3) assessing the value of the results in a wider, international context. To achieve this, we also explored the variation in seabird bycatch in relation to foraging characteristics of seabirds (i.e., diving and surface-feeding) to uncover possible differences between the two groups. Such information is crucial to uncover which populations of seabirds are most likely to be affected by this type of fishery and identify potential ways forward to reduce the bycatch.</p>
