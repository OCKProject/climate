 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we present estimates and distinct spatio-temporal patterns of seabird bycatch in the extensive small-vessel gillnet fishery along the entire Norwegian coast. Our findings represent new and important contributions to the seabird bycatch literature, especially because statistically-valid knowledge of the extent of bycatch for this large-scale type of fishery has been very limited. Even when excluding extreme events, the associated total estimate of bycatch in the 10-year study period amounted to approximately 52,000 seabirds (SE = 15,000), although with large variation among years. Approximately 60% of this bycatch consisted of equal numbers of common guillemots and fulmars, which amounts to an approximate estimate of 1300 birds of each of the two species being killed annually as bycatch. The high percentage of surface-feeding seabirds taken was perhaps the most surprising result from our findings and contradicts the general perception of surface-feeding birds not being as susceptible to bycatch in bottom-set gillnets as diving species [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref001">1</a>] (but see [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref028">28</a>]). These findings are thus intriguing and concerning from an international perspective. Many surface-feeding procellariform species have been identified as threatened by incidental bycatch in longline fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref007">7</a>]. Considering the world-wide use of gillnets, our results make it reasonable to question if surface-feeding seabirds are under-represented in the international literature on bycatch in gillnet fisheries.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The temporal trend in bycatch, with higher bycatch rates of diving species in winter than in summer, could be expected for several reasons. One is that most of these birds, comprising 41% of the bycatch, were of species that only breed in a relatively small number of colonies, many of which are within protected areas where fishing close to land is restricted between 15 April and 31 July. In comparison, only 7% of the bycatch belonged to more wide-spread diving species (common eider, cormorants and black guillemot). Also, the five most abundant species, constituting 85.5% of the bycatch, are highly pelagic species that typically forage on food supplies found far offshore where gillnet fisheries are less common. Outside the breeding season, seabirds are free to move more opportunistically. Further, the pelagic species are sometimes attracted to forage in coastal areas because of temporal availability of food, such as capelin 
  <span class="italic">Mallotus villosus</span> (that spawns mainly on the Finnmark coast), or larger herring 
  <span class="italic">Clupea harengus</span> brought to surface by whales. The fisheries targeting such fish stocks, or targeting larger predatory fish attracted to the stocks (such as cod 
  <span class="italic">Gadus morhua</span>), may also represent an attractive source of food, especially in periods where natural food is less available because of prolonged periods of bad weather and reduced light conditions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The peak in bycatch of surface-feeding seabirds, especially fulmars, in May and June is somewhat more puzzling. However, most seabirds are still incubating early in the breeding season, leaving the off duty parent more time to explore larger areas than when both adults are caring for the offspring later in summer. It has also been shown that the proportions of immature fulmars in the bycatch is higher in this period than later in the season [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref029">29</a>], possibly because these birds are likely to prospect for potential future colonies more when the established breeders are busy caring for their young.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results provide new information for improvement of mitigation methods to reduce and avoid seabird bycatch in gillnets, and also address the urgent need to understand which species groups are susceptible to bycatch in such fisheries in order to initiate the most effective mitigation measures. For diving seabirds, the clear trend of elevated bycatch rates in specific areas, at specific fishing depths, distances to shore and time periods, indicates that measures such as space/time closures in the fishery might be an effective mitigation action for reducing seabird mortality. In particular, ensuring a minimum fishing depth and minimum distance from the coast for the fishery in the winter months may have the potential to lower the bycatch rate for diving seabirds in general. Another option would be to enforce obligatory gear change or modifications (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref030">30</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref031">31</a>]). By enforcing specific closures or obligatory gear modifications, for a shorter time, the mitigation measures might effectively be balanced against associated social benefits of the fisheries, such as for example food security and local job opportunities.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For surface-feeding seabirds, we also recognized a distinct spatio-temporal pattern, with the highest bycatch rates in May and June, and generally higher bycatch rates in the northeast and central fishing areas. The apparent small increase in bycatch rates for some areas, as well as the effect of increased bycatch rates with minimum fishing depth as shown by our second- and third-most supported models, are more difficult to explain from a biological perspective. It is possible, however, that both distance to the coast and minimum fishing depth are associated with variables not included in our analysis. One could, for example, expect distance from the coast to be associated with increased wave height, or rougher seas in general. Thus, the observed tendency of increased bycatch with distance to the coast could simply be due to more movements and/or decreased visibility of the nets while they are being set or hauled, increasing the risk for birds to get entangled. Also, the effect of distance from the coast might be related to the distribution of the susceptible species in Norwegian waters, with fulmars feeding further away from the coastline than other surface-feeding seabirds, as the species is overrepresented in the catch. Further, as there was no clear effect of minimum fishing depth, we suspect that most surface-feeding seabirds are stuck in the nets during setting or hauling. This hypothesis was supported by the fishers that collected the data, when questioned on the specific patterns of this bycatch. In their experience, the movement of the boat and fishing gear when setting and hauling in rough conditions most often lead to birds getting trapped in the nets. During fishing, nets are often hauled and set again in one operation. The associated presence of fish on the surface attracts surface-feeding birds, which risk being dragged down quickly if they are in contact with the fishing gear when set again. An understanding of how and why these birds are caught points to some obvious actions that can likely help reduce the bycatch of surface-feeding seabirds. Measures such as scaring lines, gear modifications and reduction in release of wastewater during fishing operation (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref016">16</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref032">32</a>]) are probably a more effective mitigation approach for this group of birds than the implementation of space/time closures. For both surface feeding and diving seabirds, we did not find a clear effect of mesh size. Thus, we do not find any support for changing mesh size as a possible way of mitigating seabird bycatch.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a population level, the effects of bycatch mortality depend not only on the number of birds caught, but also on the sex and age structure of the birds killed, which source population they belong to, and the status of those populations [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref033">33</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref034">34</a>]. In our study, we did not have access to this information. Previous bycatch studies of fulmars in the same areas have, however, shown that adult male birds dominated the bycatch and that these birds likely originated from populations breeding in more temperate regions [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref035">35</a>]. It is therefore plausible that the same applies in this study. Fulmars travel far and have extensive foraging ranges [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref036">36</a>] and birds on the Norwegian coast could thus originate from colonies far away from the point of capture. An estimated 2.4â€“4.4 million pairs of fulmars breed in the northeastern Atlantic [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref037">37</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref038">38</a>], but several of the populations are now in decline [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref039">39</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref040">40</a>], making it imperative to identify the drivers of the negative trend. This especially applies to the small and nationally endangered breeding population of fulmars along the Norwegian mainland (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref041">41</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Common guillemots, the second most affected species in the study, were primarily taken as bycatch during the winter in northeastern Norway. Preliminary results from the SEATRACK project, which tracks seabirds over time (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.seapop.no/en/seatrack/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.seapop.no/en/seatrack/</span>), show that this is a key wintering area for common guillemots from colonies in the southwestern Barents Sea (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://seatrack.seapop.no/map/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://seatrack.seapop.no/map/</span>), whereas birds from colonies further south rarely stay in the Barents Sea in winter. The Finnmark and BjÃ¸rnÃ¸ya populations in Norway have increased substantially since a huge population crash in the mid-1980s [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref041">41</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref042">42</a>], and now probably total more than 300,000 breeding birds. It is difficult to assess what effect the bycatch of 1300+ common guillemots per year has had on the populations, especially when the age structure of birds taken as bycatch is unknown. In the extreme case that they were all breeders from the Norwegian colonies, it would have decreased annual survival by 0.4 percentage points (1300 of 300,000), reducing the long-term survival rate from 93.1% to the observed 92.7% [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref042">42</a>] and accounting for approximately 6% of the annual loss of adults. Empirical data on the age distribution and origins of the birds affected would most likely reduce this estimate significantly. The inclusion of extreme events in the estimates would have the opposite effect.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An obvious restriction in our study is the inability to estimate and predict where, how and when extreme bycatch events might occur, despite having a rather large dataset. We decided to exclude the extreme events when constructing the GLMM-models, as they were very rare in our data and could thus not be predicted with any statistical reliability. Given that the three extreme events represent less than 0.02% of the data, the episodes most likely reflect rare peaks in the spatial-temporal distribution overlap between birds and fishing activity in an area over a short period, for instance when the seabirds and the fish are targeting high concentrations of the same prey. Up-scaled estimates based on a few such events should in general be handled with caution, as they are likely to cause much controversy and be highly biased, such as the extreme estimates reported by Strann et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref043">43</a>]. On the other hand, the rarity of these extreme events in the reference fleet might not reflect the true situation for the whole fleet. Even though we have confidence that the fishers in the reference fleet report true bycatch numbers due to the close follow up by IMR, they might also be more focused on avoiding hot spots and situations producing extreme bycatch events. However, we believe this is also the situation for most fishers, as getting a large seabird bycatch is in general an unwanted situation. The unpredictable occurrence of such extreme events, and in particular how they might modify and/or bias bycatch estimates, emphasizes the need for either more and longer time series, or carefully designed bycatch studies to better capture the real frequency and implications of such events. Our results indicate in particular that sampling effort should be increased in areas where the fishery targets fish species in shallow, nearshore waters where they coincide with high densities of diving seabirds. It is also informative to present estimates both with and without extreme and rare bycatch events to better understand how these events alter the estimates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For reasons discussed above, the population effects of the Norwegian gillnet fishery on seabirds are somewhat inconclusive, but previous work has raised substantial conservation concerns related to the level of bycatch of diving species in gillnets [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref006">6</a>] and procellariform species in longline fisheries (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref044">44</a>]). Our results do, however, emphasize the need for a more holistic, spatio-temporal assessment of the effects of bycatch on a wide range of seabird species across multiple types of fisheries and fishing gear to evaluate the cumulative impact of the fishing activity. We found clear spatio-temporal trends regardless of net type used. Thus, it is likely that management would benefit from a stronger focus on general mitigation measures as discussed above, rather than a focus on fisheries defined by their target species. Also, the small-vessel gillnet fisheries obviously have broader ecological effects than seabird bycatch alone, alongside associated social benefits such as employment, economic security and food. Therefore, it is not a straightforward task to reduce bycatch by implementing what could be perceived as rather drastic mitigation measures for the fishers, such as time or area closures. Although the effect of a mitigation measure on seabird bycatch might be evident in a seabird perspective, the total outcome of the measure includes multiple aspects, as it might affect local jobs, income and food security. So, we can only agree with Northrigde et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0212786.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212786.ref032">32</a>] who pointed out that management efforts need to consider all of these factors to find suitable and acceptable ways to minimize the impacts of gillnet fishing on vulnerable taxa, while maintaining, or even enhancing, the benefits these fisheries provide.
