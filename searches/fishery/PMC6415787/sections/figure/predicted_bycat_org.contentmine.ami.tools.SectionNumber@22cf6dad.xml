  <div class="title">Predicted bycatch of surface-feeding seabirds: Distance to coast.</div>
  <p>Predicted bycatch of surface-feeding seabirds per fishing trip (Â± SE indicated in grey) against distance to coast, divided by area (colour of lines) and month (panes). The predictions are averaged over all fishing trips and years. Further, the predictions assume the use of 36 fishing nets per trip, which is approximately the mean number of nets used per trip.</p>
