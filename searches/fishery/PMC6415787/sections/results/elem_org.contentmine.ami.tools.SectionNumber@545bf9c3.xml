 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the fishing-trip level, bycatch of seabirds in our study system was relatively rare with only 2% of the trips reported to have any such bycatch, and approximately 85% of the bycatch events involved less than five seabirds caught per trip. The remaining 15% of the events involved up to 29 seabirds per trip, and up to 83 seabirds per trip when including the three extreme events. In total, there was a somewhat surprisingly even distribution of diving (57%) and surface-feeding seabirds (43%) in the net catches, with northern fulmar (
  <span class="italic">Fulmarus glacialis</span>, hereafter fulmar) and common guillemot dominating the catches (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean estimated seabird bycatch per trip was calculated to ≈ 0.08 (SE = 0.03) seabirds across all years using the complete dataset. Excluding the three extreme bycatch events in 2008 reduced the mean to ≈ 0.06 (SE = 0.02). However, estimated bycatch per trip still varied considerably between years, with no clear trend. When including the extreme bycatch events, the estimated bycatch for the complete coastal Norwegian net-fishery fleet from 2006–2015 amounted to approximately 65,220 (SE = 24,702) seabirds. Excluding the three extreme events reduced the estimate to 52,019 (SE = 14,918) individuals (cf. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212786.g002" href="#pone.0212786.g002">Fig 2</a> for all annual estimates). The variation between estimated yearly bycatch for the whole coastal Norwegian net-fishery fleet followed the variation between estimated bycatch rates closely, as fishing effort in the fishery varied little between years.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model selection procedure revealed a different fixed effect structure for diving and surface-feeding seabirds, suggesting different drivers behind the bycatch events. For both feeding types, the most supported models were negative binomial GLMMs.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For diving seabirds, one model got substantially more support (based on AIC) than the alternative candidates. The fixed effect structure for this model included year, month, area, distance from coast, number of nets set and fishing depth as fixed effects, where the effect of distance to coast varied with area and the effect of number of nets set varied with fishing depth (
   <a rid="pone.0212786.t004" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0212786.t004">Table 4</a>). The temporal trend revealed increased bycatch rates in winter, with highest predicted bycatch between November and January, while the bycatch rates were lowest in May and June (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212786.g003" href="#pone.0212786.g003">Fig 3</a>). The bycatch rate was higher in northeastern Norway compared to the other areas, in particular close to shore (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212786.g003" href="#pone.0212786.g003">Fig 3</a>) and at minimum fishing depth (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212786.g004" href="#pone.0212786.g004">Fig 4</a>). All areas had elevated bycatch rates of diving seabirds at minimum fishing depth. The effect of distance to shore was only apparent in northeastern Norway, where it was very similar to the effect of minimum fishing depth, indicating co-occurring events of high bycatch rates both close to shore and with nets being set at a shallow fishing depth.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For surface-feeding seabirds, three models had considerable support (
   <a rid="pone.0212786.t004" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0212786.t004">Table 4</a>). The highest ranked model included year, month, area and distance to coast as fixed effects, with the effect of distance to coast varying with area. The second- and third-most supported models also included an effect of fishing depth either as an additive effect (second-most supported model), or as an interactive effect with number of nets set (third-most supported model). However, as the apparent effect of fishing depth for surface-feeding seabirds seemed unreasonable, with elevated bycatch at increasing fishing depth, we chose to focus on the predictions from the most supported model only. The temporal bycatch trend was opposite to that of the diving seabirds, showing a general peak in May and June, with declining bycatch rates towards and during the winter months (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212786.g005" href="#pone.0212786.g005">Fig 5</a>). Also, for surface-feeding seabirds, bycatch rates were generally higher in northeastern Norway. The apparent effect of distance to shore varied from area to area, from a small tendency of increasing bycatch rates with increased distance to the shore in the south, central and northwest areas to seemingly no effect of distance in the northeastern area (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212786.g005" href="#pone.0212786.g005">Fig 5</a>). It is also interesting to note that our most supported model for surface-feeding seabirds seemed to underestimate the bycatch rate in general and did not explain the variation in the data as well as for the model for diving birds. Thus, although the model for surface-feeding seabirds still showed obvious trends in the bycatch, we probably lacked some unmeasured variables related to the variation in surface feeding seabirds, particularly with regards to describing events where multiple seabirds were taken.
