  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was based on interviews with artisanal fishermen from the fishing community of Peniche, on the coast of the western sub-region of Portugal (39° 21′ 32″ N, 9° 22′ 40″ W; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). This city has 27,628 inhabitants with an area of approximately 77,55 km2 [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. The climate is temperate with rainy winters and dry and somewhat hot summers (Köppen type Csb) [

Formed by an archipelago of islands (Berlenga Grande, Estela and Farilhões), this marine protected area is located in the transition zone between the Mediterranean and European sub-regions, specifically at the top of the escarpment of the Nazaré Canyon [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. The Berlengas Marine Natural Reserve (MNR) is renowned for its great marine biological diversity, archaeological features, insular ecosystem specificities and is importance in the life cycle of the marine avifauna [

  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This fishing community is considered a local symbol with remarkable prestige throughout the municipality [

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Semi-structured interviews [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>] were conducted from June to September 2016 to obtain data on LEK about the European pilchard. The state-owned company Docapesca - Portos e Lotas granted permission for administering the interviews to the fishermen of Porto de Peniche. Fishermen were interviewed over successive visits in the fishing warehouses of the Port of Peniche and at the main meeting points of the fishing community. Brook and McLachlan (2008) sees this type of involvement with the community as indispensable [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. The objectives of the work and the statement of informed consent to participate in the research were provided to the fishermen through the Statement of Informed Consent (IC) [see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>].
  </p>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interviews were mainly conducted through manual transcription and occasionally with a digital audio recorder. The interviews with fishermen were conducted randomly - always before or after the arrivals and departures of the fishing teams and when they were doing net and fishing gear repairs. The interview script [see Additional file 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">2</a>] was structured in 2 parts: Profile of fisherman (age, schooling, fishing time, time of residence in Peniche, income source, type and length of boat, fishing time at sea and time to catch sardines) and LEK of European pilchard (folk taxonomy, habitat, behaviour and migration, development of sardines, spawning, fat accumulation season and uses, beliefs and food taboos). The educational profile of the interviewees followed the Portuguese educational classification: A (1st Cycle: 1–4 years of study), B (2nd Cycle: 5–6 years of study), C (3rd Cycle: 7–9 years of study) and D: (Secondary Education: 10–12 years of study).
