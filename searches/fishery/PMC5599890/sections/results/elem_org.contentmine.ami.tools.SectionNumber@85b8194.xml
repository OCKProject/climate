  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 87 interviews were conducted in the fishing community of Peniche. The interview sites were predominantly in the Port of Peniche (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 71) followed by the city centre (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 16). The average age of the respondents was 58.25 years, with a minimum of 25 years and a maximum of 76 years. More than half of the interviewees (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 59) were born in Peniche and are active (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 49) in the fishing currently. According to the Portuguese educational classification, 58 individuals belonged to the 1st Cycle, 19 to the 2nd Cycle, 5 to the 3rd Cycle and 5 to Secondary Education. There were no illiterates or individuals with higher education in the sample. The fishing experience varied from 3 to 60 years, but fishing experience average was 39.08 years. The average monthly income source related to fishing, including retirees, is 810.5 Euros, ranging from 208.0 to 3000.0 Euros. A total of 50 fishermen interviewed supplement their income with income from other activities. Of these fishermen, 31 informants do so through work related to fishing (maintenance of fishing nets) and the rest in other autonomous activities.

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main types of boats mentioned by the fishermen were: trawlers, artisanal fishing boats, trawl nets, coastal boats, and sports boats. Trawlers were further sub-classified by fishermen into trawlers (larger boats) and “rapa” (smaller boats). Boats were measured 93 times during the interviews. Of these, the boats mentioned were as follows: trawlers (35), artisanal fishing boats (38), “rapa” (14), trawl nets (3), coastal boats (2) and sport boats (1). Six Fishermen have said they have fished in more than one type of boat, those being 3 in both artisanal fishing boats and trawlers and 3 in artisanal fishing boats and trawl nets. Only 17 of the fishermen interviewed are boat owners.</p>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fishermen interviewed were questioned about their preferred schedule of sardine capture during the fishing campaigns
   <span class="italic">.</span> A cycle called "It is six in the morning and six in the afternoon" was the most cited by fishermen (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 27). Other respondents mentioned both sunrise and sunset (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 17), day and night (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 16), preferably day (N = 16), preferably night (

   <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Peniche, besides the name sardine, the artisanal fishermen attributed popular names to small sardines. A total of 82 fishermen attributed the name “petinga” or “esquilha” to juvenile sardines. One fishermen mentioned the name “real” sardine and another fishermen “sueste” fish.

   <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When questioned about the preferential habitat of sardines, 40 of the fishermen indicated coasts and high sea, 39 only on the coast, 6 more often on the coast, one only on the high sea and one did not answer this question. The informants highlighted some specific habitats (rocky seabeds, areas where the river empties into the sea carrying food, clean seabeds, more temperate waters, and sandy seabed to escape from common dolphin (
    <span class="italic">Delphinus delphis</span> Linnaeus, 1758) attacks.
   </p>
   <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In relation to the most common depth of the sardine in the sea, 32 informants indicate a forage interval of 0–50 m, 40 between 0 and 100 m and 11 between 0 and 200 m. Two fishermen did not know how to answer this question and two others just said they were deep-sea fish.</p>
   <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The locomotion of sardines in the sea, according to all fishermen, is carried out in shoals. Some fishermen (
    <span class="italic">N</span> = 15) specified that the schools are enormous. Two other fishermen referred to a phenomenon that makes sardines stick together. One informant said that sardines usually come together to protect themselves from common dolphins, and the other informant said that common dolphins make them stay together to feed.
   </p>
   <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following types and patterns of sardine migration have been mentioned by fishermen in the fishing community of Peniche: the migration comes from the South (13 times), comes from the North (18 times), comes from the South and North (32 times), occurs with the tides (3 times), occurs according to the seasons of the year - summer and winter (15 times) and migrant/pelagic/moving fish (14 times). Only 7 respondents did not respond to this part of the interview.</p>
   <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local fishermen also mentioned the probable areas of sardine displacement along the Portuguese Coast that passes through Peniche (Table 
    <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The areas most cited by respondents were Figueira da Foz (27 times), Algarve (25 times), Nazaré (19 times), Ericeira (15 times), Sesimbra (12 times) and Sines (11 times). Other areas of Portugal, such as Aveiro, Setúbal and Portimão (8 times), Cape Roca (7 times), São Pedro de Moel and Matosinhos (4 times), Viana de Castelo, Póvoa de Varzim, Olhão and Santa Cruz (3 times) and Cascaiz and Leixões (2 times). Foz do Minho Beach, Vila do Conde, Caparica Coast, Porto Beach, Mira Beach, Tocha Beach, Sagres and Lisbon were mentioned only once in the interviews.

The vast majority of respondents (

The spawning time ranged from one to 8 months (72 citations). There was 1 response for 8 months, 2 for 4 months, 3 for 6 months and 3 for 7 months, 7 responses for 5 months, 16 for 4 months, 17 for 3 months and 20 for 2 months. The rest of the respondents (

December was quoted 19 times, November and March 15 times and October 12 times.

  <p id="Par58" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sardine is greatly important to the fishermen interviewed. According to the majority of the interviewees (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 81), sardines have a high economic importance in the region of Peniche. Another 4 fishermen said that the importance of it is average and 2 other respondents have said that the importance is low. The summer (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 21) is cited as the time when the sardine is more important to the population of Peniche. The main uses of this pelagic species are as bait for another species (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 85 fishermen), in the canning industry (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 53), for one’s own food (

  <p id="Par59" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some informants (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 6) from this community mentioned sardine food taboos. Fish that are restricted were locally termed “raimoso”. A change in the restriction of this fish was observed over time. Twenty-three percent of fishermen said that the sardine was once “raimosa” in the past and 61 % of the fishermen said it was not “raimosa”. Two informants said that the sardine was little “raimosa” and that sick people could not eat it. There were 3 respondents who said that if the joint between the sardine skins is removed, it is no longer a restricted food. The fat found in sardines was recognized as a source of omega 3 by fishermen (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 9), aiding in the medical treatment of people with problems with cholesterol or in the treatment of heart disease patients.
