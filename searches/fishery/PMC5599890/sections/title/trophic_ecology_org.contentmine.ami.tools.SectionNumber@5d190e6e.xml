 <p id="Par72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sardine is one of the main prey species of the common dolphin (
  <span class="italic">D. delphis</span>) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. It also serves as a food base for several species of demersal fish, seabirds and marine mammals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>]. These animals were also cited by fishermen during the interviews (Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). The common dolphin stood out among all the other predators [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. Along the Portuguese Coast specifically, 
  <span class="italic">S. pilchardus</span> was the most important species in the common dolphin diet in a study in which the stomach contents of this animal were examined during accidental catch and when they were stranded [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. It is also known that the common dolphin is an opportunistic predator of small epipelagic fish [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>], usually in places with moderate or high productivity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>] where sardines seek their energy sources [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Given the current population decline in the sardine population on the Iberian coast [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>], attention should be given to the conservation of the common dolphin along the Portuguese coast, as this is one of the main predators of this clupeoid fish [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>].

 <p id="Par73" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sardines primarily seek zooplankton as their energy source [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>]. Phytoplankton are also an integral part of the diet of this species [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. Among the zooplankton, we should highlight copepods, decapods and cirripeds [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>], fish eggs and crustaceans [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. During the winter spawning months, sardines may exhibit cannibalistic behaviour in which they predate on their own eggs [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. Respondents describe a foraging behaviour similar to that reported in the investigative work on European sardine prey (Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). In general, it is also observed that fishermen in the fishing village of Peniche show sardines with migratory behaviour, high dispersal capacity, prey and school behaviour similar to other pelagic fish.
