 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A respect for the stakeholders and communities, the clarification of data collection objectives, the interactive approach and the recognition of information limitations were used as a basis for analysing the data acquired [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>]. All the information provided through the surveys was analysed following the union model of the different individual competences [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. The LEK about sardine was analysed through an emic-etic approach [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>], and the data generated by the community were compared with the scientific literature [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. The wealth of information and depth of perceptions in the data collected were analysed through careful coding and cross-checking to ensure the objectivity of the study [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>]. Species nomenclature data were analysed following the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>], and Fish Base [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>]. The data obtained in the interviews were stored and standardized in EXCEL and analysed (descriptive statistics) in the R Project for Statistical Computing version 3.3.2 [
