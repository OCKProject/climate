 <p id="Par82" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The socioeconomic profile of the fishermen of Peniche was described in this ethnoecological research. Respondents provided detailed informal data on the taxonomy, ecology and biology of 
  <span class="italic">Sardina pilchardus</span>. This informal knowledge showed agreements with the scientific literature. We suggest the use of non-corresponding data with formal knowledge to aid in the construction of testable hypotheses for new investigative work on sardines. The data generated here can be used to try to improve the understanding of the fishermenâ€™s knowledge of the European pilchard by managers and conservationists. This approach requires the use of an adaptive framework, which contributes to an improvement in the relations between the actors involved with the resource. The food taboos and social rules about European pilchard were not relevant to conservation in this community. This species, which is mainly used as baitfish for other fishes and in the canning and fish meal industries, provides a great economic value for the fishing community studied here.

 <p id="Par83" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our results highlighted that artisanal fishermen from Peniche show ethnoecological data about European pilchard that can support scientific knowledge, as well as collaborate with future initiatives in pursuit of viable conservation goals for sardines on the coast of Portugal.</p>
