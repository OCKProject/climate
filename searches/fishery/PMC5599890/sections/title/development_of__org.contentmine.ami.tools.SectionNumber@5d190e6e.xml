  <span class="italic">N</span> = 57) corroborate the scientific research in relation to rapid growth (Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). In relation to the stages of development of this species, the fishermen only mentioned the egg phase as constituting the whole sardine life history. However, it is known that the larval stage is one of the development stages of this pelagic fish [
