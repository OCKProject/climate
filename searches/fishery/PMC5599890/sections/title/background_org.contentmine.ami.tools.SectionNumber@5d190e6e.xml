 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human populations have forced marine coastal ecosystems to differ from their historical states, which were characterized by diversified and productive communities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. One of the biggest human impacts has been overfishing, which has progressively reduced stocks, geographically expanded its range and disguises itself through new and improved technologies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In marine ecosystems, pelagic fish are recognized as abundant in productive fishing areas, both on a large scale and on a small scale [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>], and are characterized by a history of large fluctuations in their populations, both due to overfishing as well as environmental factors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>]. Within this group of fish, we have small pelagic species, such as sardines and anchovies, which are abundant in several productive regions of the ocean and are found mainly in areas of coastal and oceanic upwelling [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. These clupeoid fishes are recognized mainly as having a low trophic level in the food web, early reproduction age and rapid growth, all of which make them more vulnerable to different environmental factors and climate change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the central, eastern, and northeastern Atlantic, the European pilchard 
  <span class="italic">Sardina pilchardus</span> (Walbaum, 1792) stands out among the pelagic fish for fisheries [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. At the moment in Iberian waters, this species exhibits low biomass stocks at age 1 and a decrease in the stock of old fish and low recruitment rates [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. In Portugal, European pilchard are one of the most important species to fishing fleets using purse seines and are recognized for their socio-economic values and traditional uses among the Portuguese [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With all these processes occurring, it is important to understand both the perceptions of local fishery managers and users of local resources and to provide strategies for avoiding conflicting shared perceptions among the stakeholders involved in fisheries management [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>]. In small-scale fisheries, for example, local fishermen are in many cases disadvantaged in relation to the actors belonging to large-scale fisheries due to their marginal political power, lack of infrastructure and their typical remoteness [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, it is known that support from the general public for the management of natural resources is fundamental for long-term sustainability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>]. Discussions should be initiated with these local communities as a way of transferring responsibility and regulatory power over available environmental resources [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The local ecological knowledge (LEK) in this context serves as an effective tool for monitoring and assisting in the planning of depleted resources, for the conservation of biodiversity [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>], and for conducting more reasonable and culturally sensitive research and management plans [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. This knowledge can be understood as the lay or experiential knowledge of an individual about the environment based on daily observations, practical experiences in nature and learned scientific knowledge [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To better understand recent history of artisanal fishing and the deterioration of the standard of living of the dependents of this resource [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], we can employ ethnoecology, which according to Marques (2001) can be understood as the scientific study of traditional ecological knowledge (knowledge, behaviour, feelings, and beliefs that influence all interactions between humans and the ecosystem) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. More specifically within ethnozoology, we have ethnoichthyology [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], which aims to report the knowledge that fishermen have about fish biology and ecology [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>], and the understanding of interactions between humans and ichthyological resources encompassing the cognitive and behavioural aspects supported by conservation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From this perspective, extracting ethnoecological data about European pilchard from the fishing community of Peniche, as well as the knowledge passed from generation to generation by the more experienced fishermen, can be important strategies for the conservation of this fishing resource. This type of ethnoecological survey emphasizes the cultural knowledge of fishermen, favours their dialogue with environmental managers and researchers, and contributes to the improvement of participatory management of natural resources by increasing the acceptance of management rules [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, the aim of this study was to record the ethnoecological knowledge of the fishing village of Peniche, Portugal, about the ecology and biology of 
  <span class="italic">S. pilchardus. T</span>he fishermenâ€™s profiles and the likely human uses, beliefs and taboos related to European pilchard (also known as the Atlantic sardine, European sardine, or sardine) were also explored. The ethnoecological data provided by the fishermen who are in agreement with the published biological data were interpreted and discussed in the present study.
