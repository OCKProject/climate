 <p id="Par61" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the ethnoecological data extracted from the interviews, sardine is a predominantly coastal species and prefers sites near river mouths in the sea. The fishermen reported that sardines are distributed vertically, predominantly between the depths between 0 to 100 m. In the scientific literature, similar information was found indicating that this species is predominantly found in coastal shelf waters [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] and prefers areas of great productivity near the mouths of rivers and estuaries [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. In a study on the modelling of habitat suitability for juveniles of 
  <span class="italic">S. pilchardus</span>, the results showed that sardines in the growth phase, in search of food and in the spawning process can be closely linked to sites that provide nutrient sources that increase productivity, such as local upwelling or river runoff [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Di Natale and collaborators (2011) report in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2011 that European pilchard can usually be found at depths of up to 100 m, reaching a lower depth limit of 180 m [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. The PECH Committee of the European Parliament for the sardine fishery shows that this species can range down to 150 m [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>], and in a study of sardine habitat to the west of Portugal showed that this species has a preference for waters with depths of up to 100 m [

 <p id="Par62" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">European pilchard show migratory behaviour, a high dispersal capacity and schooling behaviour similar to other pelagic fish [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. In the present study, respondents exclusively reported this type of behaviour pattern. There was an account of a fisherman who referred to this ability to school as a way to ward off predators. Neilson and Perry (1990) show that the presence of competitors or predators may change the direction or influence the intensity of these migrations in schooling [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>] (Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par63" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Portugal, the geographic distribution of this pelagic fish covers the entire coastline, Madeira Island and the Azores [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. However, sardine migration patterns are not yet well understood [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. There are indications of seasonal migrations along the Portuguese Coast [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>], and fifteen interviewees mentioned this information.
 </p>
 <p id="Par64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to acoustic campaigns performed in April and May of 2015 by the Portuguese Sea and Atmosphere Institute (IPMA), the abundance of sardines decreased from the north to the south of Portugal [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. Regarding sardine migrations, it is known that they occur during the growth phase and towards the north coast of Spain [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. During the collection of ethnoecological data in this part of the interview, it was observed that there was a variation in the responses among the interviewees. There were 18 fishermen who said that the sardines come from the north of Portugal and another 32 fishermen who say that they come from the north and the south of Portugal. This pattern of responses among fishermen reinforces the need to investigate and explore the studies on the migratory behaviour of sardines in the Iberian Peninsula.
 </p>
 <p id="Par65" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The European pilchard show migratory behaviour, a high dispersal capacity and schooling behaviour similar to other pelagic fish is distributed mainly near Póvoa de Varzim and Figueira da Foz in the northwestern region of Portugal and near Peniche and Lisbon in the southwestern region [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. In the Algarve (Southern Portion of Portugal), this pelagic fish is found in greater quantities in Lagos, Portimão and between Faro and Vila Real de Santo António [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]. According to the fishermen of Peniche’s LEK, the Figueira da Foz region and the Algarve were cited the most frequently when asked about where the sardine is on the coast after passing through Peniche (Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>). The regions of Portimão, São Pedro de Manoel, Olhão, Tocha Beach and Sagres were identified by the fishermen in the southern portion of Portugal, which are included in or near the range of greater distribution found during the last acoustic campaign by the IPMA. None of the respondents specifically mentioned V. Real de Santo Antônio.
