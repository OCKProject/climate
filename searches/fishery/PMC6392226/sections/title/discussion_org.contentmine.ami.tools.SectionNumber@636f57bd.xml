 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The High-Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) on Food Security and Nutrition of the Committee on World Food Security, has the need to develop scenarios to understand the possible impacts of climate change on the food security and nutrition of the most vulnerable zones [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref002">2</a>]. Canada’s Indigenous populations, particularly those residing in rural, remote, and coastal regions, disproportionally experience the effects of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref051">51</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref076">76</a>]. Moreover, given their lower socioeconomic status, sociopolitical marginalization, and reduced access to healthy foods, they are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change on food and nutrition security [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref077">77</a>]. By modelling the effect of climate-related declines in seafood abundance on the nutritional adequacy of diets for coastal BC FNs, our results suggest that intakes of essential nutrients will decline by 21% to 31% under lower and upper scenarios of climate change by the year 2050 relative to 2000. Moreover, substitutions of seafood with selected alternative foods, such as chicken, canned tuna and bread, do not provide adequate amounts of selected nutrients.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modelled scenarios of the impacts of the seafood production decline on nutrient intakes did not account for changes in FN population size over time. According to the most recent census, the number of FNs with registered or treaty Indian status rose by 30.8% from 2006–2016 [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref013">13</a>]. Recent population projections revealed that between 2001 and 2011, the registered Indian population rose at an average annual rate of 2.4%, and was projected to range between 1.4 to 1.8% from 2011 to 2036 (over 25 years) [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref078">78</a>]. For comparison, the growth rate of the non-FN population in Canada averaged 1.0% annually [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref078">78</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the FN population growth rate projection, we estimated the possible increase in numbers of BC FNs by 2050 relative to 2009 (BC FNFNES data collection) as well as the corresponding amounts of seafood needed to supply the growing population. With an average annual growth rate of 2.4% from 2009 to 2011 and of 1.6% from 2011 to 2050 [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref078">78</a>], our sample of 356 individuals will increase to 693 by 2050 (almost double). In 2009, coastal BC FNs consumed about 60g/d per person of seafood; therefore, 21360 g/d of seafood (i.e., 60g/d x 356 = 21360) were needed on a daily basis. By 2050, the same amount of seafood will provide only 30.8 g/d per person (i.e., 21360 g/d/693 = 30.8 g/d) which is about half of the baseline consumption. Thus, two times more seafood will be required to supply coastal FN population in BC by 2050 relative to 2009. In contrast, our projected seafood harvest potential will decline by 21%–31% by 2050 relative to 2000, resulting in a seafood consumption rate of 21.3g/d to 24.3g/d compared to the baseline of 60g/d). The projected potential decline in seafood harvest combined with the increased demand for seafood because of population growth can result in a decrease in nutrient intake of 60%–65%. It is important to note that there has been already a steep decline in both the variety and amount of traditional food in the dietary pattern described here [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref079">79</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref081">81</a>] which can serve to explain the limited contribution of current seafood intake for protein, vitamin A, zinc and iron. Carbon isotope measurements suggest that pre-contact, adult coastal people obtained 90% of their protein from marine sources [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref082">82</a>]. Shellfish (a rich source of iron), and other beach foods had a much larger relative contribution [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref080">80</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref083">83</a>] than today where few beaches remain open to harvesting because of development and contamination (sanitary or biotoxin) and foreshore leases. Other keystone species, like eulachon and eulachon grease (important contributors of vitamin A) are rarely available. For salmon alone, estimates suggest that at pre-contact, annual per capita use, at least among some Coast Salish communities was around 316 kg/year (0.9 kg/capita/day) [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref082">82</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref084">84</a>]. This serves to highlight, while it is difficult to know with certainty what portion was used for purposes other than food, that current seafood use and its relative contributions of nutrients is at a critically low level. Nevertheless, locally-harvested seafood still supplies daily recommendations of EPA+DHA and vitamin B12, as well as substantial levels of other nutrients. Our predictions show that climate change will likely have a further impact on the seafood contribution to nutrients such as protein, EPA+DHA, vitamin D, selenium and vitamin B12. Given low or insufficient intake of selected nutrients in the total diet of BC FNs [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref030">30</a>], the nutritional health of coastal BC FNs is highly vulnerable to this potential decline in seafood consumption related to the changing climate and species abundance. Along with the effects on diet quality, the decline in seafood consumption has detrimental impacts on mental health as well as cultural practices, language, self-determination and social cohesion.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among a wide variety of seafood species reported to be consumed by BC FNs, salmon was the most frequently consumed, which reflects its relative abundance in BC coastal ecosystems [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref085">85</a>] as well as its status as a cultural keystone species and preferred food for BC FNs [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref044">44</a>]. Salmon species (collectively) supplied over 70% of the EPA+DHA recommendation, 50% of vitamin B12, 20% of vitamin D, 18% of niacin, 17% of selenium, and 10% of protein requirements. The diversity of salmon species available for harvest or consumption is an important dimension of food security and cultural stability for BC FNs. Greater population and species diversity of salmon is associated with more stable catch and longer fishing seasons [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref086">86</a>]. In recent years, however, salmon returns have been lower than predicted, and the lowest in the past 120 years due, in part, to the warming ocean temperature [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref087">87</a>]. With climate change affecting salmon abundance, protecting and increasing diversity among salmon populations may help provide a buffer against food insecurity among BC FNs [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref086">86</a>]. Climate change adaptation strategies should incorporate Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref088">88</a>]
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Food insecurity is an important social determinant of health for FNs and is directly related to low incomes, high costs of nutritious store-bought foods, and constraints in accessing traditional foods [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref040">40</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref089">89</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref090">90</a>]. According to the 2008–2009 BC FNFNES, 75% of respondents observed that climate change was affecting the availability of traditional foods for harvest, while almost half the respondents reported that climate change decreased the availability of traditional foods in their households [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref030">30</a>]. Aside from climate change, there are other barriers to traditional food consumption. Although Canadian courts have established that food, social and ceremonial fisheries of Indigenous Peoples have priority over all other uses of the resource [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref091">91</a>], government restrictions, fleet rationalization programs, commercial and recreational harvest allocation, and other industrial activities such as forestry, hydroelectricity, mining, farming and oil/gas industries were noted by BC FNs as potential barriers to traditional food consumption [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref030">30</a>]. Over two-thirds (68%) of FNs in BC said that all barriers, when combined, decreased access to salmon and other fish species [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref030">30</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We inevitably had to simplify the complex interactions between climate change, ecological responses, and fisheries governance impacts on fisheries and nutritional health; these assumptions can be further refined in the future to provide more detailed projections of climate change effects on FN’s food security. Firstly, the coarse resolution of the earth system model used by DBEM renders fine scale interpretation of the DBEM outputs uncertain. Thus, some of the meso-scale processes and features that may determine the fine scale distribution, changes in ecosystem productivity or abundance could not be presented in the model projection. Secondly, we only used one earth system model (GFDL ESM2M). Inter-model comparison of different earth system model outputs suggests that projected effects of climate change using GFDL ESM2M are likely to be more conservative relative to projections using other earth system models [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref045">45</a>]. Thirdly, we assumed a linear relationship between changes in species abundance and seafood availability for FNs. However, responses of FN fishing activities, including shifts in fishing grounds, fishing effort, gear modification and changes in targeted species may also affect seafood availability under climate change. Also, changes in the exploitation status of fish stocks, fishing effort of BC FNs as well as other commercial and recreational fisheries, and the allocation of resources to different fisheries would affect the availability of fish to BC FNs directly [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref092">92</a>]. This study assumes that these are all kept relatively unchanged in the future which is the main source of scenario uncertainty [
  <a rid="pone.0211473.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211473.ref093">93</a>]. Future studies could include alternative fishing and governance scenarios to further explore these critical dimensions of access to traditional foods. Because of these limitations, our predictions cannot be viewed as a precise estimation of future fish consumption or nutrient intake. However, the broad-scale trends and comparison between climate change scenarios are robust and can be used to identify the risks to BC FNs due to climate-related changes in traditional foods and illustrate the need for the development of an adaptation plan.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our model results show that decreases in nutrient intakes as a result of the potential decline in seafood harvest cannot be easily replaced by market foods, such as chicken, canned tuna or bread. It is important to note that the results of this modelling exercise are intended to be used by local resources managers and public health professionals as a starting point to develop adaptation plans for climate change only. There are many underlying factors such as the distribution of seafood among members in the communities, food preferences of individuals, price elasticities and access to alternative foods, etc. that will affect the relationship between fish harvest and intake. This information, as well as local data on alternative food choices, need to be collected for more realistic and relevant models. Another limitation of this exercise is the insufficient data or lack of information for sensitive subpopulations such as pregnant/lactating women and children. Since these subpopulations are the most nutritionally vulnerable, they will likely be most affected by the impacts of declining availability of seafood.</p>
