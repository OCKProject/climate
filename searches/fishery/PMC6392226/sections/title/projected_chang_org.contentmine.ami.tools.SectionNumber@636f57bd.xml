 <p>
  <span class="sup">1</span>—Average daily intake of nutrients, estimated base on gram-to-gram replacement by alternative foods. 
  <span class="sup">2</span> –Baseline nutrient intakes from seafood based on the food frequency questionnaire of the FNFNES. 
  <span class="sup">3</span> –Chicken: nutrient content is based on the most popular preparation method (chicken breast meat and skin roasted). 
  <span class="sup">4</span>—Canned tuna: nutrient content is based on the most reported type of canned tuna (tuna, light, canned in water, drained, unsalted). 
  <span class="sup">5</span> –Bread: nutrient content is based on the most reported type of bread (bread, white, commercial, enriched). 
  <span class="sup">6</span> –decline in seafood consumption under lower (21%) and upper (31%) scenarios of climate change. *—Retinol activity equivalent, RAE, "—Niacin equivalent. Bolded are the amount of nutrients not substituted by alternative foods.
