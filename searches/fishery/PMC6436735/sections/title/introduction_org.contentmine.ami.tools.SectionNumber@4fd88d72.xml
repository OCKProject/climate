 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive strides have been made at the international level to address the impacts of climate change. The 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) helped mainstream the establishment of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) which bind countries to reach predefined mitigation and offsetting targets [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref001">1</a>]. In order to support countries in reaching their respective NDCs, funding for climate adaptation and mitigation projects through mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) have been established. Although an in-balance between the climate finances available and the necessary investments needed to address climate change persists [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref002">2</a>], COP 21 contributed to positive engagements, commitments and increased funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation activities [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref002">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A first step in order to attract bilateral and multilateral support is for countries to prioritize the sub national areas that are most vulnerable to climate change and require technical assistance [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref003">3</a>]. Given the extent to which climate change is already affecting many vulnerable communities [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref004">4</a>], and the finite resources available to development and governmental agencies [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref002">2</a>], it is of paramount importance that interventions are strategically designed and implemented [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref003">3</a>]. Vulnerability assessments (VA) have been developed to provide guidance and support for adaptation planning and justification for project implementation in order to create a more objective decision making process [

  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref006">6</a>]. Vulnerability assessments can help to identify which communities are the most vulnerable to climate change, where they are located, and what is driving this vulnerability [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Agriculture is one of the sectors most vulnerable to changes in the climate [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref004">4</a>]. At the global level the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) note that yields are generally expected to decline most severely in countries at lower latitudes [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref009">9</a>]. Recent studies have shown that projected losses in the production of cacao [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref010">10</a>] and coffee [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref011">11</a>] threaten national economies and also the regional and global supply chains of these respective industries. The projected impacts of climate change are a threat to crop production in regions that currently experience food insecurity [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref012">12</a>]. In Africa and south Asia, major grains including wheat, maize and sorghum are projected to suffer mean yield losses of 8% by 2050 with some crops, notably wheat in Africa, expected to experience a yield change of -17% [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref012">12</a>]. The impacts of climate change on agriculture are already being felt, in India, climate change induced disturbances to the monsoon recorded between 1966–2002 are estimated to have reduced yields of rice by 4% [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref013">13</a>]. Although the impacts of climate change will impact national and global industries [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref010">10</a>], it is the marginalised and impoverished rural communities in developing countries whose livelihoods are dependent upon small scale agriculture who are particularly vulnerable [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref014">14</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref017">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the past decade a growing number of vulnerability assessments have emerged from the scientific literature that focus on assessing the vulnerability of various sectors, including agriculture to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref018">18</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref020">20</a>]. A number of studies [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref023">23</a>] have adopted the well-established IPCC [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref024">24</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref009">9</a>] definition of vulnerability which can be reflected in “the extent to which a natural or social system is susceptible to sustaining damage from climate change impacts, and is a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity” [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref022">22</a>]. The impact of climate change on agriculture and livelihoods therefore can be conceptualized as the aggregation of these components [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distinction between exposure, sensitivity, and also adaptive capacity (AC) can be opaque. Fritzsche 
  <span class="italic">et al</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>] recommend that exposure variables are strictly climatic phenomena, such as the magnitude, rate of change or variation in rainfall and temperature or meteorological events such as drought or flooding. Smit et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref025">25</a>] argues that certain variables can be indicative of both exposure and sensitivity and suggests that clear boundaries between the two components do not exist. Whilst Caffrey et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref006">6</a>] note that sensitivity and adaptive capacity can be combined to indicate “social vulnerability” [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref020">20</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref026">26</a>]. A recent study by Thiault et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref023">23</a>] has applied the conceptual framework of vulnerability [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref027">27</a>] but through a socio ecological lens in which they quantify the vulnerability of human and marine systems which are intricately connected, using small scale fishing communities in Moorea, French Polynesia as a case study. The ecological vulnerability is combined with the human societal vulnerability in order to spatially prioritise conservation efforts. The study uses primary data collection to characterize the households and develop the socio and ecological vulnerability indices based on the grouping of multiple indicators. Unlike our study the focus is not on a driver (climate change) of change, but rather on assessing how a complex and integrated system can be understood through interconnected vulnerability. Nonetheless, the attempts to include multiple indicators to capture the complexity of vulnerability are shared with our proposed approach. Therefore, what constitutes exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity is dependent upon the context of the question and the predefined definitions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The approach to vulnerability used in this study develops upon the assertions of Turner et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref028">28</a>] that vulnerability is determined by the degree to which a system will experience stress due to a given pressure or combination of pressures. In our case the pressures are framed within the conceptual framework of vulnerability as a function of sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref024">24</a>]. Exposure, is deemed to be the combination of different natural hazards, sensitivity is the projected changes in the climate (precipitation and temperature) and the impacts on climatic suitability for key agricultural crops, and adaptive capacity is the socio-economic standing of the community, and how well they are able to deal with the potential impact (Exposure and Sensitivity).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A number of studies have used spatial analysis and geographic information systems (GIS) to quantify vulnerability to climate change (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s001" href="#pone.0213641.s001">S1 Table</a>). For example, at the global level vulnerability assessments have been used to identify which countries are more vulnerable to climate change shocks that affect a specific industry, such as fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref028">28</a>]. Several studies have focused on non sector specific vulnerability to climate change but operationalized at a resolution that is sub national thus allowing comparison between and within countries [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref029">29</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref030">30</a>]. At a similar resolution and coverage, attempts have been made to quantify the vulnerability of agricultural areas to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref031">31</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref032">32</a>] and more recently, efforts have focused on the impacts of climate change on a specific crop [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref023">23</a>] or combination of crops [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>] and the ensuing vulnerability of rural communities.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been noted that several studies have projected the future climate and assessed how this influences vulnerability [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref020">20</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref033">33</a>] however, fewer attempts have been made to also project the future societal context of the community (adaptive capacity), as these indicators are often hard to predict and uncertain [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref006">6</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref034">34</a>]. Likewise, high levels of uncertainty inhibit confidence in the prediction of natural hazards (exposure) which are by nature unstable and chaotic [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref035">35</a>]. Thus, our study will not attempt to project changes in adaptive capacity or exposure, but instead assume that current levels of adaptive capacity and exposure will remain constant under the future climate change scenario [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref006">6</a>]. We are therefore focusing on how a future high emission climate scenario will affect the suitability of key agricultural crops, and how the exposure to natural hazards and the communities ability to respond (adaptive capacity) under current conditions will manifest itself as vulnerability. The output of vulnerability assessments can be at a resolution equivalent to national [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref028">28</a>], sub national [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref032">32</a>] or sub administrative level [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref023">23</a>] depending on the context of the study and available data.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we propose a Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment (CRVA) methodology that is designed to be flexible whilst providing guidance in regard to conceptualisation of vulnerability, assigned indicators, datasets and methods. We fulfil a gap in the current literature by modelling the impacts of climate change on current and future conditions for multiple crops that dominate the agricultural sector, integrating the impacts of natural hazards into the exposure component and combining the adaptive capacity at a fine scale relevant for policy making. Our objective is to provide a flexible and robust methodology that can be applied to countries across the tropics in order to identify at the sub national scale which rural areas are most vulnerable to the impacts of projected climate change on agriculture.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested the CRVA methodology in Vietnam, Uganda and Nicaragua, three developing countries that are particularly threatened by climate change. In the following section, we introduce the case study countries and their main risks to climate change, the selected crops used for the ecological modelling, and the GIS data and its implementation within the spatial model structure to assess vulnerability. We then present the results of each component of vulnerability and the final index. We identify the main hotspots of vulnerability and the underlying driving factors. Finally we discuss the relevant indicators and their integration within the broader discourse on vulnerability assessments that are designed to inform decision making under progressive climate change.</p>
