 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our study we have adopted the assumption [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref033">33</a>] that vulnerability is equal to: 50% potential impact (sensitivity and exposure) and 50% adaptive capacity. It is possible that greater weight could be attributed to adaptive capacity, if for instance, human capital rather than the presence of natural hazards (exposure) or loss of climatic suitability for cropping systems (sensitivity) drives vulnerability. Future studies could focus on the impacts on vulnerability of increasing the weight of AC for instance. Furthermore we aggregated the indicators within the three components of vulnerability using a deductive approach [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref105" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref105">105</a>] with multiple indicators that are thought to influence vulnerability selected and weighted equally. It is possible however to prioritise indicators [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref106" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref106">106</a>] based on perceived importance which can be achieved in a number of ways, including stakeholder meetings or expert consultations [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref019">19</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Datasets produced at a global extent may not effectively capture the sub national context. A recent investigation by Trigg et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref107" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref107">107</a>] tested 6 global models used to derive flood hazard and found that agreement between the models for the African continent was roughly 30–40%, thus highlighting the discrepancies between models when extracted to a reduced coverage. The global dataset for flood frequency [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref063">63</a>] used in our study possesses a fine resolution (1km) and was validated by experts through a workshop in the case study countries, Vietnam and Nicaragua. However, there is a chance that at very fine resolutions (&lt;1km) and in areas where flash floods, complex topography, peri-urban landscapes and varying technological and management capacity exist; discrepancies between the model and reality are likely [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref107" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref107">107</a>]. Additionally, the datasets are historic snapshots and may not capture the current trend, for instance, the flooding data [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref063">63</a>] is based on records from 1999–2007. However, this was the most up to date and robust data available at the time of the study. Despite inevitable constraints, the flooding and additional hazard datasets (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>, see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">methods</a>) used in our study have been tested and published [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref108" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref108">108</a>] and the utilised data has been scrutinised throughout the methodology process (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213641.g001" href="#pone.0213641.g001">Fig 1</a>, see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">methods</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate suitability modelling results for the current conditions have been verified by experts. They largely capture the known locations where the crop is grown. However, there is uncertainty attached to the future projections of climate suitability which are based on a single RCP (8.5) [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref092">92</a>] and are dependent upon the ensemble of 33 GCMs. Using a mean of the GCMs has been adopted to reduce the uncertainty inherent in using a single GCM [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref092">92</a>], but the EcoCrop and Maxent models do not cater for the standard deviation between the GCMs. A further assumption is in the use of the representative concentration pathway 8.5, which is a high emission scenario. Using a less aggressive scenario (for example, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5) would likely reduce the impacts of climate change on climatic crop suitability under the future conditions and this is likely to affect the final crop vulnerability results. Further research could quantify the impacts of using different RCPs on the climate suitability component of the CRVA. Another potential avenue for selecting a future climate scenario is to identify the RCP which is used by the respective ministry in the country of interest, this will likely result in greater uptake of the final vulnerability recommendations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also acknowledge that the GIS analysis may possess some biases which influence the final outputs. Notably we have undertaken the study at a policy unit which is fine resolution. It is notable that several of the administrative units which possess smaller areas tend to have higher vulnerability, for example, in the case of Uganda, we see that the sub county of Pader TC, located in the district of Pader, northern Uganda is in the “highest” vulnerability category, whilst all the surrounding sub counties are “high” vulnerability. The sub county is 64 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>, which is below the average sub county area (250km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), and smaller than the surrounding sub county’s. Nevertheless, besides the adaptive capacity data for poverty and education (district level) the utilised datasets were either at the sub county level or at a resolution of roughly 1km (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>, see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" href="#sec002">methods</a>), which therefore enables sub county analysis, including those at &lt;100km
  <span class="sup">2</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have also made assumptions regarding the indicators used to represent the components of vulnerability. A recent study by Cinner et al [
  <a rid="pone.0213641.ref109" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0213641.ref109">109</a>] propose an alternative approach to understanding adaptive capacity that includes the willingness and capability to turn resources into adaptation action and suggest additional criteria, beyond wealth, education and organizational capacity (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>) that can be used to determine the capacity to respond to change. We have assumed simplistically that adaptive capacity is homogenous across the analysed cropping systems for the respective countries based on a number of indicators (
  <a rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0213641.t002">Table 2</a>). We acknowledge the complexity of capturing adaptive capacity and understand that it may vary depending on the community or farming system being analysed, for instance, it may be that wealthier farmers grow cash crops and therefore have greater resistance to climate change, or that the adaptive capacity of coffee farmers is driven by different indicators to that of rice farmers. Furthermore, we understand that farmers are constantly responding to changes in the climate, whilst in our study we have compiled spatially explicit secondary data on the current adaptive capacity of the population which does not capture the fluid and responsive nature of adaptation to climate change. Our methodology is intended to capture the general patterns of vulnerability to climate change at a national extent through an agricultural lens. We spatially identify the vulnerability of administrative areas to climate change using secondary data, but we do not have the local scale data required to capture the responsiveness of individual farmers to climate stresses. We can accept this as a limitation of our study but one that is necessary due to the pan tropical extent of our research. Future studies could undertake primary data collection at a fine temporal (daily) and spatial resolution (house hold) for administrative areas that we have identified as vulnerable in order to identify how farmers respond on a daily basis to climate challenges. The updates in the conceptualization and measure of adaptive capacity provides an opportunity to develop a more responsive and complex representation of vulnerability that goes beyond the traditional indicators.
