 <p>Climate scenarios incorporate changes in fuel costs associated with carbon taxation as well as economic development used in the GCAM projections. Total fuel price is calculated as the sum of the base price, determined from the growth rate, and the carbon tax. Ocean (OA) acidification impacts include either no impact, or combinations of increasing larval mortality (Larvae), reduced growth rates (Growth), and increased mortality of small scallops due to predation (Predation). Management impacts include either no set catch limits, or combinations of maximum allowable biological catch (ABC), varying reference points due to changing growth rates (F
  <sub>MSY</sub>), and closed areas (10% closure).
