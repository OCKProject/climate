 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test the impacts of management of the sea scallop industry on future scenarios, we test four different management cases:</p>
 <div list-type="order" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>No catch limits: Although not realistic, we allow the current limited access scallop fleet (~320 vessels) to choose scallop landings based on economic viability of fishing through the choice of days at sea from 0 to 365. This removes the catch and effort limits from the economic decision-making rules described in Cooley et al. [
    <a rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref013">13</a>], while maintaining the scallop fleet as a limited access fishery with its current gear regulations, crew limits and selectivity.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Low management: Regulations are set at those described in Cooley et al. [
    <a rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref013">13</a>]. Management sets annual catch limits by setting fishing mortality to F
    <sub>ABC</sub>, and tracking catch [
    <a rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref013">13</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0203536.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref027">27</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0203536.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref028">28</a>]. This reduction from F
    <sub>MSY</sub> accounts for scientific uncertainty in biological reference points. This management scenario assumes that fisheries reference points (e.g. F
    <sub>MSY</sub>) remain constant through time.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Medium management: This assumes the rules from “low management,” and additionally quantifies fisheries reference points every 5 years based on updated growth rates and natural mortality from changing local temperature and carbonate mineral saturation state. This scenario changes F
    <sub>MSY</sub> over time based on growth and mortality rates using the stochastic yield-per-recruit model described in Hart [
    <a rid="pone.0203536.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref029">29</a>] and is used by NMFS during their regular stock assessment workshops [
    <a rid="pone.0203536.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref027">27</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0203536.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref028">28</a>] to reevaluate fisheries reference points.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>High management: This scenario assumes the rules from “medium” management scenarios, and additionally adds in a closure that represents a permanently closed area to fishing. Beginning in 2012, we assume 10% of the biomass of each Georges Bank and the Mid-Atlantic Bight populations are placed in permanently closed areas and track the two sub-populations separately over time. This biomass adds to the total supply of recruits, but is not available for fishing, so that fishing mortality and the associated incidental and discard mortalities for this subpopulation are zero. We assume 10% of the total recruitment occurs in closed areas each year. The closed area biomass is then factored into both the stochastic yield model to quantify F
    <sub>MSY</sub>, and the forward projecting model. This scenario is most similar to the current management scheme, which includes permanently closed regions (parts of Closed Area II) on Georges Bank that represents approximately 10% of the biomass.
