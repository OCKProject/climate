 <div class="title">Scallop biomass by size class from the Mid-Atlantic Bight (left panels) and Georges Bank (right panels) populations versus ocean acidification impact (rows).</div>
 <p>Upper panels show larval impacts only, middle panels show larval and growth impacts, and bottom panels show larval, growth, and increased predation impacts. Dashed lines illustrate catch limit only management scenarios and solid lines illustrate the highest level of management (catch limits, varying reference points, and 10% area closures). Black lines indicate reference simulations with no ocean acidification impacts.</p>
