 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These projected model scenarios showing stock and landing declines with time under elevated CO
  <sub>2</sub> and increasing ocean acidification are not without caveats. No studies have been published to date on the impacts of ocean acidification on 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">magellanicus</span>, and the IAM relies on experimental studies of other bivalves, including Pectinids, to estimate the relative impacts of ocean acidification on juvenile and adult scallop growth rates [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref013">13</a>]. Since the initial meta-analysis used in Cooley et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref013">13</a>], several new experiments have been published within the scallop taxa. Lagos et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref034">34</a>] found that juvenile 
  <span class="italic">Argopecten purpuratus</span> was sensitive to ocean acidification, with reduced growth rates in experimental individuals compared to those reared under present day conditions. However, Ramajo et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref035">35</a>] found the opposite result, with increased growth and calcification rates of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">purpuratus</span> in response to ocean acidification. Gobler et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref036">36</a>] found that 
  <span class="italic">Argopecten irradians</span> juveniles were sensitive to acidification, but this sensitivity manifested itself in reduced survival rates, rather than a reduction in growth rates. Older work by White et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref010">10</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref011">11</a>] also found that larval 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">irradians</span> was sensitive to acidification that manifested in both reduced larval survival and calcification rates.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given both the species-specific and within-species variability that is typically observed among different populations (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref034">34</a>] vs. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref035">35</a>]), generalizing how 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">magellanicus</span> may respond to ocean acidification using studies from other species may lead to errors in estimating the population and fishery trajectory under future climate scenarios. From the studies used in Cooley et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref013">13</a>], and the additional studies above, experiments have mostly been conducted on estuarine or shallow water species, where seasonal or diel cycling may expose bivalves to low carbonate mineral saturation state under naturally varying conditions. These organisms may be more resilient to ocean acidification than those found in more stable, deeper continental shelf environments, like 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">magellanicus</span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few studies have been conducted on a similarly long-lived Pectinid, 
  <span class="italic">Pecten maximus</span>, found in deep-water environments in the Northeast Atlantic. Experiments there have focused on the juvenile and larval life stages, and the swimming capability of adults, and they have shown mixed responses [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref012">12</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref015">15</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref021">21</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref037">37</a>]. Sanders et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref037">37</a>] found no impact of ocean acidification on juvenile 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">maximus</span> growth when food was not limiting. However, irrespective of treatment, growth as measured by changes in shell height was negligible over their 90-day study, suggesting a longer-term experiment might be needed to determine the effects ocean acidification on growth of long-lived species such as 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">maximus</span> or 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">magellanicus</span>. Larval 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">maximus</span> life stages are also sensitive to ocean acidification, with experimental declines in survival, shell height, and increases in deformity rates with decreasing carbonate mineral saturation state [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref012">12</a>]. Currently, results from Andersen et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref012">12</a>] are used to link carbonate mineral saturation state to recruitment in the IAM [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref013">13</a>]. Although Schalkhausser et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref015">15</a>] found the swimming behavior of 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">maximus</span> was sensitive to ocean acidification and reduced clapping force, a repeated experiment on a different subpopulation showed a different, yet still acidification-sensitive swimming response [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref021">21</a>]. Populations sourced from Norway were more sensitive and exhibited reduced clapping force, while 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">maximus</span> individuals sourced from France were only sensitive to acidification when incubated under warm water conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref015">15</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref021">21</a>]. The high variability in response within a single species suggests that studies on the response of 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">magellanicus</span> to ocean acidification are warranted to improve future projections of populations under future climate scenarios.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if ocean acidification impacts specific to 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">magellanicus</span> were known, individual scallop responses may be difficult to translate to population-level impacts. For example, although the population submodel in the IAM incorporates increased larval mortality through effects on the stock-recruit relationship, larval and juvenile stages (under two-year-old scallops) are not explicitly modeled. An additional pre-recruit model, such as that described in Punt et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref038">38</a>] for the Alaskan red king crab, that incorporates growth rates, larval and juvenile mortality, settlement indicators [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref039">39</a>] and environmental change, would better describe how increased larval or juvenile mortality might impact population-level recruitment. Finally, biological adaptation or acclimatization over time to increased ocean acidification stress could occur [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref040">40</a>]. Future iterations of this work could also incorporate an adaptation-type response within our growth, mortality, and predation rate projections [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref041">41</a>], which is beyond the scope of the current study.
