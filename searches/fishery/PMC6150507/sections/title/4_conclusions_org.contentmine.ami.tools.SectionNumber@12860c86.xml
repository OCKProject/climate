 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Integrated assessment models (IAMs) provide frameworks for bridging climate change and socioeconomic projections with other analyses of vulnerability, impacts, adaptation opportunities and mitigation possibilities. The wild-caught commercial US Atlantic sea scallop fishery (
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">magellanicus</span>) is currently valuable, well managed, and healthy, but is also potentially sensitive to increasing atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub>, ocean acidification, and ocean climate warming [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref005">5</a>]. In previous work [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref013">13</a>], we reported on preliminary sensitivity studies using a new sea scallop IAM that incorporates: scallop recruitment and size-structured scallop population dynamics; ocean CO
  <sub>2</sub> uptake, biogeochemistry, and warming; and scallop fishery management rules and socio-economic drivers. Here we conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the scallop IAM exploring scenarios that vary atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> and climate change, ocean acidification impacts, fishery management, and fuel costs. For future external forcing over the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century, we utilize representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that provide internally consistent projections of atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub>, ocean warming, population, economic development, and carbon tax. This framework and a generalized version of the IAM could be applied to other species with similar life history characteristics such as relatively sessile and size-structured population dynamics provided information was available on important model parameterizations such as growth and mortality rates and sensitivity to ocean acidification.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The suite of possible scenarios presented here are intended to provide initial ways to consider the impacts of differing degrees of climate change and ocean acidification on a highly valuable, wild-caught, federally regulated fishery. Impacts on the fishery were substantially smaller for a moderate climate policy scenario (RCP4.5) in comparison to a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5), showing the value of climate mitigation efforts. Ocean acidification may lead to shifts in the size structure of the scallop stock, with ensuing biological, fishery management and economic impacts (e.g. declining fishery revenue for smaller sized scallops). Model runs with increased management partially offset the decline in the scallop fishery, but do not fully protect the population from the long-term impacts of global change. The IAM simulations emphasize the benefits of sustained monitoring and adaptive management of the US scallop fishery to avoid the worst possible consequences of ocean acidification. Additionally, the development of this suite of model scenarios highlights the lack of empirical data on the potential impacts of ocean acidification on 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">magellanicus</span> at the organismal, population, and community level including effects from recruitment and growth to predator-prey interactions. A suite of laboratory studies identifying the response of various 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">magellanicus</span> life stages to ocean acidification is a clear next step in determining the future of this valuable fishery.
