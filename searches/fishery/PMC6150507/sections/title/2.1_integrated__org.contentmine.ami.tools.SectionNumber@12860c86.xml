 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scallop population submodel is a size-based matrix population model that was simplified from the sea scallop fisheries management model, the Scallop Area Management Simulator (SAMS). The SAMS model splits the scallop population into a number of distinct geographic units with individual populations and growth rates based on historical survey data. The reduced population submodel used in the IAM described in Cooley et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref013">13</a>] separates the sea scallop population into two geographic units, Georges Bank and the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and tracks each population with unique population parameters. The population submodel includes terms for recruitment, growth, maximum size, and natural, incidental, discard, and fishing mortalities, growth rates, maximum sizes, and recruitment.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The biogeochemical submodel is a two-box ocean model (surface and bottom waters) with separate sub-modules for Georges Bank and Mid-Atlantic Bight regions. Carbonate chemistry is explicitly modeled including terms for air-sea gas exchange, primary production, and calcium carbonate production in the surface box, and biological export and organic matter remineralization in the bottom water box. The two-box model also includes terms for temperature and salinity to determine seasonal changes in stratification and mixing, and the biogeochemical model parameters were trained with data from the 2000â€“2010 period. The biogeochemical model in the IAM is linked to the population model through temperature and calcium carbonate mineral saturation state impacts on adult growth and larval mortality. The biogeochemical model is linked to the socio-economic model through the future climate scenarios, from the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which set future atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The economic submodel is based on economic modeling of the sea scallop fishery by the New England Fisheries Management Council [
  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref018">18</a>]. The submodel uses price and cost models that include terms for landings, per-capita disposable income (an indication of economic development), scallop imports and exports, fuel costs, days at sea, and number of crew members. From yearly estimated price and costs, the economic model determines the optimal number of days at sea to fish based on a rules analysis maximizing net profit and adhering to management set maximum allowable biological catch (ABC) that is determined as the catch associated with a precautionary fishing mortality (F
  <sub>ABC</sub>) that is a slight reduction in the fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (F
  <sub>MSY</sub>). The economic submodel is linked to the scallop population model through the management set limits on catch and the scallop pricing analysis, and linked to the biogeochemical model through the RCP scenarios.
