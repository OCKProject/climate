 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Management choice has by far the largest immediate impact on biomass and fishery outcomes. Although the “market chooses” scenario is unlikely to ever occur due to federal fisheries management regulations, the removal of a set catch limit is still an interesting exercise to highlight the value in the fisheries management process. Under the “no set catch limits” scenario, regardless of other possible impact pathways, there were dramatic declines in fishery biomass (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g006" href="#pone.0203536.g006">Fig 6</a>). For orientation, the red curves in Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g003" href="#pone.0203536.g003">3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g006" href="#pone.0203536.g006">6</a> correspond to the same cases (high management and high ocean acidification impact). Stock biomass was depleted by between ~30–80% for “no set catch limits” cases when compared to a similar climate and ocean acidification impact scenario that includes management set catch limits. Initially, when catch limits are removed, there is a spike in landings and decline in biomass suggesting that there are untapped resources within the sea scallop stock in any given year (blue data in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g007" href="#pone.0203536.g007">Fig 7</a>). Beyond this initial spike, landings do not deviate from the similar climate-with-high-management scenario (purple data in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g007" href="#pone.0203536.g007">Fig 7</a>) until beyond 2050. As landings are similar for the first 40 years of simulation, revenues also do not deviate between the “market chooses” and high management scenario until the latter half of the century. However, because stock biomass is depleted, scallop vessels must fish nearly twice as many days at sea to maintain landings at the same level, leading to significant reductions in crew incomes when compared to scenarios with set catch limits. Because operating costs of the industry are taken from crew shares [

  <a rid="pone.0203536.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0203536.ref018">18</a>], after the initial spike, owner profitability remains largely similar between “market chooses” and management scenarios until landings and revenues deviate due to future climate impacts beyond 2050.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each increase in management level improves the future outcome of the fishery for every climate scenario. The addition of a simple catch limit (ABC only management scenario) without time-evolving fisheries reference points or closed areas leads to the most relative gain in future biomass compared to the higher management scenarios (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g007" href="#pone.0203536.g007">7</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g008" href="#pone.0203536.g008">8</a>). Time-evolving reference points (ABC+YPR, “medium” management) lead only to minor gains in biomass with high ocean acidification impacts, likely because the fishery is currently well-managed at a precautionary fishing mortality. Under RCP8.5 and high ocean acidification impacts, the highest level of management considered here increases the future biomass of the fishery compared to constant management targets and no closures. The fishery has slightly reduced landings due to a lower set catch limit from the initial 10% biomass closure beginning in 2012. However, the closure increases total biomass by more than 25% due to buildup of large scallops in the closed areas, and improves recruitment in the Mid-Atlantic region where a clear stock-recruit relationship has been observed [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the future projection of scallop biomass improves with the highest levels of management considered here, this additional management level only somewhat reduces the long-term overall decline in biomass (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g006" href="#pone.0203536.g006">6</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g007" href="#pone.0203536.g007">7</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g008" href="#pone.0203536.g008">8</a>) and changes in size distribution (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g005" href="#pone.0203536.g005">Fig 5</a>) due to ocean acidification impacts. When a 10% closure is added to the scallop management regime, biomass builds up in the largest scallop size classes compared to scenarios with catch limits only (solid vs. dashed lines), but this buildup becomes less pronounced over time, e.g. 2020 (blue data in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g005" href="#pone.0203536.g005">Fig 5</a>) vs. 2100 (yellow data in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g005" href="#pone.0203536.g005">Fig 5</a>) and with increasing ocean acidification impacts. This suggests the 10% closure may not be enough to preserve scallop biomass under future changes in carbonate mineral saturation state.
