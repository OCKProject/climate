  <div class="title">Contour plots of biomass at three different time points (2020, 2050, and 2100) for RCP8.5 (left panels) and RCP4.5 (right panels).</div>
  <p>X-axes increase management levels from low to high as no set catch limit (None), allowable biological catch limits only (low), ABC and variable fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (YPR, medium), and ABC, YPR, and an additional 10% closed area (high). Y-axes increase ocean acidification impacts from no impact to high impacts as no ocean acidification impacts, larval impacts only (L), larvae and growth rate impacts (L+G), and larvae, growth, and predation (L+G+P). Biomass is shown in units of 1000 metric tons (mT).</p>
