 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With anthropogenic pressures rapidly expanding in the Mediterranean Sea, there is a serious risk that these may push the system beyond the “point of no-return”, with consequence for marine biodiversity and the economies that depend on it, seriously constraining the ecosystem service options available to future generations. Ecosystem modelling tools can support the analysis and identification of the potential suitable options for ensuring the coexistence of sustainable human activities and the protection of healthy marine ecosystems. Temporal hind-cast analysis has enabled us to assess changes in the historical dynamics of species/functional groups inhabiting this system, quantifying the role and impact of changes in primary productivity and fishing pressure. Since climate variability and change in combination with fishing pressure is expected to intensify in the region, modelling approaches like the one presented here are necessary in predicting the effect of changes of the above-mentioned pressures on the marine food web. This constitutes an important first step further to advance in the regional assessment of the Mediterranean Sea ecosystem to inform conservation plans and management actions.</p>
