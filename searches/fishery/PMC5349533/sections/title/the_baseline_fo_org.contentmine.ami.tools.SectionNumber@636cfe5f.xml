 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The baseline food web model of the Mediterranean Sea</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a previously developed food web model
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a> constructed with the Ecopath with Ecosim approach (EwE) using the Ecopath mass-balance module
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a> representing the whole Mediterranean ecosystem in the 1950 decade. We used the Ecopath model as a baseline to run temporal hind-cast (1950–2011) analyses, assessing the response of the Mediterranean marine ecosystem to changes in primary productivity and fishing effort. The baseline Ecopath model consisted of 103 functional groups, ranging from phytoplankton and invertebrates to top predator species and it was divided in four sub-models representing the four main areas of the Mediterranean basin: 1) Western Mediterranean Sea (W); 2) Adriatic Sea (A); 3) Ionian and Central Mediterranean Sea (I); and 4) Aegean Sea and Levantine Sea (E). These areas account for sub-regional differences in environmental and ecological characteristics of the ecosystem and are utilised also by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The food web model had the following key input variables: biomass (B), production/biomass ratio (P/B), consumption/biomass ratio (Q/B), diet composition, and fisheries catches and discards. The main trophic structure of the Mediterranean Sea EwE model is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a> and species and/or functional groups included in the model are listed in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S1</a>. A full description and sources of information of the input and output parameters of the baseline Ecopath model are available in Piroddi 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a> and are presented in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S2-S3 Tables</a> in the

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A set of pre-balancing (PREBAL
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>) analyses are presented in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Figure S4</a> with the purpose of showing the coherency of the basic input parameters with respect to general rules/principles of ecosystem ecology. In particular, these rules include: 1. biomass estimates by functional group in the model, which span 5–7 orders of magnitude when arranged against their trophic levels; 2. slope of biomass (on a log scale) by functional group, which declines by 5–10% across all the taxa when arranged against trophic levels; 3. vital rates (P/B; Q/B) across taxa/trophic levels which decline with increasing trophic level

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Ecopath model constructed in Piroddi 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a> included seven types of fishing fleets: trawlers, dredges, mid water trawlers, purse seiners, longliners, artisanal and recreational activities. In this study, these fleets were adapted due to a lack of time series of data regarding the number of vessels and gross tonnage (GT) for some of the fleets, which are important for estimating historical fishing effort. In particular, while recreational fishery was retained from the previous model, main commercial fisheries were divided in: 1. trawlers (which included trawlers and dredges); 2. purse seiners; 3. longliners and 4. artisanal fisheries. This new fishing fleets configuration was created to follow the same structure as in Sacchi 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>, the main source of information for temporal time series data of number of vessels and gross tonnage (GT) for the above-mentioned fleets for each Mediterranean country for the period 1990–2010. For Italy and Greece, we were able to get longer time series data using detailed reconstructions respectively from Piroddi 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a> for the 1950–2010 period, from Stergiou

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a> for 1964–1989, and Moutopoulos 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a> for 1990–2010. To estimate an overall trend of number of fishing vessels for the 1950–2010 period, for those countries with missing years, we assumed same trends as observed by Greer
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a> who reported the number of fishing vessels for each country of the world for 1950–2010. GT was extrapolated, for the missing years, as the average ratio of GT in the observed time periods, while number of days spent fishing were kept as the ratio of days at sea observed respectively in Sacchi 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.

  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a> for Greece. For Spanish and Italian trawlers, we complemented our trends with data from EVOMED
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>, a European project that assessed the evolution and technological improvement of fishing capacity for the major countries of the Mediterranean Sea for the early 1900–2010 period.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishing effort (kW*days
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) was calculated as the product of the number of fishing vessels, kW per vessel (inferred from their GT), and the number of days spent fishing. To account for improvements in technology (e.g., mobile phone, GPS, sonar, radio) that were not captured by kW as a measure of effort (

  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a> and EVOMED
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a> was applied from 1980 to 1995 while for the remaining periods (1950–1979 and 1996–2010) a 0.5% and ~ 1.9% (this value varied with gear type; see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S6 Table</a>) were respectively used following the work of Pauly and Palomares
