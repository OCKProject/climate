 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modelling results explained from 50% to 69% of the variability of historical time series data utilised in the present study. Both fishing pressure and PP anomaly played an important role in improving the model fit. In addition, our results indicated that the PP anomaly, representing the temporal variation of the primary productivity of the system, was the strongest driver upon the Mediterranean Sea ecosystem. This supports the results obtained from other studies

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">57</a> that have shown how the Mediterranean Sea is driven by bottom-up processes where nutrient availability controls the biological characteristics of the region. The use of relative PP trends from a regional biogeochemical model helped validating our predicted PP anomaly trend and improved the temporal dynamics of selected species in the ecosystem (particularly for forage fish: European pilchards and anchovies). This was clearly visible, for example, in the Adriatic Sea where PP anomaly unsuccessfully reproduced the trends of European anchovies while PP trends from the biogeochemical model was able to better capture the dynamics. Since there are no official long-trend (from the 1950 s) records of primary production in the region (Macias 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2014), using a modelling framework that combines hydro-dynamic biogeochemical models with ecosystem models (such as EwE), becomes critically important, particularly in complex areas like the Adriatic Sea that show strong physical and biological oceanographic characteristics [decreasing gradient of trophic conditions from north to south
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" href="#b58">58</a> ] and is also subjected to strong anthropogenic pressures (e.g., fishing)

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">60</a>. Currently there is a growing interest in these ensemble modelling frameworks

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a> in order to improve scientific capability to predict future ecosystem changes, and provide guidance for the setting of targets and implementation of management measures

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" href="#b61">61</a>. Accordingly to Macias 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" href="#b62">62</a>, which explored potential changes in primary productivity in the Mediterranean Sea under different emission scenarios of future climate change, the Mediterranean basin will become warmer and more saline with consequences on the productivity of the region. The Western basin is expected to become more oligotrophic, associated to a surface density decrease influenced by the Atlantic waters, while the Eastern basin, on the contrary, is predicted to become more eutrophic due to a surface water density increase caused by increasing evaporation rate. Since these results are expected to alter the structural and functional processes shaping the Mediterranean food web, modelling tools like the one developed here are necessary in predicting the effects of climate variability and change on the future food web configurations.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study also highlights that fishing was an important driver affecting the dynamics of fish populations and invertebrates of the Mediterranean Sea ecosystem. This is in line with previous studies that documented the increasing impact of fishing in the Mediterranean Sea and the overexploitation of its marine resources

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">63</a>. Simulations, in fact, were able to reflect the impact of increased fishing effort in the basin starting, in all the four sub-areas, since the ‘50 s. Nominal fishing effort showed decreasing trends only after 2000; the only exception was found in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea where fishing effort showed a fluctuating trend in the 2000 s decade.
