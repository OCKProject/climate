 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trends in ecological indicators calculated from Ecosim temporal outputs showed different patterns if we looked at each sub-regional sea individually or at the Mediterranean ecosystem as a whole. For example, considering the entire Mediterranean Sea, a clear decreasing trend was observed in community biomass indicators like the forage fish biomass (on average −34%) and, to less extent, for demersal fish (−14%), the Kempton’s biodiversity index (−18%) and in all the trophic level indicators considered (TLco, TL ≥ 3.25 and TL Catch) (−5%) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f7" href="#f7">Fig. 7</a>). On the contrary, an increase was predicted for invertebrate biomass (+23%) while no clear trend was visible for sharks and rays/skates. Total catch was the only indicator that clearly increased in time (until 1990 s) (+189%) and that gradually decreased afterwards. These patterns were also reflected through the Spearman correlation test (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering sub-regional seas (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Figures S10–S13</a>), we observed a clear decline of forage fish (−41%), demersal fish (−49%) and sharks/rays-skates (−60%) biomasses in the Western and Adriatic Seas, a fluctuation of these groups in the Ionian Sea while in the Eastern Mediterranean they respectively decreased, increased and fluctuated. Invertebrate biomass slightly decreased in the Adriatic Sea (−13%); fluctuated in the Western and Ionian Seas; and increased in the Eastern Mediterranean (+53%). The Kempton biodiversity index decreased in the Western (−49%) and in the Ionian Sea (−41%), it showed a slight increase in the Adriatic (+9%) while no clear trend was visible in the Eastern Mediterranean. Total catch increased in all the areas (+189%) until the beginning of 1990 s but in the Western and Ionian Seas started to fluctuate afterwards while in the Eastern and Adriatic Sea it gradually declined. As for the different trophic level indicators assessed, the mean TL of the community slightly increased in the Western Mediterranean (+10%) and decreased in the other sub-regions (−5%), while the mean TL ≥3.25 and mean TL catches decreased in all the seas (−4%) except in the Eastern Mediterranean where they respectively fluctuated with no clear trend and slightly increased (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we tested the significance and correlation of our suite of temporal ecological indicators, we noticed that in the Western and the Adriatic Seas the majority of the time series were negatively correlated with high significance (respectively 6 and 7 out of 9 indicators; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f8" href="#f8">Fig. 8</a>). On the contrary, in the Ionian Sea and Eastern Mediterranean Sea, the community indicators (except for forage fishes in the Ionian that showed a weak negative correlation) were highly significant and positively correlated (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f8" href="#f8">Fig. 8</a>). Also, we observed no significant and weakly correlated trends for mean TL ≥3.25 and Kempton biodiversity index in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.
