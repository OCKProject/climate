  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a> was applied in Ecosim to assess sensitivity of Ecosimâ€™s output to the basic Ecopath input parameters (B, P/B, Q/B, EE), drawing input parameters from a normal distribution centered on the base Ecopath value and using a defined coefficient of variation, in this case set to 0.1

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" href="#b53">53</a>. Here, we run 1000 iterations, and the range of outputs (the 5
  <span class="sup">th</span> and 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile) were plotted for both the fitted results (in our case time series of biomasses) and the model-based ecological indicators.
