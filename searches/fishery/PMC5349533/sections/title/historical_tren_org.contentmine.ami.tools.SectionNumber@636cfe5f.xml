 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We provide here new insights on temporal dynamics of major marine species/functional groups of the Mediterranean Sea ecosystem. In general, both biomass trends and ecological indicators revealed that the combined effect of excessive fishing pressure and changes in the primary productivity have altered the Mediterranean marine ecosystem over time, especially reducing the proportions of top predators and larger fish (e.g., pinnipeds, large pelagic fish) and increasing the abundance of groups at lower trophic levels (e.g., invertebrates). This was already observed from west to east in other studies, for example, in the Catalan
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" href="#b64">64</a>, Adriatic
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">55</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" href="#b59">59</a> and Ionian
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" href="#b65">65</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">66</a> Seas. Our results also show that forage fish species were observed to decrease, at a different time scale, in the majority of the studied Mediterranean sub-areas; with the only exception in the Ionian Sea where no clear trends were observed. These forage fish (mainly European pilchard and anchovy) constitute the bulk of fish catches in the Mediterranean Sea, accounting for almost 40% of total landings
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" href="#b67">67</a> and they are of high commercial interest. Therefore, an increase of fishing mortality, together with changes in productivity, have affected these stocks throughout the Mediterranean Sea. As for the Ionian Sea, the results obtained here should be taken with caution. Our fitting analysis for the majority of the species/functional group in this area didn’t show any clear trend besides fluctuations over time. These results for the Ionian Sea disagree with several studies that have shown decreasing trend in the abundance of many commercial and uncommercial species in the area
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" href="#b47">47</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" href="#b65">65</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" href="#b68">68</a>. Poor model performance could be related to poor quality of the available data used in our study (e.g., for forage fish species, long time series were available only from Sicily), or to the fact that important additional factors were missing from our modelling analysis (e.g., changes in oceanographic and physical characteristics, quality of prey availability, etc.) that could be affecting Ionian Sea populations. This will need further research.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trends in demersal fish stocks also show signs of decrease, both at regional and sub-regional scale (specifically in the Western and Adriatic Sea), while sharks (which in our model were mainly represented by demersal species, see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S1</a>) and rays/skates seemed to have declined in the Western and Adriatic regions, but not in the whole Mediterranean Sea. Part of these results are in line with historical
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" href="#b69">69</a> and recent studies
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" href="#b70">70</a>, which pointed to increased fishing pressure and lack in gear selectivity as the reason why 85% of the assessed demersal stocks (including demersal sharks, rays and skates) are currently overexploited.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, our estimates of species declines are conservative in comparison with results from fisheries stock assessments available for the Mediterranean Sea
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" href="#b71">71</a>. The reason behind is likely related to the lack of data particularly in the 1950s–1970s period, which probably contributed to lower the reduction captured by the model in term of abundance of certain functional groups. In addition, our model was built with functional groups, which in some cases aggregated a vast number of species including commercial and non-commercial ones, and/or considered the North and South Mediterranean Seas together. This is probably masking the largest declines of highly commercial species in the Northwestern and Central Mediterranean Sea areas that we observe when looking at these species individually.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A clear sign of change in the structure of the Mediterranean Sea ecosystem is visible from results of the mean trophic level of the community, mean TL ≥ 3.25 and Q diversity index (which includes those species or groups with TL ≥ 3) showing a decline since 1950 s and reflecting the decline of large predators/fish stocks and increase of lower trophic level organisms. These results are consistent with previous ecosystem assessments
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b63" href="#b63">63</a>, although it is important to bear in mind that these results were assessed considering both fitted and non-fitted groups. Caution should be taken when interpreting the results. Differences in ecological indicators (e.g., community and TL based indicators) were found among the different sub-regions analyzed and, because of lack of studies at sub-regional scale to validate these results, we would like to stress the need to further develop this work.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding catches, the fitting procedure enabled us to detect issues related to landings data at the beginning of our survey period. Low fishing mortalities were observed in the ‘50 s, in each sub-area, for three very important commercial species (European pilchard, anchovy and hake). Mortality rates for these species were between 5 and 10 times lower than the average reference values reported for these fish stocks in the Mediterranean Sea
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a>. This supports the hypothesis, already highlighted by several studies
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b72" href="#b72">72</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b73" href="#b73">73</a>, of poor quality of fisheries statistics, particularly in historical times (1950–1970). Part of this problem could be related to the different way fisheries data were collected and aggregated by the different countries and regional institutions
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b74" href="#b74">74</a>. Poor data quality and availability could also be explained by the presence of illegal, unreported and/or unregulated (IUU) fishing activities occurring in the region
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">44</a> especially with regard to illegal nets and mesh sizes, the landing and marketing of undersized fish, and compliance with restrictions on fishing season and areas
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>. This highlights the need to utilize better catch data in modelling exercises in the Mediterranean Sea in order to account for more realistic fishing mortality estimates and trends, and guide proper management decisions. Recent catch reconstruction efforts, which aim at considering all types of fisheries removals (from reported and unreported landings to recreational landings and discards), have been constructed and are now available (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.seaaroundus.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.seaaroundus.org</span>) for the different countries of the Mediterranean Sea
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" href="#b75">75</a>. In this study, the catch reconstruction has been partly used to fill up gaps encountered in the FAO catch database (e.g., contribution of specific species/functional groups to fishing fleets and the proportion of the reconstructed catches of European pilchard/anchovy/hake relative to the total catch). Unfortunately, though, at the time this modelling exercise was completed, the reconstruction of total catches for Mediterranean countries was still being developed. Therefore, a necessary further step of this study should be the integration of such catch reconstruction in the input modelling parameters to compare results with the current implementation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite limitations, our model was able to reflect the temporal trends of fisheries across the Mediterranean Sea, with a general increase in the total catch and a decline in the mean TL catch. Such patterns could reflect that catch composition, with a highly diversified targeted species, continues to change in time as a result of fisheries expansion to further and deeper fishing grounds
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>. A different picture emerges when looking at total catches per sub-regional area, where clear signs of decrease are noticeable mainly in the Adriatic and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea - and for the last simulation years also in the Western Mediterranean and Ionian Seas. These results are consistent with previous studies that have pointed out excessive fishing mortality and food web degradation caused by fishing in the Eastern and Adriatic fisheries
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">55</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" href="#b76">76</a>. On the other hand, the more stable catches observed in the Western Mediterranean and Ionian Sea could be the result of exploiting new species, as observed for the Mediterranean as a whole
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trophic level of the catches for the whole Mediterranean Sea and as well for the majority of the sub-areas (Western, Adriatic and Ionian Seas) presented a clear ‘fishing down’ effect
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" href="#b77">77</a> that occurs when top predators and large sized fish are removed from the ecosystem and gradually replaced by lower trophic level organisms. Similar trends had been observed in the Mediterranean Sea, both at regional
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" href="#b77">77</a>, sub-regional
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a> and more local scale
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">10</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b78" href="#b78">78</a>. The only exception was found in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea where, contrary to the rest of areas, a situation of ‘fishing up’ was found. Accordingly to Stergiou and Tsikliras
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b79" href="#b79">79</a>, though, this might be a ‘false fishing up effect’ occurring when small pelagic fishes and invertebrates, with a low trophic level, and larger-size predators fish are both intensely fished and/or depleted.
