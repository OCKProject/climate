 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most statistically significant results in our model fitting exercise were obtained when trophic interactions, fishing and the primary productivity changes were included together in the model run (Step 7 in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t3" href="#t3">Table 3</a>). Differences were found among the five areas with the “best” fitted models (lowest AICc) explaining from 50% to 69% of the variance of the data (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t3" href="#t3">Table 3</a>). By looking at each area separately, the Ionian Sea sub-model was the one that showed the smallest improvement of prediction capabilities (thus the AICc estimates declined the least), while the Eastern followed by the Western Mediterranean were the areas with the highest improvement from the baseline AICc estimates. Both fishing and primary productivity drivers, when considered individually, were able to enhance the fit of all areas by ~16–~50% (when using the predicted PP anomaly) and by ~10–~37% when using fishing effort (steps 3 and 5 in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The addition of trophic interactions to changes in PP anomaly alone (step 4 in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>) provided the second largest improvement for the Western, Ionian, and the whole Mediterranean Seas (AICc reduced further by ~10%). For the Adriatic Sea, this was obtained with the addition of trophic interactions to fishing effort (step 6 in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Also, different vulnerabilities were tested, and the largest enhancement was obtained using high vulnerabilities (step 7 in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t3" href="#t3">Table 3</a>) for both the sub-models (maximum predator prey-interactions or Vs: #24) and the additional Mediterranean model as a whole (maximum predator prey-interactions or Vs: #2). Despite differences observed both at species/functional group and at sub-regional level, Ecosim results revealed that the Mediterranean Sea was mainly driven by bottom-up control interactions and low vulnerabilities were dominant (Western: 46%; Adriatic: 75%; Ionian: 50% and Eastern: 54%), followed by top-down controls interactions indicated by high vulnerabilities (Western: 42%; Adriatic: 21%; Ionian: 25% and Eastern: 33%). Mixed effect interactions represented a smaller proportion (vulnerabilities close to 2; Western: 13%; Adriatic: 4%; Ionian: 25% and Eastern: 13%) (S 14).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we tested for correlation between the PP anomaly, resulting from the Ecosim fitting procedure, and the PP from the biogeochemical model, in all the areas these were positively and significantly correlated. Only the Adriatic Sea showed a significant negative correlation (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t4" href="#t4">Table 4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Figure S7</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the “best” fitted models, Ecosim reproduced satisfactorily the biomasses trends for some of the functional groups with available survey data in all sub-areas (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">4</a>). Overall, forage fishes (functional groups n. 8–9), demersal fishes (n. 12–14) and invertebrates (n. 18–19 and 21) showed a good fit in the different sub-models, while deep sea fish (n. 15) and benthos (n. 23) were the least well fitted (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S7</a>). These latter groups are the ones with the fewest data points. A satisfactory fit was also shown for sharks and rays/skates groups (n. 16–17), and, despite only few observed records, also for pinnipeds (n. 3) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S8</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Western Mediterranean, based on the biomass trends by area, the predicted time series suggested a decreasing pattern for the biomasses of several functional groups (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S8</a>). European pilchard (n.8) showed a decline from the beginning of our study period (1950), which became more pronounced in the last years of the observed time series. A similar result was also observed for medium (n. 13) and small (n. 14) demersal fishes, and pinnipeds (n. 3), although the model was not able to capture the sharp decline of these marine mammals in the 1970 s. As for sharks (n. 16), rays/skates (n. 17) the model confirmed a decrease in trends until the end of the 1990 s and a slight increase in the 2000 s decade. For European anchovy (n. 9) and hake (n. 12), Ecosim had difficulties reflecting observed variations in their biomass, although suggesting a decreasing trend for both species. A poor fit was observed for benthos (n. 23) and deep sea fish (n. 15), where only few data points were available. A good reproduction of biomass time series was found for crustaceans (n. 21) and benthopelagic cephalopods (n. 18) where the model was able to follow the majority of the fluctuations in time (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S8</a>). When the model was run using the PP from the biogeochemical model as an alternative primary productivity driver, we observed similar pattern (red dashed line in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">4</a>) as the ones obtained using the PP Ecosim anomaly, and for certain species/functional groups (n. 8 and n. 21 in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>) the fit improved.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As for the Western Mediterranean, also in the Adriatic Sea, Ecosim suggested a decline for some top predators, demersal and pelagic fish and for some invertebrates (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S8</a>). In particular, the model was able to capture the steep decline of pinnipeds (n. 3) observed in the area since mid-1970s
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" href="#b54">54</a> and a less marked decrease of medium (n. 13) and small (n. 14) demersal fish observed in mid 1990s
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" href="#b55">55</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" href="#b56">56</a>. Ecosim captured some of the pattern observed for European hake (n. 12), sharks (n. 16), rays/skates (n. 17) suggesting a decline of the groups until the end of the 1990 s, followed by a slight increase or by fluctuations (in the case of European hake) in the last years of the studied period. An overall satisfactory match between predicted and available data was found for benthopelagic cephalopods (n. 18) where a decrease was captured since the beginning of the survey period, and for benthic cephalopods (n. 19) and crustacean (n. 21) where the model followed some of the fluctuation of the groups and a slight increase at the end of 2000 s. Again, the model did not represent the trends well for deep sea fish (n. 15; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Figure S8</a>). Regarding forage fish (n. 8–9), when we run the model using PP anomaly as driver, Ecosim was not able to reflect the decreasing biomass trend observed in European anchovies, while it was able to pick up a general decline for European pilchards. However, it was when we applied the PP from the biogeochemical model in the model run that Ecosim was able to follow the steep decline observed in European anchovies in mid 1970 s and improve also slightly the decline of European pilchard. For the other species/functional groups, different trends were observed using the two different PPs particularly in the decades before the beginning of our time series of observations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S8</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Ionian Sea resulted to be the area with less biomass changes during the years with available survey data (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Figs 4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S8</a>). Except for pinnipeds (n. 3), where the model was able to pick up the decline since the late 1970, despite the presence of only few data points, all the other groups didn’t show any directional variation in time resulting mainly in a series of fluctuations. However, by looking at the overall time period (1950–2011), the model suggested a small increase in biomass since the beginning of 1990 s for small demersal fish and crustaceans. The model partly underestimated and was not able to capture the biomass trends for European pilchards and medium demersals (respectively n. 8 and n. 13; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Figs 4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S8</a>), and it did not represent well the trend for benthos (n. 23; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Figure S8</a>). The use of PP from the biogeochemical model improved slightly the fit for crustaceans (n. 21), sharks (n. 16) and benthopelagic cephalopods (n. 18) while maintaining the same pattern observed with the PP anomaly.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Eastern Mediterranean, different trends among species/functional groups were detected (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Figs 4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S8</a>). Ecosim represented relatively well the biomass declines of European pilchards (n. 8) and anchovies (n. 9) since the 1990 s, despite underestimating the high peaks observed at the beginning of this decade. The model was able to capture the biomass trends for European hake (n. 12), small demersals (n. 14), sharks (n. 16), rays/skates (n. 17), benthic cephalopods (n. 19) and crustaceans (n. 21). All these groups showed similar patterns with signs of decrease in the 1990 s and fluctuations afterwards. An underestimation of biomass by the model was predicted for medium demersal fish (n. 13), deep sea fish (n. 15), benthopelagic cephalopods (n. 18), and benthos (n. 23) where the model was not able to reproduce observed trends and fluctuations (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Figure S8</a>). A good fit, even though for only few data points, was found for pinnipeds (n. 3) where the model was able to represent the fluctuation of these marine mammals over time (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>). The predicted trends obtained using PP from the biogeochemical model were similar to the ones found using the PP anomaly and for European hake (n. 12), small demersals (n. 14), sharks (n. 16), benthic cephalopods (n. 19) and crustaceans (n. 21) the fit slightly improved. Ecosim was able to represent the decrease in biomass of large pelagic fish (n. 6) particularly since the 80 s, while it failed to capture the fluctuation observed at the end of the 2000 s in the whole Mediterranean model for the two highly migratory species for which we had survey data: large pelagics and sea turtles. In the case of the sea turtles (n. 5), the model approximated the general increasing biomass trend, but it failed to reproduce its fluctuations over time (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a>). We observed similar results with the PP from the biogeochemical model as a driver.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time series of catch trends estimated for the five areas, when compared with independent data, showed a general satisfactory match (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Figs 6</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S9</a>): the sub-models overestimated or underestimated some fractions of the time series trends, but overall, they were able to capture long-term trends similar to those observed (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6</a>). In the Western Mediterranean, an increase (up to the end of the 1990 s) and posterior decrease in catches were predicted for the majority of the groups with the exception of other small pelagic fish (n. 10), large demersal (n. 11), and benthic cephalopods (n. 19) that continued to increase even afterwards. Non-significant trend was simulated for rays/skates (n. 17), while the model was not able to reflect the trend observed for benthopelagic cephalopods (n. 18). Regarding large pelagic fishes (n. 6), catches predicted for the whole Mediterranean were similar to those observed until the 1980 s, but the predicted catches did not reflect the increase observed in the last two decades (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Adriatic, as for the Western Mediterranean, the model simulated the decrease in catches observed in the beginning of the 1990 s for the majority of the functional groups while it did not succeed to pick up the sharp decline of European anchovies (n. 9) in mid 1970 s, and of European hake (n. 12) and sharks (n. 16) in the 1990 s (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Ionian Sea, the model predicted the increase in catches until the end of 2000 s for the majority of the functional groups. For European hake (n. 12), medium demersals (n. 13), sharks (n. 16), rays/skates (n. 17) and benthic cephalopods (n. 19), though, such increase turned into a decrease approximately around the 1990 s (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Figure S9</a>). In the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, predicted results indicated the increase in catches for the majority of the functional groups until the 1990 s and the decline afterwards and they also captured the continuous increase for other small pelagic fishes (n. 10) and benthopelagic cephalopods (n. 18). On the other hand, simulated results did not match the sharp decline of sharks (n. 16) observed since the 1980 s in the region (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Figure S9</a>).
