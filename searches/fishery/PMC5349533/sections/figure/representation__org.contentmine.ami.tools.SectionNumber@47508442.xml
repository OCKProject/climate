  <div class="title">Representation of modelling fitting results for large pelagics and sea turtles in the Mediterranean Sea as whole for the period 1950–2011.</div>
  <p>Predicted biomass (t·km
   <span class="sup">−2</span>) is shown as solid black lines, while observed data is represented as black dots. Functional groups codes correspond to those given in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>. The predicted model (dashed red line) using modelled biogeochemical PP is also shown. Blue shadow represents the 95% percentile and 5% percentile obtained through the Monte Carlo routine. Drawings for species/functional groups 1–3, 5–6 and 8 are by Massimo Demma -
