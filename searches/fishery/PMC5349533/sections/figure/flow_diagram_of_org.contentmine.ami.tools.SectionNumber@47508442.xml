  <p>Each functional group is shown as a circle and its size is proportional to the log of its biomass. The functional groups are represented by their trophic levels (y-axis) and linked by predator-prey relationships showed as light grey lines. Numbers refer to functional group codes, which are reported in the legend, while those in red are graphically represented with a drawing. Numbers in the figure: 1. Piscivorous cetaceans; 2. Other cetaceans; 3. Pinnipeds; 4. Seabirds; 5. Sea turtles; 6. Large pelagics; 7. Medium pelagics; 8. European pilchard; 9. European anchovy; 10. Other small pelagics; 11. Large demersals; 12. European hake; 13. Medium demersals; 14. Small demersals; 15. Deep sea fish; 16. Sharks; 17. Rays and skates; 18. Benthopelagic cephalopods; 19. Benthic cephalopods; 20. Bivalves and gastropods; 21. Crustaceans; 22. Jellyfish; 23. Benthos; 24. Zooplankton; 25. Phytoplankton; 26. Seagrass; 27. Detritus; 28. Discards. Drawings for species/functional groups 1–3, 5–6 and 8 are by Massimo Demma -
