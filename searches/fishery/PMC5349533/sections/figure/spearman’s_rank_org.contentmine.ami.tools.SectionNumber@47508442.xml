  <p>Positive correlations are displayed in blue and negative correlations in red color. Color intensity and the size of the eclipses are proportional to the correlation coefficients. At the right side of the graph, the legend color shows the correlation coefficients and the corresponding colors. The color follows a gradient according to the strength of the correlation. The width of the ellipses is related to correlation strengths with more diffused ellipses representing lower correlation strengths. When the indicators are non-significant (&gt;0.05) are represented with an X symbol.</p>
