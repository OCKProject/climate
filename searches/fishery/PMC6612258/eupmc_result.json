    "Exploring factors shaping genetic structure of marine fish is challenging due to fewer barriers to gene flow in the ocean. However, genome-wide sequence data can greatly enhance our ability to delineate previously unidentified population structure as well as potential adaptive divergence. The small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) is a commercially important fish species with high gene flow and its overwintering populations experience heterogeneous environment, suggesting possible population differentiation and adaptive divergence. To delineate patterns of population structure as well as test for signatures of local adaptation, a total of 68,666 quality filtered SNP markers were identified for 80 individuals from four overwintering populations by using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). Significant genetic differentiation among overwintering populations from the Central Yellow Sea, the South Yellow Sea and the North East China Sea were detected (Pair-wise F ST: 0.00036-0.00390), which were consistent with population division of overwintering groups inferred from traditional ecological approaches. In addition, a total of 126 unique SNPs were detected to be significantly associated with environmental parameters (temperature, salinity and turbidity). These candidate SNPs were involved in multiple pathways such as energy metabolism and phagocytosis, suggesting they may play key roles in growth and innate immunity. Our results suggested the existence of hitherto unrecognized cryptic population structure and local adaptation in this high gene flow marine fish and thus gain new insights into the design of management strategies."
