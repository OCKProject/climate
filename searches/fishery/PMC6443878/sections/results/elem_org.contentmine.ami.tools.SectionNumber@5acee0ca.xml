  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">GPP was projected to increase with climate change, more so with higher radiative forcing (RCP8.5), and more toward the end of the century (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a>). For the low emission scenario (RCP2.6) hardly any difference between the time periods can be seen in the simulated GPP values. Differences between the medium and the high emission scenario simulations (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are evident only from the mid-century onward (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Figure 2</a>). The estimated median increase in GPP was 34% for the mid-century time period (2041–2070), and 46% for the end of the century (2071–2100), over all radiative forcing levels (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Table 1</a>). Current observed mean annual growth in 15 forestry regions of Finland compared well (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.95) with PREBAS simulated results for the same period (2.0–7.6 m

   <span class="sup">-1</span> yr
   <span class="sup">-1</span>; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Figure 3</a>). In the climate change projections for mean annual forest growth, all scenarios give similar results for the first time period (2011–2040, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Figure 4</a>), whereas the differences become clear later, especially toward the end of the century. The highest increase in mean annual growth was projected for the north of Finland (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figure 3</a>). The simulated country-wide median forest growth increased from 5.6 m

   <span class="sup">-1</span> in 2071–2100 (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interpreted as an ES, a more negative value of NEE means that the ecosystems of the region have a potential to mitigate the radiative forcing by atmospheric CO
    <sub>2</sub>, which is the most important contributor of human induced climate change. Across Finland, the simulated median annual NEE was –50 gC m

    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Table 1</a>). Reported current national total annual C sink of forest biomass and soil varied in the range –35 to –18 Mt CO

    <a rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90">Official Statistics of Finland, 2019</a>). Averaged over total forestry land (262,000 km
    <span class="sup">2</span>), the reported range corresponds to annual removals of –36 to –19 gC m
    <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
    <span class="sup">-1</span>. Our simulated reference period annual C sink thus clearly exceeds the range of reported current values (

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulations with the low emission scenario (RCP2.6), which include only PREBAS results, represent clearly larger C sink values (more negative NEE) than simulations with the other scenarios, for all time periods. The high emission scenario (RCP8.5) shows the largest range in simulated NEE results (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a>). In projections across Finland from both ecosystem models and all climate scenarios, the median removal of CO
    <sub>2</sub> increased with 48 and 39% by mid-century and the end of the century, respectively. The corresponding simulated median values were NEE –74.1 and –66 gC m

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Warming temperatures, changing precipitation patterns (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>) and increasing forest growth (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a>, 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>) altered the water availability in the JSBACH simulations. The risk for drought was slightly increasing for all scenarios. Much of the change is due to earlier snow melt and thus possibility for earlier drought events. Decreasing precipitation was projected for some climate models in winter for all time periods, and also in summer for the end of the century (
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). The mean number of dry summer days was approximated to around 4 days for the reference period. By the end of the century (2071–2100), the mean simulated number of dry summer days increased to about 15 days in the south and to 10 days in the north (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Table 2</a>). In southern Finland, simulations for the mid-century gave even higher number of dry days (23). In the JSBACH simulations, the number of soil frost days was decreasing in all simulations (
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Table 2</a>). The changes were largest in southern Finland under the high forcing scenario (RCP8.5), from 134 days in 1981–2010 to 25 days in 2071–2100. This means the opportunities for winter harvest on drained peatlands are decreasing with all scenarios, more in the south than in the north.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimates of the start dates of the vegetation active period on the basis of webcam images were similar to those simulated by the JSBACH model (see section “Webcam Network” in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Material</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Figure 6</a>). The vegetation active period ended slightly later according to the JSBACH results than based on the webcam images. VAPstart in Finland occurred in median on 28 April in all simulations for the present period (1980–2010) (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Table 1</a>). In comparison, for the period 2001–2017, VAPstart in Finland was determined from satellite observations (
   <a rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" href="#B122">SYKE, 2018</a>). The satellite-derived median VAPstart occurred on 13 April in evergreen coniferous forest. JSBACH simulations included all PFTs whereas PREBAS simulations included forested areas only. Thus, the simulated present day VAPstart seems to be slightly ahead of satellite observations with a median VAPstart on 5 May for all forest types (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4</a>). In comparison to reference conditions, the vegetation active period started (VAPstart) about 2 weeks earlier in the mid-century, and 3 weeks earlier toward the end of the century. This means spring would start earlier in April than at present. The vegetation active period ended (VAPend) by the end of the century in early October, compared to late September in the reference conditions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Supplementary Table 1</a>). In the climate change simulations, the length of the vegetation active period (VAPlength) increased from 162 days with about 20 days in the mid-century and with 30 days by the end of the century (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2</a> and
