 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our analysis, climate change impacts on key boreal forest ES are both beneficial and detrimental. Increased GPP is beneficial, leading to increased C sequestration, as well as increased forest growth and improved supply of harvestable wood. Warmer temperatures lead, however, also to higher ecosystem respiration, which in some instances cause increasing fluxes of CO
  <sub>2</sub> from vegetation to atmosphere (NEE &gt; 0). Although GPP is steadily increasing in our simulations, there are times in early and late 21st century when GPP is smaller than ecosystem respiration and annual NEE becomes positive. Here, the assumptions concerning future conditions included only different climate change scenarios, not considering any adaptation measures, e.g., regarding changing forestry practices. Thus, future forest growth simulations with PREBAS reflect a continuing business as usual response of the forestry sector. This means the current forestry practices are assumed to continue, and possible shifts toward higher harvest rates to accommodate increased demand for bioenergy have not been considered here. Possible increased risk of forest damage was also not accounted for, although increasing probabilities of more frequent insect outbreaks and wind throw damages have been recognized. There is still a large uncertainty in predicting future forest growth, since the models disregard natural disturbances, and are not constrained by potential nutrient limitations (N, P and base cations). These limitations call for further model developments as well as biomass and flux data to inform process based modeling. Our current simulation results likely represent the high end of the future growth estimates. We also noted the need to consider a balanced approach between forest harvesting, C sequestration potential and nature based ecosystem services in forested ecosystems.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While some of the studied ES are expected to improve with climate change (biomass growth, nature tourism), the projected decrease in number of soil frost days is expected to decrease the opportunities for winter harvest in forestry especially in the south. Future levels of net ecosystem exchange of CO
  <sub>2</sub> are uncertain; some simulations indicate decreasing radiative forcing levels, while other simulations lead to increasing levels. Forests remain C sinks, however, in all simulations. The risk for summer drought is slightly increasing in the whole country. Climate warming is expected to lead to earlier opportunities for spring-time nature tourism, and may improve opportunities for autumn mushroom and berry picking. The opportunities for winter sports are decreasing while hiking opportunities are increasing with earlier occurrences of spring.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate the range of uncertainty in future provision of boreal forest ES. The estimates described in this paper may provide input to comprehensive systems for integrated natural capital accounting, as well as sharing such information via hubs such as National Clearing House Mechanism for the Convention on Biological Diversity (
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Finnish Ecosystem Service Indicators, 2015</a>). Furthermore, the examples in this paper may highlight the potential for advancing ES monitoring, such as improving information on ecosystem variables for instance by high-resolution Earth Observation or novel
