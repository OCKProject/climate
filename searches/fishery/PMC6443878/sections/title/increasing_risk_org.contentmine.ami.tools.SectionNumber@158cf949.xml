 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In boreal and northern conditions, dry and warm summers have been found to increase drought-related symptoms in trees, such as defoliation or discoloration (
  <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">Muukkonen et al., 2015</a>), limit tree radial growth (
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">Aakala and Kuuluvainen, 2010</a>) and contribute to severe disturbances (
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">Aakala et al., 2011</a>). Satellite-derived estimates of vegetation growth trends indicate a clear negative response to recent dry summer conditions (
  <a rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96">Piao et al., 2011</a>). Shorter periods of frozen soil increase wind damages to forest, as the trees are less firmly anchored in non-frozen soil. Wind-thrown trees may also serve as starting points for bark beetle outbreaks (
  <a rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" href="#B102">Pukkala, 2018</a>). In boreal forests, timber is mainly harvested with heavy machinery, which can operate only if the soil has a sufficient bearing capacity (
  <a rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" href="#B120">Suvinen, 2006</a>). Higher and more variable air temperatures in winter, coupled with longer and more frequent rain events, may cause pronounced edge effects by skidding trails (
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">Montoro Girona et al., 2016</a>), or lead to periods during which the sites on drained peatlands are not accessible (
