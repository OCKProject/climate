 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the regulation and maintenance section of the CICES classification, the key service studied was related to regulating climate through C sequestered by growing vegetation. The corresponding benefit to society was avoided CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The proxy for CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing, NEE (gC m
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>), is the difference between the total respiration rate of the ecosystem, and GPP. When the flux is from the atmosphere to the ecosystem, NEE is negative, and when the flux is from the ecosystem to the atmosphere, NEE is positive. In 2017, the Finnish total greenhouse gas emissions were 55.5 million metric tons CO
  <sub>2</sub> eq, including energy, industrial, agriculture, and waste sectors. In contrast, the net removal from the atmosphere by forest land was 27.0 million metric tons CO2 eq. Altogether, the net sink of the land use, land use change, and forestry sector (LULUCF) was 20.4 million metric tons CO
  <sub>2</sub> eq (
  <a rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90">Official Statistics of Finland, 2019</a>). Climate change impacts on future values of NEE were simulated by JSBACH and PREBAS.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Risk of productivity losses related to summer drought, and decreasing opportunities for winter harvest on drained peatlands were considered as examples of regulating services. JSBACH simulations of the number of dry summer days, and soil frost days, were used for the climate impact projections. We used the length and the timing of the vegetation active period as proxies for both a regulating service (the maintenance of habitats), and a cultural service (recreational opportunities). The impact of climate change on the length (VAPlength, number of days) and timing of the vegetation active period (VAPstart, VAPend, day of year) was simulated with JSBACH and PREBAS.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current potential ES provision was estimated as the median values of the simulated biophysical variables for the reference period (1981â€“2010). The impact of climate change on ES provision was interpreted as future changes in simulated biophysical variables compared to reference period median values. Positive changes in GPP, stemwood growth and number of soil frost days are in our analysis associated with benefits for human society. Positive values of NEE represent a flux from the ecosystem to the atmosphere (CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions), while negative values of NEE (CO
  <sub>2</sub> removals) represent avoided CO
  <sub>2</sub> forcing. Thus, in our analysis, positive changes in the simulated values of NEE are considered losses, and negative changes benefits to human society. Increasing frequencies of dry summer days are similarly considered losses. An increase in the length of the vegetation active period, however, may lead to both benefits and losses.
