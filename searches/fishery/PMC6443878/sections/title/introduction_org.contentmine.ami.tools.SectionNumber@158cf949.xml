 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecosystem services (ES) are defined as the contributions that ecosystems make to human wellbeing (e.g., 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">Costanza et al., 1997</a>; 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">Daily and Matson, 2008</a>). The ES concept has become widely used and serves to emphasize the dependency of human society’s welfare on natural ecosystems (
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">MEA, 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">Costanza et al., 2017</a>). A wide variety of ES are found in forests, which cover about 30% of global terrestrial area (
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">FAO, 2018</a>). Forests provide timber, and food, they conserve biodiversity, regulate water resources, and provide recreational opportunities (
  <a rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116">Shvidenko et al., 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" href="#B111">Saastamoinen et al., 2014</a>). Forests are essential factors of the global carbon (C) cycle, with an important role in regulating atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>) (
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">Kurz et al., 2013</a>). Boreal forests represent 29% of global forests (
  <a rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116">Shvidenko et al., 2005</a>), comprising the circumpolar vegetation zone of high northern latitudes that covers one of the world’s largest biogeoclimatic areas (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">Brandt et al., 2013</a>). The ES provided by boreal forests thus benefit human society both locally and on the global scale (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Gauthier et al., 2015</a>). Boreal forests account for about 20% of the global C sinks (
  <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">Pan et al., 2011</a>). Thereby boreal forests provide a climate regulating ES with bearing on climate change mitigation on the global level, although trade-offs are also recognized (
  <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">Luyssaert et al., 2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Estimates of recent trends in above-ground biomass C indicate an increase for boreal forests (
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">Liu et al., 2015</a>). The stand and landscape level characteristics of the boreal forests of North America, Fennoscandia and Russia vary between the regions because of historical and current regional differences in natural disturbances and management practices (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Gauthier et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Kuuluvainen and Gauthier, 2018</a>). Statistics from two neighboring boreal countries show increasing trends in roundwood increment in Finland (
  <a rid="B128" ref-type="bibr" href="#B128">Vaahtera et al., 2018</a>) and Sweden (
  <a rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" href="#B117">Skogsdata, 2018</a>). The future rate of C uptake by forests depends on how ambient temperature, land use and resource management practices evolve (
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Ahlström et al., 2012</a>; 
  <a rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115">Shao et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">Lappalainen et al., 2016</a>). Rapid climate warming projected for the boreal zone (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">IPCC, 2013</a>) has been observed in North America (
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">McKenney et al., 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" href="#B101">Price et al., 2013</a>), Fennoscandia (
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">Mikkonen et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">Hedwall and Brunet, 2016</a>), and Russia (
  <a rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112">Schaphoff et al., 2016</a>), which may have significant consequences for future boreal forest ES. Management practices may interact with climate change with consequences for forest biodiversity (
  <a rid="B126" ref-type="bibr" href="#B126">Tremblay et al., 2018</a>; 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">Cadieux et al., 2019</a>). 
  <a rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112">Schaphoff et al. (2016)</a> found that the impacts of climate change on Russia’s boreal forests are often superimposed by other environmental and societal changes, while 
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Kalliokoski et al. (2018)</a> estimated likely increases in future forest productivity in Finland, although with a high uncertainty. Climate change may affect the occurrence and extent of natural disturbances, such as insect outbreaks and fire (
  <a rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112">Schaphoff et al., 2016</a>), e.g., 
  <a rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87">Navarro et al. (2018)</a> report a northward shift of spruce budworm (
  <span class="italic">Choristoneura fumiferana</span>) during the 20th century. Earlier thermal growing season has been found to be associated with earlier onset of biospheric C uptake, whereas earlier termination of biospheric activity was associated to later termination of thermal growing season (
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">Barichivich et al., 2012</a>). Warmer springs have consequences for bird reproduction (
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">Ludwig et al., 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="B137" ref-type="bibr" href="#B137">Wegge and Rolstad, 2017</a>) and for moth multivoltinism, in combination with warmer summers (
  <a rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" href="#B100">Pöyry et al., 2011</a>). Less severe winter colds may promote the expansion of forest pests (
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Fält-Nardmann et al., 2018</a>). Warmer winters may also have impacts on the possibilities for winter harvest on drained peatlands (
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">Hökkä et al., 2016</a>) and for winter recreation (
  <a rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89">Neuvonen et al., 2015</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pathway from ecosystems, their biophysical structure, processes and functions to their benefit and value to human society, is illustrated by the ES cascade model, which portrays ES as emerging from the functional and structural properties of the ecosystem (
  <a rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98">Potschin and Haines-Young, 2011</a>). In the Common International Classification of ES (CICES), services are classified into provisioning, regulating and maintenance, and cultural services (
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Haines-Young and Potschin, 2018</a>). Several studies have discussed mapping of ES provision potential at different scales (
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">Burkhard et al., 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="B134" ref-type="bibr" href="#B134">Vihervaara et al., 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">Maes et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Albert et al., 2016a</a>). The European Commission seeks to improve the basis for implementing the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2020 (
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">European Commission, 2011</a>) by encouraging national ES assessments of the member states of EU through its flagship project MAES (
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">European Commission, 2018</a>). National accounting of natural capital needs information from national ES accounts and ongoing development of natural-capital accounts also supports national ES assessments (
  <a rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113">Schröter et al., 2016</a>). 
  <a rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" href="#B111">Saastamoinen et al. (2014)</a> applied the CICES hierarchy on the boreal forest ES in Finland, reporting their results in a conceptual and historical context. 
  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">Mononen et al. (2016)</a> developed a framework of ES indicators for Finland that complies with both national circumstances and international typologies such as the cascade model (
  <a rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98">Potschin and Haines-Young, 2011</a>) and the CICES framework (
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Haines-Young and Potschin, 2018</a>). ES are increasingly used to inform policies, and frameworks including ES analysis for decision support are becoming available (
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">Albert et al., 2016b</a>). Potentially highly promising avenues for underpinning resource allocation decisions are based on detailed place-based analyses of supply and demand of ES (e.g., 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">Kopperoinen et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="B133" ref-type="bibr" href="#B133">Vauhkonen and Ruotsalainen, 2017</a>). On the other hand, broad, unspecified ES may be more easily adopted by policy actors, according to

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our aim is to illustrate potential impacts of climate change on boreal forest ES. In this paper we (i) apply two dynamic ecosystem models (JSBACH and PREBAS) driven by a set of climate change scenarios to simulate present day and future values of a set of biophysical variables; (ii) compare simulated present day values with available observations and statistical data; (iii) suggest interpretations of the biophysical variables as ES; (iv) discuss the consequences of changes in these biophysical variables on future ES of boreal forests (
