 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding NEE, JSBACH and PREBAS models produced fairly different patterns especially under climate change – PREBAS predicted more negative NEE values than JSBACH (
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">MONIMET, 2017</a>; Peltoniemi et al., unpublished results). We assume that the differences are caused by different approaches to describing tree growth and management in these models, JSBACH assuming steady-state conditions and PREBAS accounting for forest growth and management explicitly. The harvests lead to a drain of stemwood from the forest which reduces the amount of C entering the soil as coarse woody debris, and therefore reduces the rate of heterotroph respiration from the soil. In our presentation, the NEE projections aggregate results from these models with different assumptions concerning vegetation and forest management, and the variance of the results reflect uncertainties in process descriptions and parameterizations. Forests remain a C sink in our simulation results.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been shown that future development of NEE varies much according to ecosystem model and applied climate forcing. According to 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Ahlström et al. (2012)</a>, simulations with a dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS), forced by 18 CMIP5 climate projections, showed net release by 2100 for the boreal region. However, the projections were not in full agreement with each other. The magnitude of the release varied, and even turned to uptake in some simulations. Further, according to an ensemble of CMIP5 models both uptake and release of C by land ecosystems is accelerated in the twenty-first century (
  <a rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115">Shao et al., 2013</a>). The boreal latitudes could become a major C sink by 2100 in many models. It should also be recognized that there is a trade-off situation between the ES supply of “harvestable wood” and “avoided radiative forcing.” According to calculations by the Finnish Climate Change Panel, meeting the Finnish targets for implementing the Paris climate change agreement would, in addition to stringent GHG emission reductions, also require a large increase in the C sinks (
