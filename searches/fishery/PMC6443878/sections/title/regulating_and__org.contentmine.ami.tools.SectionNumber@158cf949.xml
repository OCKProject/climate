 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For regulating ES, earlier start of vegetation active period means earlier opportunities for birds, insects and other species, but is also linked to the risk for coincident occurrences of cold spells that may be detrimental. For cultural ES, climate warming is expected to lead to earlier opportunities for nature tourism linked to the coming of spring, such as bird watching and observing shoot growth, bud bursting and flowering. However, potential detrimental long-term impacts of climate change on species diversity and conservation are also well recognized (e.g., 
  <a rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" href="#B124">Thomas et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="B136" ref-type="bibr" href="#B136">Virkkala et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">Heikkinen et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="B135" ref-type="bibr" href="#B135">Virkkala, 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">Cadieux et al., 2019</a>). For regulating ES, later end of vegetation activity may mean decreased leaching of N in autumn. For provisioning and cultural ES, later end of vegetation may be associated with improved opportunities for the growth and picking of mushrooms and berries, although the success of these species is mostly regulated by local weather conditions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of regulating ES, this means that there is a positive impact on the reproduction and survival of birds, insects and other species that are dependent on forest vegetation activity. There might be negative impacts due to mismatch of animal production and food supply, or better match between insects and host plants and resulting damages that could alter ecosystem composition (
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">Foster et al., 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103">Pureswaran et al., 2015</a>). The spruce bark beetle (
  <span class="italic">Ips typographus</span>), a serious pest in boreal forests may benefit from warmer temperatures (
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">Annila, 1969</a>) and earlier occurrence of spring (
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">Lange et al., 2006</a>; 
  <a rid="B140" ref-type="bibr" href="#B140">Zang et al., 2015</a>), increasing the risks for declining forest health (
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Blomqvist et al., 2018</a>). With the lengthening of the vegetation active period, there is also the option for spatial migration of plant and animals to more northern areas (e.g., 
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">Jeganathan et al., 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summertime nature tourism in the Nordic countries, e.g., for fishing, biking, hiking, kayaking, bird and animal watching, was perceived as interesting activities by respondents in an international survey (
  <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">MEK, 2010</a>). According to the Finnish national outdoor recreation inventory, almost 70% of annual nature visits were made during the 5 months from May to September, the most popular outdoor recreation activities being walking, swimming, spending time in nature and at a recreational home, picking wild berries, cycling, boating, fishing, cross-country skiing and mushroom picking (
  <a rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88">Neuvonen and Sievänen, 2011</a>). According to 
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">Lankia et al. (2015)</a>, the overall value of recreational nature visits was considerable in comparison to other land uses. It is likely that an increase in VAPlength would be beneficial to human society. It should, however, be noted that as the increase in VAPlength may be accompanied by increased probability of spring and autumn rains (
  <a rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110">Ruosteenoja et al., 2016</a>), the recreational value may not be realized. Here, we do not report simulated future changes in number of snow cover days in response to climate change. It is clear, however, that the occurrence of earlier start of spring and later beginning of autumn season are coupled to shorter winter periods, leading to losses as regards the opportunities for winter tourism. Cross-country skiing is an important recreational activity in Finland (
  <a rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88">Neuvonen and Sievänen, 2011</a>) and 
  <a rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89">Neuvonen et al. (2015)</a> presented an interactive tool to study the implications of climate change for cross-country skiing. A considerable proportion of recreational nature visits are made to nature conservation areas, and in the case these visits constitute an increased pressure on the nature conservation areas, the goals of conservation and recreation may be conflicting. It is more likely, however, that the goals of forestry and conservation are colliding. The recreational experience is not independent of the maintenance of habitats, and we are aware of the risk of double attribution in estimating quantitative values for these services, e.g., in monetary terms. It was, however, beyond the scope of our work to assess quantitative values for the services we have studied. In the case of the qualitative analysis carried out here, we think we are justified to use the vegetation active period characteristics to illustrate both the potential for habitat maintenance and recreation opportunities.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the near decades, even in mid-century, the three emission levels (RCP) gave broadly similar projected temperature increase and change in precipitation on the annual and country-wide level (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). Different climate models, however, gave varying responses especially for seasonal changes. Extreme warming (&gt;5°C) was projected by some climate models by the end of the century for the high emission scenario. 
  <a rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110">Ruosteenoja et al. (2016)</a> call the late century response to RCP8.5 “
  <span class="italic">an alarm signal, demonstrating the furious climatic changes that would be expected if the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions were totally neglected.</span>” Although spatially explicit data have been used to drive the ecosystem models, the results we report here are mainly estimates aggregated over the whole country. We realize that important detailed information is lost in such an aggregation, especially concerning tradeoffs between ES, and the spatial distribution and balance of ES supply and demand (
  <a rid="B99" ref-type="bibr" href="#B99">Potschin and Haines-Young, 2013</a>; 
  <a rid="B133" ref-type="bibr" href="#B133">Vauhkonen and Ruotsalainen, 2017</a>). The value of boreal forest future ES has also not been addressed in this paper. We have qualitatively described future ES on the basis of simulated biophysical quantities such as forest growth and CO
  <sub>2</sub> exchange with the atmosphere. Analyzing current and future valuation of ES by forest owners and other stakeholders would be needed in order to introduce boreal forest ES into a natural capital framework (
  <a rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" href="#B113">Schröter et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">Lai et al., 2018</a>), or to assess forest carbon policies (
  <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">Pohjola et al., 2018</a>). Such considerations are, however, beyond the scope of our work.
