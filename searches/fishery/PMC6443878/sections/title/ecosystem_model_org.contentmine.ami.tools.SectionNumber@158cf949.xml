  <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">2019</a>) for the land area of mainland Finland, using input data in spatial resolution ranging from 16 m (forest resources, PREBAS), 0.1° (land surface characteristics, JSBACH) to a 0.2° × 0.1° longitude-latitude grid (climate data). We report simulated results for a set of biophysical variables for four time periods (1981–2010, 2011–2040, 2041–2070, 2071–2100). Two variables reflect directly ecosystem C fluxes: gross primary productivity (GPP; gCm
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE; gCm
  <span class="sup">-2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>). Ecosystem phenology is described by three variables: the length of vegetation active period (VAPlength; days), when terrestrial vegetation is assimilating C through photosynthesis, the start (end) of vegetation active period (VAPstart; VAPend; days from January 1st, when the daily level of photosynthesis first exceeds, or returns to below 15% of its summertime value). Stemwood growth (m
  <span class="sup">3</span> yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) was simulated with PREBAS, and the number of summer dry days (soil moisture &lt; 5th percentile of reference period) and number of winter days with soil frost were simulated with JSBACH. The models have been compared earlier and found to produce similar GPP estimates at local and national level (
  <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">Peltoniemi et al., 2015a</a>). Here we use the two models in parallel to provide further information about the changes in biophysical variables under climate change, and also in supplementing each other for variables predicted by only one of the models. We present the results as boxplots and tabulated percentile values, and cumulative distribution functions aggregated over the whole area, as well as time series and maps for some variables.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">JSBACH is a land surface model of an earth system model of Max Planck institute for meteorology (MPI-MET) and describes the biogeophysical processes that regulate the balances of water and CO
  <sub>2</sub>. The storage of water and C into the ecosystem as well as their release to the atmosphere is regulated by the climatic variables. Land vegetation is divided into plant functional types (PFT), and for our domain (the Finnish mainland) we based the PFT distribution on Finnish CORINE land cover data (
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">CLC, 2012</a>), which contains information about soil type, thus providing soil characteristics consistent with the vegetation cover data. Seasonal development of leaf area index is regulated by air temperature and soil moisture with PFT specific maximum leaf area index as a limiting value. For the generation of the seasonal cycle, PFTs are divided in summergreen, evergreen, grass and crop phenology types (
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Böttcher et al., 2016</a>). Photosynthesis is described according to 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Farquhar et al. (1980)</a>, using PFT-specific parameters for the maximum carboxylation (
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>max</sub>) and electron transport (
  <span class="italic">J</span>
  <sub>max</sub>) rates. Global parameter values were used in this study, and as JSBACH was run without explicit nitrogen cycle, the mean values at 25°C (
  <span class="italic">V</span>
  <sub>max</sub>
  <span class="italic">25</span>) were applied, with

  <a rid="B139" ref-type="bibr" href="#B139">Wullschleger, 1993</a>; 
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">Kattge et al., 2009</a>). The photosynthetic rate is resolved first under non-water-stressed conditions to attain photosynthetic activity (
  <a rid="B141" ref-type="bibr" href="#B141">Schulze et al., 1994</a>), and limitations in water availability are accounted for 
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">Knorr and Heimann (1995)</a> and 
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">Knorr (2000)</a>. The radiation absorption within the vegetation canopy is calculated for three layers (
  <a rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" href="#B114">Sellers, 1985</a>), accounting for clumping of the leaves in sparse canopies (
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">Knorr, 2000</a>). In addition to the canopy processes the model consists of a 5-layer soil moisture description (
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Hagemann and Stacke, 2015</a>) and the Yasso soil C module (
  <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">Goll et al., 2015</a>). We adopted a formulation that delays the beginning of photosynthetic activity of evergreen species in spring (
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">Kolari et al., 2007</a>), as according to 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Böttcher et al. (2016)</a> the start date of the photosynthetically active season of coniferous evergreens in the model is ahead of the observed. We decreased the threshold of the temperature sum regulating the bud-break from 4 to 2°C in accordance to findings by 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">Böttcher et al. (2016)</a>. Furthermore, a condition that reduces stomatal conductance under supersaturation was removed because it falsely prohibits photosynthesis under conditions of very high humidity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, simulations were performed with PREBAS, a C-balance based stand growth and gas exchange model (
  <a rid="B129" ref-type="bibr" href="#B129">Valentine and Mäkelä, 2005</a>; 
  <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">Peltoniemi et al., 2015b</a>; 
  <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">Minunno et al., 2019</a>). In PREBAS, photosynthesis (GPP) and evapotranspiration are calculated using a light-use-efficiency approach linked to soil moisture and driven by daily environmental inputs of radiation, temperature, vapor pressure deficit, precipitation and ambient CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration (
  <a rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95">Peltoniemi et al., 2015b</a>; 
  <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">Minunno et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Kalliokoski et al., 2018</a>). GPP is allocated to mean-tree growth and respiration at an annual time step, and allocation of growth to different tree components is based on conservation of structural constraints, e.g., the pipe model (
  <a rid="B129" ref-type="bibr" href="#B129">Valentine and Mäkelä, 2005</a>). Tree mortality due to crowding is included in the model. The growth module updates canopy leaf area index which is used as input to the gas exchange module in the following year. To calculate NEE, PREBAS has been linked with the soil C model YASSO07 through annual litter inputs (
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">Liski and Westman, 1995</a>; 
  <a rid="B127" ref-type="bibr" href="#B127">Tuomi et al., 2009</a>). In addition to weather data, PREBAS requires information on the initial state of the simulated forest, and forest management actions, including thinning, clearcut and regeneration, to obtain a realistic dynamic pattern of forest development. The relatively simple structure of the model allows us to apply it at a large regional scale and make simulations of C and water fluxes that are both climate and management sensitive. Here, we defined forest management on the basis of current management recommendations in Finland (
  <a rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" href="#B121">Sved and Koistinen, 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">Minunno et al., 2019</a>). The simulations were carried out by linking PREBAS to information on soil fertility, stand basal area, mean height and mean diameter, derived from 16 m resolution multisource forest inventory data maps (
  <a rid="B125" ref-type="bibr" href="#B125">Tomppo et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">Mäkisara et al., 2016</a>; 
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">LUKE, 2018a</a>,
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">b</a>). The forest resource maps were divided into 16 km grid cells. Within each grid cell, simulations were carried out for 50 forest classes with the highest proportional areas, accounting also for the remaining classes by distributing their area to these dominant classes. The forest classes represented different combinations of dominant tree species, age, basal area and mean height. Categories of soil fertility were herb-rich heath, mesic heath, sub-xeric heath, xeric heath, and poorer types (
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">Cajander, 1949</a>). To account for mineral and peat soil types, we used two sets of soil parameters, one describing typical mineral soil, and one for a soil layer with high soil water retention capacity (depth = 430 and 1000 mm, respectively), as PREBAS does not simulate organic soils as such. The simulated annual values for each class were aggregated to grid cell level based on 16 m resolution forest maps. Climate data from the nearest climate grid point were used for each 16 km forest simulation grid cell.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compared the simulated annual NEE for the period 1981–2010 with reported values of the C sink of Finnish forests (
  <a rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90">Official Statistics of Finland, 2019</a>). The simulated stemwood growth values for the period 2009–2012 were compared to observed forest growth for the same period. The simulated VAPstart days were compared to estimates based on webcam images (
