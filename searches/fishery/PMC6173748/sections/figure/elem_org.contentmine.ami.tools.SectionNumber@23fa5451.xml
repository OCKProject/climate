  <p>Main stressors interacting synergistically within the Adriatic Sea, which exemplify the axes in an SOS. Fine-scale spatial distribution for three major environmental stressors impacting the Adriatic Sea: industrial fishing pressure and nitrate and phosphate concentration (mean value for the 1999–2016 period). Despite the decreasing trend in nitrate concentrations observed for this area (see Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>), the Northern Italian coast still shows relatively high nitrate and phosphate concentrations. This area is also heavily impacted by commercial fisheries. Together, these stressors are likely to synergistically reduce ecosystem resilience to climate change.
