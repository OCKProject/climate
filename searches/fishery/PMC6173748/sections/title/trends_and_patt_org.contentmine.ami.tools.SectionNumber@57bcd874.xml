 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our spatially-explicit assessments on the cumulative impact of climate change (SST, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub> and pH), land-based pollution (nitrate and phosphate concentration, NPP and dO
  <sub>2</sub>) and commercial fisheries, reveal spatial overlap of these multiple stressors in coastal and shelf areas across the whole Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The most impacted marine zones occur through coastal and shelf areas from the Balearic, Tyrrhenian, Adriatic and Aegean Seas in the North; and the Central and Eastern African coast in the South. These general trends and patterns are consistent when considering climate and human impacts separately (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>).

    <p>Spatial congruence of climate and human impacts: a SOS for the Mediterranean Sea. Three dimensions of the safe operating space (SOS) for the Mediterranean Sea (
     <span class="bold">a</span>) (image courtesy of Javier Díaz), reflecting the intensity of (
     <span class="bold">b</span>) climate change-induced ocean warming (sea surface temperature, CO
     <sub>2</sub> partial pressure and pH), (
     <span class="bold">c</span>) changes in ocean biochemistry likely caused by changes in land-use (nutrient concentrations, net primary production and dissolved oxygen concentrations), and (
     <span class="bold">d</span>) fishing impacts. All these stressors are combined in (
     <span class="bold">e</span>) to provide an overview of the spatial heterogeneity in the magnitude of environmental changes and highlight those marine areas that have undergone the largest recent changes in environmental conditions. Maintaining these systems in a desirable state of conservation and sustainable use (by retaining them within the safe operating space) as climate change progresses requires management of interacting human stressors to bring them down from excessive levels (indicated by the lower arcs in dashed, blue lines in -a-) to acceptable ones (upper arcs).

  <span class="italic">p</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub> and pH, are unevenly distributed within the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>), and broadly concur with the more general and global trends towards increasing water temperatures, CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations, and seawater acidification

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. However, there is much spatial heterogeneity in the magnitude of these changes. Increasing trends in SST are particularly acute in the Eastern Mediterranean (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1a,b</a>), whereas the sharpest changes in ocean pH and 
  <span class="italic">p</span>CO2 have occurred in the Western and Central Mediterranean, particularly along the Central and Eastern African coasts and within the Adriatic Sea (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1d–i</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate that coastal and shelf areas of the Mediterranean Sea are most impacted by pollution, eutrophication or anoxia events. These highly impacted areas mainly occur in the Adriatic and the Aegean Seas, but also along the Central and Eastern African coasts (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>), where runaway population growth is creating unprecedented anthropic pressure on marine ecosystems

  </span>.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, our fine-scale analysis of fishing pressure revealed that fishing effort is particularly acute over the continental shelfs and in the North-Western and Central Mediterranean, where most overexploited commercial species occur

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. This includes regions within the Alboran and the Balearic Seas, but also within the Ligurian, Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas (Fig.
