 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is now overwhelming evidence for human-induced climate change on a scale that may result in increasing extinction rates or ecosystem collapses
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Given this scenario, it has been proposed that ecosystem resilience to climate change should be improved through local pro-active management
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Indeed, critical climate levels for ecosystem collapse may be influenced by conditions that can be managed locally
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Thus, reducing local stressors may keep ecosystems within a “safe operating space” (SOS, sensu
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>), where they remain resilient to climate change
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. The practicality and scale of such local measures makes them more feasible than global greenhouse gas management

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is virtually no part of the global environment that we have left “unchanged”. However, the oceans are of particular concern since they are among the most complex, difficult to study, poorly understood and most impacted of Earth’s biomes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Among the suite of human stressors impacting marine ecosystems, the most alarming threats are ocean pollution and overfishing
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>, and their effects appear to increase the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate impacts such as ocean warming and acidification
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Accordingly, climate and human stressors should not be treated in isolation from each other when developing conservation and management strategies for marine ecosystems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatially-explicit assessments on the distribution of climate and human impacts are vital for identifying marine areas of particular concern that are simultaneously impacted by different stressors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. This may represent a major challenge for marine conservation today, given the scarcity of data with the necessary spatiotemporal resolution. Fortunately, satellite remote-sensing data now provide a means for studying the most recent and striking trends and patterns in physical (e.g., sea surface temperature, SST), chemical (e.g., N, P and O
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations) and biological (e.g., marine productivity) variables in the world’s oceans at unprecedented spatio-temporal resolutions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>. Recent advances in modelling techniques based on Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) track data for fishing vessels are also providing more reliable information on the spatial distribution of fishing effort
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Together, these data provide a uniquely detailed insight into the spatio-temporal distribution of climate and additional human stressors threatening marine communities.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, by combining information on the spatial distribution of these multiple stressors, we aimed to identify highly impacted marine areas for the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), where the relatively “easy-to-handle” local and medium-scale stressors require management within a SOS framework to enhance resilience to climate change. In particular, we combined long-term remote-sensing data with data on the spatial distribution of fishing pressure to identify areas simultaneously impacted by climate impacts, diffuse sources of pollution and industrial fisheries. Spatially explicit information on the impact of climate change was derived by combining long-term data of SST (1982–2016) with ocean pH and CO
  <sub>2</sub> partial pressure (
  <span class="italic">p</span>CO
  <sub>2</sub>, 1999–2016). Changes in ocean biochemistry, likely driven by land-based pollution sources, were mapped by developing a spatially-explicit index that combined long-term (1999–2016) information on nutrient (phosphate and nitrate) concentrations, net primary production (NPP) and dissolved oxygen concentrations (dO
  <sub>2</sub>). Finally, available time series (2012–2017) of data on the spatial distribution of fishing pressure
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span> were used as a proxy for local impacts of human fisheries on marine ecosystems. We follow up this spatial analysis by exemplifying the potential value of our spatially-explicit assessments in the management of a thermophobic (i.e. heat intolerant) fish with high commercial value that is showing signs of collapse in the Mediterranean (European sardine, 
  <span class="italic">Sardina pilchardus</span>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>; and the conservation of the Adriatic Sea, a well-known highly impacted sub-region where pollution and overexploitation have been intense

    <p>The Mediterranean Sea: a “miniature ocean” and a “giant mesocosm”. The Mediterranean Sea (
     <span class="bold">a</span>) is the deepest enclosed sea on Earth. Located between Africa, Europe and Asia, it connects with the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean through the Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal. The Strait of Sicily divides the sea into two sub-basins with contrasting oceanographic conditions, the western (0.85 million km
     <span class="sup">2</span>) and the eastern (1.65 million km
     <span class="sup">2</span>). The Mediterranean Sea hosts a number of emblematic species and habitats, such as the seagrass meadows of 
     <span class="italic">Posidonia oceanica</span> (
     <span class="bold">b</span>, 
     <span class="bold">c</span>) (images courtesy of Javier Díaz). Because of its particular oceanographic, geological and biological conditions, this “miniature ocean” is a giant mesocosm that can be used for horizon-scanning assessments on how the Earth’s oceans are responding to multiple stressors
