 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coral reefs are severely threatened by a suite of human‐induced stressors at local and global scales. Ecosystem‐based management combined with resilience thinking can be used to better effect than approaches which do not take into account the multi‐use, complex social‐ecological nature of coral reef systems. Improving MPA design to enable coral reef organisms to adapt, acclimate or disperse under climate change is necessary but not sufficient: a range of other conservation tools will need to be employed including management of external stressors, alternative fisheries restrictions, novel approaches such as active restoration, inclusion of social–ecological factors and action on multiple scales. Figure 
  <a rid="ece34146-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34146-fig-0001">1</a> summarises various management strategies aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change and local human activities, facilitating positive responses to them via acclimation, adaptation or dispersal, and sustaining ecosystem services and functioning to maintain the resilience of social‐ecological systems.

However, integration of MPAs with other management strategies and participatory approaches provide the best chance of maximising coral reef resilience in the face of climate change, while ensuring equitable access to the valuable ecosystem services they provide.
