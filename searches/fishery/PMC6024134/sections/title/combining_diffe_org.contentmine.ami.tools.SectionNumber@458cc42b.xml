 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Combining different tiers of conservation management with spatial planning</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conservation management cannot focus solely on biodiversity measures or maintaining pristine reefs in remote locations. Six million fishers from nearly 100 countries rely on coral reefs for their livelihoods (Teh, Teh, &amp; Sumaila, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0159" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0159">2013</a>); therefore, management needs to support the resilience of both coral reefs and the communities that depend on them (Anthony et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0008">2015</a>; Cinner, Pratchett, et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0039">2016</a>). Climate change impacts on reef social‐ecological systems are bi‐directional: how climate change impacts on communities determines how they then interact with the environment. For example, if climate change and local human pressures reduce local fish populations, will fishers look further afield for more fish, or turn to alternative incomes (Cinner, Pratchett, et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0039">2016</a>)? Such impacts are poorly understood, so the resilience of social‐ecological systems to climate change cannot be predicted.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reducing dependency on fishing is imperative to protecting coral reefs, but highly challenging in societies with population growth, a lack of alternative income sources and poor governance (Burke et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0027">2011</a>; Newton, Côté, Pilling, Jennings, &amp; Dulvy, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0131" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0131">2007</a>). These factors cannot be managed by conservation practitioners; however, management strategies built upon access rights, particularly, customary tenure are gaining traction (Christie et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0033">2009</a>; Jupiter, Cohen, Weeks, Tawake, &amp; Govan, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0105">2014</a>). A key study of over 2,500 reefs globally showed that reefs doing better than predicted from their environmental and social context commonly had customary management schemes and marine tenure (Cinner, Huchery, et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0037">2016</a>). In contrast, reefs doing worse than predicted had technological commonalities such as intensive netting methods (Cinner, Huchery, et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0037">2016</a>). These findings suggest reef management may benefit from integrating customary and/or marine tenure arrangements, and gear restrictions rather than focusing solely on MPAs. These arrangements arise within indigenous communities or kinship groups and restrict certain behaviours, for example fishing at specific times or locations. Importantly, these restrictions may support key reef functions and processes, with positive implications for coral reef resilience (Aswani, Albert, Sabetian, &amp; Furusawa, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0013">2007</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further considerations often overlooked are large‐scale or “distal” human drivers of coral reef degradation, which influence local anthropogenic threats such as fishing and pollution (Hughes et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0098">2017</a>). These include international demand for certain species for food or the aquarium trade; increasing human migration (which may be exacerbated by climate change); foreign investments driving land use change; and changing fishing effort (Cinner, Graham, et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0035">2013</a>; Norström et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0132">2016</a>; Rhyne et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0143" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0143">2012</a>; Sale et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0150">2014</a>). Broader management strategies, especially marine spatial planning, need to be used to combat these external drivers. MSP incorporates MPAs and zoning, supports key ecosystem services, and separates conflicting uses of marine resources, for example by dividing coastal waters for different activities (e.g., conservation, food security and livelihoods) and integrating local and regional targets (Agardy et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0003">2011</a>; Sale et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0150">2014</a>). This approach compensates for many of the deficits of MPAs on their own, incorporating them into a broader system of management and preventing degradation of surrounding areas (Agardy et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0003">2011</a>). It should also reduce conflicts, maintain ecosystem services, and can facilitate rights‐based governance (Sale et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0150">2014</a>). For instance, models for a national spatial plan for Belize which quantified ecosystem services led to a 25% increase in coastal protection with increases in tourism and doubling of fishing revenue when contrasted with models only including stakeholder views (Arkema et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0012">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prioritisation of goals at national and regional scales, the inclusion of ecosystem services, and broad, coordinated conservation planning are essential to protecting coral reefs. Successful implementation of MSP will require adaptation to local need and governance, participation of communities and stakeholders, political motivation at national and international levels, and support from NGOs and international development partners. Internationally, regulation of markets and the aquarium trade could reduce demands on coral reefs by ensuring fish are caught through sustainable measures (Burke et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0027">2011</a>). For example, international screening for the effects of cyanide poisoning on live fish could promote sustainable fishing (Calado et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0028">2014</a>). From local, rights‐based management, through to regional and national marine planning and international laws and regulations on trade, coral reef conservation is a multi‐scale objective requiring support from a wide variety of stakeholders and organisations.
