 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Towards ecosystem‐based management of coral reefs</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conservation goals for coral reefs have traditionally focused on reversing declines and returning the ecosystem to “pristine” conditions (Rogers et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0148" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0148">2015</a>). However, many people rely on reefs for food and livelihoods and multi‐use of reefs requires careful consideration of the identification and understanding of trade‐offs among conflicting management and conservation objectives. This also requires a detailed understanding of the multiple stakeholders involved in direct use of and those involved in distal activities that could be impacting reefs, for example, in the case of land‐based pollution (Fredston‐Hermann et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0071">2016</a>) and logging (Hamilton et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0088">2017</a>). The type of management and conservation measures in place needs to take into account a combination of the changing environmental and human impacts as well as their potentially changing benefits.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marine protected areas or no‐take marine reserves are the most common form of reef management, focusing predominantly on reducing local anthropogenic pressures (Agardy, di Sciara, &amp; Christie, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0003">2011</a>; Mellin, Aaron MacNeil, Cheal, Emslie, &amp; Julian Caley, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0122">2016</a>). The recent trend in designations of very large, remote MPAs such as the 640,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> Chagos MPA (Jones &amp; De Santo, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0103">2016</a>) to meet the 10% coverage target of the Convention on Biological Diversity may represent political rather than science‐based interests. These MPAs cost little to designate but may not be effective or representative (Jones &amp; De Santo, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0103">2016</a>). They do not protect the most threatened reefs—those associated with high human population densities—nor address social issues such as maintaining ecosystem services for those reliant on reefs for food or income (Sale et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0150">2014</a>). Their designation should not divert attention from management of more damaged coral reefs in highly populated areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is increasing recognition that coral reef management has been unable to halt degradation, and that returning to “pristine” conditions is an unrealistic goal (Abelson et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0001">2016</a>; Burke et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0027">2011</a>; Hughes et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0098">2017</a>; Rinkevich, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0145" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0145">2015</a>), particularly in the context of changing environmental conditions. Conservation is moving away from this more traditional approach, as research seeks to provide conservation practitioners with a more diverse toolbox, including a range of indicators (Nash &amp; Graham, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0129">2016</a>) and modelling frameworks (McClanahan et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0115">2012</a>). The focus of management has changed from individual species and selected reefs, to management of the whole seascape, as the complexity of reef ecosystem responses to climate change and local human stressors has been realised (McClanahan, Graham, Macneil, &amp; Cinner, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0118">2015</a>; Olsson, Folke, &amp; Hughes, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0135" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0135">2008</a>; Weijerman et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0169" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0169">2015</a>). Ecosystem‐based management (EBM) is a more holistic framework, incorporating interactions within ecosystems and socialecological links, impacts of multiple stressors on key functional groups and ecosystem processes, with the goal of maintaining ecosystem functioning and services (Levin &amp; Lubchenco, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0110">2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concept of resilience has been advocated and can be used to support the design and implementation of EBM (Hughes et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0098">2017</a>; Levin &amp; Lubchenco, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0110">2008</a>). Ecological resilience can be defined as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain the same structure and functioning in a changing environment, including resistance to stress and recovery from disturbances (Levin &amp; Lubchenco, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0110">2008</a>; McClanahan et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0115">2012</a>). One of the benefits of embedding this framework into EBM for reefs is that resilience of coral reefs has been relatively well studied, for example, in the context of recovery following disturbance events such as bleaching (Anthony, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0006">2016</a>) and socio‐ecological resilience (Cinner, Pratchett, et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0039">2016</a>; Kittinger, Finkbeiner, Glazier, &amp; Crowder, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0106">2012</a>). Vulnerability frameworks that integrate across ecological, social and economic aspects of coral reefs are an important part of developing adaptive and more integrated ecosystem management strategies under climate change (Cinner, Huchery, et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0036">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the context of climate change, changes in underlying reef resilience could also occur if key recovery processes (such as recruitment, growth or dispersal) are impacted by climate change (Anthony, 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0006">2016</a>). Management strategies could therefore enhance resilience to ongoing stressors (e.g., warming, sedimentation) and act directly to reduce the impacts of disturbances, such as control of CoTS (Anthony et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0008">2015</a>). Reducing local drivers of coral reef decline may increase the chances of re‐establishment of coral‐dominated reefs from degraded reefs which are themselves resistant to change (Graham et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0077">2013</a>). Maintaining resilience also means retaining diversity and functional redundancy in the face of change, managing ecosystem connectivity, understanding and managing feedbacks, and promoting social principles including encouraging education, broadening participation and advocating integration of multiple stakeholders (Biggs et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0020">2012</a>; Hughes et al., 
  <a rid="ece34146-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34146-bib-0098">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To maintain the resilience of social‐ecological systems to climate change, we advocate for the need to (1) minimise local stressors, (2) design MPAs that address not only local pressures but also incorporate measures to address global environmental change, (3) utilise active management approaches such as human‐assisted evolution and reef restoration, and (4) develop coordinated management and governance at multiple scales from local customary tenure and community participation, to broader‐scale MSP, to regulations at the international scale. Each of these approaches is considered in depth below.</p>
