Yet to identify the management challenges and complete footprint of individual gears, a broader systems approach is required that integrates ecological, economic and social sciences. Here we apply this approach to artisanal fish fences, intensively used across three oceans, to identify a previously underrecognized gear requiring urgent management attention. A longitudinal case study shows increased effort matched with large declines in catch success and corresponding reef fish abundance. We find fish fences to disrupt vital ecological connectivity, exploit&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;500 species with high juvenile removal, and directly damage seagrass ecosystems with cascading impacts on connected coral reefs and mangroves. As semi-permanent structures in otherwise open-access fisheries, they create social conflict by assuming unofficial and unregulated property rights, while their unique high-investment-low-effort nature removes traditional economic and social barriers to overfishing.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Artisanal fish fences are used for fishing along many tropical coastlines.

Yet, addressing localised threats (e.g., unsustainable or damaging fishing practices) can build short-term ecosystem resilience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, improve adaptive capacity of species and ecosystems to changes in climate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and increase the opportunity for adaptation and acclimation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, there are potentially catastrophic impacts in areas where dependence on marine ecosystem services is high. For example, coral reefs provide the majority of protein to over 400 million people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, yet an estimated two-thirds of reef fish are already believed to have been lost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Developing solutions to slow the degradation of these ecosystems, including identifying the most-damaging practices and understanding what drives them, is therefore among the biggest global challenges facing humanity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A range of tools are currently used for sustainable coastal fisheries management. Marine Protected Areas often provide a governance structure for tailored conservation action such as fisheries management and can successfully buffer ecological communities against disturbances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, especially when optimal reserve size thresholds are met<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, manpower and funding are sufficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and ecological connectivity is considered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Where strict no-take rules are impractical, fish biomass can be maintained via more tailored fisheries management, including restrictions on gear usage and access<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, while strengthening fisheries governance at the local-scale best protects ecological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Governance of fishing activities is made more challenging by the multi-gear nature of many tropical small-scale fisheries; it is not uncommon for over 50 distinct gear types to be in use at a single location (including multiple varieties of the same gear class)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Although on occasion, critical management targets are easily identified, for example, blast fishing with explosives that has received considerable conservation attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, it is often less obvious where effort would be best spent to maximise conservation benefits. Similar to management interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, individual gear types express characteristics that span ecological, economic, and social sciences, and to fully understand their true impact they should be viewed beyond the narrow perspective of whether they are visibly destructive. Instead, a multi-directional approach is needed to realise the complete footprint on both the human communities and ecological systems in which they are used.</p><p id="Par5">Artisanal fishing gears are often promoted by managers, based on a widely held perception of smaller footprints compared with more-industrialised or modernised techniques. This is often despite the lack of an holistic understanding of the wide-ranging and far-reaching impacts these gears might pose. Artisanal fish fences (artisanal weirs, static fyke nets), for example, are used frequently and intensively, and their impacts appear severe and far-reaching, making them an ideal gear to test our approach. We show fish fences being used intensively across three ocean basins (Atlantic, Indian, Pacific), before presenting a unique 15-year case study incorporating ecological, fisheries catch and socioeconomic data to examine fish fence impacts across communities (natural and human) and ecosystems (seagrass, coral reef and mangrove), as well as exploring the social and economic drivers underpinning their use. Through such a comprehensive assessment, we are able to highlight otherwise unrecognised threats from this widely used gear type to local stakeholders and across multiple ecosystems, and demonstrate the value of a multi-disciplinary approach in directing evidence-based gear restriction efforts in tropical small-scale fisheries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Spatial and temporal patterns in usage and effort</title><p id="Par6">Artisanal fish fences are semi-permanent structures positioned on intertidal and shallow subtidal flats (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) that use fences to funnel fish into a holding structure at the seaward end as the water recedes towards low tide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. They were a common gear type globally before the advent of industrial fishing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, and they remain in use across a wide geographical range as a component of small-scale tropical coastal fisheries. We report the use of artisanal fish fences from the published scientific literature in 19 tropical countries across three oceans; from South America and West Africa through East Africa and the Persian Gulf, to the Indo-Pacific and Pacific Islands (see Methods). Further, image analysis using Google Earth (based on the latest satellite imagery available in July 2018) and the personal observations of the authors, identified their use in three additional countries (Sri Lanka, Thailand and Malaysia), as well as locations in Philippines and Indonesia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

From just 37 fences in 2002, numbers increased by 450% in only 7 years, peaking at 210 in 2009. Fence length (based on the total length of the central spine) showed a similar trend (analyis of variance; ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>6</italic></sub>&#x02009;<italic>=</italic>&#x02009;9.00, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>&#x02009;1.25<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), increasing by 69% in 11 years from 106&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9&#x02009;m (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1SE) in 2005 to 179&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9&#x02009;m in 2016.

If all fences were placed end-to-end, they would have stretched for a total of 10.57&#x02009;km in 2005, and 27.89&#x02009;km in 2015. Fences are typically arrow-shaped, consisting of a central spine and multiple wings, and those studied here on average incorporated 2.5 times the length of their central spine in total fence length. This means a combined total of 69.73&#x02009;km of physical barrier was in place around the island in 2015; significantly exceeding the island&#x02019;s ca. 60&#x02009;km coastline.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> Total fish fence effort around Kaledupa Island between 2002 and 2016, showing total number of fish fences in use (pink), and length of fences measured along the central spine (orange). <bold>b</bold> Catch statistics from fish fences between 2003 and 2016 during intensive 5-week study periods July&#x02013;August, showing catch per unit effort (CPUE; grey) and number of individual fish caught (purple). <bold>c</bold> Overall proportion of fish caught as juveniles for the total catch (all species combined; yellow), for species that mature above 15&#x02009;cm (green) and for species that mature above 20&#x02009;cm (blue).

This could create a false impression to managers that total effort is stabilising, whereas it could simply indicate that spatial saturation is being reached, and that effort may continue to rise through regular mesh size decreases as seen here.</p><p id="Par9">Fishers on the island appear to have changed their main fishing gear preferences, moving from widespread use of low-intensity methods (lines and spears) to a greater reliance on net fishing and fish fences. As part of stratified randomised household interviews throughout Kaledupa, 209 fishers were interviewed in 2005, and 75 interviewed in 2012. The majority of fishers in 2005 used lines as their main gear (54%), with 21% using nets and 7% using fish fences. Ten per cent used small mobile fish traps (bubus) and 5% used spears. By 2012 the majority of fishers used nets (62%) with 30% now using fish fences as their main gear. In 2012, no one reported using spears or lines as their main gear and one fisher reported using a fish attraction device.</p><p id="Par10">Despite this widespread and growing use and large cumulative spatial footprint, fish fences are still only of direct economic benefit to a small proportion of the total fishing community. Each fence is typically owned by a single fisher, and no additional labour is required to maintain their catches unless the owner chooses to employ an assistant to collect catches on their behalf. The widespread negative impacts of fish fence use must be placed in the context of their status as a minority gear type to fully appreciate the mismatch between the economic benefits to a few and the ecological costs suffered by all.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Impacts within and between ecosystems</title><p id="Par11">Local expert workshops and household interviews conducted between 2011 and 2014 revealed the presence of a range of direct physical impacts caused by the construction and use of artisanal fish fences. Considering the importance of habitat in supporting fish stocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, the loss of habitat from these direct impacts will expand the footprint of fish fence use beyond the simple removal of fish by reducing local carrying capacity and recruitment potential. Fishers commonly remove all seagrass within the immediate vicinity of the fence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), either through cutting or the use of poison as it is believed that this enhances catch. This creates a patch of habitat loss within the structure of the fence, as well as a halo surrounding it (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), resulting in habitat fragmentation and edge effects, which are known to have negative ecological impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Fences also introduce an artificial physical barrier, acting as an obstacle to natural ecosystem functioning, which will interrupt the natural movement of mobile species, but will also impact hydrology, connectivity, and even infochemical processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, which, in turn, can disrupt benthic community structure. This can lead to a healthy habitat coming abruptly to an end at the seaward side of a fence, to be replaced by a barren seascape on the landward side (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Fences are typically constructed using wooden poles harvested in local mangroves, further increasing the ecosystem scale impact of these fisheries. In the Wakatobi, <italic>Bruguiera gymnorhiza</italic> wood is used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, usually with a 2&#x02009;m long pole every 0.5&#x02009;m along the entire length of fence. Based on each structure incorporating on average 2.5 times the length of its central spine in total fence length, this results in ~&#x02009;500 poles being used for the construction of a 100&#x02009;m long fish fence. Using the total number and mean length of fences in 2015, this equates to 139,464 poles being used. Assuming a mean pole radius of 2&#x02009;cm, and using the average of published wood density values for <italic>B. gymnorhiza</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, we estimate 268 tonnes of mangrove wood was required to construct the fences present around Kaledupa in 2015, representing a substantial driver of local mangrove deforestation.</p><p id="Par13">Long-term catch monitoring suggests severe and far-reaching ecological impacts from intensive artisanal fish fence use. At the broadest level, catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined by almost 70% between 2005 and 2007 (ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>8</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13.53, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>), from 18.08&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.36&#x02009;kg fence<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 5.44&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.86&#x02009;kg fence<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). This has subsequently stabilised, fluctuating between lows of 3.65&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.22&#x02009;kg fence<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (2012) and 6.29&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.76&#x02009;kg fence<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (2016). The number of individual fish caught showed a similar decline of over 75% (Negative Binomial generalised linear models (GLM), <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>8</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;478.18, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.2<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>), from 713.50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;256.67 individuals fence<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 2005 to 172.76&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;34.32 individuals fence<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 2007. However, unlike CPUE, this downward trend continued, and by 2012 only 36.80&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.10 individuals fence<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were being caught.

On one hand this could indicate that, in such a complex multi-species fishery, no individual species were caught in sufficient numbers to accurately detect the true length distributions at a single time point. Alternatively, if these changes are indeed accurate, it could suggest that some species are benefiting from the intensive removal of competitors/predators elsewhere in the system (e.g., from other gear types), or they represent potential winners of environmental change. For example, <italic>S. canaliculatus</italic> feeds on epiphytic algae, which tends to proliferate with habitat degradation.</p><p id="Par16">Fish surveys via underwater visual census (UVC) on adjacent coral reefs show a corresponding decline in overall abundance. When all sites and depths are combined, fish densities (individuals 250&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) almost halved in 10 years, from 910&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;88 in 2002 to 498&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;31 in 2012 (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Whereas reef fish density decreased negatively with the number of fish fences in use (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), this was found not to be statistically significant (linear regression&#x000a0;<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08), although in a complex multi-gear fishery this is unsurprising. However, there is evidence to suggest that fish fences are an important, and under-appreciated, driver of these ecosystem wide declines, namely (i) their high exploitation of vulnerable life stages, (ii) their non-selective nature and subsequent exploitation across a diverse fish community, and (iii) their inherent purpose of disrupting the natural movements of fish populations that limits vital connectivity.</p><p id="Par17">Owing to the semi-permanent nature of artisanal fish fences, combined with their large dimensions and small mesh size (1.28&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.43&#x02009;cm in 2016), they are highly non-selective (i.e., they remove a large proportion of the available community including early life stages). When this is framed within the hyperdiverse marine ecosystems of the Indo-Pacific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, the footprint of such non-selective gears across the entire fish community can be huge. Fish community composition around Kaledupa is well known, thanks to over two decades of intensive research combining visual surveys and fishery catch monitoring (see Methods). A total of 575 fish species have been recorded by visual surveys of local reef, seagrass, and mangrove habitats historically. Of these, 251 (44%) have also been recorded in fish fence catches (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, a further 263 species have been recorded in fish fence catches that have not also featured in local surveys, meaning these fences are known to exploit at least 514 fish species to some extent at a single location. This includes charismatic species such as sharks and rays, which were observed as by-catch during this study in addition to non-fish species including turtles and various invertebrates. Although discarding of by-catch was minimal during this study, it has recently been recorded in other parts of the Indo-Pacific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, suggesting further sustainability concerns for artisanal fisheries.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Visual representation of the 838 fish species recorded locally, separated by their presence in visual surveys only (blue fish), fish fence catch monitoring only (red fish)&#x000a0;or both (green fish).

This causes disruption to the well-described, and ecologically important, natural connectivity between coastal marine habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. When the cumulative extent of this barrier is equivalent to ca. 50% of the coastline, as seen here around Kaledupa Island, this disruption is likely to be extreme. When the species recorded in local surveys are categorised into habitat associations based on the specific visual surveys in which they have been recorded locally, the proportion of which are known to be exploited by fish fences increased in those communities occupying multiple habitats (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). For example, 90% of the species observed in &#x0201c;reef&#x02009;+&#x02009;seagrass&#x02009;+&#x02009;mangrove&#x0201d; and 85% of species observed in &#x0201c;reef&#x02009;+&#x02009;mangrove&#x0201d; have been recorded in fence catches. This is compared with only 38% of species observed only on reefs. Natural connectivity enhances fish abundance and protects ecological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, as well as preserving resilience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and so any activity that acts to disrupt this connectivity will be counter-productive to conservation efforts. Considering reef fish have been shown to migrate over 30&#x02009;km<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> even local fish fence use can have far-reaching implications across a wide geographical area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Bioeconomic controls and social conflict</title><p id="Par19">Indonesian fishers will typically invest ca. USD 400 (correct as of 2018) of capital to construct a new fence, and typically no further financial outlay is required for at least 1 year, after which there will be small costs associated with maintenance and repair. This level of capital investment is similar to other gear types used on coral reefs, e.g., gill nets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, but while these alternatives are also typically associated with high regular effort (labour at sea and on land), fish fence use requires little regular effort from the fisher for as long as the structural integrity of the fence is maintained (at which point they can choose whether to repair, replace or exit the fishery). Fish fences are generally moved up to four times per year. Daily effort is restricted to a single trip to empty the fence at low tide and return the catch to land. This makes artisanal gears an example of a highly efficient gear, which are known to impact fish stocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, but also means fence owners are forced (by the need to recover capital investments) and incentivised (by long-term cost neutrality and low regular effort) to operate their fences for as long as possible. Once a fence is constructed, there exists a lack of any economic or energetic barriers to overfishing. This is coupled to a lack of any technical barrier in the form of gear availability, access to fishing grounds, and required expertise. Thus, fishing pressure is maintained in the face of diminishing returns and habitat damage, satisfying the criteria of Malthusian overfishing when framed alongside continued high human population growth in the tropics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">From a bioeconomic perspective, increasing the cost of fishing (for example, via high capital investment) should theoretically improve sustainability by reducing the total effort at which open-access equilibrium is reached<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. However, conversely, a reduction in regular unit cost/effort should have an opposite effect, exacerbating overfishing beyond the original open-access equilibrium. The passive nature of fish fences could therefore negate the potential benefit of capital investment as a control mechanism against overfishing, and could even accelerate fishery collapse (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This impact is worsened by the privatisation of fish fences in recent decades, having evolved from cooperative to single ownership. This concentrates the benefits of fence use within a narrow group of people, and displaces others into other gear types to maintain livelihoods, thus intensifying overall fishing pressure. It is also likely an important contributing factor toward the increase in fence numbers documented during this study as former cooperative members switch to individual ownership.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>The Gordon-Schaefer fixed price bioeconomic model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup> indicating the open-access equilibrium where cost equals the effort&#x02013;yield curve.

However, fish fence owners assume perceived property rights while excluding other stakeholders from accessing traditionally open-access fishing grounds. Fish fence owners then assume an unofficial (and unregulated) exclusive spatial harvest right, while undermining the catches of the wider stakeholder community through previously discussed disruption of ecological connectivity and high juvenile removal. The fences surveyed as part of this study averaged a 5:1 length to width ratio, meaning that in 2015 (the most recent year in which all effort metrics are available), a mere 160 fishers (one fisher per fence) assumed dedicated access privileges over an estimated 0.97&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup> of fishing grounds in addition to the ca. 70&#x02009;km of physical barrier limiting the natural movement of fish stocks.</p><p id="Par22">Fish fences also create social conflict in Indonesia owing to perceived social hierarchy between <italic>Pulo</italic> (islander) and <italic>Bajo</italic> (sea nomad) communities.

When combined with the issues surrounding assumed property rights and privatisation, fish fences undermine co-management efforts, which rely on buy-in across the stakeholder group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.

In the case of complex tropical multi-gear fisheries, a better understanding of the impact and extent of individual gear types will help identify those having a disproportionate impact and make more informed decisions.

Yet, they disrupt vital ecological connectivity, remove high quantities of juveniles, exploit hundreds of species, lack traditional economic and social barriers to overfishing and create social conflict among wider stakeholder groups, whilst only benefiting a minority of the overall stakeholder community. This suggests a worrying, and disproportionately high, impact on both fisheries sustainability and the multiple ecosystems on which they depend.</p><p id="Par24">Restricting fish fence use would represent a low-effort&#x02014;high-reward conservation strategy as they are semi-permanent and thus easily detectable, making them far easier to police than many other gears. This effort would result in direct and immediate benefits to the health and extent of three distinct ecosystems (coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangrove forests), would remove a significant sink for large numbers of juvenile fish across many hundreds of species, and would benefit the wider fishing community by removing an important source of social conflict whilst re-opening large areas of currently inaccessible fishing ground and restoring natural fish movement/migrations. There would likely be displacement into alternative gear types, but owing to the wide-ranging threats from fish fence use outlined here, we would anticipate this to have an overall net benefit to the fishery as a whole. Without restriction, the low regular effort required to maintain operation combined with the economic need to recover initial investment will likely mean their widespread and intensive use persists regardless of further declines in fish stocks. We therefore call on managers to target gear restrictions toward fish fences as an urgent priority in achieving sustainability in these vital fisheries, while improving our understanding of the hidden threats of artisanal fisheries by applying our approach to a broader suite of gear types.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Satellite imagery visual analysis to determine extent of artisanal fish fence use</title><p id="Par25">Owing to the large and semi-permanent nature of artisanal fish fences, their structures are easily visible from satellite imagery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

We thank all field scientists and student volunteers who helped with data collection, and thank the local communities of Kaledupa Island, in particular the fish&#x000a0;fence owners themselves, for allowing their daily routines to be disrupted in order for our surveys to be conducted. We are particularly grateful to Beloro and his team at the local Kaledupan fisheries NGO FORKANI, who provided invaluable local knowledge and facilitation; this project would not have been possible without them. We also thank Pippa Mansell for logistical assistance and fish fence census data collection.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>DAE and DJS conceived the study and JJ advised on study design and local requirements.
