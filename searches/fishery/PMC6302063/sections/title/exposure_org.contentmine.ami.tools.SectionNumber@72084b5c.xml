 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants discussed ecological changes that are beyond past experiences and related to the growth of bakeapples, noting that knowledge on change varied by individual for some observations. While this reflects lack of consensus in some observations (e.g., for weather, hydrological conditions, abundance of bakeapples), it also reflects differential engagement of individuals with bakeapple picking and different locations regularly visited.</p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few interviewees consider the recent variability in weather, including wind and temperature, to be beyond normal (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>).
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par30">“The berry picking for the bakeapples has changed because the weather has changed. The weather has changed, because it is more windy. A lot of wind. And more stormy. A lot of storms…. Extreme weather conditions are changing the bakeapples.” Rosetta Howell</p>
  </div>While these participants consider spring temperatures to be warmer in the last decade they also noted that the 2017 spring was an exception, being colder than usual.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Almost half the participants observed that bakeapples have been ripening earlier than normal in recent years (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>), and explained that this is because of changes in the timing of the seasons and earlier warmer temperatures.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par32">“The springs are coming earlier each year and because of that your blossoms are coming out earlier and they are ripening earlier because of that.” Dave Hamel</p>
  </div>A few participants independently attributed changes in the growth of bakeapples to climate change.
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten participants noted changes in the landscape at the bakeappple picking grounds, and many observed increases in larger shrubs surrounding bakeapple grounds and felt this vegetation is competing with the bakeapples (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>).
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par34">“Some of the other shrubs seem to be overtaking some of the… places where bakeapples grow.” Dave Hamel</p>
  </div>Analysis of satellite images from 2004 to 2016 indicates an increase in total green vegetation in The Big Marsh by 21.5% (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">4</a>).

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some participants, in response to a question about changing water conditions at bakeapple picking grounds reported that the landscape is drier (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>) as could be observed through small bodies of water in the landscape, ponds and rivers, or by the kinds of shoes needed to go picking. Several participants described how a small pond near a popular bakeapple picking ground completely dried up one year after large cracks formed in the landscape. Satellite imagery showed that the surface water increased at The Big Marsh from 2004 to 2016 by 66.4%, consistent with the development of thermokarst (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">4</a>). It is possible that this discrepancy is because bakeapple pickers would tend to avoid the grounds that are becoming wetter because they became less accessible.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third of participants observed that the bakeapple fruits are changing and that they grow differently, but did not know why (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>). A few observed that the way the bakeapples are ripening is more fragmented in space and time.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par37">“But I know that the bakeapples don’t grow anymore like they used to years ago. Years ago, when they ripe, you go out into a spot of bakeapples and you just pick, pick, pick. But now when you go you pick a few that’s ripe and then you go back a bit later and pick a few more when they are ripe. Why? I don’t know. But I do know there is a lot of vegetation growing up that wasn’t in some places anyhow.” Donnie Howell</p>
  </div>Fragmentation of bakeapple patches may be related to changes in palsas., palsas are estimated to have decreased in area from 2004 to 2016 by 64.5% at The Big Marsh (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">4</a>). From relevé analysis, it is evident the vegetation is different on palsa features compared to the surrounding areas with no permafrost, and is significantly correlated with changes in elevation and ALD. The decrease in palsa features in The Big Marsh has likely contributed to i) changes in vegetation communities resembling the differences, at present, between the palsa and no permafrost sites, and ii) fragmentation of the previous permafrost palsa vegetation communities, including bakeapple patches.
