 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first describe the activity of bakeapple picking and the ecological conditions at the picking grounds before characterizing the components of vulnerability drawing upon interviews and quantitative data. Note that interviewees agreed to the use of their quotes and some requested that their names be cited.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bakeapple Picking</div>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 17 of the 18 interviews, participants said that bakeapple picking is a family activity.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par18">“We did it with our two children from the time we had them till they left and then the grandkids came along and we are still doing it. 46 years of doing that.” Judy Pardy</p>
   </div>Half of the interviewees explained that in the past if the men were fishing only the women and children would bakeapple pick.
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Every family has their favorite spots to go bakeapple picking, some of which go back generations and other new ones are discovered by word of mouth. Often, a family keeps the exact location of their favorite picking grounds a secret to protect their supply. There is consensus among all interviewees that the best bakeapple picking areas are on the outer islands, and during the harvest, usually in August, families travel by boat to their summer homes or islands nearby.</p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bakeapples are used for special dishes like pies, cheesecakes, and muffins during the holidays. For some individuals, bakeapples are a part of their daily diet, although this was more common in the past when local grocery stores did not sell fruit during the winter.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par21">“Well, my father, he was 97 when he died, he had bakeapples every day. Every day for breakfast he had bakeapples.” Dwane Burdett</p>
   </div>Families will generally go for day trips or a holiday to the bakeapple grounds from the end of July through September, depending on when the bakeapples ripen. Largely, interviewees consider this variability to be normal.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par22">“Timing changes almost every year. You might be able to pick bakeapples in the middle of July and most times it is not until the first week in August and then from that on the bakeapples ripen.” Leslie Hamel</p>
   </div>Almost half of the participants describe how the temperatures in both the spring (April and May) and the summer (June, July, and August) determine the ripening time. With a shorter spring and earlier summer the bakeapples will ripen sooner. Also, about a third of participants explain that the time when bakeapples ripen depends on location, and can be as late as early September if the berries are in a sheltered spot where they receive less sun or on an island farther from the mainland.
  </p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quantity that a family picks depends on their uses of the bakeapples. Generally, if a family is picking solely for its own use, they will pick between five to 15 gal per season. If the family is picking with the intention of selling, they might pick anywhere from 20 to 50 gal depending on the abundance of bakeapples in a given year. Participants expect the growth of bakeapples to be variable from year to year and largely attribute this to weather.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par24">“Some years there’s none nowhere! I’ve been up there and sometimes you can literally see that the land has an orange glow to it. Like an orange… a big orange carpet.” Dwane Burdett</p>
   </div>About a third of participants emphasized that the weather during the spring and summer of the year is a key factor in the abundance of that season. Interviewees explained that in the spring if there are strong winds (between 40 to 60 km/h) or a downpour of rain then the bakeapple blossom can be destroyed because it is particularly sensitive until the shuck has closed in. Interviewees also explain that the weather during the summer is very important. Extreme warm temperatures (above 25° Celsius) can destroy the fruit.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par25">“If it’s too hot they’ll kind of burn up… and if it’s cold and damp for a while they just won’t grow like they should. You’ll get a few but they’ll be small or spaced apart.” Tracy Martin</p>
   </div>In addition to the importance of weather, ecological constraints on bakeapple growth were identified and characterized by interviewees and through field surveys. Interviewees described the optimal ecological conditions for bakeapple growth. Almost all explained that bakeapples are found in the boggy but not overly wet areas.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par26">“A lot of the places you pick bakeapples are pretty much wet spots anyways. Not right wet as such but damp… the best areas.” Leslie Hamel</p>
   </div>Additionally, more than half (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 11) explained that bakeapples will likely be larger and more abundant in spots sheltered by the (micro)topography of the landscape and/or surrounding plants.
  </p>
  <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted field surveys to determine whether the presence or absence of permafrost in palsa bogs constrained the presence or absence of bakeapples. A chi-squared test showed that the presence/absence of bakeapples is not significantly different between palsa and no permafrost plots. However, ANOSIM analysis of a NMDS plot of the vegetation data revealed that the vegetation types between palsa and no permafrost plots are significantly different with an ANOSIM test statistics equal to 0.226 and a significance value of 0.001 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Additionally, SIMPER analysis showed that 
   <span class="italic">sphagnum moss</span> spp
   <span class="italic">., sedge</span> spp
   <span class="italic">. Empetrum nigrum, Lichen</span> spp
   <span class="italic">.,</span> bakeapple (
   <span class="italic">Rubus chamaemorus)</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Vaccinium ulginosum, and Ledum groelandiculum</span> contributed to 70% of the dissimilarity between palsa and no permafrost plots. Spearman rank correlation coefficients revealed that ALD was significantly correlated with the first ordination axes and elevation was significantly correlated with the second ordination axes and therefore, both ALD and elevation explain differences in the vegetation types between the palsa and no permafrost plots (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). While permafrost presence in palsa bogs does not significantly impact the presence/absence of bakeapples
   <span class="italic">,</span> it does have a significant impact on vegetation species and the ecosystem as a whole (Photograph 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">1</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Exposure</div>
  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants discussed ecological changes that are beyond past experiences and related to the growth of bakeapples, noting that knowledge on change varied by individual for some observations. While this reflects lack of consensus in some observations (e.g., for weather, hydrological conditions, abundance of bakeapples), it also reflects differential engagement of individuals with bakeapple picking and different locations regularly visited.</p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few interviewees consider the recent variability in weather, including wind and temperature, to be beyond normal (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>).
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par30">“The berry picking for the bakeapples has changed because the weather has changed. The weather has changed, because it is more windy. A lot of wind. And more stormy. A lot of storms…. Extreme weather conditions are changing the bakeapples.” Rosetta Howell</p>
   </div>While these participants consider spring temperatures to be warmer in the last decade they also noted that the 2017 spring was an exception, being colder than usual.

   </div>
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Almost half the participants observed that bakeapples have been ripening earlier than normal in recent years (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>), and explained that this is because of changes in the timing of the seasons and earlier warmer temperatures.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par32">“The springs are coming earlier each year and because of that your blossoms are coming out earlier and they are ripening earlier because of that.” Dave Hamel</p>
   </div>A few participants independently attributed changes in the growth of bakeapples to climate change.
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ten participants noted changes in the landscape at the bakeappple picking grounds, and many observed increases in larger shrubs surrounding bakeapple grounds and felt this vegetation is competing with the bakeapples (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>).
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par34">“Some of the other shrubs seem to be overtaking some of the… places where bakeapples grow.” Dave Hamel</p>
   </div>Analysis of satellite images from 2004 to 2016 indicates an increase in total green vegetation in The Big Marsh by 21.5% (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">4</a>).

   </div>
  </p>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some participants, in response to a question about changing water conditions at bakeapple picking grounds reported that the landscape is drier (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>) as could be observed through small bodies of water in the landscape, ponds and rivers, or by the kinds of shoes needed to go picking. Several participants described how a small pond near a popular bakeapple picking ground completely dried up one year after large cracks formed in the landscape. Satellite imagery showed that the surface water increased at The Big Marsh from 2004 to 2016 by 66.4%, consistent with the development of thermokarst (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">4</a>). It is possible that this discrepancy is because bakeapple pickers would tend to avoid the grounds that are becoming wetter because they became less accessible.
  </p>
  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A third of participants observed that the bakeapple fruits are changing and that they grow differently, but did not know why (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>). A few observed that the way the bakeapples are ripening is more fragmented in space and time.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par37">“But I know that the bakeapples don’t grow anymore like they used to years ago. Years ago, when they ripe, you go out into a spot of bakeapples and you just pick, pick, pick. But now when you go you pick a few that’s ripe and then you go back a bit later and pick a few more when they are ripe. Why? I don’t know. But I do know there is a lot of vegetation growing up that wasn’t in some places anyhow.” Donnie Howell</p>
   </div>Fragmentation of bakeapple patches may be related to changes in palsas., palsas are estimated to have decreased in area from 2004 to 2016 by 64.5% at The Big Marsh (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">4</a>). From relevé analysis, it is evident the vegetation is different on palsa features compared to the surrounding areas with no permafrost, and is significantly correlated with changes in elevation and ALD. The decrease in palsa features in The Big Marsh has likely contributed to i) changes in vegetation communities resembling the differences, at present, between the palsa and no permafrost sites, and ii) fragmentation of the previous permafrost palsa vegetation communities, including bakeapple patches.
  </p>
  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to these biophysical stressors, socioeconomic changes are impacting where and when families pick bakeapples.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="Sec12" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity</div>
  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity to the changes in exposure documented needs to be understood in regard to long-term changes in human-environment interaction. Before the 1960s, families moved between summer homes, conveniently located for fishing and bakeapple picking, and winter homes for trapping and hunting. Resettlement to Cartwright in the 1960s moved community members farther from their summer homes and picking grounds making it harder to cope with variability in the growth of bakeapples.</p>
  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, before the moratorium on cod and salmon fishing in the 1990s, many families went to their summer homes out on the islands around June and returned to Cartwright around September. The salmon fishery in July ended just before the bakeapple harvest in August, when the cod fishery also started. After the moratorium, families remain in Cartwright during the summer and thus have farther to travel to the bakeapple picking grounds (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>).
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par41">“I was a young teenager when the cod fishery was over so life began to change then. So life began to change and peoples’ way of life began to change from that day to this. Less and less and less people could make a livelihood from in shore fishing. Taking their families to summer fishing places.” Rosetta Howell</p>
   </div>Few families can take a holiday to return to their summer homes, which can be hours away by boat, for bakeapple picking. More commonly, they will take day trips to nearby bakeapple picking grounds, less than a half hour away by boat.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par42">“That’s the way we pick bakeapples. We run off for a few hours and go out for a day or two and come back.” Leslie Hamel</p>
   </div>Community members explained that when not all the bakeapples are ripe they have to make multiple day trips back to the same berry patch over the course of the two weeks or so it takes all the bakeapples to ripen. It is more challenging for community members, in terms of finances and time, to deal with temporal and spatial variability in the ripening of bakeapples living farther from the bakeapple picking grounds.
  </p>
  <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many families have increasing difficulty in finding the time to go bakeapple picking together. It is difficult to cope with variability in weather and harvest timing with rigid work schedules and increasingly, single men will go to the bakeapple grounds for a couple of hours.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="Sec13" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptive Capacity</div>
  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The adaptive capacity of the community informs how bakeapple pickers respond to the identified exposures and sensitivities. The speedboat, an upgrade from row-boats and then motor-boats, is a part of the community’s adaptive capacity because it enables families to travel more quickly and to continue frequenting their bakeapple picking grounds (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>).
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par45">“You jump on your boat and go on and you’re there in half the time you were there in a motor boat.” Rosetta Sainsbury</p>
   </div>Because the speedboat reduces travel time, individuals can more easily get to a nearby bakeapple picking spot before or after work. The speedboat has -also encouraged families to explore new bakeapple picking spots.
  </p>
  <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“You can now go so much faster and so many different places.” Cookie Lethbridge In fact, some participants explain that the slower speed of motor-boats kept people from bakeapple picking at the best spots. Most families with a speedboat are better able to deal with the temporal and spatial variability of the bakeapple harvest.</p>
  <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the advantages of the speedboat, challenges remain, including the difficulty of traveling long distances by boat, particularly for elders, high winds, the cost of gasoline, and access to a suitable boat.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par48">“Getting ashore is always a problem if there is a sea on. Even if there is no wind sometimes you try and land and there’s too much sea. So you had to pick your days.” Leslie Hamel</p>
   </div>Two participants considered the cost of gasoline to be a barrier to bakeapple picking. A woman, a picker for almost 70 years, said that she and her husband spend $40 per trip on gasoline making bakeapple picking too expensive compared to when she was growing up and could just walk to the bakeapple grounds. Also, two noted the difficulties arising from either not owning a boat or having rented out the boat for work.
  </p>
  <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The market for bakeapples is a part of the community’s adaptive capacity because it helps some individuals to offset the costs of gas. Individuals sell as much as 30 gal of bakeapples to supply the high demand in Happy Valley-Goose Bay (central Labrador) and on the island of Newfoundland where they are not abundant and as a result sell for ~$80 a gallon, as well as in Cartwright as a source of supplemental income. The market for bakeapples also caters to individuals in Cartwright who are unable to go out and pick bakeapples due to age, lack of resources, time, and/or interest (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>). In addition to the market for bakeapples, more than half of the interviewees said that they share their surplus bakeapples with family and friends, as well as others who are unable to pick for whatever reason.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par50">“If I was going to get rid of any, I would give them away.” Donnie Howell</p>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TEK of generations of bakeapple pickers is a part of the community’s adaptive capacity because it captures when and where bakeapples are available and ripe. Pickers can start to predict the impact of weather on the ripening of bakeapples in the spring and communication among community members will identify the best harvesting grounds.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par52">“We know not to go to certain places if we are looking for bakeapples because chances are slim you are going to get them… and a lot of that is local knowledge.” Judy Pardy</p>
   </div>The value placed on bakeapples by individuals is also a part of the community’s adaptive capacity because it provides motivation to identify and adapt to ecological and social changes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>). Almost all participants explained that the bakeapples are still a valuable part of the diet.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par53">“Bakeapple picking has always been a big part of our lives for food. It’s been very important.” Donnie Howell</p>
   </div>Also, interviewees prefer bakeapples to other fruits available at the grocery store and recognize their nutritional value.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par54">“Whatever is in the grocery stores doesn’t matter. We are still going to get bakeapples if we can get them because they were something that we really liked to have, right?” (Anonymous male)</p>
   </div>Participants also enjoy bakeapple picking because they get to be out on the land.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par55">“For me, I love picking berries. I’d just go out and crawl around on the land all day long, you know?” Judy Pardy</p>
   </div>Participants also pointed out that bakeapple picking is hard work and can be increasingly difficult with age. Some interviewees value the social aspect of bakeapple picking. After a long day of bakeapple picking, the family will meet up for a ‘boil up,’ which is a picnic with some hot tea. A third of participants continue to bakeapple pick because it is a tradition, but fewer brought up their Inuit ancestry as a reason for bakeapple picking since most largely associated bakeapple picking with their Labradorian culture.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par56">“That’s how our ancestors survived and it just got passed down from generation to generation.” Dwane Burdett</p>
   </div>A minority of participants observed that families, especially the younger generation, are less engaged in bakeapple picking.
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p id="Par57">“Like I said it is [bakeapple picking] getting done less and less. There are less and less people out on the land.” Dwane Burdett</p>
    <p id="Par58">“We still try and pick bakeapples every year. But even that families don’t do that anymore with their children or grandchildren. You know some do but very few.” Rosetta Howell</p>
   </div>Because an increasing number of the younger generation places less value on family bakeapple picking and bakeapples as a food source, the cultural and nutritional value that families currently place on bakeapples may not be a source of adaptive capacity in the future.
