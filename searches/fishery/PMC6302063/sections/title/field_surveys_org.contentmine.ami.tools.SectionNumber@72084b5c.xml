 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relevé method was used to determine the importance of permafrost conditions on the presence of bakeapples to describe the exposure. A relevé is, at minimum, a list of present species within the plot (Causton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1988</a>). Plots spanned four permafrost-associated peatlands (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) and surveying occurred over four consecutive days (August 7–10, 2017). The plots were 1m
  <span class="sup">2</span>, based on recommendations for lichen and moss communities (Ellenberg and Mueller-Dombois 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">1974</a>). Plots were stratified between palsa sites with an active layer overlying permafrost, and sites with no detectable permafrost within 120 cm of the peat surface. In total, 31 plots were randomly selected on both palsa and no permafrost sites by throwing the quadrat in areas of the peatland with palsa features. Seven palsa and seven no permafrost plots were selected at Hare Harbor; eight palsa and eight no permafrost plots at Grady; five palsa and five no permafrost plots at Main Tickle Point; 11 palsa and 11 no permafrost plots at The Big Marsh in Cartwright. Per plot, species frequency was measured with the Daubenmire scale (Ellenberg and Mueller-Dombois 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">1974</a>; Thomas 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2003</a>). Elevation was measured with a hand-held Garmin GPS with a resolution of less than 10 m, and active layer depth (ALD) was measured with a 120 cm permafrost probe.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">R [1.0.143] was used to analyze the field data. To determine if bakeapples are significantly different across palsas and no permafrost sites, a Fisher’s exact chi squared test was used with the 
  <span class="italic">stats</span> package (Causton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1988</a>). With the Vegan package, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index, was performed to determine if distinct vegetation communities are associated with the palsa and no permafrost plots (Šmilauer and Lepš 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2014</a>); ANOSIM analysis was done to test whether the dissimilarity between the vegetation of the palsa and no permafrost plots is significantly greater than the dissimilarity within each group; SIMPER analysis was done to determine which species are contributing most to dissimilarity between groups (Clarke 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2006</a>). Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated with the stats package to determine if elevation and/or ALD are significantly correlated with the NMDS coordination axes; elevation and ALD were then fitted via regression to the ordination axes using the Vegan package (Causton 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1988</a>).
