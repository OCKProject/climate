 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 17 of the 18 interviews, participants said that bakeapple picking is a family activity.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par18">“We did it with our two children from the time we had them till they left and then the grandkids came along and we are still doing it. 46 years of doing that.” Judy Pardy</p>
  </div>Half of the interviewees explained that in the past if the men were fishing only the women and children would bakeapple pick.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Every family has their favorite spots to go bakeapple picking, some of which go back generations and other new ones are discovered by word of mouth. Often, a family keeps the exact location of their favorite picking grounds a secret to protect their supply. There is consensus among all interviewees that the best bakeapple picking areas are on the outer islands, and during the harvest, usually in August, families travel by boat to their summer homes or islands nearby.</p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bakeapples are used for special dishes like pies, cheesecakes, and muffins during the holidays. For some individuals, bakeapples are a part of their daily diet, although this was more common in the past when local grocery stores did not sell fruit during the winter.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par21">“Well, my father, he was 97 when he died, he had bakeapples every day. Every day for breakfast he had bakeapples.” Dwane Burdett</p>
  </div>Families will generally go for day trips or a holiday to the bakeapple grounds from the end of July through September, depending on when the bakeapples ripen. Largely, interviewees consider this variability to be normal.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par22">“Timing changes almost every year. You might be able to pick bakeapples in the middle of July and most times it is not until the first week in August and then from that on the bakeapples ripen.” Leslie Hamel</p>
  </div>Almost half of the participants describe how the temperatures in both the spring (April and May) and the summer (June, July, and August) determine the ripening time. With a shorter spring and earlier summer the bakeapples will ripen sooner. Also, about a third of participants explain that the time when bakeapples ripen depends on location, and can be as late as early September if the berries are in a sheltered spot where they receive less sun or on an island farther from the mainland.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quantity that a family picks depends on their uses of the bakeapples. Generally, if a family is picking solely for its own use, they will pick between five to 15 gal per season. If the family is picking with the intention of selling, they might pick anywhere from 20 to 50 gal depending on the abundance of bakeapples in a given year. Participants expect the growth of bakeapples to be variable from year to year and largely attribute this to weather.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par24">“Some years there’s none nowhere! I’ve been up there and sometimes you can literally see that the land has an orange glow to it. Like an orange… a big orange carpet.” Dwane Burdett</p>
  </div>About a third of participants emphasized that the weather during the spring and summer of the year is a key factor in the abundance of that season. Interviewees explained that in the spring if there are strong winds (between 40 to 60 km/h) or a downpour of rain then the bakeapple blossom can be destroyed because it is particularly sensitive until the shuck has closed in. Interviewees also explain that the weather during the summer is very important. Extreme warm temperatures (above 25° Celsius) can destroy the fruit.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par25">“If it’s too hot they’ll kind of burn up… and if it’s cold and damp for a while they just won’t grow like they should. You’ll get a few but they’ll be small or spaced apart.” Tracy Martin</p>
  </div>In addition to the importance of weather, ecological constraints on bakeapple growth were identified and characterized by interviewees and through field surveys. Interviewees described the optimal ecological conditions for bakeapple growth. Almost all explained that bakeapples are found in the boggy but not overly wet areas.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par26">“A lot of the places you pick bakeapples are pretty much wet spots anyways. Not right wet as such but damp… the best areas.” Leslie Hamel</p>
  </div>Additionally, more than half (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 11) explained that bakeapples will likely be larger and more abundant in spots sheltered by the (micro)topography of the landscape and/or surrounding plants.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted field surveys to determine whether the presence or absence of permafrost in palsa bogs constrained the presence or absence of bakeapples. A chi-squared test showed that the presence/absence of bakeapples is not significantly different between palsa and no permafrost plots. However, ANOSIM analysis of a NMDS plot of the vegetation data revealed that the vegetation types between palsa and no permafrost plots are significantly different with an ANOSIM test statistics equal to 0.226 and a significance value of 0.001 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Additionally, SIMPER analysis showed that 
  <span class="italic">sphagnum moss</span> spp
  <span class="italic">., sedge</span> spp
  <span class="italic">. Empetrum nigrum, Lichen</span> spp
  <span class="italic">.,</span> bakeapple (
  <span class="italic">Rubus chamaemorus)</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Vaccinium ulginosum, and Ledum groelandiculum</span> contributed to 70% of the dissimilarity between palsa and no permafrost plots. Spearman rank correlation coefficients revealed that ALD was significantly correlated with the first ordination axes and elevation was significantly correlated with the second ordination axes and therefore, both ALD and elevation explain differences in the vegetation types between the palsa and no permafrost plots (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). While permafrost presence in palsa bogs does not significantly impact the presence/absence of bakeapples
  <span class="italic">,</span> it does have a significant impact on vegetation species and the ecosystem as a whole (Photograph

Palsa (P) plots are in green and no permafrost (NP) plots are in blue. Proximity of plots implies less species composition dissimilarity. Environmental vectors (Elev = elevation, ALD = active layer depth) are overlaid on the NMDS. The direction of the vector indicates whether the correlation is positive or negative and the magnitude of the vector is proportional to the strength of the correlation</p>
