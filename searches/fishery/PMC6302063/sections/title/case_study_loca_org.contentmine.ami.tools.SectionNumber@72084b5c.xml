 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cartwright is located in southern Labrador on Sandwich Bay on the Atlantic coast (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) in the mid Boreal Forest ecoregion (Roberts 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2006</a>). According to Environment and Natural Resources Canada (1981–2010 climate normal), Cartwright had an average annual temperature of 0 °C, experienced average annual rainfall of 616.8 mm and average annual snowfall of 462 cm. The permafrost is classified as isolated patches and is limited to palsa features in peatlands, which are between 0.3–1.3 m high and covered by lichens and exposed peat (Way 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2018</a>). In the surrounding wetter depressions with no permafrost shrubs and mosses predominate. Three important salmon spawning rivers feed into Sandwich Bay. The regional flora and fauna are ecologically diverse including seals, whale, black bear, polar bear, caribou, wolf, fox, small mammals, waterfowl, marine and freshwater fish, blueberries, crowberries, bakeapples, lichen, white and black spruce, Eastern larch, and birch (Roberts

 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the Canadian 2016 census, Cartwright has a population just under 500 individuals, the majority with Indigenous ancestry and recognized as the people of NunatuKavut. Due to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador’s centralization program in the 1960s, Cartwright was provided with a school, a grocery store, postal service, telephone lines, and a road (Lethbridge and Chesley 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2007</a>), causing many families in nearby communities without these services to move to Cartwright. Presently, many individuals are employed at the Labrador Fishermen’s Union Shrimp Company Limited where crab is processed from the offshore crab fishery. Historically, there was a cod fishery but stocks declined noticeably in the second half of the twentieth century and the Canadian government placed an official moratorium on the commercial cod fishery throughout Southern Labrador in 1992. The inland commercial salmon fishery closed a few years later.
