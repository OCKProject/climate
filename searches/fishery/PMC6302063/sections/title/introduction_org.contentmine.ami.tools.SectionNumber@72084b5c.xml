 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global temperatures are increasing at unprecedented rates with increases amplified in the Arctic (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2013</a>; AMAP 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2017</a>). According to Environment Canada, air temperatures have increased by 1.7 °C and by 3.1 °C in the western Canadian Arctic. Indigenous communities in the Arctic and Subarctic, in particular, are highly sensitive to climate changes (Serreze and Barry 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">2011</a>) because of their close relationship with the land for livelihoods and associated food systems, colonial legacies, and concurrent socioeconomic changes (Anisimov 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2007</a>; Ford 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scholarship examining the human dimensions of climate change in the Arctic and Subarctic, particularly in Canada and with a focus on Indigenous peoples is well established (Ford 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2018</a>). Much of this work describes hunting and fishing livelihoods and associated food systems, but comparable work on berry picking is largely absent (Ford 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2012b</a>; Bunce 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2016</a>). There are also geographic disparities in research, with most scholarship focusing on communities and the region above 60°N (Ford 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2012a</a>) rather than the Subarctic (Downing and Cuerrier 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2011</a>; Cuerrier 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2015</a>).

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wild berry picking is an important part of the food subsistence for Indigenous communities in southern Labrador, for both nutritional and cultural reasons (Fitzhugh 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">1999</a>). Individuals consider wild berries, including bakeapples, to be healthier than store bought foods and berry picking traditions have been passed down for generations. There is a two-to-three week window, typically in August, when families go bakeapple picking. Bakeapples often grow in peatlands on or around palsa features (a peat mound with a permafrost core) and many factors including precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, and the surrounding vegetation impact their growth (Korpelainen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">1994</a>; Kellogg 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2010</a>; Seppälä 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2011</a>). Models predict that most peatland permafrost in southeastern Labrador will thaw by the end of the twenty-first century (Way 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2018</a>). Thawing of peatland permafrost can cause ground subsidence, hydrological changes, thermokarst development, and fragmentation of the palsa dependent vegetation—forbs, shrubs, lichens— and a transition to wet graminoids and 
  <span class="italic">Sphagnum moss</span> spp. (Camill 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">1999</a>; Camill 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2001</a>; Christensen 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2004</a>; Johansson 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2006</a>). While the importance of palsas for bakeapple growth is unclear, previous research suggests impacts of climate related changes on the ripening time, quality, and abundance of berries (Cuerrier 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identify and characterize the vulnerability of bakeapple (
  <span class="italic">Rubus chamaemorus</span> and Appik in Inuttitut) picking to climate change, combining qualitative and quantitative methods including interviews, field surveys, and satellite imagery analysis. Focusing on the community of Cartwright, Labrador, we utilize a ‘contextual approach’ to vulnerability assessment, focusing on both climatic and non-climatic factors affecting berry picking.
