 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mixed methods — field surveys, satellite imagery analysis, interviews —were used to characterize the environmental changes affecting the ripening time, abundance, and quality of bakeapples (exposure). Interviews were also used to characterize sensitivity and adaptive capacity, drawing upon the traditional ecological knolwedge (TEK) of informants. Traditional knowledge (TK) is the “cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and values acquired through experience and observations on the land or from spiritual teachings and handed down from generation to generation” (Pearce

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2015</a>: 235). TEK is a subset of TK that specifically encompasses knowledge about the environment and human’s relationship with it (Riedlinger and Berkes 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2001</a>). TEK is an integral part of the ability of Indigenous communities to safely and effectively live off the land, continues to be a component of adaptive capacity to climate change, and is increasingly valued by researchers seeking to understand how climate change interacts with society (Huntington
