 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity to the changes in exposure documented needs to be understood in regard to long-term changes in human-environment interaction. Before the 1960s, families moved between summer homes, conveniently located for fishing and bakeapple picking, and winter homes for trapping and hunting. Resettlement to Cartwright in the 1960s moved community members farther from their summer homes and picking grounds making it harder to cope with variability in the growth of bakeapples.</p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, before the moratorium on cod and salmon fishing in the 1990s, many families went to their summer homes out on the islands around June and returned to Cartwright around September. The salmon fishery in July ended just before the bakeapple harvest in August, when the cod fishery also started. After the moratorium, families remain in Cartwright during the summer and thus have farther to travel to the bakeapple picking grounds (Fig.

   <p id="Par41">“I was a young teenager when the cod fishery was over so life began to change then. So life began to change and peoples’ way of life began to change from that day to this. Less and less and less people could make a livelihood from in shore fishing. Taking their families to summer fishing places.” Rosetta Howell</p>
  </div>Few families can take a holiday to return to their summer homes, which can be hours away by boat, for bakeapple picking. More commonly, they will take day trips to nearby bakeapple picking grounds, less than a half hour away by boat.

   <p id="Par42">“That’s the way we pick bakeapples. We run off for a few hours and go out for a day or two and come back.” Leslie Hamel</p>
  </div>Community members explained that when not all the bakeapples are ripe they have to make multiple day trips back to the same berry patch over the course of the two weeks or so it takes all the bakeapples to ripen. It is more challenging for community members, in terms of finances and time, to deal with temporal and spatial variability in the ripening of bakeapples living farther from the bakeapple picking grounds.
 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many families have increasing difficulty in finding the time to go bakeapple picking together. It is difficult to cope with variability in weather and harvest timing with rigid work schedules and increasingly, single men will go to the bakeapple grounds for a couple of hours.</p>
