 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The adaptive capacity of the community informs how bakeapple pickers respond to the identified exposures and sensitivities. The speedboat, an upgrade from row-boats and then motor-boats, is a part of the community’s adaptive capacity because it enables families to travel more quickly and to continue frequenting their bakeapple picking grounds (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>).
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par45">“You jump on your boat and go on and you’re there in half the time you were there in a motor boat.” Rosetta Sainsbury</p>
  </div>Because the speedboat reduces travel time, individuals can more easily get to a nearby bakeapple picking spot before or after work. The speedboat has -also encouraged families to explore new bakeapple picking spots.
 </p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“You can now go so much faster and so many different places.” Cookie Lethbridge In fact, some participants explain that the slower speed of motor-boats kept people from bakeapple picking at the best spots. Most families with a speedboat are better able to deal with the temporal and spatial variability of the bakeapple harvest.</p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the advantages of the speedboat, challenges remain, including the difficulty of traveling long distances by boat, particularly for elders, high winds, the cost of gasoline, and access to a suitable boat.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par48">“Getting ashore is always a problem if there is a sea on. Even if there is no wind sometimes you try and land and there’s too much sea. So you had to pick your days.” Leslie Hamel</p>
  </div>Two participants considered the cost of gasoline to be a barrier to bakeapple picking. A woman, a picker for almost 70 years, said that she and her husband spend $40 per trip on gasoline making bakeapple picking too expensive compared to when she was growing up and could just walk to the bakeapple grounds. Also, two noted the difficulties arising from either not owning a boat or having rented out the boat for work.
 </p>
 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The market for bakeapples is a part of the community’s adaptive capacity because it helps some individuals to offset the costs of gas. Individuals sell as much as 30 gal of bakeapples to supply the high demand in Happy Valley-Goose Bay (central Labrador) and on the island of Newfoundland where they are not abundant and as a result sell for ~$80 a gallon, as well as in Cartwright as a source of supplemental income. The market for bakeapples also caters to individuals in Cartwright who are unable to go out and pick bakeapples due to age, lack of resources, time, and/or interest (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>). In addition to the market for bakeapples, more than half of the interviewees said that they share their surplus bakeapples with family and friends, as well as others who are unable to pick for whatever reason.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par50">“If I was going to get rid of any, I would give them away.” Donnie Howell</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TEK of generations of bakeapple pickers is a part of the community’s adaptive capacity because it captures when and where bakeapples are available and ripe. Pickers can start to predict the impact of weather on the ripening of bakeapples in the spring and communication among community members will identify the best harvesting grounds.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par52">“We know not to go to certain places if we are looking for bakeapples because chances are slim you are going to get them… and a lot of that is local knowledge.” Judy Pardy</p>
  </div>The value placed on bakeapples by individuals is also a part of the community’s adaptive capacity because it provides motivation to identify and adapt to ecological and social changes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">3</a>). Almost all participants explained that the bakeapples are still a valuable part of the diet.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par53">“Bakeapple picking has always been a big part of our lives for food. It’s been very important.” Donnie Howell</p>
  </div>Also, interviewees prefer bakeapples to other fruits available at the grocery store and recognize their nutritional value.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par54">“Whatever is in the grocery stores doesn’t matter. We are still going to get bakeapples if we can get them because they were something that we really liked to have, right?” (Anonymous male)</p>
  </div>Participants also enjoy bakeapple picking because they get to be out on the land.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par55">“For me, I love picking berries. I’d just go out and crawl around on the land all day long, you know?” Judy Pardy</p>
  </div>Participants also pointed out that bakeapple picking is hard work and can be increasingly difficult with age. Some interviewees value the social aspect of bakeapple picking. After a long day of bakeapple picking, the family will meet up for a ‘boil up,’ which is a picnic with some hot tea. A third of participants continue to bakeapple pick because it is a tradition, but fewer brought up their Inuit ancestry as a reason for bakeapple picking since most largely associated bakeapple picking with their Labradorian culture.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par56">“That’s how our ancestors survived and it just got passed down from generation to generation.” Dwane Burdett</p>
  </div>A minority of participants observed that families, especially the younger generation, are less engaged in bakeapple picking.
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p id="Par57">“Like I said it is [bakeapple picking] getting done less and less. There are less and less people out on the land.” Dwane Burdett</p>
   <p id="Par58">“We still try and pick bakeapples every year. But even that families don’t do that anymore with their children or grandchildren. You know some do but very few.” Rosetta Howell</p>
  </div>Because an increasing number of the younger generation places less value on family bakeapple picking and bakeapples as a food source, the cultural and nutritional value that families currently place on bakeapples may not be a source of adaptive capacity in the future.
