Most research has focused on hunting and fishing activities, overlooking berry picking as an important socio-cultural activity and contributor to the diversity of food systems. We examined the vulnerability of cloudberry (referred to as &#x02018;bakeapple&#x02019; consistent with local terminology) picking to environmental changes in the community of Cartwright, Labrador using semi-structured interviews (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;18), field surveys, and satellite imagery. We identified the components of vulnerability including: the environmental changes affecting the abundance, quality, and ripening time of bakeapples (i.e., exposure), the characteristics of the community that affect how these changes have local impacts (i.e., sensitivity), and the ways in which the community is responding to environmental changes (i.e., adaptive capacity). Our results confirm that environmental changes related to permafrost, vegetation, and water have occurred at the bakeapple picking grounds with observed impacts on bakeapples. It is becoming increasingly difficult for bakeapple pickers to respond to variable growth as in the past because of changes in summer settlement patterns that place families farther from their bakeapple patches. We conclude that harvesters in Cartwright have high adaptive capacity to respond to environmental changes due to their knowledge of their bakeapple patches, and at present, socioeconomic changes have had a greater impact than environmental changes on their harvesting capacity.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Vulnerability</kwd><kwd>Cloudberry (bakeapple) picking</kwd><kwd>Indigenous peoples</kwd><kwd>Subarctic</kwd><kwd>Southeastern Labrador</kwd><kwd>Canada</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Leeds</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Global temperatures are increasing at unprecedented rates with increases amplified in the Arctic (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2013</xref>; AMAP&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>).

Individuals consider wild berries, including bakeapples, to be healthier than store bought foods and berry picking traditions have been passed down for generations. There is a two-to-three week window, typically in August, when families go bakeapple picking. Bakeapples often grow in peatlands on or around palsa features (a peat mound with a permafrost core) and many factors including precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, and the surrounding vegetation impact their growth (Korpelainen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1994</xref>; Kellogg <italic>et al.</italic>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2018</xref>). Thawing of peatland permafrost can cause ground subsidence, hydrological changes, thermokarst development, and fragmentation of the palsa dependent vegetation&#x02014;forbs, shrubs, lichens&#x02014; and a transition to wet graminoids and <italic>Sphagnum moss</italic> spp. (Camill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1999</xref>; Camill <italic>et al.</italic>

Vulnerability can be defined as the &#x0201c;susceptibility to be harmed&#x0201d; (Adger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>:269) with vulnerability research seeking to identify and characterize who is vulnerable, to what stresses, and why (Ford and Smit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>). Contextual vulnerability considers the political, biophysical, social, and economic factors that interact to shape vulnerability and defines vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (O&#x02019;Brien <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2007</xref>; Wang <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2014</xref>; Archer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>); exposure captures the environmental changes affecting the ripening time, abundance and quality of berries; sensitivity reflects the livelihoods and other social, economic, and political characteristics of the community, and shapes the impacts of exposure, e.g., if there is a landslide caused by permafrost degradation (exposure), the effect on a community will be dependent on components of sensitivity such as the location of settlements, infrastructure, land use, and technology (Smit and Wandel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2006</xref>); adaptive capacity reflects the potential ability of the community to plan for, address, or cope with exposure (Ford and Smit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>; Smit and Wandel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2006</xref>; O&#x02019;Brien <italic>et al.</italic>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>), e.g., berry pickers may bring extra gasoline anticipating the need to visit multiple bakeapple picking grounds by boat. The response to these drivers of vulnerability in turn shapes and changes the initial conditions of vulnerability, and as a result, vulnerability is dynamic (Smit and Wandel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2006</xref>; Ford <italic>et al.</italic>

Presently, many individuals are employed at the Labrador Fishermen&#x02019;s Union Shrimp Company Limited where crab is processed from the offshore crab fishery.

TEK is a subset of TK that specifically encompasses knowledge about the environment and human&#x02019;s relationship with it (Riedlinger and Berkes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2001</xref>). TEK is an integral part of the ability of Indigenous communities to safely and effectively live off the land, continues to be a component of adaptive capacity to climate change, and is increasingly valued by researchers seeking to understand how climate change interacts with society (Huntington <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Pearce <italic>et al.</italic>

Plots spanned four permafrost-associated peatlands (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and surveying occurred over four consecutive days (August 7&#x02013;10, 2017). The plots were 1m<sup>2</sup>, based on recommendations for lichen and moss communities (Ellenberg and Mueller-Dombois <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1974</xref>). Plots were stratified between palsa sites with an active layer overlying permafrost, and sites with no detectable permafrost within 120&#x000a0;cm of the peat surface. In total, 31 plots were randomly selected on both palsa and no permafrost sites by throwing the quadrat in areas of the peatland with palsa features. Seven palsa and seven no permafrost plots were selected at Hare Harbor; eight palsa and eight no permafrost plots at Grady; five palsa and five no permafrost plots at Main Tickle Point; 11 palsa and 11 no permafrost plots at The Big Marsh in Cartwright.

Additionally, following the approach of Sannel and Kuhry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2011</xref>), we used the panchromatic bands with the aid of the multispectral bands to identify palsas. Automatic target detection, with the matched Filtering (MF) algorithm, was used to identify any green vegetation and surface water in the 2004 and 2016 images. To assess the target detection, the separability between vegetation, water, and the unclassified areas was computed with Jeffries-Matusita separability measures. All combinations of features had Jeffries-Matusita separability measures greater than 1 indicating good spectral separability (Richards and Jia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2006</xref>). Following Richards and Jia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2006</xref>), we calculated the following classification accuracy metrics: overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. The user accuracy, which is the chance that a pixel labeled vegetation or water is actually vegetation or water, was 81.82 and 87.50% for the surface water class in 2004 and 2016 respectively, and 100% for the vegetation class in both 2004 and 2016.

There is consensus among all interviewees that the best bakeapple picking areas are on the outer islands, and during the harvest, usually in August, families travel by boat to their summer homes or islands nearby.</p><p id="Par20">Bakeapples are used for special dishes like pies, cheesecakes, and muffins during the holidays. For some individuals, bakeapples are a part of their daily diet, although this was more common in the past when local grocery stores did not sell fruit during the winter.<disp-quote><p id="Par21">&#x0201c;Well, my father, he was 97 when he died, he had bakeapples every day. Every day for breakfast he had bakeapples.&#x0201d; Dwane Burdett</p></disp-quote>Families will generally go for day trips or a holiday to the bakeapple grounds from the end of July through September, depending on when the bakeapples ripen. Largely, interviewees consider this variability to be normal.<disp-quote><p id="Par22">&#x0201c;Timing changes almost every year. You might be able to pick bakeapples in the middle of July and most times it is not until the first week in August and then from that on the bakeapples ripen.&#x0201d; Leslie Hamel</p></disp-quote>Almost half of the participants describe how the temperatures in both the spring (April and May) and the summer (June, July, and August) determine the ripening time. With a shorter spring and earlier summer the bakeapples will ripen sooner. Also, about a third of participants explain that the time when bakeapples ripen depends on location, and can be as late as early September if the berries are in a sheltered spot where they receive less sun or on an island farther from the mainland.</p><p id="Par23">The quantity that a family picks depends on their uses of the bakeapples. Generally, if a family is picking solely for its own use, they will pick between five to 15&#x000a0;gal per season. If the family is picking with the intention of selling, they might pick anywhere from 20 to 50&#x000a0;gal depending on the abundance of bakeapples in a given year. Participants expect the growth of bakeapples to be variable from year to year and largely attribute this to weather.<disp-quote><p id="Par24">&#x0201c;Some years there&#x02019;s none nowhere!

Like an orange&#x02026; a big orange carpet.&#x0201d; Dwane Burdett</p></disp-quote>About a third of participants emphasized that the weather during the spring and summer of the year is a key factor in the abundance of that season. Interviewees explained that in the spring if there are strong winds (between 40 to 60&#x000a0;km/h) or a downpour of rain then the bakeapple blossom can be destroyed because it is particularly sensitive until the shuck has closed in. Interviewees also explain that the weather during the summer is very important. Extreme warm temperatures (above 25&#x000b0; Celsius) can destroy the fruit.<disp-quote><p id="Par25">&#x0201c;If it&#x02019;s too hot they&#x02019;ll kind of burn up&#x02026; and if it&#x02019;s cold and damp for a while they just won&#x02019;t grow like they should. You&#x02019;ll get a few but they&#x02019;ll be small or spaced apart.&#x0201d; Tracy Martin</p></disp-quote>In addition to the importance of weather, ecological constraints on bakeapple growth were identified and characterized by interviewees and through field surveys. Interviewees described the optimal ecological conditions for bakeapple growth. Almost all explained that bakeapples are found in the boggy but not overly wet areas.<disp-quote><p id="Par26">&#x0201c;A lot of the places you pick bakeapples are pretty much wet spots anyways. Not right wet as such but damp&#x02026; the best areas.&#x0201d; Leslie Hamel</p></disp-quote>Additionally, more than half (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;11) explained that bakeapples will likely be larger and more abundant in spots sheltered by the (micro)topography of the landscape and/or surrounding plants.</p><p id="Par27">We conducted field surveys to determine whether the presence or absence of permafrost in palsa bogs constrained the presence or absence of bakeapples. A chi-squared test showed that the presence/absence of bakeapples is not significantly different between palsa and no permafrost plots. However, ANOSIM analysis of a NMDS plot of the vegetation data revealed that the vegetation types between palsa and no permafrost plots are significantly different with an ANOSIM test statistics equal to 0.226 and a significance value of 0.001 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Spearman rank correlation coefficients revealed that ALD was significantly correlated with the first ordination axes and elevation was significantly correlated with the second ordination axes and therefore, both ALD and elevation explain differences in the vegetation types between the palsa and no permafrost plots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). While permafrost presence in palsa bogs does not significantly impact the presence/absence of bakeapples<italic>,</italic> it does have a significant impact on vegetation species and the ecosystem as a whole (Photograph&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>NMDS showing the relative position of the vegetation plots in a two-dimensional space via comparison of the species surface cover per plot.

Several participants described how a small pond near a popular bakeapple picking ground completely dried up one year after large cracks formed in the landscape. Satellite imagery showed that the surface water increased at The Big Marsh from 2004 to 2016 by 66.4%, consistent with the development of thermokarst (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). It is possible that this discrepancy is because bakeapple pickers would tend to avoid the grounds that are becoming wetter because they became less accessible.</p><p id="Par36">A third of participants observed that the bakeapple fruits are changing and that they grow differently, but did not know why (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

From relev&#x000e9; analysis, it is evident the vegetation is different on palsa features compared to the surrounding areas with no permafrost, and is significantly correlated with changes in elevation and ALD. The decrease in palsa features in The Big Marsh has likely contributed to i) changes in vegetation communities resembling the differences, at present, between the palsa and no permafrost sites, and ii) fragmentation of the previous permafrost palsa vegetation communities, including bakeapple patches.</p><p id="Par38">In addition to these biophysical stressors, socioeconomic changes are impacting where and when families pick bakeapples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sensitivity</title><p id="Par39">Sensitivity to the changes in exposure documented needs to be understood in regard to long-term changes in human-environment interaction. Before the 1960s, families moved between summer homes, conveniently located for fishing and bakeapple picking, and winter homes for trapping and hunting. Resettlement to Cartwright in the 1960s moved community members farther from their summer homes and picking grounds making it harder to cope with variability in the growth of bakeapples.</p><p id="Par40">However, before the moratorium on cod and salmon fishing in the 1990s, many families went to their summer homes out on the islands around June and returned to Cartwright around September. The salmon fishery in July ended just before the bakeapple harvest in August, when the cod fishery also started. After the moratorium, families remain in Cartwright during the summer and thus have farther to travel to the bakeapple picking grounds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<disp-quote><p id="Par41">&#x0201c;I was a young teenager when the cod fishery was over so life began to change then. So life began to change and peoples&#x02019; way of life began to change from that day to this. Less and less and less people could make a livelihood from in shore fishing. Taking their families to summer fishing places.&#x0201d; Rosetta Howell</p></disp-quote>Few families can take a holiday to return to their summer homes, which can be hours away by boat, for bakeapple picking. More commonly, they will take day trips to nearby bakeapple picking grounds, less than a half hour away by boat.<disp-quote><p id="Par42">&#x0201c;That&#x02019;s the way we pick bakeapples. We run off for a few hours and go out for a day or two and come back.&#x0201d; Leslie Hamel</p></disp-quote>Community members explained that when not all the bakeapples are ripe they have to make multiple day trips back to the same berry patch over the course of the two weeks or so it takes all the bakeapples to ripen. It is more challenging for community members, in terms of finances and time, to deal with temporal and spatial variability in the ripening of bakeapples living farther from the bakeapple picking grounds.</p><p id="Par43">Many families have increasing difficulty in finding the time to go bakeapple picking together. It is difficult to cope with variability in weather and harvest timing with rigid work schedules and increasingly, single men will go to the bakeapple grounds for a couple of hours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Adaptive Capacity</title><p id="Par44">The adaptive capacity of the community informs how bakeapple pickers respond to the identified exposures and sensitivities. The speedboat, an upgrade from row-boats and then motor-boats, is a part of the community&#x02019;s adaptive capacity because it enables families to travel more quickly and to continue frequenting their bakeapple picking grounds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<disp-quote><p id="Par45">&#x0201c;You jump on your boat and go on and you&#x02019;re there in half the time you were there in a motor boat.&#x0201d; Rosetta Sainsbury</p></disp-quote>Because the speedboat reduces travel time, individuals can more easily get to a nearby bakeapple picking spot before or after work. The speedboat has -also encouraged families to explore new bakeapple picking spots.</p><p id="Par46">&#x0201c;You can now go so much faster and so many different places.&#x0201d; Cookie Lethbridge In fact, some participants explain that the slower speed of motor-boats kept people from bakeapple picking at the best spots. Most families with a speedboat are better able to deal with the temporal and spatial variability of the bakeapple harvest.</p><p id="Par47">Despite the advantages of the speedboat, challenges remain, including the difficulty of traveling long distances by boat, particularly for elders, high winds, the cost of gasoline, and access to a suitable boat.<disp-quote><p id="Par48">&#x0201c;Getting ashore is always a problem if there is a sea on. Even if there is no wind sometimes you try and land and there&#x02019;s too much sea. So you had to pick your days.&#x0201d; Leslie Hamel</p></disp-quote>Two participants considered the cost of gasoline to be a barrier to bakeapple picking. A woman, a picker for almost 70&#x000a0;years, said that she and her husband spend $40 per trip on gasoline making bakeapple picking too expensive compared to when she was growing up and could just walk to the bakeapple grounds. Also, two noted the difficulties arising from either not owning a boat or having rented out the boat for work.</p><p id="Par49">The market for bakeapples is a part of the community&#x02019;s adaptive capacity because it helps some individuals to offset the costs of gas. Individuals sell as much as 30&#x000a0;gal of bakeapples to supply the high demand in Happy Valley-Goose Bay (central Labrador) and on the island of Newfoundland where they are not abundant and as a result sell for ~$80 a gallon, as well as in Cartwright as a source of supplemental income. The market for bakeapples also caters to individuals in Cartwright who are unable to go out and pick bakeapples due to age, lack of resources, time, and/or interest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In addition to the market for bakeapples, more than half of the interviewees said that they share their surplus bakeapples with family and friends, as well as others who are unable to pick for whatever reason.<disp-quote><p id="Par50">&#x0201c;If I was going to get rid of any, I would give them away.&#x0201d; Donnie Howell</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par51">The TEK of generations of bakeapple pickers is a part of the community&#x02019;s adaptive capacity because it captures when and where bakeapples are available and ripe. Pickers can start to predict the impact of weather on the ripening of bakeapples in the spring and communication among community members will identify the best harvesting grounds.<disp-quote><p id="Par52">&#x0201c;We know not to go to certain places if we are looking for bakeapples because chances are slim you are going to get them&#x02026; and a lot of that is local knowledge.&#x0201d; Judy Pardy</p></disp-quote>The value placed on bakeapples by individuals is also a part of the community&#x02019;s adaptive capacity because it provides motivation to identify and adapt to ecological and social changes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Almost all participants explained that the bakeapples are still a valuable part of the diet.<disp-quote><p id="Par53">&#x0201c;Bakeapple picking has always been a big part of our lives for food. It&#x02019;s been very important.&#x0201d; Donnie Howell</p></disp-quote>Also, interviewees prefer bakeapples to other fruits available at the grocery store and recognize their nutritional value.<disp-quote><p id="Par54">&#x0201c;Whatever is in the grocery stores doesn&#x02019;t matter. We are still going to get bakeapples if we can get them because they were something that we really liked to have, right?&#x0201d; (Anonymous male)</p></disp-quote>Participants also enjoy bakeapple picking because they get to be out on the land.<disp-quote><p id="Par55">&#x0201c;For me, I love picking berries. I&#x02019;d just go out and crawl around on the land all day long, you know?&#x0201d; Judy Pardy</p></disp-quote>Participants also pointed out that bakeapple picking is hard work and can be increasingly difficult with age. Some interviewees value the social aspect of bakeapple picking. After a long day of bakeapple picking, the family will meet up for a &#x02018;boil up,&#x02019; which is a picnic with some hot tea. A third of participants continue to bakeapple pick because it is a tradition, but fewer brought up their Inuit ancestry as a reason for bakeapple picking since most largely associated bakeapple picking with their Labradorian culture.<disp-quote><p id="Par56">&#x0201c;That&#x02019;s how our ancestors survived and it just got passed down from generation to generation.&#x0201d; Dwane Burdett</p></disp-quote>A minority of participants observed that families, especially the younger generation, are less engaged in bakeapple picking.<disp-quote><p id="Par57">&#x0201c;Like I said it is [bakeapple picking] getting done less and less.

Bakeapple pickers explained that variability in the timing and abundance of bakeapples is to be expected. Some bakeapple pickers observed that the timing of picking has been earlier in the past decade largely due to earlier warming temperatures in the spring and summer (see also Downing and Cuerrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>). Some interviewees described how tree and larger shrub growth has encroached on bakeapple patches. First Nation communities in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, Inuit communities in Nunavik, and Gwich&#x02019;in communities have also observed new shrub and tree species at berry picking spots (Parlee <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2005</xref>; Guyot <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2006</xref>; Cuerrier <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>). Participants also observed that the berries ripen in a more fragmented way, are less abundant and smaller compared to when they were younger. A couple of participants attributed these changes to climate change. Climate change and vegetation growth have likely contributed to the decrease in palsas at The Big Marsh, consistent with trends seen in other permafrost-associated peatlands (Christensen <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>; Johansson <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>; Bouchard <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). The observed fragmentation of bakeapple patches may also be related to changing permafrost conditions in bogs. From field surveys showing that vegetation types are significantly different across palsa and no permafrost plots, and from satellite imagery revealing a decrease in palsas, we can infer that with continued palsa degradation, the vegetation will change and eventually resemble the present vegetation of the surrounding no permafrost areas. One bakeapple picker from Cartwright attributed the fragmentation of bakeapple patches and less abundant bakeapples to more extremes in the weather, including precipitation. Other Indigenous communities note changes in the bakeapples themselves. First Nation communities have described precipitation that is resulting in smaller berries and less snow bringing fewer berries (Guyot <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2006</xref>). In a Gitga&#x02019;at community in British Colombia, residents explained that in recent years wild berries are scarce and attributed this to heavy rains (Turner and Clifton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par60">In Cartwright, bakeapple picking is tied to other harvesting activities, specifically fishing. Similarly, in Gwich&#x02019;in First Nation communities the harvest of berries and fish occur at the same time (Parlee <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2005</xref>). Other First Nation communities in British Colombia also harvest important plants, specifically edible seaweed, while fishing for salmon and halibut. As a result, any changes in the fishery have an impact on the harvesting of edible plants. In Cartwright resettlement impacted families&#x02019; land based livelihoods because it became more difficult for them to travel between their summer homes for fishing and berry picking and their winter homes. Similarly, resettlement programs also moved Inuit in Nunavut into permanent communities and ended their semi-nomadic way of living, which limited individuals&#x02019; ability to access hunting areas (Wenzel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2009</xref>) and reduced the extent of harvesting areas and the availability of country food (Ford and Beaumier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>). Resettlement, with subsequent sociocultural transformations, is an example of a slow variable that has resulted in a change in culture and livelihoods over the past half century in Indigenous northern communities (Chapin <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>; Ford <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par61">New technology has enabled Indigenous communities to continue living off the land despite social and environmental change. In Cartwright, owning a speedboat allows families to continue visiting bakeapple picking grounds. Similarly, the snowmobile allows individuals in Inuit communities in Nunavut to continue hunting despite living farther away from traditional hunting grounds (Wenzel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2009</xref>). In Arctic Bay, Inuit use GPS and online sea ice reports to navigate changes in sea ice conditions (Archer <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). Members of a Gitga&#x02019;at community in British Columbia created technology to dry their seaweed and fish despite increased precipitation (Turner and Clifton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par62">The market for bakeapples in Cartwright is a part of the adaptive capacity of the community in that it provides supplemental incomes and makes it more affordable for many families to continue bakeapple picking. Community members did not indicate that the market for bakeapples has threatened traditional sharing networks with family and friends. Similarly, Inuit communities in Greenland have had widespread positive experiences selling country food for 150&#x000a0;years (Ford <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>). In contrast, other Indigenous communities are concerned about the commercialization of traditional foods. For instance, in the Gwich&#x02019;in settlement region, communities are concerned that commercializing wild berries will complicate traditional sharing networks (Murray <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2005</xref>; Parlee <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2005</xref>). Similarly, some Inuit communities in Nunavut have expressed concerns about the commoditization of country food in terms of traditional sharing networks (Ford <italic>et al.</italic>

Other studies have documented the nutritional value that an Indigenous community in Alaska and an Inuit community in Nunavut also place on bakeapples (Downing and Cuerrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Kellogg <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>). However, there is concern in Cartwright that younger families spend less time or no time bakeapple picking. Other studies document similar concerns within Indigenous communities that traditional knowledge is not being passed to younger generations (Turner and Turner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2008</xref>; Beaumier <italic>et al.</italic>

The impacts of these environmental changes on families&#x02019; abilities to harvest bakeapples are magnified by socioeconomic impacts, including the closures of the inland fisheries and the resettlement program of the 1960s. However, the advent of the speedboat, the commercial market for bakeapples, the cultural and nutritional value families continue to place on bakeapples, and concerns with maintaining traditional cultural and ecological knowledge seem to reinforce families&#x02019; continued engagement in bakeapple picking.</p><p id="Par65">Contextual vulnerability to climate change encompasses not only the environmental impacts associated with climate change but the concurrent social, political, and economic processes that determine how a given community experiences climate change (Ford and Smit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>; Smit and Wandel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2006</xref>; O&#x02019;Brien <italic>et al.</italic>
