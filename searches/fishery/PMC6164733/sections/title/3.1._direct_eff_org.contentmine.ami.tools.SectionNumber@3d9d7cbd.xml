 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed rates and modelled projections indicate that warming over southern Africa is happening at twice the global rate [
  <a rid="B48-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-15-01884">48</a>]. Unless concerted international action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures may rise more than 4 °C over the southern African interior by 2100, with increases of more than 6 °C over large the western, central and northern parts of the country, which have faced several years of droughts [
  <a rid="B30-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-15-01884">30</a>,
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-15-01884">49</a>]. Relative to a 1981–2000 base period, the probability of summer heat waves over South Africa has increased by over 3.5 fold [
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-15-01884">50</a>]. Impacts of heat waves differ from the more insidious, but no less harmful, rises in heat that increasingly cause heat-related symptoms during Summer, but also in Spring and Autumn in some parts of the country [
  <a rid="B30-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-15-01884">30</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An analysis using national mortality and temperature data for each district of the country over 17 years found that temperature-related mortality (from cold or hot spells) accounts for 3.4% of deaths in South Africa [
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-15-01884">51</a>]. Those at extremes of age are most vulnerable, given their reduced thermoregulatory ability, as well as more limited mobility and resources to adjust to extreme temperatures. A study pooling data from Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg, calculated that for every 1 °C rise, overall mortality escalates by 1% and by 2% in those aged above 65 years [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-15-01884">52</a>]. Heat exposures also hold particular dangers for pregnant women and the developing foetus, a concern given the already high levels of maternal and infant mortality in the country [
  <a rid="B53-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-15-01884">53</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As temperatures rise, the levels of risk from occupational heat may increase from ‘low risk’ to ‘moderate or high risk’, especially in the mining, agriculture and outdoor service sectors [
  <a rid="B32-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-15-01884">32</a>]. A seminal study in the mid-20th century of &gt; 200,000 underground miners in South Africa reported a mortality rate of 3.3 deaths/year/1000 miners if the temperature exceeded 34 °C, compared to 0.7 deaths/year/1000 miners when temperatures were between 31 and 33 °C [
  <a rid="B55-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-15-01884">55</a>]. Outdoor workers in Upington, one of the hottest part of the country, frequently experience heat-related effects, including sunburn, sleeplessness, exhaustion and reduced productivity [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-15-01884">36</a>]. At the time of the study, few, if any, measures had been taken to reduce these effects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Impacts of heat in the domestic environment are also important to consider [
  <a rid="B56-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-ijerph-15-01884">56</a>]. Low-cost government-built housing in South Africa and informal settlement houses (mostly made of sheets of corrugated iron, bricks, wood and plastic) are poorly insulated against heat and cold. During hot weather these structures may be 4–5 °C warmer than outdoor temperatures and cooler during cold spells by the same magnitude [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-15-01884">39</a>,

  <a rid="B57-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57-ijerph-15-01884">57</a>]. Replacing informal settlement housing with formal brick and cement housing could reduce heat-related mortality by as much as a half [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-15-01884">40</a>]. Similarly, many school classrooms in the country are constructed of prefabricated asbestos sheeting with corrugated iron roofing, are overcrowded and lack ceiling fans [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-15-01884">23</a>]. Temperatures in these structures often exceed 30 °C and heat-health related symptoms are commonplace [
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-15-01884">23</a>]. Equally concerning is the evidence that temperatures in many waiting rooms in public-sector health facilities are dangerously high. A study of eight rural clinics found that the temperature in these clinics was as much as 4 °C higher than outdoors, reaching temperature ranges associated with heat-health impact warning categories of ‘caution’ and ‘extreme caution’ [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-15-01884">47</a>]. In addition, already vulnerable inner-city areas, such as Hillbrow, Johannesburg [
  <a rid="B58-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58-ijerph-15-01884">58</a>] constitute urban ‘heat islands’, where temperatures can exceed that of sub-urban areas by several degrees [
  <a rid="B59-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-ijerph-15-01884">59</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is also projected to increase the frequency and severity of storms and flooding in the country [
  <a rid="B60-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-ijerph-15-01884">60</a>]. The effects of these extend beyond mortality alone, and include injuries, food and water insecurity, spread of disease and mental health conditions [
