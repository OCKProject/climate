 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question of how to tackle the ecological determinants of health is poised to become the signature public health issue of the coming decade in South Africa, in much the same way that HIV took centre stage in the preceding decades. Rapid environmental changes are creating observable effects in multiple domains, from air quality, temperature and weather patterns, to food security and disease burden [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-15-01884">1</a>]. Ambient air pollution is estimated to have been responsible for 4% of deaths in South Africa in 2015 [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-15-01884">2</a>]. Even though there is some spatial variation in the warming signal, most of South Africa has experienced upward trends in temperature during the last half of the 20th century [

  <a rid="B4-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-15-01884">4</a>]. Food security is also under threat, with, for example, crop yields likely to decline in many parts of the country, accompanied by livestock losses [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-15-01884">5</a>]. Furthermore, it is now possible to detect changes in response to climate change in most terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems in the country [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In South Africa, despite policies promoting an ambitious renewable energy programme, the countryâ€™s response to climate change has been hampered by policy uncertainty and corruption, especially in the energy and transport sectors, and its health systems are ill-prepared for the effects of climate aberration [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-15-01884">10</a>]. The new National Climate Change Bill, which is currently open for public comment shows promise, however. Its provisions for coordination among different government departments have the potential to remove policy uncertainty, and align related policies [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This article summarises evidence of the impact of climate change on health in South Africa and highlights specific effects on vulnerable populations. The review covers the direct impacts on health through extreme events and temperature increases, but also the more indirect impacts mediated through natural systems (for example infectious diseases) and through social vulnerabilities [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-15-01884">12</a>]. While several narrative reviews have summed the impacts of climate change on health in South Africa [

  <a rid="B16-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-15-01884">16</a>], there is a need to review more up to date literature and to collate evidence in a systematic manner.
