 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Medline (PubMed) and Web of Science were searched on 8 August 2018 (
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-15-01884" href="#app1-ijerph-15-01884">Supplementary File 1</a>: review protocol). The PubMed search strategy included free text terms and MeSH codes, specifically: (((((“South Africa”[MeSH]) OR (“South Africa”[Title/Abstract]) OR (“Southern Africa*“[Title/Abstract]))) AND “last 10 years”[PDat])) AND (((“global warming”[Title/Abstract] OR “global warming”[MeSH] OR climatic*[Title/Abstract] OR “climate change”[Title/Abstract] OR “climate change”[MeSH] OR “Desert Climate”[MeSH] OR “El Nino-Southern Oscillation”[MeSH] OR Microclimate[MeSH] OR “Tropical Climate”[MeSH])). A total of 820 titles and abstracts were screened by a single reviewer after removal of 34 duplicate items (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To be included, articles had to describe the impact of climate change on health in South Africa. All study designs were eligible, including modelling studies, narrative and systematic reviews, case studies, case series and qualitative research. We excluded articles that were not in English (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 3), only covered animals or plants (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 343), were not on South Africa (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 270), were unrelated to health (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 47) or climate change (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 55), or were on climate change adaptation (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 38) or mitigation (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 30). We then screened full text articles for eligibility (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 86), of which 34 were included. We then extracted data on the characteristics of the included articles (
  <a rid="ijerph-15-01884-t001" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-15-01884-t001">Table 1</a>). The findings presented in each included article were used to draft the text of the review. We also included additional articles located through searches of article references or through targeted internet searches for policy documents, for example.
