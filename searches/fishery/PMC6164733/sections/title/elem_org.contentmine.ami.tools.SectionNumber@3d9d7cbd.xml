 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When climate change is framed as a predominately a health issue, rather than purely as an environmental, economic, or technological challenge, it becomes clear that South Africa is facing major challenges. Health puts a human face on what can sometimes seem to be a distant threat [
  <a rid="B84-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84-ijerph-15-01884">84</a>]. Through a deeper engagement with the topic, health professionals, hitherto fringe players, could lead the way in identifying impacts of climate change, addressing these and pushing for mitigation against further deterioration. Without these interventions, climate change will likely worsen the country’s existing socioeconomic and health inequities [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-15-01884">22</a>]. A step-change is required in the country’s response if it is to meet its commitments to the Sustainable Development Goal 2, which includes improved food security and improved nutrition, and sustainable agriculture [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is significant that very few studies were identified in our review used empirical data from health services to analyze the impact of climate change. More effective use of surveillance and research data are required to monitor climate change impacts on human health in South Africa, and to then bring these findings to the attention of policy makers and the public. The considerable human resources dedicated to health research in the country have yet to turn their attention to climate change [
  <a rid="B38-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-15-01884">38</a>]. Equally, many of the leaders in climate change research globally are South African, but they have yet to focus on climate change and health [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-15-01884">15</a>]. A few carefully targeted funding opportunities may help to induce these shifts (
  <a ref-type="boxed-text" rid="ijerph-15-01884-box001" href="#ijerph-15-01884-box001">Box 1</a>), especially if driven by a proactive inter-sectoral research agenda applying a full spectrum of research methodology, from modelling to social science enquiry. Notably, the review included only one qualitative research paper [
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-15-01884">31</a>]. Perhaps most importantly, additional detection and attribution studies are needed in South Africa, documenting the extent to which changes in health can be attributed to climate change [
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-15-01884">51</a>,
  <a rid="B85-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-15-01884">85</a>]. These studies can inform risk management and planning for future changes, but require reliable long-term data sets, and more knowledge about the factors that confound and modify the effects of climate on health [

    <span class="italic">Key Research</span> 
    <span class="italic">Priorities</span>:
   </div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. Examine the interface between climate change and HIV,
    identifying possibilities for a joined-up, synergistic, evidence-based
    response to climate-HIV interactions.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. Attribution and detection studies that use long-term,
    multi-decadal climate data to document and project long-term trends in health
    outcomes. Most such work has focused on malaria, with substantial gaps in
    data on diarrheal diseases, for example. Predicting other emerging infectious
    diseases with more complex environmental determinants remains a significant
    challenge.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. Document the heat impacts on vulnerable groups, such
    as infants and the elderly, and interactions between heat and poor air
    quality in occupational and domestic settings.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. Understand heat exposure in occupational settings in
    South Africa and develop interventions to reduce health-health, especially
    for miners, agricultural workers and those providing outdoor services.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. Investigate the effects of climate change on mental
    health, especially among vulnerable population groups.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. Identify the indirect impacts of a changing climate on
    food security and other social determinants of health.</p>
  </sec>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, the measurement and communication of the impact of climate change could be improved by drawing on the considerable policy, research, advocacy and communication expertise built up during the HIV response in South Africa. By becoming proficient communicators on the subject of climate change, health professionals could provide clear messaging on risks and actions required during extreme weather, for example. Just as critical is the need for health professionals to use their considerable influence to advocate for policy change and improved climate governance. The overarching priority ultimately is to enact policies to shift the country away from a coal-dependent energy system and economy, and to encourage the public to question its seemingly boundless desire for economic growth and consumer goods. This requires honest reflection on whether South Africans can ‘develop the enhanced moral imagination to motivate doing better and more with less, in time to effect meaningful change’ [
  <a rid="B87-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-ijerph-15-01884">87</a>]. It is time for the health sector to position itself at the core of such changes.
