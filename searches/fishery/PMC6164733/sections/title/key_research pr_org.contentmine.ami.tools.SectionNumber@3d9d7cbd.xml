  <span class="italic">Priorities</span>:
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. Examine the interface between climate change and HIV,
  identifying possibilities for a joined-up, synergistic, evidence-based
  response to climate-HIV interactions.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. Attribution and detection studies that use long-term,
  multi-decadal climate data to document and project long-term trends in health
  outcomes. Most such work has focused on malaria, with substantial gaps in
  data on diarrheal diseases, for example. Predicting other emerging infectious
  diseases with more complex environmental determinants remains a significant
  challenge.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. Document the heat impacts on vulnerable groups, such
  as infants and the elderly, and interactions between heat and poor air
  quality in occupational and domestic settings.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. Understand heat exposure in occupational settings in
  South Africa and develop interventions to reduce health-health, especially
  for miners, agricultural workers and those providing outdoor services.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. Investigate the effects of climate change on mental
  health, especially among vulnerable population groups.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. Identify the indirect impacts of a changing climate on
  food security and other social determinants of health.</p>
