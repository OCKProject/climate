 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature increases have sizable implications for the transmission of vector-borne diseases. Rises in temperature as well as precipitation changes have been linked with malaria spikes, especially in Limpopo province [

  <a rid="B33-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-15-01884">33</a>]. These spikes often occur around two months after warmer temperatures and high precipitation have occurred in neighboring countries [
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-15-01884">28</a>]. The projected changes in climate in South Africa will favor the survival of the malaria vector 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles arabiensis</span>, while its distribution may decline in many other parts of Africa [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-15-01884">19</a>,

  <a rid="B43-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-15-01884">43</a>]. The effects of climate variability are especially notable with Rift Valley Fever, which mostly affects the semi-desert Karoo biomes during strong La Nina years, but then during El Nino episodes shifts to the central grassland areas of South Africa [

  <a rid="B62-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-15-01884">62</a>]. Changes in the distribution of the disease vectors 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Aedes albopictus</span> have raised the likelihood of transmission of dengue fever, Zika and other infections in the region [
  <a rid="B61-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-ijerph-15-01884">61</a>]. The Avian influenza epidemic in South Africa in 2017, attributed, in part, to climate change, [
  <a rid="B63-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-15-01884">63</a>] threatens poultry food sources, among other things. Warming may also alter the distribution, breeding and survival of the snail species implicated in schistosomiasis, whose choice of habitat is highly sensitive to water temperature [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Importantly, climate change impacts on the persistence and dispersal of water- and food-borne pathogens in a myriad of ways. Droughts and high precipitation worsen water quality, and hamper hand washing and other hygiene practices [
  <a rid="B64-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-15-01884">64</a>,
  <a rid="B65-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijerph-15-01884">65</a>]. Bacterial pathogens multiply faster in higher temperatures, which also can result in breakdowns in food cooling chains. A study in children under-five in Cape Town noted that a 5 °C rise in minimum weekly temperatures increased cases of diarrhoea by 40% one week thereafter [
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-15-01884">37</a>]. These findings echo a similar study in Limpopo [
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-15-01884">42</a>]. An escalation in sea-surface temperature was linked to a cholera outbreak in 2000–2001 in KwaZulu-Natal, possibly stemming from an increased abundance of phytoplankton and thus higher numbers of copepods (small crustaceans commensal to cholera) that feed on these organisms [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Listeria monocytogenes, recently responsible for a major epidemic across South Africa, appears to be particularly climate sensitive, with occurrences rising with temperature spikes [
