  <div class="title">Maps for the three cases in this study where a significant change in the center of gravity was accompanied by a significant decrease in inertia.</div>
  <p>Centers of gravity (left) and inertia (right) for Georges Bank yellowtail flounder at five year intervals in the spring, 1970–2015 (upper), and in the fall, 1965–2015 (middle); and Southern New England-Mid Atlantic yellowtail flounder in the spring, 1970–2015 (lower). Closed Area II and the Hague Line are also shown in the upper and middle panels. Due to the tight grouping of the centers of gravity in the lower left panel the year labels are shown in the inset plot. Year labels for both stocks are truncated where necessary for clarity.</p>
