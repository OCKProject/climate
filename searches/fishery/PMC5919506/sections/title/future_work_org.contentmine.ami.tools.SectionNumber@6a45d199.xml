 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two unresolved issues in this study suggest avenues for future analyses. First, a plausible mechanism for the relationship between relative 
  <span class="italic">F</span> and spatial distribution needs to be elucidated. For example, if fishing were concentrated in the south of the stock distribution, this would result in a shift in the overall stock distribution to the north. However, fishing is not evenly distributed across the stock distribution for all sorts of reasons such as density of fish, distance from port, bycatch of other species, etc. Thus, an increase in 
  <span class="italic">F</span> should result in a change in distribution, although one could probably not predict 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> how the distribution would change unless the fishery was specifically focused on only one region. The second unresolved question is the reliability of the PA as an area occupancy measure, as a zero may represent a low probability of capture rather than true absence from this area [
  <a rid="pone.0196583.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196583.ref047">47</a>]. Thus the relationships found in this study should be verified with alternative area occupancy measures such as the minimum area containing a specified percentage of population biomass.
