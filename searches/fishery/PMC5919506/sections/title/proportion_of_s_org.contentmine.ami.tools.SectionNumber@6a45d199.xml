 <div class="title">Proportion of stocks for which a variable was the most important predictor, by spatial indicator.</div>
 <p>Spatial indicators and associated units are: geographically referenced longitude and latitude of the center of gravity (XCG and YCG, respectively; km), inertia (km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), depth (m) and positive area (PA; km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). Predictor variables are: Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) bottom trawl survey stratified mean kg per tow (biomass; kg), catch/NEFSC stratified mean kg per tow (relative 
  <span class="italic">F</span>) and NEFSC stratified mean bottom temperature (Â°C). Proportions may not sum to one in the case of ties.
