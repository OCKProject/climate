 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishing pressure was the most important predictor of the CG for the majority of stocks in the spring, whereas in the fall this was restricted to the east-west component. Fishing pressure was also the most important predictor of the dispersion around the CG in both spring and fall. While climate indices were not considered in this study, our results clearly show that fishing pressure, in addition to the previously established role of climate [
  <a rid="pone.0196583.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196583.ref006">6</a>], affects the spatial distribution of groundfish in the Northwest Atlantic. In the North Sea both fishing mortality and climate have an effect on the CG and depth indices for sole [

  <a rid="pone.0196583.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196583.ref012">12</a>]. More broadly, the demersal fish community in the North Sea has changed over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries in response to both climate and fishing pressure [
  <a rid="pone.0196583.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196583.ref045">45</a>]. Finally, synergistic effects have also been shown, such that fishing pressure increases the climatic sensitivity of larval fishes in the California Current ecosystem [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biomass was the most important predictor of area occupancy for both cod stocks, southern silver hake, and both yellowtail flounder stocks in spring and fall. This confirms previous analyses that have shown similar relationships for cod and yellowtail flounder in Canadian waters [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bottom temperature was the most important predictor in the fewest number of cases. This general lack of a temperature effect is consistent with Nye et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0196583.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196583.ref006">6</a>], who found that distributional shifts in the Northwest Atlantic were associated with large scale warming and climatic conditions, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, rather than annual temperature measures
