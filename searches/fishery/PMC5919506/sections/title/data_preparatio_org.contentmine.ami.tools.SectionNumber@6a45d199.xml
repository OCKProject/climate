  <a rid="pone.0196583.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0196583.ref022">22</a>]. This was done by setting the minimum longitude and latitude of the strata for each stock as (0, 0) and converting all coordinates to kilometers. The cosine of the midpoint latitude for each stock was used to convert longitude. This process is also known as geographical referencing [
