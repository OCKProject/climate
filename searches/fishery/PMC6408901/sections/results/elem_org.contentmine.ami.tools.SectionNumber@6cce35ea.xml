  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we successfully apply a framework for assessing social-ecological vulnerability to a major climate change impact at the country or territory scale across many jurisdictions. Synthesizing island-level data on ecological and socio-economic indicators related to reef fisheries and marine tourism, we find considerable variability in the ecological and socio-economic components of vulnerability across the Caribbean (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182365F3" href="#RSPB20182365F3">figure 3</a>). With the exception of Haiti, the islands of the Greater Antilles and larger islands of the Lesser Antilles (e.g. Dominica, St. Lucia, and Grenada) have lower social-ecological vulnerability than other islands. Across the study area, there is low but significant spatial autocorrelation in ecological exposure and recovery potential, socio-economic adaptive capacity and composite social-ecological vulnerability (electronic supplementary material, table S20), with high and low values more spatially clustered than would be expected to occur randomly. Despite this geographical clustering, the components are measuring distinct aspects of vulnerability, as we found no significant correlations between the three ecological components or the three socio-economic components (electronic supplementary material, table S21). The spread in scores across islands is greatest for socio-economic sensitivity (coefficient of variation = 48), followed by ecological sensitivity (CV = 32), and socio-economic adaptive capacity (CV = 26; electronic supplementary material, table S22). Overall, there is greater spread across the islands in socio-economic than ecological variables (electronic supplementary material, table S23), thus driving more variation for the socio-economic compared to the ecological components of vulnerability.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite a common focus in the literature on exposure to bleaching conditions as the most important driver of vulnerability, islands' social-ecological vulnerability ranks are often inconsistent with their ecological exposure ranks (electronic supplementary material, table S24). Furthermore, some islands have fairly consistent rankings across the different components of vulnerability (e.g. St. Kitts and Nevis and Dominica), whereas others do not. For example, St. Barthelemy has low scores for ecological exposure and ecological sensitivity, but high socio-economic sensitivity and low ecological recovery potential and socio-economic adaptive capacity, leading to its ranking as among the most vulnerable islands overall (electronic supplementary material, table S24). Examining how potential ecological and socio-economic impact (exposure plus sensitivity) relate to ecological recovery potential and adaptive capacity, respectively (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182365F4" href="#RSPB20182365F4">figure 4</a>), we find that some islands occur in the same quadrant of both graphs (e.g. Haiti and Saba are highly vulnerable in ecological and socio-economic dimensions). Islands in the southern Caribbean (Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, and Trinidad and Tobago) have some of the highest scores for ecological recovery potential, while Haiti and the Dutch territories have among the lowest scores for adaptive capacity (electronic supplementary material, table S24). Aside from Haiti, the islands with the highest potential for socio-economic impact and the lowest adaptive capacity are all overseas territories (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182365F4" href="#RSPB20182365F4">figure 4</a>).

      <span class="italic">b</span>). High potential impacts indicate a system with high exposure and/or sensitivity to bleaching, while high recovery potential or adaptive capacity indicates that a system is able to respond to changes. Islands in the lower left quadrant have the lowest vulnerability (low potential impact and high recovery potential/adaptive capacity); islands in the upper right quadrant have the highest vulnerability. Sovereign islands are dark grey circles, while territories are light grey triangles.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the many factors that could potentially influence social-ecological vulnerability at the island scale, we identify aspects of governance and resource management that are significant predictors of some components of vulnerability, explaining 47% of the variation in overall social-ecological vulnerability and 41% and 46% of the variation in socio-economic sensitivity and adaptive capacity, respectively (
   <a rid="RSPB20182365TB1" ref-type="table" href="#RSPB20182365TB1">table 1</a>). An island's fisheries regulation score (an index of the number of regulations in place that control fishing effort or reduce fishing pressure on key species or life-history stages) and its status as an independent state are negatively related to its social-ecological vulnerability, suggesting that fishing regulations and sovereignty reduce an island's overall vulnerability (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). Socio-economic sensitivity is positively related to an island's mean Worldwide Governance Index (WGI) score, a measure of the quality of governance that includes levels of participation, stability, effectiveness, and corruption. Islands that have higher fisheries regulation scores have reduced socio-economic sensitivity and higher socio-economic adaptive capacity. Somewhat surprisingly, despite the frequent promotion of MPAs as a means of increasing resilience to climate impacts, we do not find the percentage of an island's coral reefs occurring within MPAs to be an important modifier of vulnerability, although it may have a small negative relationship with ecological sensitivity (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">WGI scores and sovereign status explain 37% and 38% of ecological exposure and socio-economic exposure, respectively: islands that are territories and those with higher WGI scores have lower exposure. We do not detect strong relationships between any of the covariates and ecological sensitivity or ecological recovery potential (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> for best-fit models ≤ 0.1). We also ran the model for social-ecological vulnerability without the WGI as a covariate because the WGI is not available for all islands; that model produced similar results but explained less of the variation in social-ecological vulnerability (
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.30).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that islands that are independent nations are less vulnerable than overseas territories in several dimensions. Independent nations have significantly lower mean socio-economic sensitivity, higher socio-economic adaptive capacity, and lower overall social-ecological vulnerability to coral bleaching compared to territories (Kruskal–Wallis: mean
   <sub>Independent</sub> = 0.07, mean
   <sub>Territory</sub> = 0.26, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01), despite having greater ecological and socio-economic exposure (electronic supplementary material, table S26). Examining the underlying mechanism(s) that may be causing this result, independent islands rely on reef-based tourism for lower proportions of their economic productivity as measured by GDP (mean
   <sub>Independent</sub> = 0.03, mean
   <sub>Territory</sub> = 0.11, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) and have less on-island consumption of domestically landed fish (mean
   <sub>Independent</sub> = 0.88, mean
   <sub>Territory</sub> = 0.93, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01; electronic supplementary material, table S26). Independent islands are also more likely to have fisheries monitoring programmes (
   <span class="italic">χ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 6.8, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) and climate change adaptation plans (
   <span class="italic">χ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 11.9, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). The difference in social-ecological vulnerability between independent islands and territories is highlighted by the finding that the 12 islands with the highest socio-economic sensitivity scores are all territories and eight out of the 10 lowest socio-economic adaptive capacity scores belong to territories (electronic supplementary material, table S24). Although territories tend to be smaller islands with lower human populations, these attributes do not explain the differences in social-ecological vulnerability. Island area and population size, when included as covariates, were not significant and did not improve the model (electronic supplementary material, table S27). However, island population explains 28% of the variation in watershed-based sedimentation, pollution, and nutrient enrichment, implying that the link between independent status and increased ecological exposure may relate to higher populations on independent islands (see the electronic supplementary material for details on these models).
