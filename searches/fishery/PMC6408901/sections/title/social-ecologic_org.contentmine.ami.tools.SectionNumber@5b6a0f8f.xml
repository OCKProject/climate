 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated a composite social-ecological vulnerability score for each island as the sum of socio-economic exposure (equivalent to ecological vulnerability, rescaled to range from 0 to 1) and socio-economic sensitivity, minus socio-economic adaptive capacity. The sum of socio-economic exposure and socio-economic sensitivity represents the potential socio-economic impact. Scores for each component of ecological and socio-economic vulnerability could range from 0 to 1, and thus social-ecological vulnerability could range from âˆ’1 to 2. We ranked the islands by each component of social-ecological vulnerability. We also tested for spatial autocorrelation in each component of vulnerability using Moran's
