  <a rid="RSPB20182365C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C2">2</a>], and coral reef systems, including those in the Caribbean, may be particularly at risk of climate change impacts [

  <a rid="RSPB20182365C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C6">6</a>]. The predicted temperature increase in the Caribbean by the end of the century is approximately 2–3°C [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C7" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C7">7</a>], with more frequent and widespread bleaching events expected [

  <a rid="RSPB20182365C10" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C10">10</a>]. Additionally, many Caribbean reefs are already degraded, potentially making them more vulnerable to future climate pressures [

  <a rid="RSPB20182365C12" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C12">12</a>]. Changes to the natural system will impact human communities, as people rely on healthy reefs for services including seafood, tourism, and coastal protection [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C13">13</a>]. However, the effects of climate impacts on both the ecological and social components of reef systems are complex. For example, ecological vulnerability will impact socio-economic exposure to climate-induced threats; ecological systems can demonstrate both fragility and remarkable recovery potential; and social systems can vary considerably in their sensitivity and adaptive capacity [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C14">14</a>]. As a result, social-ecological vulnerability will vary across space at a range of scales, although we do not have a good understanding of the spatial patterns and drivers of this variability for Caribbean reefs [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C15" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C15">15</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We define social-ecological vulnerability to climate change as the degree to which a system, including both natural and human components, is susceptible to and unable to cope with the adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes [

The literature on assessing social-ecological vulnerability includes new approaches to operationalize theory with quantitative assessments and proposes improvements to the widely adopted Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability framework [

  <a rid="RSPB20182365C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C24">24</a>]. However, existing assessments focus on small spatial scales and/or examine impacts on single economic sectors (e.g. fisheries), with an emphasis on ecological resilience [

  <a rid="RSPB20182365C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C30">30</a>]. Few studies have assessed social-ecological vulnerability over scales spanning multiple national jurisdictions (but see noteworthy exceptions [

  <a rid="RSPB20182365C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C32">32</a>]). Regional-scale assessments are required to address open questions about how vulnerability varies across countries within a region [

  <a rid="RSPB20182365C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C34">34</a>], which factors drive social-ecological vulnerability at the country scale, and whether national-level policies focused on changes to natural resource management or governance can modify vulnerability [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C18">18</a>]. These questions are of particular relevance in the Caribbean, given expected spatial variation in vulnerability stemming from differing reef conditions and exposure to climate threats, as well as ongoing regional initiatives to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, such as the Caribbean Biodiversity Fund (
  <span xlink:href="https://www.caribbeanbiodiversityfund.org/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.caribbeanbiodiversityfund.org/</span>) and the Caribbean Community's Climate Change Centre (
  <span xlink:href="https://www.caribbeanclimate.bz/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.caribbeanclimate.bz/</span>). The many jurisdictions in the Caribbean also vary in their socio-economic characteristics and dependence on reef resources and take distinct approaches to conservation, marine resource management, and ocean governance [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assess variability in the vulnerability of Caribbean coastal social-ecological systems to climate change-induced coral bleaching, a global phenomenon that disrupts the functioning of coral reef social-ecological systems. We focus on impacts to reef fisheries and marine tourism, comparing levels of ecological, socio-economic, and composite social-ecological vulnerability across the region at the island scale. Our assessment follows a modified IPCC framework, developing five quantitative indicators of vulnerability: (i) ecological exposure (to conditions that cause coral bleaching), (ii) ecological sensitivity (of the dominant coral taxa to bleaching conditions and of fished species to coral loss), (iii) ecological recovery potential of reef ecosystems, (iv) socio-economic sensitivity (based on economic dependence on reef fisheries and tourism), and (v) socio-economic adaptive capacity (defined as an island community's ability to adapt to environmental change or transform itself [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C18">18</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C35">35</a>], assessed using proxies for livelihood diversification and learning, social organization, and the ability to detect and adapt to environmental change). We assess these indicators using existing data and scientific literature from 30 nations and territories (territories include overseas regions, departments, and collectivities associated with other sovereign nations) in the insular Caribbean (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182365F1" href="#RSPB20182365F1">figure 1</a>). We combine these five components into a composite index of vulnerability [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C21">21</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C28">28</a>] (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182365F2" href="#RSPB20182365F2">figure 2</a>) and evaluate which components of the index most influence spatial patterns of vulnerability in the Caribbean. We then assess whether attributes commonly cited as potential mechanisms to mitigate climate vulnerability—specifically, governance characteristics, marine protected area (MPA) coverage, and fisheries management—explain variation in vulnerability to bleaching across the Caribbean. This research addresses important gaps in the literature including: assessing social-ecological vulnerability at larger spatial scales than most previous studies (e.g. the insular Caribbean); identifying policy-relevant governance and management factors that may influence island-scale vulnerability; and developing and compiling an unprecedented array of ecological and social indicator data for the Caribbean.
