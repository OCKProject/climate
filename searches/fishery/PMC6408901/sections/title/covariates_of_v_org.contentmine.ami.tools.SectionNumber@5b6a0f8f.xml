 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the many factors that could potentially influence social-ecological vulnerability at the island scale, we identify aspects of governance and resource management that are significant predictors of some components of vulnerability, explaining 47% of the variation in overall social-ecological vulnerability and 41% and 46% of the variation in socio-economic sensitivity and adaptive capacity, respectively (
  <a rid="RSPB20182365TB1" ref-type="table" href="#RSPB20182365TB1">table 1</a>). An island's fisheries regulation score (an index of the number of regulations in place that control fishing effort or reduce fishing pressure on key species or life-history stages) and its status as an independent state are negatively related to its social-ecological vulnerability, suggesting that fishing regulations and sovereignty reduce an island's overall vulnerability (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). Socio-economic sensitivity is positively related to an island's mean Worldwide Governance Index (WGI) score, a measure of the quality of governance that includes levels of participation, stability, effectiveness, and corruption. Islands that have higher fisheries regulation scores have reduced socio-economic sensitivity and higher socio-economic adaptive capacity. Somewhat surprisingly, despite the frequent promotion of MPAs as a means of increasing resilience to climate impacts, we do not find the percentage of an island's coral reefs occurring within MPAs to be an important modifier of vulnerability, although it may have a small negative relationship with ecological sensitivity (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">WGI scores and sovereign status explain 37% and 38% of ecological exposure and socio-economic exposure, respectively: islands that are territories and those with higher WGI scores have lower exposure. We do not detect strong relationships between any of the covariates and ecological sensitivity or ecological recovery potential (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> for best-fit models ≤ 0.1). We also ran the model for social-ecological vulnerability without the WGI as a covariate because the WGI is not available for all islands; that model produced similar results but explained less of the variation in social-ecological vulnerability (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.30).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that islands that are independent nations are less vulnerable than overseas territories in several dimensions. Independent nations have significantly lower mean socio-economic sensitivity, higher socio-economic adaptive capacity, and lower overall social-ecological vulnerability to coral bleaching compared to territories (Kruskal–Wallis: mean
  <sub>Independent</sub> = 0.07, mean
  <sub>Territory</sub> = 0.26, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01), despite having greater ecological and socio-economic exposure (electronic supplementary material, table S26). Examining the underlying mechanism(s) that may be causing this result, independent islands rely on reef-based tourism for lower proportions of their economic productivity as measured by GDP (mean
  <sub>Independent</sub> = 0.03, mean
  <sub>Territory</sub> = 0.11, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) and have less on-island consumption of domestically landed fish (mean
  <sub>Independent</sub> = 0.88, mean
  <sub>Territory</sub> = 0.93, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01; electronic supplementary material, table S26). Independent islands are also more likely to have fisheries monitoring programmes (
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 6.8, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) and climate change adaptation plans (
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 11.9, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). The difference in social-ecological vulnerability between independent islands and territories is highlighted by the finding that the 12 islands with the highest socio-economic sensitivity scores are all territories and eight out of the 10 lowest socio-economic adaptive capacity scores belong to territories (electronic supplementary material, table S24). Although territories tend to be smaller islands with lower human populations, these attributes do not explain the differences in social-ecological vulnerability. Island area and population size, when included as covariates, were not significant and did not improve the model (electronic supplementary material, table S27). However, island population explains 28% of the variation in watershed-based sedimentation, pollution, and nutrient enrichment, implying that the link between independent status and increased ecological exposure may relate to higher populations on independent islands (see the electronic supplementary material for details on these models).
