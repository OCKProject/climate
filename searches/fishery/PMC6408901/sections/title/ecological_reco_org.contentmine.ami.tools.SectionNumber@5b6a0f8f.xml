  <span class="italic">Diadema antillarum</span> (sea urchin) density, and the species richness of reef fish and hard corals. The data on coral and macroalgal cover, Scaridae biomass, and 
  <span class="italic">Diadema</span> density came from reef survey data in published papers, grey literature, and government- and volunteer-monitoring programmes, and we filled data gaps using ecoregional averages (electronic supplementary material, table S5). We scaled Scaridae biomass values by dividing by a representative unfished biomass value for the region of 47 g m

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assembled data on coral species richness from recent surveys, using ecoregional averages to fill in gaps (electronic supplementary material, table S6). We used reef fish species richness data reported in a biogeographic analysis and used the derived linear relationship between island area and reef fish species richness to fill gaps (electronic supplementary material, equation (S4) and table S7). We rescaled the values of coral and reef fish species richness by dividing each island's value by the total number of species in each category found across the 30 islands. For the composite index of ecological recovery potential, we inverted algal cover values and then averaged the six variables for each island.</p>
