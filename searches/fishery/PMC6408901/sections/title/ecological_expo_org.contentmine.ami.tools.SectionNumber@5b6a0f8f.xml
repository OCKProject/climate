 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Variation in environmental factors drives spatial variation in exposure to bleaching conditions. We calculated the exposure of each island's coral reefs using a spatial model of environmental conditions that may trigger (e.g. sea surface temperature, solar radiation) and mitigate (e.g. tidal amplitude) bleaching [

To account for the role of sedimentation and land-based pollution and nutrient enrichment in increasing the incidence of bleaching, we calculated the average relative risk of water quality issues for the reefs of each island and used this value as a multiplier (ranging from 1 for islands with very low exposure to watershed-based threats to 1.4 for islands with high exposure to this threat) to modify the ecological exposure score [
