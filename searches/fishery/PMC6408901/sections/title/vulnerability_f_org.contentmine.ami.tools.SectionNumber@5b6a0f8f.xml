 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The IPCC has historically defined vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C17">17</a>]. This definition was revised in 2012 to categorize exposure as a factor distinct from vulnerability that contributes to the risk of experiencing impacts from climate change [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C59" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C59">59</a>]; here, we include exposure as a factor contributing to vulnerability to make our framework and results comparable with past assessments of other relevant aspects of climate vulnerability and to reflect the potential for significant differences in exposure to the biophysical conditions that can cause bleaching events throughout the Caribbean region. We operationalized this definition to estimate socio-economic and ecological vulnerability, drawing from existing frameworks [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C28" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C28">28</a>,

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182365F2" href="#RSPB20182365F2">figureÂ 2</a>). We selected indicators for the components of vulnerability based on scientific theory and evidence, bounded by the availability of recent, comparable data across all islands, as described in the electronic supplementary material. We also examined how different aspects of marine resource management might explain variation in social-ecological vulnerability.
