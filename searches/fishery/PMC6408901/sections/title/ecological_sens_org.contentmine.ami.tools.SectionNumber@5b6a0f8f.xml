 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed two indicators: first, we estimated the sensitivity of the dominant hard coral species to bleaching to assess ecosystem sensitivity based on the key habitat-forming species. We identified the most abundant coral taxa in each island from reef surveys that occurred after the region-wide 2005 bleaching event [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C4">4</a>] and used a taxon-specific bleaching response index (BRI) [
  <a rid="RSPB20182365C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20182365C43">43</a>] to calculate the island-level coral sensitivity score as the average of the BRIs from the most abundant coral taxa, with BRI scores ranging from 0 to 1 (higher values represent higher bleaching impacts) (electronic supplementary material, table S2). Second, we estimated the sensitivity to bleaching impacts of the fish and invertebrate species targeted in each island's fisheries to assess the ecological components most directly valued by local communities. We identified the taxa that accounted for at least 10% of cumulative landings from 2005 to 2014, calculated a sensitivity index for each taxon based on habitat usage and adult home range size (electronic supplementary material, table S3), summed each target taxon sensitivity score after it was multiplied by its proportion of the catch (electronic supplementary material, table S4) and then inverted the scores so that higher values indicated greater sensitivity. We averaged island scores for coral and target species sensitivity into a composite index of ecological sensitivity.
