  <p>Potential ecological impacts (ecological exposure plus ecological sensitivity) versus recovery potential (
   <span class="italic">a</span>), and potential socio-economic impacts (i.e. socio-economic exposure and socio-economic sensitivity) versus adaptive capacity (
   <span class="italic">b</span>). High potential impacts indicate a system with high exposure and/or sensitivity to bleaching, while high recovery potential or adaptive capacity indicates that a system is able to respond to changes. Islands in the lower left quadrant have the lowest vulnerability (low potential impact and high recovery potential/adaptive capacity); islands in the upper right quadrant have the highest vulnerability. Sovereign islands are dark grey circles, while territories are light grey triangles.
