 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In many coastal marine reserves, biological data are often collected via underwater visual censuses as part of a reserve’s monitoring program. Scientific divers record fish and invertebrate richness and abundances, as well as fish total length along belt transects. Ecological surveys are typically performed annually in each reserve and corresponding control site(s), before and after the implementation of the reserve, providing a sampling design that can be used to draw causal inference. Control sites are areas where habitat is similar to that of the reserve, but with presence of fishing activity; in principle these are areas that are otherwise observationally identical to the reserve site, but where, for presumably random reasons, a reserve was not implemented. While transect dimensions (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span> length and width) and sampling methods might vary from study to study, the general idea remains the same: richness, abundances, and sizes of organisms are recorded in a study–specific standardized way. For this reason, MAREA does not assume specific transect dimensions, and pertinent indicators are calculated per transect (

  <span class="italic">D</span>; in m). 
  <span class="italic">ϵ</span> represents the error term associated to the regression. Here, years are modeled as factors, using the first year as the reference level. This does not impose a linear structure in the way an indicator changes through time (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the change in biomass between 2006 and 2007 does not have to be the same as the change between 2015 and 2016). The treatment and implementation variables, modeled as dummy variables, are coded as Control = 0 and Reserve = 1; and Before implementation = 0 and After implementation = 1, respectively.
