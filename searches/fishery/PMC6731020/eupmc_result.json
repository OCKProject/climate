    "Recreational fishing practices can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems but their catch dynamics are often difficult to quantify, particularly for spearfishing. On coral reefs, the impacts of recreational spearfishing are often considered to be negligible compared to other practices, but the highly selective method adopted by spearfishers can result in locally distinct ecological consequences. Here we investigated the spatial patterns and catch composition of recreational spearfishers on the Great Barrier Reef using an online survey (n = 141 participants) targeted at spearfishers active along the coastline of Queensland. Observations from within the Queensland spearfishing community were also used to explore perceived changes in catches of three functionally distinct spearing targets. Preferred reef regions (coastal, inshore, offshore) differed among spearfishers from Bundaberg (south) to Cooktown (north). The piscivorous coral trout, Plectropomus leopardus, was suggested to be the preferred target comprising 34% (Â±1.5 SE) of spearfishers' reported catch composition. Spearfishers also noted a variety of changes in their catch composition over time, particularly regarding parrotfishes (decreased landings) and tuskfishes (increased landings). How this relates to the relative abundance and population biology of these taxa on the Great Barrier Reef requires attention. Spearfishers can provide important information regarding the status of their fishery through direct observations, which can inform legislation when acknowledged."
