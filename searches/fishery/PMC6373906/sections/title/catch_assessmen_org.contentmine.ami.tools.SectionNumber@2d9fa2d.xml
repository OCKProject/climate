 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catch assessment records were acquired from WCS-Kenya, which has collected data on landed fish from 25 landing sites since 1995 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211224.g001" href="#pone.0211224.g001">Fig 1</a>). Fishing is typically conducted from the shore to the outer reef in sand, coral, and seagrass habitats of the fringing reef lagoon [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref040">40</a>]. WCS-Kenya catch records classified 185 landed fish to the species level. The landing site, date, gear used, number of individuals per species, and standard lengths were recorded [

  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref051">51</a>]. A total of 278 days and 25 locations were sampled over the 18-year period. These data were extracted and used to aid in construction of species occurrence during the contemporary period. From these records, we extracted information on the presence of each historically-exploited species (species that were exploited between 750-1500CE) and the recorded year.
