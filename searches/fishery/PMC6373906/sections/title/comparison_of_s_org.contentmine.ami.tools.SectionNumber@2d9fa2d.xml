 <div class="title">Comparison of species identified as possibly locally extinct by our framework with three established extinction risk methods.</div>
 <p>Our two step framework identified species threatened with local extinction. Step one identified reef species absent from contemporary records and step two estimated the probability of local extinction. The established extinction risk methods are global IUCN Red List status, vulnerability to fishing [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref023">23</a>], and functional vulnerability. The color coded system highlights where each historically-exploited species was identified as threatened with local extinction by each established method. Normal font for agreement, italicized font for moderate agreement and bold font for disagreement.
