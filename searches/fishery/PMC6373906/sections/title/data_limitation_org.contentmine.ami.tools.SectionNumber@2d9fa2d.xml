 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A number of biases and limitations exist when reconstructing species occurrence from disparate data sources, including differences in types of sighting and the reliability of the sighting. For example, the archaeological remains represent only captured species and not the full assemblage of fish. Species may have existed in the past but were not captured and therefore undetected and impossible to assess for extinction risk. Variable levels of preservation and sampling strategies are also affect occurrences in the archaeological record. Other limitations include variation in the temporal resolution and data gaps, primarily in our study from 1500–1991 CE. Unlike archaeological data, species identified in naturalists’ lists provide a single date when a species was observed. Spatial scale and resolution is also variable and the archaeological data here represents two distinct regions, whereas catch assessments and underwater surveys are distributed more broadly but differ in their coverage of habitats and the species assemblages. These limitations can be mitigated by the Bayesian extinction analysis explained below.</p>
