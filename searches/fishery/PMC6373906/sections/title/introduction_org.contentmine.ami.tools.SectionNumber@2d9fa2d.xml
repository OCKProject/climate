 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While global extinctions are rare, local extinctions at population or smaller–scale geographies are becoming increasingly common [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref002">2</a>]. However, due to limited funding for broad and intensive sampling [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref003">3</a>] and the need for robust statistics to estimate local extinction [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref005">5</a>], identifying at-risk species remains challenging. Being able to identify species at risk of extinction is important, as even local extinctions have implications for the food diversity and security of dependent communities [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref006">6</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref007">7</a>] and ecosystem functional diversity, productivity, and resilience [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref008">8</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref010">10</a>]. In particular, the loss of key predators can fundamentally change fisheries ecosystems and associated services [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref011">11</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref013">13</a>]. Consequently, there is a need for rapid and inexpensive methods to assess the vulnerability of species to extinction and to assess lost diversity and ecological services [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref005">5</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vulnerability to extinction is not random [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref015">15</a>] and factors such as geographical range size, evolutionary history, life history traits, and marketability can determine susceptibility to extinction [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref016">16</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref018">18</a>]. Biological traits such as a large body size, late sexual maturity, and long generation time are considered among the most consistent and reliable correlates of extinction vulnerability in marine fish [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref019">19</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref021">21</a>]. Moreover, carnivorous fish are most sensitive to fishing pressure and extinction because of traits that increase their vulnerability to extinction [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref016">16</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref022">22</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref027">27</a>]. The expected vulnerabilities of carnivores provoked research that has identified historically-exploited species that are now locally extinct. For example, Ferretti et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref028">28</a>] reconstructed the occurrence of two locally extinct, commercially important sawfish species (
  <span class="italic">Pristis pristis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pectinata</span>) from 1576 to the present using historical documents, images, museum specimens, and catch records. They demonstrated that these species went extinct in the Mediterranean between the 1960s and 1970s. Similarly, Drew et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref029">29</a>] compared shark teeth records from a museum repository with contemporary species lists, revealing the local extinction of spot tail (
  <span class="italic">Carcharhinus sorrah</span>) and dusky (
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">obscurus</span>) sharks from Kiribati (Oceania) prior to the onset of scientific monitoring. Both studies used a range of historical and contemporary data to reconstruct the occurrence of species over time in order to accurately estimate the rate of decline and make conclusions about local extinction. They show local historical data are potentially well suited to document past range contractions, declines in abundance, and extinctions [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Varied extinction risk methods have been introduced to assess the vulnerability of species to extinction [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref025">25</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref027">27</a>]. Comparing established extinction risk methods with approaches that make use of both historical and modern data sources can potentially highlight the efficacy of existing extinction risk methods. Nevertheless, while the comparison of historical and modern records can be useful, it can also be challenged by data limitations. Sources can differ in their time-span, location, precision in timing, geographic area, biases in observing and identifying species occurrences, and other method and data-inherent uncertainties [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref032">32</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref035">35</a>]. For example, traditional ecological knowledge is often used to reconstruct species occurrence and abundance histories, but suffers from bias in memories and inaccuracies in reporting of historically-exploited species abundances [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref035">35</a>]. Additionally, archaeological records are influenced by a number of factors that include variable preservation rates, biases in sampling and excavation methods, and changing fishing and discard behaviors [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref031">31</a>]. To better account for these biases, recent Bayesian extinction analyses have estimated the probabilities of survey effort bias and false positives [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref036">36</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref037">37</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical and contemporary species occurrence studies have generally been confined to regions with historical written documents and quantitative records [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref016">16</a>]. In contrast, developing countries that rely heavily on natural resources and fishing often have few written baseline records. Therefore, extinction risk methods remains a practical approach to predict extinction risk among coral reef fishes [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref022">22</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref023">23</a>]. In countries without long written traditions, archaeological records are another alternative to detecting species occurrences [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref030">30</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref031">31</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref038">38</a>]. Here we investigated historically-exploited coral reef fish species in Kenya to determine taxa likely to be threatened by local extinction. Our central hypotheses were: (i) that carnivores would be among the most frequently threatened species and (ii) that our historical analysis method would corroborate the results of other well established extinction risk methods. These hypotheses were based on the premise that population declines are non-random and therefore similarly detectable by disparate methods [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref016">16</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref017">17</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref026">26</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref039">39</a>]. We extracted species sightings data from the disparate data sources, archaeological remains, naturalists’ species lists, catch assessment records, and underwater surveys to reconstruct changes in the presence of exploited fish. First, we reconstructed occurrences of each historically-exploited species over historical time from all available sources of data. Second, we showed which historically exploited reef species were absent from the contemporary records. Third, we applied Bayesian extinction likelihood analyses to account for differences in our data collection methods and types [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref036">36</a>]. Finally, species that we identified as threatened with local extinction were compared with the results of three established extinction risk methods: vulnerability to extinction, vulnerability to fishing, and functional vulnerability.
