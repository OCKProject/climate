 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study showed that limitations are evident in existing extinction risk methods. The IUCN Red List is the definitive index of extinction risk and has assessed a 7563 marine fishes [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref070">70</a>]. However, the IUCN Red List assessments examine extinction risk at a global scale but apply the extinction risk independent of local factors. For example, three Kenyan species, which we identified as threatened with local extinction, were listed by the IUCN as “Least Concern”. The justification given was that despite local declines in certain areas of their range these species are common and abundant in other parts of their range [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref079">79</a>]. This approach overlooks the possibility of local extinction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another limitation of the IUCN Red List assessment is the level of quantitative data required to carry out the assessment. This requirement is not always achievable, particularly for non-charismatic species or species with low commercial value. For these species records can be scarce. Our study identified three species as threatened with local extinction that the IUCN Red List categorised as “Data Deficient”. These species could go extinct before sufficient data is available for the IUCN Red List assessment.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the IUCN use a category “Not assessed” for species that haven’t been assessed for extinction risk. Six of the species we identified as threatened with local extinction are included in this IUCN category. There is a considerable risk that some of these six species will disappear before the IUCN can carry out an extinction risk assessment. Limitations to IUCN’s resources are understandable given the scale of their task; however relying solely on the IUCN Red List could result in these species going extinct without formal protection or recognition of their threatened status.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the IUCN Red List limitation concerning global level assessments, the vulnerability to fishing assessment method fails to reflect local differences in a species extinction risk, such as vulnerability to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref022">22</a>]. Furthermore, recent work has shown that spatial variation in fishing needs to be taken into account when using life history traits [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref080">80</a>]. These limitations of the vulnerability to fishing assessment method do not account for differential responses in species extinction risk at a local scale [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref081">81</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref083">83</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The other method, functional vulnerability, simplifies the species into groupings. While this is a useful indicator at an ecosystem level, it fails to produce a threatened list at the species scale [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref022">22</a>]. This presents a challenge where incorporating functional vulnerability findings into conservation measures as these measures are typically set at a species level.
