 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At-risk species often elude detection because of the lack of species monitoring programs [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref059">59</a>]. Surprisingly, our study identified a large number of well-known and conspicuous, rather than rare or inconspicuous, species as at-risk. Many of these species were identified as at risk as they were not sighted recently in fish transects and fish landings (Tables 
  <a rid="pone.0211224.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0211224.t001">1</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0211224.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0211224.t002">2</a>). A number of species identified by our method as threatened were commercially important carnivores. Additionally, piscivores and macro-invertivores are among the most vulnerable functional groups because they tend to be large bodied and exhibit long generation times [

  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref024">24</a>]. Finally, many carnivores are attracted to fishing bait, which can make even non-target or by-catch carnivores vulnerable to overexploitation [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref013">13</a>]. The loss of carnivores found here reflects declines reported in other coral reefs and ecosystems [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A number of the threatened species belong to the carnivorous family of Epinepheline groupers and Haemulidae sweetlips. Epinepheline groupers represent a valuable fishery resource that are inherently vulnerable to collapse due to fishing pressure [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref062">62</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref063">63</a>]. One of their attributes that predispose them to intense fishing and population collapse is the formation of predictable spawning aggregations that fishers frequently learn to exploit. Sweetlips are less studied but are considered as vulnerable because both families share similar biological attributes such as large body size, extended longevity, late sexual maturation, and aggregating behavior, which correlate positively with extinction vulnerability [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref023">23</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref064">64</a>]. A number of the other identified species are more difficult to classify in terms of the specific traits that make them vulnerable at the family level and may require more investigation to better understand the specific causes. Sweetlips and groupers are more easily observed and counted than some identified species and their higher abundance in fisheries closures indicates their vulnerability to even moderate levels of fishing [
