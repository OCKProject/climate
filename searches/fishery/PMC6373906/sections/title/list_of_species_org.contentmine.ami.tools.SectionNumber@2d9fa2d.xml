 <div class="title">List of species potentially threatened with local extinction based on historically-exploited species that were ‘absent’ in the modern data sources (catch assessment records, underwater surveys).</div>
 <p>The probability that the at-risk species identified were locally extinct. Bayesian extinction analyses are based on specimens from the archaeological record and catch records, and sightings from underwater surveys and naturalist’s species lists. Species (with functional group) are listed in order of most likely to be locally extinct. The P-values are derived from the Bayesian extinction analysis and represents the likelihood that a species is extant today. The lower the P-value, the less likely the species is extant.</p>
