 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) Identifying reef species absent from contemporary records</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compiled a list of reef species that were observed in the archaeological record but were absent or rare in the contemporary data sets (catch assessment records and underwater surveys). Initially, every species was examined but the list was subsequently refined to target and by-catch reef fish species. We also considered reef species found in the archaeological record that were rare in the catch assessment records and underwater surveys, i.e. since 1991, and included these in the list of missing reef species. A species was considered rare if it made up &lt;1% of the catch assessments (&lt;15 fish observed in total landings) or &lt;1% of the biomass recorded in underwater surveys (&lt;2 fish observed in total surveys) [
  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref031">31</a>]. Historically exploited reef fish were considered as ‘absent’ when they were present in archaeological records but absent or rare in the naturalist’s species lists, catch assessment records and underwater surveys. If species were categorised as ‘absent’, this signified that the species were potentially threatened with local extinction.
