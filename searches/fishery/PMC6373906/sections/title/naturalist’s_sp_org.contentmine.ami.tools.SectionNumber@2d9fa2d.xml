 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Naturalist’s species lists were derived from the Kenyan office of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the published literature.

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0211224.s001" href="#pone.0211224.s001">S1 Table</a>). Naturalist’s compiled these species lists from species sightings, species occurrence lists, photographs and museum specimens between 1759 and 2003. From these records, we extracted information on the presence of each historically-exploited species and the recorded year. We verified species classification and occurrences with online biodiversity databases, including World Register of Marine Species and FishBase [
