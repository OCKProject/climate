 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our final resource was underwater surveys from WCS-Kenya conducted between 1991 and 2012 at 44 sites along the Kenyan fringing reef (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211224.g001" href="#pone.0211224.g001">Fig 1</a>). Surveys were conducted in fisheries closures and fished reefs with various types of gear management. In each site, a single investigator recorded fish to species level in replicate 500m

  <a rid="pone.0211224.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0211224.ref052">52</a>]. A total of a 199 fish species in selected families were observed in 404 transects (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0211224.s002" href="#pone.0211224.s002">S2 Table</a>). We extracted all occurrence information specific to our historically-exploited species list including the species, date, and location. These observations were then used to construct species occurrence during the contemporary period. From these records, we extracted information on the presence of each historically-exploited species and the recorded year.
