 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Findings from key informant interviews indicated a general awareness among the village elders and other community leaderships that climate change and variability have been a reality in the area. One of the key informants who had stayed in Chundu Communal Area for over five decades (50 years) had this to say:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“I was born in this place in 1965 and my parents were also born here. Yes, I have heard of climate change. I can witness that the climate is changing judging from the shifting rainfall patterns, it is increasingly becoming erratic and local spirit mediums have advised that rainfall will decrease. We have observed it to be true and even the radio confirms this notion about declining and erratic rainfall.”</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceptions of key informants are similar to about 58.1% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=186) of household questionnaire respondents who indicated that they were aware of climate change whilst 41.9% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=134) were not aware. Results from one-way ANOVA show that there were no significant differences in the mean responses across the entire sample (
  <span class="italic">p</span> ≤ 0.000). Focus group discussions further revealed that, in the study area, rainfall has been generally decreasing whilst temperature has been increasing. Key informants and FGD participants expressed concern that while the rainfall amount has been generally decreasing, the seasonal distribution of the rainfall was not even throughout the growing seasons.
