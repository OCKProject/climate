 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results from the household survey show that the majority (88.1%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=282) of the respondents perceived that the rainfall amount was generally decreasing whilst temperatures were increasing (68.1%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=218) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Respondents showed mixed perceptions on temperature trends with 68.1% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=218) of the respondents perceiving an increase, 8.1% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=26) perceiving a decline, and 23.8% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=76) perceiving that temperatures had remained the same (
  <span class="italic">P</span>=0.02) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). The mean response was 1.40. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed on perceptions on rainfall with 4.4% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=14) of the respondents perceiving an increase, 88.4% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=282) perceiving a decline, and 6.9% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=22) perceiving that temperatures had remained the same (
  <span class="italic">P</span>=0.03). The mean response was 2.83.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Findings from key informants and FGDs indicate that there has been a shift in the onset of rain season from October to mid-December whilst the end of rainy season has shifted from March to April since 2013. Traditional leadership noted that the community used to receive early rain like “
  <span class="italic">bumharutsva</span>” and “
  <span class="italic">gukurahundi</span>” prior to the onset of the rain season in November. The majority of key informants indicated that the onset of the rain season had shifted and was now shorter whilst the amount of rainfall has been declining. One key informant stated
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“Rains are no longer coming in November but mid-December and end in early March. In the past, we used to get rainfall from October/November until around March/April. Overall, the length of the rain seasons has also decreased we only get rainfall for just two months or even one month. From 1982, we have been receiving normal rainfall except for 1992, 2001 and 2008 when we experienced severe drought. From 2008 up to now it has drastically decreased.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large proportion of the household respondents (94.4%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=302) perceived that they had experienced drought as the most frequent extreme event followed by extreme heat (74.7%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=239) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Key informants and FGD participants also confirmed that there have been changes in rainfall amount and temperature. One key informant stated
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“2015/16 summer season has been the worst in terms of excessive heat. There were 2 days on a weekend that were the hottest ones we have ever seen. On those same days, our soya bean crops actually dried up within hours from the excessive heat. I think that temperatures at that time were over 40°C. On the other hand, we also experienced extremely cold periods in winter.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large proportion (94%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=302) of the household respondents had experienced drought. Respondents showed mixed perceptions on the frequency of occurrence of drought with 61.6% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=197) of the respondents perceiving an increase, 14% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=45) perceiving a decline, and 24.4% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=78) perceiving that temperatures had remained the same (
  <span class="italic">P</span>=0.01). On the other hand, no significant differences were observed on perceptions on excessive heat and excessive cold (
  <span class="italic">P</span>=0.07). Key informants and FGD participants mentioned that the area had experienced droughts during the following years: 1981/82; 91/92; 87/88; 2001/02; 2007/8; 2013/14. Approximately half of the household respondents (56%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=178) stated that they had experienced extreme cold winters since 2008. Trends in the occurrence of cold winters were also perceived to be on the increase (48/8%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=156), and the severity was moderate (43.4%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=139). FGD participants also stated that, during the 2012/13 and 2014/2015 rain season, the area had received unusual hailstorms associated with destructive winds. However, findings from the household survey show that floods (3.8%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=12) and tropical cyclones (10%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=32) are not a common event in the area. All the key informants and FGD participants concurred that generally, weather conditions had become drier and rainfall timing was becoming more unpredictable.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key informants were of the opinion that climate change is caused by industrial pollutants and the abandonment of traditional culture and practices. Traditional leaders noted that local chiefs generally no longer perform the traditional rainmaking ceremonies. It was reported that the chiefs could not perform the ceremonies because they do not qualify since these days people use various deviant acts to become chiefs. One key informant stated
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“Back in the days when industries were few, we had no issues of climate change. The spirit mediums tell us that in terms of lifestyle, people used to be well behaved long ago and there were no cases of incest. Bereaved families did not store or hang up dead peoples' clothes (kuturika matata) like what people are doing nowadays. The ancestors are angered by these sins and in turn do not bless the area with rainfall.”</p>

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditional key informants also lamented that modern religions were overriding cultural practices most probably due to diverse cultural backgrounds of people located in Nyamakate Resettlement Area. Traditional leadership also highlighted that contemporary religious practices particularly Christianity of the apostolic sect seem to be in conflict with traditional values as indicated by invasion of sacred sites such as Hurungwe Mountain where they have established their shrines. Generally, all key informants stated that climate change is caused by excessive deforestation whilst other thought it is due to natural causes. Those who mentioned deforestation attributed this to clearance of land and wood harvesting for tobacco farming and curing, respectively.</p>
