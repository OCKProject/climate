 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study found that community members agreed that extreme events related to climate change such as prolonged dry periods and excessive temperatures have affected agricultural activities and the biophysical environment. Nyikahadzoi et al. [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>] note that climate change is expected to continue to pose a serious threat to agriculture in southern Africa as annual rainfall amounts are expected to decline and temperatures are expected to increase. Climate change has led to highly variable yields in arable agriculture (both rain-fed and irrigated) in African countries [
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">54</a>]. Findings in this study are in line with the IPCC [
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>] which states that climate change impacts affect both natural and human systems. Respondents indicated that climate change has affected seasonal rainfall patterns by reducing the length of the rainy periods as well as the amount of rain with consequences on crop and livestock production. Similar observations by Chikozho [
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>] are that low and erratic rainfall is leading to low and unpredictable levels of crop production in the semidry agroecological zones of Zimbabwe. Study findings revealed that some farmers resorted to stored grain for seed but did not indicate any loss of seed variety impacts associated with climate change. This contrasts with findings by Mburu Gathuru and Kaguna [
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>] who revealed that, in Kenya, climate change, mainly reduced rainfall levels, has led to the disappearance of some of the indigenous seed varieties as continued failure of crops is affecting the capacity for production of good seeds. In this study, farmers indicated that the planting season has been shortened due to shifting in the timing of the onset of the rain season. Findings in this study are in line with Mburu Gathuru and Kaguna [
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>] who observed that, in Kenya, climate change has caused disruption of the planting calendar such that it has become increasingly difficult for youthful farmers to predict seasonal regimes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Findings on the negative impacts of climate change on pastures and livestock health concur with those by Hopping et al. [
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">56</a>] who reported that pastoralists in the Tibetan rangelands, China, have the same opinion that changing climate is driving undesirable trends in grassland and livestock health. Rose et al. [
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">57</a>] also noted cases of decline in pastures due to low and erratic rainfall. Other authors have also noted that livestock production faces the problem of poor and variable rangeland productivity and desertification processes [
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>, 
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">58</a>, 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">59</a>]. Generally, reduction in fresh water resources affects natural resource and climate-dependent sectors such as forestry, agriculture, water, and fisheries [
  <a rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60">60</a>]. Findings from this study indicate that local communities use LEK to detect changes in water resources due to climate change and variability. Respondents indicated that frequent extreme events such as drought and increasing temperatures affect soil moisture and surface water availability for both domestic use and agriculture. This is in line with United Nations Framework on Climate Change [
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">61</a>] assertion that Africa faces challenges related to water availability and spatial variations in the location and need for water resources. Observations from this study are also similar to those by Taylor et al. [
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">62</a>] who noticed that more frequent and intense climate extremes such as droughts and floods increase variability in soil moisture and surface water. Observations in this study related to drying up of rivers and poor water quality in surface and groundwater systems coincide with findings by Urama and Ozor [
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">63</a>] who reported that impacts on water resources act in conjunction with other factors to affect ecosystem health and socioeconomic well-being of human communities. For example, Mburu Gathuru and Kaguna [
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">55</a>] also noticed that, in Kenya, climate change interacts with anthropogenic activities along rivers to contribute to reduction of river water volume over time and weakening of critical ecosystems like forest watersheds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Farmers at the agriculture wildlife interface notice impacts of climate change on wildlife resource abundance such as disappearance of wetlands, habitat changes, and changes in the phenology of indigenous tree species. These observations are in line with Dube and Phiri [
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">64</a>] who reported that climate change is affecting biodiversity in Zimbabwe as indicated by the disappearance of natural habitats, flora, and fauna. In Tanzania, Paavola [
  <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">65</a>] also noticed that forests, wildlife, and wetlands are being impacted by climate change. Farmers also reported that although wildlife resources such as fruits are consumed to avert food shortages during drought, their abundance has declined due to climatic changes. Results from this study agree with those by Rurinda et al. [
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>], who reported that the availability of wild fruits and social safety nets was affected directly and indirectly by extreme temperatures and increased rainfall variability, impacting on the livelihoods of resource-constrained farmers. Similar observations were also seen in [
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">66</a>] who noticed that farmers in Makonde district, Zimbabwe, perceived changes in ecosystem productivity, goods, and services as a result of climate-induced factors. Nhemachena et al. [
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>] also indicated that the phenology of indigenous fruit trees and invertebrate species was under threat from climate-induced changes on water availability and wetlands. However, in this study, respondents did not identify any impacts associated with invertebrate species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recruitment of plants has been constrained by low rainfall and temperature leading to low productivity [
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">67</a>]. Low productivity of primary producers (plants) had severe cascading effects on both domestic and wildlife species along the food chain. Climate change has led to creation of strong tensions between humans and wildlife species due to shortage of resources (especially food and water). Occurrence of habitat patches and invasive species (which are inedible to animals) led to animals exceeding their home-ranges and encroaching human habitats, thereby causing damage to crops and property paving a way to human-wildlife conflict. Climate change has the potential to alter migratory routes (and timings) of species that use both seasonal wetlands (migratory birds) and track seasonal changes in vegetation (herbivores) [
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">68</a>]. This increase conflicts between people and large mammals such as elephants, particularly in areas where rainfall is low. Change [
  <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">69</a>] states that wildlife-farming conflict was potentially exacerbated by climate change, in particular, drought, which encourages wildlife to forage on farmlands.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, respondents also noted that climatic parameters interact with other nonclimatic factors such as illegal harvesting and pressure from human population increase also influence the abundance of wildlife resources. For instance, trees belonging to the dominant family within the Miombo region are threatened by other nonclimatic factors such as deforestation. Similar observations have been made in Mozambique where trees associated with Miombo woodland utilised for traditional purposes are declining due to overexploitation and destructive collection [
  <a rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" href="#B70">70</a>]. Mubaya et al. [
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">71</a>] suggest that although climatic factors are critical in determining production in agroecosystems, multiple stressors interact to influence the abundance and diversity of natural resources.
