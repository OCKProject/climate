 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Communities from different parts of the world use local knowledge about ecosystems to recognize and respond to the impacts of climate change and variability [
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">1</a>]. African rural communities have been documented as constructing climate change realities based on their experiences of the impacts and effects [
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>]. Although the observation of global climate change has been largely based on meteorological data, there is paucity of information on how humans use local ecological knowledge to recognize and respond to such changes [
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>]. This calls for research to explore the role of local culture in identifying and responding to threats imposed by the changing climate. Adger et al. [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>] suggest that local communities could interpret and construct climate change trends and local indicators within a cultural setting. The United Nations (UN) recognizes the significant role played by indigenous knowledge, cultures, and traditional practices in promoting sustainable development, equity, and management of the environment [
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>]. Adger et al. [
  <a rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4">4</a>] further argue that since culture is embedded in societal modes of production, consumption, lifestyles, and social organization, it should be recognized in understanding both mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Understanding and building upon perceptions, experiences, and IK on climate change can contribute towards strengthening the resilience of poor societies who are characterized by weak infrastructure and economic well-being [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditional knowledge is derived from indigenous knowledge systems (IKSs), the designation that is used to refer to the modus operandi and processes that the indigenous peoples use to harness local knowledge [
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">7</a>]. Local/traditional/indigenous traditional knowledge is defined as the intellectual behavior and beliefs of indigenous societies or local information about the relationship of living beings (including humans) with one another and with their environment [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>]. The knowledge exists and is developed, accumulated, and transmitted culturally through local community experiences and know-how across generations [
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">8</a>, 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">9</a>]. Also, known as indigenous technical science, indigenous knowledge is dynamic and is informed by local communities' interactions with their local biophysical and social environment [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. Indigenous knowledge encompasses interrelated subsets of local ecological knowledge (LEK), seasonal knowledge, and phenological knowledge [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local ecological knowledge (LEK) refers to knowledge, practices, and beliefs shared among local resource users regarding ecological interaction within ecosystems [
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">12</a>]. LEK comprises people's lived experiences and their dialectical interaction with the natural environment [
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">13</a>]. Thus, local knowledge is a key component of integrated ecosystem and community-based adaptation strategies. The Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>] defines ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) as the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services in an overall adaptation strategy. Reid et al. [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>] defines community-based adaptation as a community-led process, based on communities' priorities, needs, knowledge, and capacities, which should empower people to plan for and cope with the impacts of climate change. EbA includes approaches such as the sustainable management, conservation, and restoration of ecosystems to provide services that help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change [
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">14</a>]. Approaches to ecosystem-based adaptation take into account the multiple social, economic, and cultural cobenefits for local communities as part of an overall adaptation strategy [
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">16</a>]. This study investigated LEK inclusive of seasonal ecological knowledge (SEK) on climate trends and responses to climate change impacts in the context of a biosphere reserve.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Man and Biosphere Reserves (MAB) are established directly to bring together biodiversity, cultural diversity, and ecosystem services, thus promoting ecological security and models for sustainable development [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>]. UNESCO MAB, together with its World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) functions as a Global Observatory for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation focused on promoting integrated monitoring, multidisciplinary approaches, and participatory activities, supporting climate change management [
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>]. The WNBR strives to implement the Paris Agreement and United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by fostering the improvement of human livelihoods and protection of natural and managed ecosystems for sustainable development [
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. Yashina [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>] notes that biosphere reserves play an important role in developing and implementing mitigation and adaptation measures as stipulated in the Madrid Climate Change Strategy Action Plan Framework of 2008 and the Climate Change Initiative of 2009. Target 24 of the Action Plan predicts that biosphere reserves can be used as learning sites for research into, adaptation to, and mitigation of climate change impacts [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. UNESCO [
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>] calls for member states to respond to new kinds of conservation challenge posed by climate change, developing innovative policy, tailoring management strategies, and recognizing the value of resilient protected area systems that help safeguard the global environment and human societies from the threats posed by climate change. UNESCO MAB strategy highlights the need for local communities to integrate indigenous knowledge in the fight against climate change. Thus, embracing indigenous knowledge in climate change adaptation is vital to enhance community resilience of communities to climate change [
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>] in biosphere reserve settings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several studies have focused on the impacts and small-scale farmers' adaptation towards climate change and variability at the agriculture-wildlife interface in Zimbabwe [
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">23</a>, 
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]. Nyikahadzoi et al. [
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>] studied the factors influencing climate change adaptation among small-scale farmers in Hurungwe District, Zimbabwe. Ndebele-Murisa et al. [
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">26</a>] studied the effects of climate change and variability on fisheries-based livelihoods in Kariba, Zimbabwe. However, a few studies have focused on the role of local knowledge in understanding climate change trends, impacts, and adaptive strategies among agroecological-based livelihoods within the MZBR. This study uses two case studies to explore local ecological knowledge (LEK) held by local communities on climate change trends, impacts, and adaptation in the Middle Zambezi Biosphere Reserve (MZBR), Zimbabwe.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The growing body of knowledge on local indigenous knowledge about climate change impacts on biophysical systems provides novel contributions towards our understanding of local climate change and people's responses [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>â€“
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>] in rural communities who are determined to develop sustainable environments [
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">6</a>]. Murphy et al. [
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">30</a>] contend that successful adaptation to climate change requires understanding processes of social and biophysical change and their interactions within socioecological systems. Thus, LEK can be used to understand community adaptive practices which promote resilience to environmental changes [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>] that have negative effects on local livelihoods and sustainable development [
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">10</a>]. LEK can therefore supplement scientific data by providing primary and comprehensive descriptions of the biophysical and socioeconomic components of the biosphere landscapes that are experiencing climate change stresses [
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>]. In addition, local community traditional daily practices such as weather forecasting can provide a myriad of benefits including making informed decisions to enhance agricultural food security [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>]. The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate local community perceptions on trends and causes of climate change, (ii) identify biophysical impacts of climate change at the local level, and (iii) explore the ecosystem-based adaptation strategies towards climate change on the MZBR, Zimbabwe.
