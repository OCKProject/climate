 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted in the Chundu Communal and Nyamakate Resettlement Area (
  <a rid="tab1" ref-type="table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>) located in the transitional zone of the Middle Zambezi Biosphere Reserve (MZBR), in the northern margins of Mashonaland West Province, Zimbabwe. The case study communities were purposively sampled due to their proximity to Mana Pools National Park and Hurungwe Safari Area (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) as an important factor in their recruitment. The study area is made up of indigenous people who were forced to migrate from the Zambezi Valley prior to the establishment of the adjacent protected areas, namely, Hurungwe Safari Area, Mana Pools National Park, and Charara Safari Area (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Nyamakate chiefdom and Chundu Communal Area was established in the Zambezi valley before and after colonization by the white men, respectively [

The 1991–92 drought was the most severe, and it had profound effects on livelihoods [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MZBR is a habitat to diverse and unique flora and fauna which contributes significantly towards the region's biodiversity. Terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna species are found in the adjacent protected areas, i.e., Mana Pools National Park, Hurungwe, Chewore, and Charara safari areas. The MZBR valley floor area is endowed with diverse wildlife species including elephant (
