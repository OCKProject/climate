 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Household respondents, key informants, and focus group discussants were aware of the impacts of climate change on socioeconomic and biophysical components of the environment (
  <a rid="tab3" ref-type="table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). The changing climate has resulted in a general decline in agricultural productivity, including changes in the availability of ecosystem goods and services. About 43% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=139) of the respondents indicate that they had experienced livestock diseases such as red water due to climate change. Approximately 59% (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=189) attributed the decrease of pastures to drought which ranked third after increase in livestock and population increase. About 8% (26) households had lost at least two cattle (currently valued at approximately US$ 800) due to drought.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A large proportion of household respondents (78%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=250) cited declining rainfall (53%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=168) as the major factor contributing to water shortages whilst another proportion (43%; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=136) also indicated that disappearance of wetlands (68; 
  <span class="italic">n</span>=218) was also mentioned to be succumbing to decreasing rainfall. Field observations revealed that some farmers cultivated in wetlands and valley bottoms, taking advantage of residual moisture in the soils. Personal field observations revealed boreholes, rivers, streams, and wells as the key water sources in the area. Key informants indicated that there have been substantial changes to the flow regime of streams such as Chitake, Chewore, Kabidza, Chitake, Mvurameshi, Mvuramachena, Samhofu, and Hodobe. For instance, key informants reported that Rukomechi river flow regime had changed from perennial to seasonal since 2015/2016 season. The study villages used to have several water sources, which would supply water throughout the year such as natural springs and wetlands, but most of them have dried up.

  <span class="italic">Piliostigma thonningii</span> (Schumach) fruits were being harvested and pounded into powder to cook porridge, whilst 
  <span class="italic">Diospyros mespiliformis</span> (mushuma) and 
  <span class="italic">Parinari Curatellifolia</span> (muchakata) fruits are used as an alternative food source during drought. In addition, exotic tree species such as raw mangoes have also been harvested prematurely and cooked for consumption during the 1991/92 and 2007/8 drought period. During drought local communities also rely on indigenous shrubs and underground tubers such as air potato (manyanya) and “mupama”, although even these roots only do well when there is good rainfall. 
  <span class="italic">Dioscorea praehensilis</span> Benth (mupama) and the air potato 
  <span class="italic">Dioscorea bulbifera</span> (
  <span class="italic">manyanya</span>) are woody perennial plants, which both belong to the family Dioscoreaceae. The plants produce edible underground organs (tubers). The air potato (mupama) is one of the most widely consumed yam species. Mupama tree is also used during drought periods. For example, respondents mentioned the tree species provided food relief to most vulnerable and poor households during the most severe 1991/2 and 2007/8 drought period. Respondents stated that the yam plant produces potato like roots are edible. Unlike the ordinary potato and sweet potato tubers, the air potato tubers have to be thoroughly boiled to remove the bitter taste before consumption. Other key informants reported that if the tubers are underprepared, their consumption could lead to severe stomach ailments and eventually death.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Key informants reported that 
  <span class="italic">Rhynchosia venulosa</span> (mukoyo) is as one of the popular drought relief plant species among the local community members. Key informants and FGD participants stated that traditional beer-brewing experts use the roots of the legume to brew beer, which can be sold locally or taken to the border town of Chirundu for sale. Key informants suggested that commercialization of the by-product from the legume is important in contributing towards household income during drought periods. The shrub has been cited as one of the underutilised legumes which have tremendous potential for commercial exploitation in the area. Participants reported that they even illegally harvest the plant in the adjacent protected area since the species is already disappearing in nearby community forests.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few respondents cited bee farming as one of the key coping strategies in response to changing climatic shortages. The beehives are made from mupfuti tree timber. Upon completion, the beehives are placed in the mupondo or mutsabvi tree because it has flowers, which easily attract the bees towards the hives. Local community members practice highlighted that bee farming requires patience and dedication; hence, very few people use it as a coping strategy. The next section presents an analysis of factors which influence the choice of coping strategies in the study area.</p>
