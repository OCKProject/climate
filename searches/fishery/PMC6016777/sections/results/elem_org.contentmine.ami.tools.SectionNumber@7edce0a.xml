  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses indicated that during the 1970–1989 period covered by Sinclair, age-specific depth distributions of cod were highly variable. Each age group (ages 4–12 y) occupied a broad range of depths and there was considerable overlap among groups (

    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S4
   </span>). Four- and 5-y-old cod were, however, more abundant in relatively shallow waters and older cod were distributed across all depths to a maximum of ∼370 m with a tendency toward progressively higher abundances in deeper waters. The center of mass (CM; 
   <a ref-type="sec" rid="s9" href="#s9">
    <span class="italic">Materials and Methods</span>
   </a>) deepened progressively with age from 80 m at age 4 y to 161 m at age 12 y (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>), consistent with the results reported by Sinclair (ref.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Empirical Analysis of Age-Specific Temperature.</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no appreciable difference in the distributions of cod aged 2 y and older with respect to temperature. The median temperature occupied averaged 3.3 °C with an interquartile range of 2.3–5.0 °C (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S6 and S7 and Table S3
   </span>). Ages 0 and 1 y were associated with warmer temperatures (median of 7.2 °C and 6.0 °C, respectively), although these age groups are not well-sampled by the survey due to off-bottom behavior and/or residency inshore of the survey area (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S4
   </span>). From 1970 to 1989, the bottom temperature on the ESS averaged 5.4 °C with a range of 4.4 °C to 6.8 °C, well within the temperatures associated with cod aged 4–12 y (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S8
   </span>). These findings too are consistent with those of Sinclair (
   <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>), who reported that the median temperatures of capture for cod ages 4–12 y were consistently between 2.4 °C to 3.3 °C with no apparent trend. While the pattern of deepening with age by cod in this ecosystem is consistent with an ontogenetic response, it is also clear that there would be little or no metabolic advantage to such behavior given the absence of any evidence of selective occupancy of progressively colder temperatures with age. The variability of shelf-bottom temperature from 1970 to 1989 was within the range preferred by cod. This precluded the investigation of deepening related to climate warming beyond the cod’s preferred temperature range with these data.

    <span class="italic">A</span> and

    <span class="italic">C</span> and 
    <span class="italic">D</span>
   </a>). Subsequent runs were set up with varying magnitudes of F. At each age the CM of the depth distribution deepened progressively as F increased, the one exception being F = 0, for which no age-related response occurred (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
    <span class="italic">A</span>

At F = 0.52, the average cod mortality during the interval 1970–1989, the difference in the depth of CM between age 4 and 12 was 56 m.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of Observed and Model-Predicted Age-Specific Depths.</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of our modeling exercise indicated that fishing alone, at F = 0.52 to a depth of 80 m, could account for 72% of the observed age related deepening of ESS cod (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
    <span class="italic">B</span>
   </a>). The discrepancy between the observed and simulated CM increases with age (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
    <span class="italic">B</span>
   </a>). This is expected given that the abundance of age 4 cod is 14 times greater than that at age 8 and 353 times greater than at age 12, thereby giving rise to greater uncertainty in the estimates of the CM for older age classes. Moreover, it is probable that this error would increase with successive applications of the model as any error at age 5 would propagate through all other age groups. However, the average value of F (0.52) was based on the entire depth range surveyed within the management unit. Consequently, applying this value to the upper 80 m alone would likely underestimate the impact of exploitation. However, increasing the value of F in our model did not result in a better overall agreement between the observed and simulated results.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decreased landings over several decades forced fishing fleets to exploit stocks at ever-increasing depths. The annual average fishing depths across the entire North Atlantic increased from 5.5 m per decade during the interval 1950–1989 to 32.1 m per decade thereafter (
   <a rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" href="#r25">25</a>). A similar pattern occurred on the Scotian Shelf. From 1970 to 1977 the otter trawl fishery, the dominant contributor to total cod landings, was primarily focused on the shallow banks, whereas the longline fishery, the second-largest component and accounting for 11% of cod landings, was characterized by greater effort in deeper waters. During the interval 1978–1989, the contribution of the longline fishery to total landings had increased to 20% (ref. 
   <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a> and 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S9
   </span>). In addition, reported depths of cod catches by commercial trawlers operating on the ESS revealed an increase in the average set depth from 73 m in 1986 to 132 m in 1989 (
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S10
   </span>). It is also apparent that some fishing occurred at depths up to ∼150 m.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We therefore examined the effect of this deepening of the fishing effort on estimates of the age-specific CMs of the ESS cod stock. These simulations revealed that moving the fishery into progressively deeper waters resulted in a deepening of the CMs (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
    <span class="italic">C</span>
   </a>). Extending F of 0.52 from the minimum depth of cod occurrence to 120 m resulted in a slight overestimation of the observed deepening by about 10% (the slope of the linear fit is 1.1, 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.99; best fit at ∼110 m, slope = 1.01, intercept = −2.8 m, and 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.996), which improved the correspondence between simulation output and empirical observations (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
    <span class="italic">A</span>
   </a>). We therefore analyzed data on cod distributions derived from the 2006–2016 surveys, during which F = 0 and when the cod population was exhibiting the first signs of recovery from its near-total collapse in 1992 (
   <a rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" href="#r26">26</a>). The systematic, well-separated cumulative abundance distributions of 1970–1989 when F = 0.52 differed markedly from the compressed, overlapping distributions of 2006–2016 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Figs. 3</a> and

   <span class="sup">−1</span> based on CM depths) of the earlier period contrasts with the overall shallowing (slope = −1.5 ± 1 m⋅y
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) during the 2006–2016 period. Moreover, we note that the more complex response for the later period could be decomposed to a weaker deepening from 83 to 95 m for the younger fish (ages 4–7, slope = 3.9 ± 1.4 m⋅y
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) and a tendency for shallowing with increasing age for ages 7–12. The deepening response of the younger fish could be a manifestation of ontogeny, whereas for the older fish it might reflect a repopulation of the more productive shallower ESS waters after a prolonged period without recovery following the initiation of the moratorium (
