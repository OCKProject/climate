 <p content-type="flushleft" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Heincke (
  <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>) concluded that “the size and age of the plaice in a definite part of the North Sea are inversely proportional to the density of their occurrence, but directly proportional to the distance of the locality from the coast, and to its depth.” Repeated observations of a similar nature for a wide variety of fish species have led to the conclusion that this pattern represents a universal ontogenetic trait that has come to be known as Heincke’s law (
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">3</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses provide strong support for our hypothesis that the widespread reports of age-/size-related deepening of larger fishes characterized as Heincke’s law can be the result, in large measure, of size-selective exploitation. By extension, these findings call into question the veracity of the several hypotheses advanced to date which invoked an evolved, selective basis for the development of age-/size-specific patterns of deepening. The tendency for larger fish to be present at all surveyed depths, albeit at lower densities in shallower waters relative to smaller fish, as revealed in our study and others (

  <a href="#r30">*</a>
  <a href="#r31">*</a>–
  <a rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" href="#r32">32</a>) provides further support for the selective fishing effect hypothesis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our modeling and empirical evaluations of the expected and realized distribution of cod on the Scotian Shelf when F = 0, the condition prevailing during the moratorium imposed on exploitation of this species from 1993 to present, suggest that there may also be ontogenetic component to the deepening, at least for younger fish, of as much as 3.9 m⋅y
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, compared with the earlier period (1970–1989) when the deepening rate was much greater (10 m⋅y
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and both ontogeny and fishing were factors driving the depth distribution of cod.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In further support of the size-selective exploitation hypothesis, direct observations of habitat occupation derived from data storage tags deployed on individuals of several discrete cod stocks distributed across the North Atlantic indicate that cod often occupy water temperatures shown experimentally to be suboptimal for growth (
  <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>, 
  <a rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" href="#r34">34</a>). They also frequently fail to move systematically closer (vertically or horizontally) to thermal optima as defined by laboratory studies (
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>). Further, our analyses of the temperature distributions of ESS cod revealed that the cod aged 2–12 y occupied essentially the same temperatures, thus revealing no tendency toward age-specific temperature preferences that would lead to ontogenetic differences in depth distributions and enhanced metabolic benefits. The median temperature occupied varied by only 0.5 °C and ∼80% of all cod occupied temperatures ranging from 1.3 °C to 7 °C (

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S6 and S7 and Tables S3 and S4
  </span>). It should be noted also that some cod of all ages occupied temperatures ranging from below 0 °C to the low to mid teens.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We note that our primary dataset from 1970 to 1989 was during a period when ocean bottom temperature remained within the cod’s preferred range. Consequently, we could not explore the potential of long-term warming in particular to drive a deepening response in the stock as a whole. Even if a warming were observed our analysis indicates, given the survey design, that 13–14 y of data (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S5
  </span>) are required to achieve reliable estimates of biomass-related parameters such as the CM.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is also notable that the seasonal temperature variations at depths ≥65 m during the North Sea studies of plaice depth distributions during the early 1900s (
  <a rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" href="#r1">1</a>, 
  <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">2</a>) were also small, from 0.7 °C to 1.8 °C (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S1
  </span>). As was the case for 2- to 12-y-old cod on the ESS (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S7
  </span>), plaice ranging in weight from ∼500–900 g were all found in this nearly isothermal environment (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S1 
   <span class="italic">B</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </span>). It thus would appear that the hypothesis that these plaice were exhibiting an age-/size-specific search for preferred temperatures is questionable. Collectively, direct in situ behavioral observations (
  <a rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" href="#r33">33</a>
  <a href="#r34">*</a>–
  <a rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" href="#r35">35</a>) of cod distributions with respect to temperature, our detailed empirical observations of the pre- and postmoratorium temperature related distributions of cod on the ESS (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Fig. S7
  </span>), and the results of our simulation studies raise serious questions regarding the assumption, common to virtually all contemporary studies of distributional changes of commercially exploited demersal fish species (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1802096115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Table S2
  </span>), that individual species, and indeed individual age/size classes within species, actively seek to remain within their thermal optima, in the latter case leading to ontogenetic deepening.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the greater availability of food resources in shallower waters (
  <a rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" href="#r8">8</a>
  <a href="#r9">*</a>–
  <a rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" href="#r10">10</a>), the model result that cod depth distributions, regardless of age, were uniform with depth when F was set at 0 was generally supported by our analysis of the depth distributions of cod during the recovery era when a fishing moratorium on the ESS existed. The estimated average CM across age groups was 87 m with a range of 23 m (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig06" href="#fig06">Fig. 6</a>). This result favors the hypothesis that all age/size classes would seek to exploit the feeding advantage associated with shallow bank habitats (
  <a rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" href="#r36">36</a>) and that, in the absence of size-selective exploitation, relatively uniform size/depth distributions should prevail. A recent analysis of 16 y of annual bottom trawl survey data from the Rockall Trough (Northeast Atlantic), coincident with a time of greatly reduced fishing effort, revealed a reoccupation of large-bodied fishes within the shallowest depth zone where most of the fishing pressure had been concentrated (
  <a rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" href="#r37">37</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, our findings, which demonstrate that the age-/size-related deepening frequently observed in commercially exploited species can be a direct result of size-selective harvesting, call into serious question the assertion that species-specific deepening is, and therefore can be used as, an indicator/index of biological effects of ocean warming linked to climate change. Ontogenetic factors, fisheries exploitation, and climate variability must be considered before deepening or any other spatial adjustment of populations/assemblages can be attributed to any of these mechanisms.</p>
