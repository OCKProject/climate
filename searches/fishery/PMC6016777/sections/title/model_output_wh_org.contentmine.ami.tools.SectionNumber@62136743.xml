 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decreased landings over several decades forced fishing fleets to exploit stocks at ever-increasing depths. The annual average fishing depths across the entire North Atlantic increased from 5.5 m per decade during the interval 1950–1989 to 32.1 m per decade thereafter (
  <a rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" href="#r25">25</a>). A similar pattern occurred on the Scotian Shelf. From 1970 to 1977 the otter trawl fishery, the dominant contributor to total cod landings, was primarily focused on the shallow banks, whereas the longline fishery, the second-largest component and accounting for 11% of cod landings, was characterized by greater effort in deeper waters. During the interval 1978–1989, the contribution of the longline fishery to total landings had increased to 20% (ref.

  </span>). In addition, reported depths of cod catches by commercial trawlers operating on the ESS revealed an increase in the average set depth from 73 m in 1986 to 132 m in 1989 (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We therefore examined the effect of this deepening of the fishing effort on estimates of the age-specific CMs of the ESS cod stock. These simulations revealed that moving the fishery into progressively deeper waters resulted in a deepening of the CMs (

   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). Extending F of 0.52 from the minimum depth of cod occurrence to 120 m resulted in a slight overestimation of the observed deepening by about 10% (the slope of the linear fit is 1.1, 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.99; best fit at ∼110 m, slope = 1.01, intercept = −2.8 m, and 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.996), which improved the correspondence between simulation output and empirical observations (
