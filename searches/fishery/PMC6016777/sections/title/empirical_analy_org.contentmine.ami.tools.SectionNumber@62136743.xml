 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was no appreciable difference in the distributions of cod aged 2 y and older with respect to temperature. The median temperature occupied averaged 3.3 °C with an interquartile range of 2.3–5.0 °C (

   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, Figs. S6 and S7 and Table S3
  </span>). Ages 0 and 1 y were associated with warmer temperatures (median of 7.2 °C and 6.0 °C, respectively), although these age groups are not well-sampled by the survey due to off-bottom behavior and/or residency inshore of the survey area (

  </span>). From 1970 to 1989, the bottom temperature on the ESS averaged 5.4 °C with a range of 4.4 °C to 6.8 °C, well within the temperatures associated with cod aged 4–12 y (

  </span>). These findings too are consistent with those of Sinclair (
  <a rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" href="#r23">23</a>), who reported that the median temperatures of capture for cod ages 4–12 y were consistently between 2.4 °C to 3.3 °C with no apparent trend. While the pattern of deepening with age by cod in this ecosystem is consistent with an ontogenetic response, it is also clear that there would be little or no metabolic advantage to such behavior given the absence of any evidence of selective occupancy of progressively colder temperatures with age. The variability of shelf-bottom temperature from 1970 to 1989 was within the range preferred by cod. This precluded the investigation of deepening related to climate warming beyond the cod’s preferred temperature range with these data.
