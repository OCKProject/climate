 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We approached this question by first reviewing 20 y of annual Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada scientific survey data (1970–1989). The survey is based on standardized tows, a stratified random design, and has been conducted on the ESS (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization division 4VsW) of the Northwest Atlantic off Nova Scotia every summer (July) since 1970 (
