 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model was initialized with F = 0.52 (1970–1989 average F, ref. 
  <a rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" href="#r24">24</a>) applied from 0 to 80 m, M = 0.2 at all depths, and with the observed depth distribution of age 4 cod (

   <span class="italic">A</span> and 
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>). Application of the model shows progressive deepening of cod with age to a maximum depth of 136 m for age 12 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig04" href="#fig04">Fig. 4 
   <span class="italic">C</span> and 
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>). Subsequent runs were set up with varying magnitudes of F. At each age the CM of the depth distribution deepened progressively as F increased, the one exception being F = 0, for which no age-related response occurred (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">A</span>
  </a>). The difference in the CM depth between age 4 and 12 cod varied with F and ranged from 32 m at F = 0.2 to 58 m at F = 1. At F = 0.52, the average cod mortality during the interval 1970–1989, the difference in the depth of CM between age 4 and 12 was 56 m. These model outcomes are highly consistent with our empirical findings and with those reported by Sinclair (ref.
