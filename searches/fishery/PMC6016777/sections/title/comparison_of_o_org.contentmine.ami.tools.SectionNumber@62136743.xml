 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of our modeling exercise indicated that fishing alone, at F = 0.52 to a depth of 80 m, could account for 72% of the observed age related deepening of ESS cod (

  </a>). The discrepancy between the observed and simulated CM increases with age (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig05" href="#fig05">Fig. 5
   <span class="italic">B</span>
  </a>). This is expected given that the abundance of age 4 cod is 14 times greater than that at age 8 and 353 times greater than at age 12, thereby giving rise to greater uncertainty in the estimates of the CM for older age classes. Moreover, it is probable that this error would increase with successive applications of the model as any error at age 5 would propagate through all other age groups. However, the average value of F (0.52) was based on the entire depth range surveyed within the management unit. Consequently, applying this value to the upper 80 m alone would likely underestimate the impact of exploitation. However, increasing the value of F in our model did not result in a better overall agreement between the observed and simulated results.
