 <p>The occupation of progressively deeper waters with increasing size and age of fish is common among commercially exploited species, a behavior attributed to evolved ontogenies. Recently deepening has been attributed to ocean warming. We evaluated the possibility, ignored in previous analyses, that these patterns result from selective exploitation of larger individuals. We found that size-selective exploitation accounted for &gt;70% of the deepening of cod on the Scotian Shelf (Northwest Atlantic). This deepening declined dramatically when exploitation was banned. Ontogeny contributed to the remaining variance. The claim that deepening can be used as an index of ocean warming should be exercised with caution; the overarching effect of exploitation should be specifically addressed in all such analyses.</p>
