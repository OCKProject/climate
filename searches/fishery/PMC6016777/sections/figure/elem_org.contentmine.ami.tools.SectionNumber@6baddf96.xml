  <p>Cumulative frequency distributions of abundance (number per standardized tow) of ESS cod with depth of capture for age groups 4 y to 12 y. Data were derived from fishery independent surveys conducted during 2006–2016 (969 standardized tows). The black dotted line denotes the depths of the CM; the numerical values are given in the inset. The two broken yellow lines are the envelope (age 4 and 12) of the cumulative percent distribution for 1970–1989 (time interval of high exploitation) from
