 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to mainland China, Taiwanâ€™s high-seas fisheries in the Northwest Pacific are its most profitable (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a> and table S7). Taiwanese longlining and squid jigging in the Northwest Pacific are among the most profitable high-seas fisheries globally without subsidies (average profit $193 million and $63 million, respectively). Taiwanese longlining elsewhere appears to be unprofitable. We estimate that in the Western Central Pacific and Eastern Central Pacific, longlining results in average annual losses of $65 million and $63 million, respectively. Similar to China, only after assuming low labor costs does Taiwanese high-seas fishing produce profits (table S7).
