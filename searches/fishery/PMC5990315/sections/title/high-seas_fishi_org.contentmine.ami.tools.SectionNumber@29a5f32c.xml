 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We defined the global high-seas fleet as fishing vessels that spend more than 5% of their fishing effort in the high seas and that either (i) self-report as fishing vessels in their AIS messages, (ii) were matched to official fishing vessel registries, or (iii) were classified as fishing vessels by the neural net models of the GFW (

  </a>). In addition, we included bunker and reefer vessels that met at sea with the high-seas fishing fleet based on AIS data. We complemented these data with Indonesian VMS data to incorporate all Indonesian vessels that operate more than 5% of their time in the high seas. For details on vessel characteristics, crews, speed, and fuel consumption, see the Supplementary Materials.
