 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We built a database of labor costs using different sources such as government reports, gray literature, and estimates of mean wages for fishers and similarly skilled workers reported by the International Labor Organization (ILO). This search often yielded two different metrics of labor cost: (i) labor cost per day and (ii) labor cost per crew member per day. We used these to estimate total labor cost for each vessel (LC

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For a subset of countries, representing 25% of total high-seas fishing effort—the EU, Japan, South Korea, and Chile—we were able to obtain reliable estimates of labor costs per day. For China, we obtained information on the average labor costs per month of crew members onboard the country’s squid jigger fleets (J. Ho, Maritima Oceánica S.A.C., personal communication, December 2017). For Taiwan, we used the country’s minimum wage. Given that fleets often use labor from similar nationalities (for example, Philippines and Indonesia), and assuming that labor costs are mostly determined by a vessel’s gear type and size, we used the average labor costs from these countries to estimate the labor costs of the remaining high-seas fleet. We considered this our high bound estimate.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Realizing that fleets often use the cheapest labor available and that it is not uncommon for human rights violations to take place on board high seas and distant-water vessels [for example, (

  </a>–
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>)], we searched for additional—often less reliable—information on labor costs to estimate a lower bound. For China, Taiwan, the United States, and Vanuatu, we obtained gray literature estimates of labor cost, and for several other countries, we used the mean wages for fishers or similarly skilled workers as reported by the ILO. For the remaining countries, we filled in data gaps with regional, gear type, and size-specific averages. All monetary values have been converted to US dollars.
