 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used high-seas catch and landed value data from the Sea Around Us research initiative for 2014, aggregated by fishing country and FAO region. Global catch data were reconstructed separately for every maritime country and its territory by the Sea Around Us or by over 300 colleagues around the world, following a general catch reconstruction approach (
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>). In principle, this approach evaluates and reviews a country’s official reported catch data to ascertain what fisheries components are missing from official reported data. These identified gaps are then filled in using all available data and information sources to derive time series of unreported catches. This may include the use of assumption-derived estimates [see (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>) and references therein]. Thus, the Sea Around Us reconstructed catch data complement official reported data as presented by the FAO on behalf of countries with best estimates of unreported catches and major discards. The Sea Around Us reconstructed catch database contains three layers of catch data: layer 1, domestic catches within the home EEZ; layer 2, non-tuna catches taken by fleets outside of home (domestic) waters (that is, foreign catch); and layer 3, industrial tuna and other large pelagic fisheries catches. The domestic data in layer 1 was the major focus for reconstructions, and thus data within EEZs have the most comprehensive coverage for unreported catches. These data, while of no direct relevance in the present context of high-seas areas, suggest that around 30% of total EEZ catches are unreported (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>). Layer 2 (foreign non-tuna catches) and layer 3 (industrial tuna and other large pelagic catches) have so far received less attention on unreported catches, although discards have been added to all data. Thus, the catch data used here for high-seas areas, although reconstructed, need to be considered as minimal estimates of the likely actual high-seas catches.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catch reconstructions are now widely documented in the peer-reviewed literature [for example, (
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>–
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>)] and increasingly used, for example, as part of the Environmental Performance Index (
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
   <span class="italic">44</span>
  </a>) or in global studies on human nutrition and health (
  <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">
   <span class="italic">45</span>
  </a>). The landed value of catches was derived by multiplying the reconstructed catches by the global ex-vessel price database first derived by Sumaila 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
   <span class="italic">46</span>
  </a>), and since updated by Swartz 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
   <span class="italic">47</span>
  </a>) and Tai 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
