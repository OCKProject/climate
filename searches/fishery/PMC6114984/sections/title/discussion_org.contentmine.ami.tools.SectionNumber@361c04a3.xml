 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change will have diverse impacts on marine ecosystems and resources. Prior projections that climate change could reduce global fisheries revenues by as much as $10 billion a year compared to today garnered significant attention (

   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>). However, taking human responses into account shifts our view of climate change and the world’s oceans. We show that the future of global fisheries could actually be more prosperous than today, but only if management reforms addressing current mismanagement and looming challenges from climate change are implemented in the near future across a wide range of fisheries. This is true both globally and for nearly half of the individual stocks analyzed. The future of fisheries, however, could also be much worse than prior projections suggested if appropriate adaptations to potential productivity changes and climate-driven movement of species across management boundaries are not made. Maladaptive responses to the pending loss of a fishery or the arrival of a new fishery could exacerbate the previously projected direct effects of climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results suggest that climate change will force global fisheries to an important crossroads over the coming decades. Either we meet the challenges proactively with effective management or we risk undoing the significant progress that has been made in some countries (

  <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">
   <span class="italic">18</span>
  </a>) and further decimating fisheries in countries that have not yet enacted sound fishery reforms. The enormous contrasts between the four future management scenarios we explored suggest that the choice of management path will have profound consequences. One necessary choice will be how to reform current harvest policies. The possibility of a more prosperous future despite climate change depends on capturing the large untapped benefits from improving currently mismanaged fisheries.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses suggest that the benefits of enacting reforms today are cumulatively large enough to counter the future deleterious impacts of projected changes in fisheries productivity for most RCPs. Achieving this improved outcome is no small task since it involves reforms for many stocks with distinct fishery characteristics, each often fished by multiple countries. Management that flexibly adapts to productivity changes may require more frequent data collection and management updates, which can be costly. Fortunately, three factors help make a more prosperous future less daunting. First, case studies suggest that reform is possible for a range of fishery types, including high seas, large-scale, small-scale, data-rich, and data-poor. Pons 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">
   <span class="italic">19</span>
  </a>) found that high seas stocks under some form of management (generally commercially important species such as tuna) have shown improvements in biomass and decreases in fishing mortality over the last 10 years. In addition, management reforms in both large-scale fisheries (for example, Peru’s individual vessel quota reform for the anchoveta fishery) and small-scale fisheries (for example, fishery reforms in Mexico and Chile) suggest that reform is possible in many contexts, although specific interventions might vary depending on fishery characteristics (
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
   <span class="italic">17</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>). These examples also suggest that even countries with more limited resources are capable of greatly improving their fisheries management. Second, the necessary fishery reforms do not require the threat of climate change as motivation. Adaptive harvest rules that respond to available biomass can provide large benefits in both static and changing climates (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">
   <span class="italic">21</span>
  </a>). Therefore, reforms motivated purely by benefits today may also help buffer against negative productivity changes in the future. The third factor promoting improved global outcomes is the highly skewed distribution of fishery sizes. Because of the large variation in stock sizes, a large percentage of the potential global economic gains in this study can be achieved through the targeted reform of large overfished stocks. In our analysis, less than 10% of global stocks would need to adopt the most comprehensive reforms for future global profit to exceed current global profit. Therefore, although achieving the full benefits of global fisheries reform is an ambitious goal, strategic targeting of reform efforts could still generate major global benefits. Furthermore, a targeting approach that incorporates fishery size, value, and vulnerability to climate change may help to efficiently direct resources toward fisheries with the greatest potential for improved outcomes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second decision we will have to make is how to respond to shifting ranges. Spatial shifts across management boundaries can undermine well-designed policies and render promising management approaches unsuccessful. Transboundary fisheries already pose significant management challenges today and are often in worse shape than fisheries that reside entirely within individual countries’ waters (
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">
   <span class="italic">22</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" href="#R23">
   <span class="italic">23</span>
  </a>). As stocks begin to move more extensively, effective bilateral and multilateral cooperation will become increasingly important for effective management (
  <a rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" href="#R12">
   <span class="italic">12</span>
  </a>). Stock movement is ultimately beneficial to one country and detrimental to another, which changes the incentives to cooperate in effective management (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). Spatial shifts within a single country may also pose management challenges as stocks shift into and out of regional management zones—for example, the ongoing challenges from spatial shifts observed in stocks along the northeast United States (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). Designing institutions to address this inherently human challenge will be crucial given the extent of projected movement of fish stocks and the potentially enormous costs of inadequate responses. While it is encouraging that spatial and temporal stock structure is already measured in some cases, the existence of this information does not guarantee that this information will influence management decisions. In addition, accurately predicting where and when fish distributions will shift may be difficult. Therefore, international institutions and agreements will need to be flexible and robust in the face of uncertainty to effectively cope with these management disruptions as they arise. Improved international collaboration will be needed to adequately address climate-induced threats not only to fisheries but also to other natural resources for which climate change will have spatial and transboundary implications (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, although management responses can more than offset the projected direct effects of climate change on fisheries to create a more prosperous global future, there are three important qualifiers to this optimistic note. First, there are other potential direct (for example, acidification and other challenges to ocean productivity) and indirect (for example, novel species interactions) impacts of climate change that are not addressed by this analysis. These impacts will be important for assessing climate effects on fisheries at the local scale. Second, not everyone will share in these benefits. Globally, profits, yields, and biomass could increase, but for about half of the world’s individual fisheries, this better future appears unattainable. Even under the most optimistic scenario for human responses, roughly half of the world’s fisheries are projected to decline under a moderate climate change scenario (RCP 6.0). Most latitudes in the tropics are not expected to obtain higher profits in the future compared to today under RCP 6.0 even with fully adaptive management (fig. S9). The distribution of winners and losers warrants considerably more attention to anticipate and potentially offset the likely food and livelihood losses that could ensue. Finally, future outcomes depend critically on the pace and magnitude of climate change. Under the most extreme scenario, RCP 8.5, both profit and harvest decline relative to today even under the most optimistic assumptions about global fisheries management reforms. This result highlights the fact that the future of fisheries will depend largely on activities that occur outside of the fishing industry and the importance of greenhouse gas emission mitigation (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). For fisheries to realize their potential, it is critical for the global community to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions; otherwise, even the most ambitious fishery reforms will fall short. Therefore, a more prosperous future for fisheries depends on both mitigation of climate change and proactive fisheries management reforms.
