 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined the implications of climate change and management reform for 779 species stocks and 136 NEI stocks (mixed-species fisheries aggregated at the country level) located across the globe (see the Supplementary Materials for aggregation methods). To make these projections, we required estimates of the fishery’s current status and level of exploitation, as well as data on the current species’ distribution to forecast responses to climate velocity. To conform to the spatial resolution of the climate velocity model, we modeled each species as a single “stock” and referred to these as “species stocks.” The 779 species stocks are comparatively data-rich relative to the global pool of fisheries. To explore a more globally representative sample, we also included 136 stocks aggregated at the country level that represent NEI stocks, as defined in Costello

   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). Each stock’s parameters, which include current biomass, fishing mortality rate, and carrying capacity, were determined through an aggregation method (see the Supplementary Materials) that calculates aggregated stock parameters using individual fisheries in a global fisheries database (

   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). Using recently published estimates of current stock status paired with bioeconomic projection models, rather than solely exploring changes in maximum potential productivity [for example, (

  </a>,

   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>)], we examined how benefits and costs from potential management changes compare to potential losses from direct climate-driven changes.

   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>) at 5-year intervals using a slightly modified version of the climate velocity model described in García Molinos 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>). This method assumes that species ranges track climate, expanding or contracting their range to keep up with changes in their thermal niche, conditioned to their inferred thermal and depth tolerances. To improve on the original model (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>), species’ trajectories were restricted based on the species’ depth range (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>) using global bathymetry data (ETOPO2v2 2-Minute Gridded Global Relief Data). Briefly, each cell within a species’ range was spatially projected forward in time based on corresponding mean annual sea surface temperature isotherm trajectories (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>). Isotherm trajectories were dictated by the speed and direction of cell-specific climate velocities (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>), based on multimodel ensemble means for the four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change RCPs: 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 (see the Supplementary Materials). Species’ ranges were recalculated at the end of each 5-year interval based on those trajectories and species’ thermal tolerance and depth range (see the Supplementary Materials).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, we converted projected changes in range size to changes in carrying capacity for each species stock over time (see the Supplementary Materials). An annual carrying capacity was calculated by interpolating between each 5-year interval. These changes in carrying capacity then drove predictable changes in maximum sustainable yield. Changes in range size cannot be projected for NEI stocks using the same methodologies, since they are composites of several species. To determine the carrying capacity trajectory for NEI stocks, we first aggregated total range by nation (including all species with range in a given nation) for each 5-year interval and then interpolated to obtain the annual aggregate range values for each nation. We then calculated annual changes in aggregate range for each nation, relative to year 2012. These relative changes were then applied to NEI stock carrying capacities. Finally, we projected future biomass, harvest, and profit under different management and climate scenarios using a bioeconomic model (

   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>). This modeling approach was modified from the original by incorporating the unique stream of future carrying capacity values over time for each species and NEI stock (see the Supplementary Materials). Each year, biomass was calculated using a modified Pella-Tomlinson surplus production model, incorporating the projected carrying capacity in each time step (
