Birds foraged over the continental shelf in waters &lt;1000 m deep, thereby remaining within the core of the Southern Benguela upwelling region (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g003" href="#pone.0210328.g003">Fig 3</a>). Their total home-range extended roughly 100 km west, and 200 km southeast of the breeding colony, with a strong focus on an area situated directly west of the breeding site (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vessel encounter rates were determined for 20 birds equipped with XGPS (including one incomplete track due to battery failure). Thirteen gannets detected a radar signal. These birds travelled farther from the colony (average maximum range from the colony 121±52 km, n = 12 excluding the incomplete track) compared with trips when no radar was detected (68±27 km, n = 7, t = -2.917, df = 17, p = 0.01). For those 13 trips with recordings, radar signals were detected on 25±31 scans (median 10, max 98) conducted every minute. Overall, radar detections represented only 1.4% (range 0–3.8%) of foraging trip duration (but note that foraging trips also include non-feeding activities, such as commuting). Combining positive radar scans separated by less than 1 h without any detection, 28 radar “encounters” were detected.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thirteen were classified as encounters without attendance based on short detection periods by birds flying at commuting flight speeds (average speed 47±11 km.h
   <span class="sup">-1</span>, encounter duration 3.5±4.2 min, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g004" href="#pone.0210328.g004">Fig 4</a>). Eight encounters by six birds were categorized as short attendance, because the birds’ average speed decreased (6.5±5.5 km.h
   <span class="sup">-1</span>), consistent with foraging behaviour, but the interactions were of limited duration (&lt;10 min). The remaining seven encounters by five birds were deemed to be “true” attendance behaviour to vessels based on their long duration (average 1.7±1.2 h, range 0.47–3.9 h, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g004" href="#pone.0210328.g004">Fig 4</a>) and low average travel speeds (13.0±4.3 km.h
   <span class="sup">-1</span>), which are typical speeds of fishing vessels (appreciably slower than merchant shipping, which is the other major category of shipping in these waters). The proportion of locations with an apparent speed &lt; 10 km.h
   <span class="sup">-1</span> (suggestive of sitting on water, as evidenced by night-time speeds: 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g004" href="#pone.0210328.g004">Fig 4</a>) was higher during these attendance periods than on average during daytime (Wilcoxon test: W = 9, p&lt;0.001, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g004" href="#pone.0210328.g004">Fig 4</a>). However only 29±14% of the duration of such encounters with “true” vessel attendance was spent within radar detection range. These attendance periods occurred within shelf waters, close to the 500 m isobaths, west and southwest of the colony, where trawling is fairly regular (Figs
