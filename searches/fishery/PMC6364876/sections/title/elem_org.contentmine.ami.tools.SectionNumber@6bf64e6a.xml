 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contradiction with our hypothesis, foraging Cape gannets studied in the Benguela seldom encountered vessels in 2017, and even more rarely attended them for prolonged periods. This surprizing result can be explained through marked dietary plasticity, and has important implications for our understanding of seabird resilience and conservation in perturbed marine environments.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dietary switch</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the marine realm, some seabirds are known for their dietary plasticity [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref024">24</a>], with recurrent dietary switches following fishery-induced perturbations [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref025">25</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref028">28</a>]. This is precisely what we found in Cape gannets. During our study period, birds breeding on Malgas Island fed within their usual home-range off the west coast of South Africa (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g003" href="#pone.0210328.g003">Fig 3</a>; [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref023">23</a>]), and their foraging parameters were comparable to those observed across the last decade [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref016">16</a>]. Yet, surprisingly, they exclusively caught saury. Cape gannets normally favour sardines whenever available and switch to fishery waste (mainly hake) in the absence of their preferred prey [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref016">16</a>]. Saury occurs irregularly in Cape gannet diet [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref013">13</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref022">22</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref029">29</a>]. It favours warmer waters (18–22°C) than anchovy and sardine, which typically frequent upwelled waters (SST &lt;16°C; [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref030">30</a>]). The presence of saury close to the west coast of South Africa might therefore be a sign of reduced upwelling activity. However, the SST within the core home-range of foraging Cape gannets has been consistently &gt;16°C during early chick-rearing (Oct-Nov) across the last decade (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g008" href="#pone.0210328.g008">Fig 8</a>), providing no support for abnormal conditions in 2017.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because saury occur irregularly and in small schools [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref031">31</a>], they are not exploited commercially in South Africa. Hence, Cape gannets targeting them are unlikely to forage in the vicinity of fishing vessels. The calorific value of saury (6.2 kJ.g
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) is intermediate between that of sardines (8.6 kJ.g
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) and hake (4.1 kJ.g
   <span class="sup">−1</span>; [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref032">32</a>]), and diet calorific value strongly constrains gannet reproductive performance [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref017">17</a>]. This potentially explains why gannets breeding on Malgas, facing a scarcity of sardines, switched to feeding on locally abundant saury, rather than fishery waste made available by hake trawlers. Dietary plasticity thus allows the gannets to maintain adult body condition and adequate chick growth rates (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g002" href="#pone.0210328.g002">Fig 2</a>; see [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref016">16</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref033">33</a>] for further information on inter-annual trends). Saury has also been found in Cape gannet diet in Namibia [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref034">34</a>], and is profitable prey for other Benguela seabirds, as indicated by a recent study [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref035">35</a>] in greater crested terns (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishing vessel avoidance</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly few vessel detections occurred in gannets carrying XGPS recorders (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g004" href="#pone.0210328.g004">4</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g005" href="#pone.0210328.g005">5</a>). This may seem puzzling considering the fact that Cape gannets share their home-range with two fishing fleets (trawlers and purse-seiners; Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g006" href="#pone.0210328.g006">6</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g007" href="#pone.0210328.g007">7</a>). As mentioned in the introduction, previous analyses combining gannet GPS-tracking with fishing vessel tracking via VMS, did show that birds avoided purse-seiners, with which they compete for small pelagic fish [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref012">12</a>]. Yet, Tew-Kai and colleagues [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref012">12</a>] also found that gannets actively sought, and followed trawlers, as a source of hake fishing waste when small pelagic fish were scarce. In the present study, only five of 20 birds carrying XGPS displayed prolonged attendance at vessels, and that for &lt; 4% of their foraging time. These results are coherent with a seabird diet dominated by saury, which the birds could exploit without approaching vessels.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cape gannets naturally balance their harvesting pressure across a range of potential prey, according to their availability and profitability [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref036">36</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref037">37</a>]. Scarcity of particular prey types, including the most profitable ones, can arise from competition with other predators, including fisheries. Our findings occur in a marine ecosystem transformed by global changes, notably industrial fisheries and climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref038">38</a>]. In this context, prey switching is a strong indicator of reduced availability of sardines, which should be naturally abundant considering high primary and secondary productivity in the Benguela upwelling region, and used to be the food base of millions of Benguela seabirds [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref014">14</a>]. Our results are coherent with reports on the 2017 state of South African hake trawl and small pelagic fisheries [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref039">39</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref041">41</a>]. Indeed, those show that hake catches remained between ca. 130,000–140,000 tonnes across 2012–2016, and total allowable catch (TAC) was set to 140,125 tonnes for 2017 (despite decreasing hake recruitment). This strongly suggests sustained supply of fishery wastes to Cape gannets. On the contrary, a June 2017 sardine recruitment biomass survey found “the second lowest measured since May 2008 amounting to just over 23 000 tonnes and substantially lower than the long term average of ~143 000 tonnes”. Therefore, a sardine TAC of ca. 58,700 tonnes was recommended, but the effective 2017 TAC for sardines was set at ca. 86,700 tonnes. Overall, these figures point to diminishing sardine availability to Cape gannets, and to persistent competition with small pelagic purse-seine fisheries.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Management implications</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seabirds and other top predators are likely to perform dietary switches, and this response conforms with optimal foraging theory [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref042">42</a>]. Such plasticity linked to foraging sustainability thresholds explains why natural predators seldom overharvest a resource. By comparison, fisheries, as they are currently operated, are less flexible, because they are driven by the value of specific products (e.g. bluefin tuna [
   <span class="italic">Thunnus thynnus]</span>), by subsidies artificially inflating fleet sizes, harvesting range and effort, and by corruption [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref043">43</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our work throws a new light on behavioural responses of Cape gannets confronted with a shifting prey base, and onto environmental management in the Benguela. Notably, seabird dietary plasticity complicates the parameterisation of ecosystem models, and environmental management. Indeed, models are often built using set functional relationships describing numerical responses of seabirds to the availability of specific prey [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref007">7</a>]. Diet switches and foraging plasticity as demonstrated in our study distort these functional relationships [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref044">44</a>]. For example, in Cape gannets, an ecosystem model could predict decreased breeding success as a consequence of sardine shortage. The use of saury as an alternative resource challenge this assumption.
