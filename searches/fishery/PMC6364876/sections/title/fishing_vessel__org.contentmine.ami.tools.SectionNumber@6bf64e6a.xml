 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surprisingly few vessel detections occurred in gannets carrying XGPS recorders (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g004" href="#pone.0210328.g004">4</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g005" href="#pone.0210328.g005">5</a>). This may seem puzzling considering the fact that Cape gannets share their home-range with two fishing fleets (trawlers and purse-seiners; Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g006" href="#pone.0210328.g006">6</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g007" href="#pone.0210328.g007">7</a>). As mentioned in the introduction, previous analyses combining gannet GPS-tracking with fishing vessel tracking via VMS, did show that birds avoided purse-seiners, with which they compete for small pelagic fish [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref012">12</a>]. Yet, Tew-Kai and colleagues [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref012">12</a>] also found that gannets actively sought, and followed trawlers, as a source of hake fishing waste when small pelagic fish were scarce. In the present study, only five of 20 birds carrying XGPS displayed prolonged attendance at vessels, and that for &lt; 4% of their foraging time. These results are coherent with a seabird diet dominated by saury, which the birds could exploit without approaching vessels.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cape gannets naturally balance their harvesting pressure across a range of potential prey, according to their availability and profitability [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref036">36</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref037">37</a>]. Scarcity of particular prey types, including the most profitable ones, can arise from competition with other predators, including fisheries. Our findings occur in a marine ecosystem transformed by global changes, notably industrial fisheries and climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref038">38</a>]. In this context, prey switching is a strong indicator of reduced availability of sardines, which should be naturally abundant considering high primary and secondary productivity in the Benguela upwelling region, and used to be the food base of millions of Benguela seabirds [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref014">14</a>]. Our results are coherent with reports on the 2017 state of South African hake trawl and small pelagic fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref039">39</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref041">41</a>]. Indeed, those show that hake catches remained between ca. 130,000–140,000 tonnes across 2012–2016, and total allowable catch (TAC) was set to 140,125 tonnes for 2017 (despite decreasing hake recruitment). This strongly suggests sustained supply of fishery wastes to Cape gannets. On the contrary, a June 2017 sardine recruitment biomass survey found “the second lowest measured since May 2008 amounting to just over 23 000 tonnes and substantially lower than the long term average of ~143 000 tonnes”. Therefore, a sardine TAC of ca. 58,700 tonnes was recommended, but the effective 2017 TAC for sardines was set at ca. 86,700 tonnes. Overall, these figures point to diminishing sardine availability to Cape gannets, and to persistent competition with small pelagic purse-seine fisheries.
