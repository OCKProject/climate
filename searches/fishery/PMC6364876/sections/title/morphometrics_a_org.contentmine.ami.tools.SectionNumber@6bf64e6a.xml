 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult Cape gannets raising 2–4 week-old chicks were caught at the nest and handled in &lt;10 min, whenever possible in the shade to avoid over-heating, and covering their heads to minimize stress. Adult body mass (±10 g) and wing length (±1 mm) were measured, and a body condition index calculated as body mass divided by wing length (g.mm

  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref016">16</a>]. Some of the handled adults regurgitated food. These prey items were sampled opportunistically across the study period, and identified to species level. Prey item occurrence was used to calculate diet composition based on frequency of occurrence. The same sampling method had been used during the same time period and phase of the Cape gannet breeding cycle in previous years, allowing a comparison of the percentage of occurrence of the different prey items in their diet. This diet can change across the breeding period [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref022">22</a>], and hence our data and conclusions concern the early stage of the breeding season only. Growth parameters of gannet chicks were determined during their linear growth phase, following Cohen and colleagues [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref016">16</a>]: We calculated the difference in a chick’s mass between two consecutive measurements divided by the number of days between those two measurements. This growth rate was averaged when more than two measurements were taken per individual. Adult body condition indexes and chick growth rates were compared using GLMs with data collected through a standardized protocol (same colony, same time of year and same methodology in 2012–2015, including diet sampling; see [
