 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seabirds and other top predators are likely to perform dietary switches, and this response conforms with optimal foraging theory [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref042">42</a>]. Such plasticity linked to foraging sustainability thresholds explains why natural predators seldom overharvest a resource. By comparison, fisheries, as they are currently operated, are less flexible, because they are driven by the value of specific products (e.g. bluefin tuna [
  <span class="italic">Thunnus thynnus]</span>), by subsidies artificially inflating fleet sizes, harvesting range and effort, and by corruption [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our work throws a new light on behavioural responses of Cape gannets confronted with a shifting prey base, and onto environmental management in the Benguela. Notably, seabird dietary plasticity complicates the parameterisation of ecosystem models, and environmental management. Indeed, models are often built using set functional relationships describing numerical responses of seabirds to the availability of specific prey [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref007">7</a>]. Diet switches and foraging plasticity as demonstrated in our study distort these functional relationships [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref044">44</a>]. For example, in Cape gannets, an ecosystem model could predict decreased breeding success as a consequence of sardine shortage. The use of saury as an alternative resource challenge this assumption.
