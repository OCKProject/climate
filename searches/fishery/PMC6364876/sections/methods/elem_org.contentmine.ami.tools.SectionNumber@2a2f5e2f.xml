 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study was conducted between the 24th of October and the 6
  <span class="sup">th</span> of November 2017 on Malgas Island (33.05° S, 17.93° E) in the Western Cape, South Africa, which hosts some 19,000 breeding pairs of Cape gannets, this population having decreased from more than 50,000 pairs in the late 1990s [
  <a rid="pone.0210328.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref021">21</a>]. All experiments were performed under permit from South African National Parks with respect to animal ethics (N° RYAP/AGR/001–2002/V1).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult Cape gannets raising 2–4 week-old chicks were caught at the nest and handled in &lt;10 min, whenever possible in the shade to avoid over-heating, and covering their heads to minimize stress. Adult body mass (±10 g) and wing length (±1 mm) were measured, and a body condition index calculated as body mass divided by wing length (g.mm

   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref016">16</a>]. Some of the handled adults regurgitated food. These prey items were sampled opportunistically across the study period, and identified to species level. Prey item occurrence was used to calculate diet composition based on frequency of occurrence. The same sampling method had been used during the same time period and phase of the Cape gannet breeding cycle in previous years, allowing a comparison of the percentage of occurrence of the different prey items in their diet. This diet can change across the breeding period [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref022">22</a>], and hence our data and conclusions concern the early stage of the breeding season only. Growth parameters of gannet chicks were determined during their linear growth phase, following Cohen and colleagues [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref016">16</a>]: We calculated the difference in a chick’s mass between two consecutive measurements divided by the number of days between those two measurements. This growth rate was averaged when more than two measurements were taken per individual. Adult body condition indexes and chick growth rates were compared using GLMs with data collected through a standardized protocol (same colony, same time of year and same methodology in 2012–2015, including diet sampling; see [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adult Cape gannets were fitted with one of two devices:</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) GPS-logger (CatTrack1, Catnip Technologies, Hong-Kong, PRC, 70×32×15 mm, 30 g, 1.2% of bird body mass) attached to the lower back with waterproof Tesa tape, which recorded position and speed at 30-sec intervals.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(2) XGPS logger (Sextant Technology, New Zealand, 110×40×20 mm, 45 g, 1.7% of bird body mass) to record GPS locations every 1 min, but also to detect interactions between animals and vessels at sea by measuring Radar emission in the 9.41GHz X radar band which is used by marine radars. Radar signals are detected by an omnidirectional micro-strip antenna that integrates the signal over 30-sec every minute. Using the same devices, previous work [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref020">20</a>] validated the method and showed that all vessels within 5 km of tracked wandering albatrosses (
   <span class="italic">Diomedea exulans</span>) were detected. Devices were recovered after 1–2 foraging trips lasting a few hours to 7 days. Bird handling and tracking using these procedures does not have a measurable impact on foraging behaviour [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref023">23</a>]. We caught adult birds at-random from the colony. Cape gannets are monomorphic and share breeding duties at the nest. Hence there are no reasons to believe that one sex may have been preferentially caught, based on its appearance or accessibility.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All recorded GPS tracks were resampled over 1-min intervals to harmonize the two data sets, and analysed following Grémillet and colleagues [
   <a rid="pone.0210328.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0210328.ref023">23</a>], who studied the same species. We thereby mapped seabird at-sea home-ranges (90% kernel contours) and calculated foraging trip duration, foraging path length, average foraging speed and maximum distance to the colony. From XGPS data, we examined the temporal distribution of successive radar detections, and grouped detections within 1 h of each other as the same vessel “encounter”. For each of these encounters, we extracted encounter duration (time between first and last boat radar detection without any gap &gt; 1h, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210328.g001" href="#pone.0210328.g001">Fig 1</a>), average bird speed, and the proportion of locations associated with a radar detection, between the first and last radar detection of the encounter. Observed co-variations in average speeds and encounter durations were used to visually categorize encounters in their likelihood to be “true” attendance when birds feed at vessels (see 
   <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec006" href="#sec006">Results</a>). Average values are reported ± SD.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data relative to the catch distribution of trawlers targeting hake and purse-seiners targeting anchovy and sardines were not available for our study period. We inferred the general distribution of operations for the two fishing fleets by mapping the catches as recorded in vessel log-books during 2008–2015 (10 x 10 nautical mile scale for purse-seiners; 20 x 20 nautical mile scale for trawlers). These data were made available by the branch: Fisheries Management of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SST (°C) data were extracted from Aqua MODIS satellite imagery, with a 4 km-resolution grid (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Ocean Ecology Laboratory, Ocean Biology Processing Group; (2018): Aqua MODIS Sensor Ocean Color Data, NASA OB.DAAC.). Average SST was calculated for October-November each year across 2007–2017, within the core (90% UD) of Cape gannet at-sea home-range as determined through GPS-tracking during the 2007–2017 breeding seasons.</p>
