 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because our research involved human subjects, Michigan State University’s institutional review board reviewed and approved our research prior to the start of research (#07–504). Literacy rates are low in our study communities, and therefore with the approval of Michigan State University’s IRB, verbal consent was obtained from all participants before conducting household surveys. While obtaining verbal consent, the purpose and procedures of the research were explained as well as potential benefits, risks, and alternatives to participation for respondents. If verbal consent was provided, survey enumerators indicated so on a consent form before initiating the survey.</p>
