 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Farming and fishing exit and entry decisions during a period of rapid globalization showed strong spatial and temporal patterns in Nicaragua's Pearl Lagoon Basin. Households in communities nearer to the new road were less likely to exit fishing–despite a deteriorating fishery throughout the lagoon–as compared to households farther from the road. This result is contrary to prior work finding fishers more willing to exit under hypothetical declines in catch [
  <a rid="pone.0186683.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref034">34</a>], while corroborating more recent findings that fishers, again in response to hypothetical scenarios, were less willing to exit in communities with greater infrastructure and economic activity [
  <a rid="pone.0186683.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref036">36</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lagoon fisheries have been in a continual state of decline since the early 1990s, reflected by declining biomass, mean trophic level, landings, and catch per unit effort. Over this same period, mean gear size, transport capacity, the number of boat motors, and the number of fish buyers have increased [
  <a rid="pone.0186683.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref012">12</a>]. The observed spatial patterns in livelihood changes appear to be driven by dissimilar access to new markets. At its terminus, the road has generated new opportunities for fishermen near the town of Pearl Lagoon by increasing access to Pacific-based markets and fish buyers. East Asian demand has also driven market development for blue crab [
  <a rid="pone.0186683.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref031">31</a>], sharks and rays (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186683.g006" href="#pone.0186683.g006">Fig 6</a>). The authors have also witnessed a growing market for jellyfish and sea cucumber. Interestingly, the only distant community with increasing participation in fishing (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186683.g003" href="#pone.0186683.g003">Fig 3</a>), however slight, was Orinoco, the largest and most developed of the four distant communities. Orinoco has more frequent and rapid boat transportation to the market towns of Pearl Lagoon and Bluefields, and road vendors have established purchase agreements with local fish buyers and the Orinoco fish cooperative (K. Stevens, unpublished data). The marked differences in prices received by fishers in communities nearer and farther from the new road for the most commonly caught species (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186683.g005" href="#pone.0186683.g005">Fig 5</a>) are further evidence that market access is an important driver of fishers’ livelihood decisions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared to the marine sector, road completion has not generated comparable market opportunities for agriculture [
  <a rid="pone.0186683.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref031">31</a>]. Very few farming households sell their products to road vendors, and a majority sell none of the nine most commonly grown crops (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186683.g007" href="#pone.0186683.g007">Fig 7</a>). In addition, many agricultural products sold by vendors from the Pacific and Highland regions of Nicaragua are being imported more cheaply. Thus, local farmers may face greater competition, particularly in communities nearer the road. This may explain why farmers in distant communities were less likely to exit. But, as local farmers primarily grow for their own consumption, other reasons might explain spatially-driven, farmer exit decisions beyond greater competition.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A greater reluctance to exit farming in distant communities may be tied to food security. Our results provide modest support for this conclusion. First, farming in distant communities may act as a food security safety net while declining marine resources become increasingly difficult to capitalize farther from the road [
  <a rid="pone.0186683.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref043">43</a>]. This is evidenced by our finding that farmers with greater food self-sufficiency in 2010 were less likely to exit in 2012. Households in communities nearer the road rely more heavily on purchased food, disincentivizing farming. Finally, increasing immigration by Mestizos may incentivize active use of farm land in distant communities in order to secure land susceptible to the advancing agricultural frontier amid weak property rights and poor title enforcement (K. Stevens, personal communication).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to spatially-driven variation in market dynamics at the community-level, household-level characteristics also affected coastal livelihood transitions. An increase in household wealth was the most important predictor of entering fishing. Similarly, larger households were associated with greater odds of entering fishing, which requires both economic and labor investments. While local farmers can freely access communal lands and engage in small-scale, non-mechanized agriculture with few inputs [
  <a rid="pone.0186683.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref043">43</a>], fishers have greater capital costs in gear and fuel. Households with greater assets may be freer to engage in riskier endeavors, like investment in an increasingly commercialized yet declining fishery.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crop diversity was associated with smaller odds of exiting farming. Crop diversity may bolster household resilience to dynamic markets and natural resource fluctuations [
  <a rid="pone.0186683.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref044">44</a>], thus incentivizing households to remain in farming despite the risks associated with increasing ties to external markets. While the parameter estimate for the effect of catch diversity on fishing exit was also negative, there was little support for this relationship (RI = 0.50 and 95% CI = -0.72 to 0.11). While the livelihoods of fishing and farming showed clear spatial patterns among near and distant communities, there was little interaction between these livelihoods at the household level. Engagement in forest product collection, however, did correlate with household farming and fishing decisions. Households participating in forest product gathering were more likely to enter farming and less likely to exit both farming and fishing. Because farm land is interspersed with secondary forest, it is convenient for farmers to gather forest products. For fishers, on the other hand, forest product gathering may diminish the risks associated with increasingly commercialized yet declining fisheries.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that increased market access and related price differentials for natural resource products are a critical driver of changing livelihoods on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. However, other explanations should be considered. Land availability differs somewhat between communities nearer and farther from the new road. In nearer communities, new farming entrants are likely to have to travel farther to access their plots, but land is available. At the same time, however, communities farther from the road also face constraints to accessing new plots due to Mestizo colonization. Additionally, while our analyses attempted to control for differences due to ethnicity, this was based on language, rendering us unable to distinguish between Garifuna and Creole people. The northern communities of Orinoco, Brown Bank, and La Fe all have large Garifuna communities whereas Pearl Lagoon, Awas, and Raitipura have large Creole and Miskitu populations. However, Kakabila, also a northern community, has a significant Miskitu population, and thus the extent to which ethnicity tracks with our distinction between near and far communities is good but not perfect. Also, as Williams [
  <a rid="pone.0186683.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref032">32</a>] notes, ethnicity is often a “fluid, socio-political identity that shapes and is shaped by opportunities and constraints.” Still, we acknowledge the possibility that ethnicity plays a larger role in explaining livelihood decisions than we are able to explain. Similarly, our categorization of communities near and distant to the new road precludes an analysis of characteristics unique to each community that may drive exit and entry decisions. For example, among distant communities, wealth may demonstrate a different relationship with household livelihood decisions. The small populations of many of our study communities along with small samples after dividing our original sample by seven communities, by farming and fishing households, and by livelihood decision (i.e. exit and entry), makes intra-community analysis difficult. Finally, as noted above, communities near and distant to the new road differ in many ways in addition to market access including wealth, farm size, food self-sufficiency, and livelihood diversity (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186683.g004" href="#pone.0186683.g004">Fig 4</a>), and some of these differences may have existed prior to the completion of the new road. The larger town of Bluefields, for example, south of our study communities, is accessible by boat from each of our study communities and was so prior to the road. Undoubtedly, however, over the study period, a major driving force affecting and differentiating our study communities, based on several years of personal communications with area residents and observations by the authors, is the road.
