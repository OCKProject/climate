  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Household surveys were completed in July of 2010 and 2012. Approximately 540 households were sampled in seven communities around the lagoon. In communities with more than 100 residents (Pearl Lagoon, Raitipura-Awas, Orinoco), we randomly sampled households while completing full censuses in the other communities. Trained students from a local university conducted face-to-face, 90–120 minute interviews covering household demographics, income and budget, material wealth, travel and communication habits, migration, social networks and relations, and livelihoods including detailed information on hunting, forest product gathering, fishing, and farming.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between the years 2010 and 2012, local, trained, research assistants collected trip and catch data for roughly 4,000 fishing trips by fishermen in six of seven of our study communities. Data collected included dates and locations of trips, fishing gear, fishing partners, and catch details including number, weight, proportion sold to market, and price received for each species.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed exit and entry decisions for farming and fishing households between the years 2010 and 2012 using logistic regression. For example, of the households not farming in July 2010 (i.e. first household survey), we modeled their entry decision after July 2010 but prior to July 2012 (i.e. second household survey). Similarly, of the households engaged in farming in 2010, we modeled their subsequent exit decisions prior to July 2012. While prior research has examined entry and exit decisions of commercial fishers, little is known about these decisions among artisanal fishers, and what we do know is based on fishers’ responses to hypothetical scenarios. These studies found that exit decisions were correlated with catch declines, greater material wealth, lower levels of infrastructure and economic vitality, greater livelihood diversity, lower catch values, and various demographic factors including age and educational attainment [
   <a rid="pone.0186683.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref034">34</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0186683.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref035">35</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0186683.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref036">36</a>]. Even less is known about livelihood changes among smallholder farmers in the developing world [
   <a rid="pone.0186683.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref022">22</a>] but similar to analyses of fishers, researchers often adopt a sustainable livelihoods approach [
   <a rid="pone.0186683.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0186683.ref037">37</a>] to understand these changes. Thus, households’ decisions to enter or exit farming likely depend on human capital (e.g. household size, age of household head, educational attainment of household head), natural capital (e.g. land ownership, land tenure), social capital (e.g. ethnicity, civic engagement), financial capital (e.g. household wealth), and physical capital (e.g. community infrastructure, market access). We consider these and other household- and community-level characteristic in our analyses of farm and fish exit and entry decisions on Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test our primary hypothesis that market access drives exit and entry decisions, we included a binary covariate (
   <span class="italic">Community</span>) for whether the household resided in one of three communities near the newly completed road (i.e. Pearl Lagoon, Awas, or Raitipura) or in one of the four distant communities (i.e. Kakabila, La Fe, Brown Bank, and Orinoco). The communities near the terminus of the new road are generally more developed and have greater access to markets via the road than communities farther away. In addition, as opposed to those nearer, communities far from the new road rely heavily on boat transportation to access markets and road vendors. Testing our hypothesis that engagement in other natural-resource based livelihoods drive exit and entry decisions, we included covariates for households’ ranking of the importance of 
   <span class="italic">Fishing</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Farming</span> in their livelihood portfolio and a binary covariate for engagement in forest product gathering (
   <span class="italic">Forest</span>). Finally, we consider various household characteristics including the head of household’s educational attainment (
   <span class="italic">Education)</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Age</span>, the proportion of food self-provided by the household as a measure of 
   <span class="italic">Food Self-Sufficiency</span>, the total number of household members (
   <span class="italic">Household Size</span>), and 
   <span class="italic">Civic Engagement</span> as measured by the extent of their participation in various social activities (e.g. food and labor sharing, money lending, childcare, voting etc.). We include a nominal covariate for 
   <span class="italic">Ethnicity</span> as determined by the head of household’s mother tongue based on Jamieson's work in the region suggesting that Miskito people were less driven by individual-oriented activities (e.g. market activities) than the Creole. While this variable is able to distinguish between Mestizo, Creole, and Miskito peoples, it cannot distinguish between the Garifuna and Creole, both of whom mainly speak Creole. Using principle component analysis, we developed a material wealth index based on the household’s possession of various goods and considered the change in wealth between 2010 and 2012 (
   <span class="italic">Household Wealth</span>). We included a binary variable for 
   <span class="italic">Migration</span> which indicates whether any household member migrated outside the community in that year. Finally, modeling exit decisions, we included measures of 
   <span class="italic">Catch Diversity</span>, the number of different marine products caught
   <span class="italic">; Crop Diversity</span>, the number of different crops grown; and 
   <span class="italic">Farm Tenure</span>, the number of years since the household first farmed their primary plot (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0186683.t001" href="#pone.0186683.t001">Table 1</a>). In preliminary bivariate analyses, we tested for differences in other household capitals between entrants and non-entrants as well as between those exiting and not exiting each livelihood. Finding no significant differences, we subsequently eliminated farm area, fishing gear (i.e. crab traps, gill nets, and cast nets), livelihood diversity, and remittances from further analysis.
