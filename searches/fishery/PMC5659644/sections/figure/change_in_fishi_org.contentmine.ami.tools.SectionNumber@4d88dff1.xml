  <p>The change in the proportion of households engaging in farming and fishing livelihoods between 2010 and 2012 in seven study communities by increasing distance (bottom to top) to the newly completed road to Pearl Lagoon. The communities of Awas and Raitipura were treated as one community above due to their close proximity and shared kin networks.
