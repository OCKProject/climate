   <p>Table A. Physical and geochemical parameters used to internally force the Baltic Atlantis model.</p>
   <p>Table B. Summary of riverine + direct point source waterborne nitrogen loads applied to the Baltic Atlantis grid based on information from the Review of the Fifth Baltic Sea Pollution Load Compilation for the 2013 HELCOM Ministerial Meeting (HELCOM PLC-5.5). Nitrogen fractionation between DIN and DON based on Savchuk et al. (2012). Bioavailable fraction of DON assumed equal to labile DON as in Savchuk and Wolff (2009). Coastal retention fractions from Savchuk and Wolff (2009).</p>
   <p>Table C. Summary of key sources used to inform the biological module of Baltic Atlantis in relation to abundance and biomass, demography, prey-predator interaction and other functions.</p>

   <p>Table E. Maximum potential growth rates and clearance rates per age class of all vertebrate biological groups.</p>
   <p>Table F. Key biological rates calibrated for the invertebrate groups.</p>
   <p>Table G. Biological functional group structure of the Baltic Atlantis model. Groups are categorized according to the ecosystem level they represent. Key species aggregated within a functional group are listed. The first species in each list is the representative one for that particular functional group. Groups that are currently “turned off”, and which do not play a role in the biological interactions, are marked with an asterisk (*).</p>
   <p>Table H. Summary of basic parameters describing the general behavior of biological groups in the model, used as input to the model.</p>
   <p>Table I. Relative cover of each polygon with 3 types of bottom abiotic habitats: bedrock, sand, mud, and a fourth abiotic habitat which corresponds to man-made structures such as wind-mill parks, pipelines etc.</p>
   <p>Table J. Total Stock Biomass, TSB (tonnes), and natural mortalities (M), target fishing mortalities (F) and TACs (tonnes) in 2012, for the seven species groups included in the FISHRENT model and TSB and F from the Atlantis model, also input for the FISHRENT model.</p>

   <p>Table L. Catch value and catch value distribution for the 9 Danish fleet segments operating in the Kattegat and/or the Western Baltic in 2012.The table shows that Netters and liners less than 12 meters, and Trawlers 12–15 meters, 15–18 meters and 18–24 meters cover more than 85% of the total catch value. It has therefore been decided to focus on these four fleet segments in the model evaluations.</p>
