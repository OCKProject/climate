 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When halving the fishing mortality, we did not see a doubling of the biomasses. This effect could be expected from a single species model, but not from an ecosystem model where the changes in fishing mortality results in changed biological interactions. As such, we for instance see cascading changes in the ecosystem food web which mitigate and buffer the effects. This is another reason that well-informed and evaluated complex ecosystem models are necessary to comprehend and project the full and long-term effects of changed fishing pressure.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cod and sprat functional groups show expected effects of increased biomass when fishing pressure decrease and vice versa. The smaller reaction of sprat in comparison to cod when halving the fishing mortality is because of the already low fishing mortality for sprat in the Atlantis model, i.e. 0.07 in 2005. When the maximum observed fishing pressure of cod and sprat observed in recent years stock assessments ([

This stronger effect, propagating over multiple trophic levels, is off course to be expected since there is a large difference between the fishing mortality of scenario #8 and #9 versus #10. However, the different fishing mortalities do not have the purpose of testing different management scenarios, rather trying to see whether the model is reacting to and realistically reflecting changes in fishing pressure, which is shown with this example.
