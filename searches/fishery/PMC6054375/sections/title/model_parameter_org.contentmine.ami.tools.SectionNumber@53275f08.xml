 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The system perspective supplied by the Baltic Atlantis model makes it a unique and useful tool for the region, enabling investigation of changes in eutrophication pressure while accounting for bio-physical interactions and feedbacks across all important trophic levels in all the basins of the Baltic. Nonetheless, the complexity of the nature of the interacting pressures on the system creates the limitation as it can be very difficult (even in a model) to separate the effects of a specific key factor, agent or process in the ecosystem, and quantitatively estimate its role under a given scenario. While the confounding can be somewhat controlled in the model it can not be completely removed as a faithful representation of the system requires a representation of the many interacting drivers. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the model parameterization cannot be equally well constrained for all groups and processes. When looking at Nephrops, they could potentially respond to drastic shifts in biomass levels of their main prey, i.e. detritus as well as benthic species. On the other hand, they may also be affected by oxygen depletion with respect to changed mortality or distribution. Although the model seems to capture those interactions, which are evaluated in the scenarios, estimates of Nephrops have showed that their biomass has remained surprisingly constant over the last decade or more [

In the long term, Nephrops have most likely increased in Kattegat according to field observations. The parameterization of these interactions and potential feedback effects is complex and difficult to comprehend and evaluate without a well-calibrated ecosystem model. Better constraints on the simulated ecosystem dynamics, while still accounting for complexity, can only be achieved by increasing the input information to the modelâ€”including data availability and promoting coordinated monitoring efforts in different regions across the Baltic Sea. See details in section B.2-C in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A lack of phosphorus cycling and cyanobacteria in the model also affects the model results in response to scenarios of reduced nutrient loading, especially in the Northern Baltic areas. While code now exists within the model framework for these components, it was not available in a timely manner and so has not yet been implemented for the Baltic. Cyanobacteria are likely to positively respond to significant reductions in nutrient inputs as they gain a relative advantage over diatoms, which primarily rely on the supply of new (non-regenerated) nutrients [

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref021">21</a>]. Prevalence of blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in the main sub-basins of the Baltic Sea implies that nitrogen fixation is an important process that slows down the recovery from a eutrophic state (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref016">16</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref081">81</a>]). However, the effects of this underrepresentation of nitrogen fixation is not expected to have an influence on the main commercial species such as cod, sprat and herring in the Baltic proper, Kattegat and Western Baltic areas, where the focus of the current implementation of the model is.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not only sources but also sinks of nitrogen are very well represented in HBM-ERGOM, and [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref082">82</a>] estimated that nitrogen removal by denitrification in sediments varied between 48 and 73% of the external nitrogen inputs delivered via rivers, coastal point sources and atmospheric deposition. In the Baltic Atlantis, in order to avoid a buildup of nutrients in some coastal boxes, especially along the eastern German and western Polish coasts (box #14), we introduced implicit decay terms of labile and refractory detritus to better balance the sources and sinks in the model. These processes are proxies for sediment burial and implicit effects of denitrification, adding to the likely underestimated model explicit denitrification, with overall aggregate sink rates being in line with the rates reported by [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several such aspects limit the model capability to evaluate the results of scenario analysis in absolute terms and in the short term. However, the model is still useful for longer term projections and its set-up enables us to identify key sensitive parameters for which we need more information or need to make the foci of sensitivity analyses and robustness testing. This is a very important capacity of the modelling approach and management evaluation framework applications in general.</p>
