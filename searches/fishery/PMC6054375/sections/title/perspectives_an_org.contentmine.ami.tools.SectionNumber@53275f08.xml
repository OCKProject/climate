 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a number of ongoing or planned developments within both Atlantis and the coupled framework. First of all, inclusion of more finely resolved vertical mixing will enable us to better capture the seasonal pattern of the nutrient distributions and processes such as changing mixed layer depth. This will enhance the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton and of oxygen mixing/non-mixing due to stagnation. Secondly, both levels and equilibrium of the production of the different functional groups will be evaluated besides the biomass in Atlantis. Next, the constant linear fishing mortality, applied equally across the whole Baltic Sea will be replaced in Atlantis by a spatial- and fleet specific fishing effort and mortality levels (resolved to the level of the spatial polygons in the model). This will also include information on fisheries economics such as revenue, costs and profit (Gross Value Added, GVA) to enable full fisheries economic analyses within the Atlantis model. Accordingly, the management- and economic module within the Atlantis model will be elaborated to avoid the need for an external bio-economic model and to dynamically model the feedbacks in the underlying processes. Lastly, the model sensitivity of the Atlantis model according to forcing from different bio-geo-chemical and hydrodynamic forcing models will be extensively explored.</p>
