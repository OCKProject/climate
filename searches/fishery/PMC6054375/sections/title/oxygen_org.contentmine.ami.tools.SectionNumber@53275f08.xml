 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Distinct benthic oxygen concentration increases were simulated in many areas according to nutrient load reductions, especially in the Western Baltic and the Baltic proper areas while less distinct in the deeper areas (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g011" href="#pone.0199168.g011">Fig 11</a>). Oxygen conditions in the bottom water layers improved with up to two to three times the amount of oxygen for scenario #4 and #5 compared with the baseline. Reducing the river load caused a reduced production of biomass which presumably lowered the need for oxygen in order to decompose all the organic matter. It must be emphasized though, that the benthic-pelagic coupling and sediment processes in general require further calibration and validation before we can apply a greater certainty to the above and below model output.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase of cod biomass might be linked with the increase in oxygen concentration for two reasons. First of all, benthic invertebrates have a higher survival chance due to the increased oxygen conditions. They are also the main food source for juvenile cod, especially the isopod

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref084">84</a>]. Secondly, the improved hydrographical conditions in the bottom water layers may have a positive effect on cod egg survival as it increases the reproductive volume [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref094">94</a>]. This is the volume of water in which the cod eggs develop and it is the key driver of its recruitment success. The reproductive volume is delimited by a concentration of oxygen &gt;2mL L-1 and a salinity of &gt;11 psu [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref094">94</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref096">96</a>]. While we didn’t explicitly represent oxygen effects on the egg and larval stage it would affect new settlers so the model captures some of the potential recruitment effects, but not all.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simulations mainly show an increase for the cod age-groups of 2–4 and rather than in the 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> age group. This implies that the increase in food sources for the juvenile cod has a larger effect than the higher survival of its eggs (Figure L in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>). So, despite an increased production for the benthic organisms, their total biomass decreased due to accentuated predation by juvenile cod.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anoxic zones have been known in the Baltic for long time and are severely impacting the ecosystem [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref096">96</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref100" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref100">100</a>], because benthic species are unable to escape. Anoxic zones cause severe losses on entire benthic communities, which are seen as one of the causes for changed levels of fish catches since the 1970s combined hydrographical driven fish recruitment patterns [
