 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a group of parameters that are unique to Atlantis, e.g. the availability of prey parameter, which is conceptually difficult to derive from stomach content data (see detailed discussion in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a> section B.2). Such parameters were therefore initially constrained using qualitative information and often adjusted substantially during the calibration process. When no information about realistic ranges of parameters were found, the robustness of the final calibrated value was evaluated using the emergent model results (i.e. diet composition) or through sensitivity analysis by changing ranges of the parameters. Tables D-F in the 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a> provide a summary of the final calibrated values assigned to the key biological parameters describing the structure and function of the ecosystem in the Baltic Atlantis for vertebrate and invertebrate groups, respectively.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other examples are the parameters for diffusive fluxes, which are calculated internally on top of advective fluxes. While we apply a constant vertical mixing rate across the majority of the model domain, these mixing rates needed to be adjusted in order to better simulate nutrient replenishment in the offshore surface waters. Other vertical transport processes occur across the water-sediment interface via bioirrigation and bioturbation of sediments, sediment resuspension and erosion; as well as in the water column via particle settling. Also horizontal and vertical light fields are calculated internally by the model. Daily and seasonal cycles of photosynthetically active radiation are obtained from calculations of the theoretical net incoming shortwave radiation at given longitude and latitude. The vertical extent of the light profile in the water column is an exponential decay function scaled by physical and biological light attenuation parameters (Table A in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>).
