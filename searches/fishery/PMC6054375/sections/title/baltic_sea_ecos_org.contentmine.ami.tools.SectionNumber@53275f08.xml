 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Understanding and quantifying the space- and time-varying intensity of human pressures and the resulting responses of marine ecosystems are essential for evaluating the impacts of human activities on the future provision of the goods and services we derive from the oceans [

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref004">4</a>]. The Baltic Sea ecosystem is subject to many interconnected and area specific pressures originating from natural changes and human activities (e.g. [

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref008">8</a>]), and human pressures are increasing [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref009">9</a>]. An initial holistic assessment of ecosystem health for 2003–2007 indicated that the majority of the Baltic Sea was in a state of "poor" or "bad" health [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref010">10</a>]. The area is geographically peripheral with respect to marine and freshwater conditions and low winter temperatures, and some ecosystem groups are therefore vulnerable to environmental changes [

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref012">12</a>]. Since the early 2000s, surface temperature has increased from an overall average of around 7°C to 9°C [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref013">13</a>] and salinity has decreased with varying magnitude across the basins [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref014">14</a>]. The Western Baltic Sea is characterized as a transition zone with temperature and salinity conditions that vary substantially both seasonally and annually depending on the magnitude of saline inflows [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref014">14</a>]. Eutrophication and pollution, partly due to run-off from land based activities, as well as ocean acidification and climate change induce environmental impacts in the Baltic Sea [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref005">5</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref006">6</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref011">11</a>]. However, so do fisheries, transport/shipping, renewable energy exploitation, gravel extraction, tourism, etc. These are other anthropogenic pressures that induce environmental impacts and also have socio-economic importance [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref005">5</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref009">9</a>]. Some of these pressures can be managed on national or local levels such as energy platforms, but several require a regionally, basin-wide integrated or even globally coordinated management approach because they have a wide spread distribution and are diffusive activities, e.g. fisheries and nutrient loads [

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref019">19</a>]. For example, despite measures taken to reduce national inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to the whole Baltic Sea, up to 18% from 1994 to 2010, the system is still characterized as highly eutrophic [

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref016">16</a>]. As the system doesn’t seem to recover, the Baltic Sea eutrophication problem is therefore increasing [
