 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NPV decrease is according to the model framework caused by the lowered catch possibilities given the lower biomass when nitrogen load reduction is imposed. However, a biomass decrease does not necessarily leads to a NPV decrease. Lowered catch possibilities can, in some cases, also lead to reduced fishing costs, and thus an increase in NPV. Furthermore, given the reduced catch possibilities which are different for the different species, reallocation of effort among fisheries may actually lead to higher catches overall and thus higher catch values for some fleets [

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref064">64</a>] in such a case the fisheries management system would not constrain the catches with TACs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though the Nephrops is a commercially high valuable species, its 10–20% reduction in biomass did not seem to have a linear response in the FISHRENT output as there was no difference in the NPV for the Kattegat area, where Nephrops is caught. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, Nephrops is a choke species in FISHRENT. This means that a vessel can be forced to stop fishing because it exhausted the quotas for Nephrops, despite underutilized quotas for other species. Accordingly the fishery and its outcomes are not directly dependent on the Nephrops stock biomass as it has a constant quota set, which cannot be exceeded. The likely reason why the decrease is most pronounced in Western Baltic is due to the decrease in the herring stock in scenario 3 as the TAC of herring is not choking. The quotas were kept constant and equal to the values in Table J in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>. Secondly, the FISHRENT model does not distinguish the fleets between the Western Baltic and the Kattegat, i.e. it considers the catches of the four fleets over a year in both areas. Thus, if less is caught of Nephrops leading to reduced NPVs for the fleet segments catching Nephrops this decrease is distributed proportionally on Kattegat and the Western Baltic according to the revenue and cost distribution keys.
