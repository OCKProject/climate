 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides fishery, eutrophication is a strong pressure on the Baltic Sea ecosystem. Studies of the biological effects of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea are numerous. Significant effects on primary production, both total area production and distribution in the water column, phytoplankton biomass, plankton community composition, water clarity and oxygen conditions have been documented (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref021">21</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref022">22</a>]). In [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref023">23</a>], modelling simulations exploring the potential effects of changing oxygen and nutrient load conditions on the benthic community in the Baltic Sea have been conducted, showing significantly changes in the biogeochemical functioning of the ecosystem. Direct effects of eutrophication on fish stock recruitment is not evidenced by a number of correlative studies and a literature review ([
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref024">24</a>], and references therein). The meta-analyses in [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref024">24</a>] finds only two fish stocks in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea where the recruitment dynamics can be related to changes in nutrient levels (Kattegat and Eastern Baltic cod). Accordingly, while there in the Baltic may be links between eutrophication and changes in fish stocks and fisheries the full chain of causality is yet to be documented. In contrast, a decrease in abundance of Baltic cod due to climate change (sea water temperature) has been documented (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref025">25</a>]). The complexity of the interactions also likely means that the direction of change is not uniform across species and/or regions [

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref026">26</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref028">28</a>]. In general, the main challenge in studies of complex systems is to find occurrences where one pressure at a time varies, all other being equal, which is usually impossible given the variety of human activities (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref008">8</a>]), as well as to integrate the ecosystem complexity adequately. Capturing this complexity is relevant in supporting different national and international policies and directives—such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU MSFD), the Water Framework Directive (EU WFD), the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) and the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive (EU MSP).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To consider several ecosystem drivers simultaneously, a possibility is to apply models that integrate a wide range of pressures and processes in a common framework that enables holistic evaluation [

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref007">7</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref008">8</a>]. To construct such models has several advantages: they tend to increase understanding of system dynamics within and across ecosystems, help identify major processes, drivers and responses, highlight major gaps in knowledge, and inform future monitoring schemes [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref002">2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref029">29</a>]. Furthermore, the final models make it possible to test management strategies virtually before they are implemented in reality [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref029">29</a>]. These so-called end-to-end or whole-of ecosystem models [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref030">30</a>], enable simulations of ecosystem dynamics and interactions from plankton to humans. Previous ecosystem modelling attempts in the Baltic include the EcoSim-EcoPath (EwE) modelling framework [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref031">31</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref033">33</a>]. [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref034">34</a>] used this framework to analyze trophic cascades and regimes shifts under scenarios of altered top-predator pressure as well as eutrophication (via assumed shifts in primary production). However, EwE has not been applied to the Western Baltic Sea, and explicit testing of eutrophication scenarios with EwE and its spatially-resolved Ecospace module would require linking with coupled physical-plankton models (e.g. POLCOMS-ERSEM) or with dedicated eutrophication models (e.g. Corps of Engineers Integrated Compartment Water Quality Model in Chesapeake Bay; [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref035">35</a>]). Another approach for testing ecosystem effects of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea involved linking the HBM-ERGOM bio-geo-chemical model (see below) and the Stochastic Multi Species (SMS) model (see below), providing a novel platform for operational ecology as part of the FP7 Marine OpEc project (
