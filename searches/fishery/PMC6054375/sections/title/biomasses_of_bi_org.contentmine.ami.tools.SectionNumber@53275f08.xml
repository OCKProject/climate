 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current calibrated version of the Atlantis implementation in the Baltic meets the goal of simulating a stable and balanced marine ecosystem where all biological functional groups survive from one model year to another in a long term equilibrium state with biomass levels close to the best available knowledge (Figure E in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>). Despite the increased biomass level for the model output of sprat, it was still accepted as the 2005 sprat assessed abundances was considerably lower than all other years in the assessment year range [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref083">83</a>]. In general, the model stability reached after the spin-up period (section B.5 in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>), is on a satisfactory level, however it should be noted that the available input data and information on the lower trophic levels are uncertain. Overall, the current calibration of the model can run uninterrupted for at least 120 simulation years, without any groups going extinct from year to year and season to season (Figure B in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The biomasses of most of the functional groups exhibit a seasonal oscillation around the same mean biomass level. Planktonic groups exhibit the largest seasonal variability as their biomasses change more rapidly with environmental changes. In our model, benthic organisms exhibit little if any seasonal variability which is in line with model results of [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref023">23</a>]. However, for Baltic benthic fauna, field observations reveal significant inter-annual variability in particular in response to prolonged changes in oxygen concentration and predation patterns. Furthermore, seasonal changes in coastal hypoxic conditions may also influence benthic biomass losses as perceived in the evaluation of the nutrient load scenarios (see below). A more complete picture of the interactions and flows between the different groups can be achieved by looking at the production instead of the biomass. This was however not possible in the current setting of the model. We argue though that, achieving equilibrium for the biomass for each of the functional groups, also means that the production is in equilibrium. This is because biomass would most likely not reach equilibrium if production is not in equilibrium.
