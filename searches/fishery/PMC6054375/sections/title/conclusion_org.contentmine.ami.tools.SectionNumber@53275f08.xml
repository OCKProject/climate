 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we have introduced a new calibrated Baltic Atlantis model and an integrated end-to-end modelling framework to examine ecosystem-wide responses under scenarios of human-induced changes in the Kattegat, Western Baltic Sea and southern Baltic proper regions with a focus on eutrophication, nutrient load reductions, and sensitivity to fishing pressure and climate factors. The Baltic Sea Atlantis model presented here for the first time forms the core of the established integrated framework. We have described the current setup of the framework with focus on the sensitivity of the Atlantis model to nutrient load reduction scenarios and fishing pressure changes; this demonstrates how the framework can be used to evaluate ecosystem and economic impacts: HBM-ERGOM, Baltic Atlantis and FISHRENT (noting that the FISHRENT KWB component of the framework only covers the Kattegat and the Western Baltic). Using four hypothetical eutrophication scenarios we demonstrated the capability of Atlantis and the framework to evaluate resulting changes in biological production and their long term biological consequences and economic impacts on the fishing catch sector, also taking into consideration fishing pressure as another anthropogenic impact. In light of the current assumptions and model limitations, we also have discussed the current and envisaged future improvements to the Atlantis model and the framework. The models have the potential to help evaluate conflicting objectives and alternative management strategies for better strategic management of human and natural pressures in relation to impacts on marine resources and in relation to an ecosystem based approach to management taking into consideration a sufficient complexity of processes and biological interactions in the ecosystem and the technical interactions in the fishery. They can also help with identifying knowledge gaps and recommendations for addressing them, e.g. regular benthos monitoring, and integrated data management for Baltic States.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Integrating marine ecosystem components for the purpose of providing integrated ecosystem advice currently relies primarily on an array of indicator-based assessment tools [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref107" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref107">107</a>]. In the Baltic Sea, ecosystem status is evaluated both as a response to an individual pressure (using HELCOM HEAT 3.0; [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref016">16</a>]) or as a cumulative effect of many pressures via an integrated ecosystem assessment (HELCOM HOLAS; [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref010">10</a>]). Such a purely statistical basis for advice can neither explain the underlying dynamics, processes, and mechanisms of change, nor can it project future responses to potential scenarios of altered pressures. Our proposed integrated (and in the long term perspective marine spatial planning and cross-sector) modelling platform offers means of an exploratory analysis of future scenarios of ecosystem-state responses to human-induced pressures, here demonstrated on the example of the eutrophication process impacting across fish stocks and fisheries. Further development of the Atlantis model and the modelling framework can be complementary to the indicator-based assessment tools (e.g. HELCOM HEAT and HOLAS tools) and, thus, be of interest to numerous stakeholders and policy makers interested in sustainable ecosystem-based management of marine resources in the Baltic Sea waters. In particular, the Atlantis-based framework can serve as a powerful holistic and long term strategic management strategy evaluation tool for such governing organizations as the ICES Working Group on Integrated Assessments of the Baltic Sea (ICES WGIAB) and their joint efforts with the HELCOM Group for the Implementation of the Ecosystem Approach (HELCOM GEAR), which has been established with the purpose of steering a managerial level process of successful implementation of the HELCOM BSAP. This is in order to help with meeting the ecological objectives and achieving good ecological/ environmental status of the Baltic Sea by 2021 at the latest.
