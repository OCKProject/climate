 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of the emergent fish dietary pattern are in accordance with our current knowledge. We can compare this to stomach data observations synthesized and modeled for example in the SMS model, previous estimates in mass balance models such as EwE (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref032">32</a>â€“
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref033">33</a>]), or reported diet and consumption estimates in published regional studies. The age-specific diet allows for a different diet for adults versus juveniles. So does the diet of adult cod consists of a greater proportion of larger planktivorous fish, such as sprat and herring (Figure F in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>, panel 4), while the diet of juvenile cod constitutes mainly of polychaetes and benthic crustaceans, such as the isopod 
  <span class="italic">Saduria entomon</span>, which is an important food source for the early life stages of cod [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref084">84</a>]. This is in general accordance with observations from stomach sampling programs and from SMS output [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref085">85</a>]. The results also indicate that the model is capable of incorporating bentho-pelagic couplings. Although we allow for a cod cannibalism interaction in the model, this process is still underestimated in the current model version. For a relatively small population of harbour porpoise in the Western Baltic, there are accurate data concerning their diet composition [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref086">86</a>]. As expected, cod constitute around 80% of the diet composition in the model with an underestimation of whiting, the second most important prey item (Figure F in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>, panel 1). The dietary patterns of the grey seal were observed from stomach sampling programs in the Baltic Proper and in the Gulf of Bothnia [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref087">87</a>]. Observations show that the majority of their diet consists of herring, with sprat and cod being the second most important prey species, followed by carps and perches. This is similar with the diets modelled with Atlantis, except that sprat is an equally important prey species next to herring for adult seals (Figure F in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>, panel 2). However, the study dated from 2010, and the geographical overlap between the species, partly due to change in seal distribution, has very likely changed over time compared to the 2005 situation (and may have changed even more since 2010).
