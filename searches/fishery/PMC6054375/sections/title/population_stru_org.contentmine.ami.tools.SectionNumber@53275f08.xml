 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of numbers per age group shows a realistic exponential decline for all the age disaggregated functional groups, where the youngest individuals of a population are prone to the highest mortality. The age distribution is most even for seals because they have the most homogeneous survival rates once they survive the first vulnerable year. The abundance of that first age group is determined by the recruitment. Considering that exact mechanisms controlling recruitment are still not fully understood despite abundant data available (e.g. cod; [
