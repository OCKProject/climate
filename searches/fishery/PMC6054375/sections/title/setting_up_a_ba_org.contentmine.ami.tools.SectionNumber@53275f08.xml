 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We present a new framework, with a Baltic implementation of the spatially-explicit end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model linked to two external models, to explore the different pressures on the marine ecosystem (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g001" href="#pone.0199168.g001">Fig 1</a>). Atlantis is used as the main and central part of a 3 part linked model system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first link is between a biogeochemical-hydrodynamic model and Atlantis. Detailed input for the hydrographic part of the Baltic Atlantis model is provided by the HBM-ERGOM model system (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g001" href="#pone.0199168.g001">Fig 1</a>) consisting of the 3D ocean circulation Hiromb-BOOS model (HBM) coupled to the biogeochemical and plankton production ERGOM model [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref055">55</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref057">57</a>]. This HBM-ERGOM model is in turn informed by the catchment models DK-QNP [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref058">58</a>] and HBV [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref059">59</a>] which deliver high spatial resolution information (1×1 km) on river discharge and nutrient loads. For the Danish areas, both the Atlantis model and the HBM-ERGOM model receive river data from the catchment model DK-QNP, for the other Baltic Sea rivers, the catchment model HBV or HELCOM data is used.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second link is between Atlantis and a bio-economic fisheries model. The Atlantis output of the terminal projection year feeds into the FISHRENT model (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g001" href="#pone.0199168.g001">Fig 1</a>), which is a bio-economic multi-fish-stock-multi-fishing-fleet-model for Kattegat and the Western Baltic fishery (FISHRENT KWB henceforth; [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref060">60</a>]).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The way the three models (HBM-ERGOM–Atlantis–FISHRENT) are connected is based on a one-way offline linking. Information is fed from one model to another without accounting for any potential dynamic coupling or feedback processes. Information about hydrodynamics obtained from the HBM-ERGOM model is passed on as input to the Baltic Atlantis for the 2005 calibration year, and information about changes in biological production obtained from the Baltic Atlantis is, with respect to fish species biomasses, passed on as input to the FISHRENT KWB model, as illustrated in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g001" href="#pone.0199168.g001">Fig 1</a>. A detailed explanation on how this is exactly done, can be found in sections A and C in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>. The outcomes of the Baltic fish Stochastic Multispecies Model (SMS; [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref061">61</a>]) are also used to provide information on natural fish mortality levels and constrain dietary interactions between the fish species sprat, herring and cod. Furthermore, a couple of other models can be associated with the framework but are not currently used and described in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g001" href="#pone.0199168.g001">Fig 1</a> (i.e., the DISPLACE [

  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref063">63</a>] model, coupled to the SMS models [
  <a rid="pone.0199168.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0199168.ref064">64</a>], and the broader socio-economic CBA model, an ecosystem services assessment tool [
