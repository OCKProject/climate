  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A comparison of the Chl-a levels and spatial distribution in the output from the Atlantis model (annual average for the last five projection years) and the modelled output by the HBM-ERGOM model (annual average for 2005–2014) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g004" href="#pone.0199168.g004">Fig 4</a>) shows that the relative distribution and general levels of Chl-a in Atlantis matches the patterns and levels in HBM-ERGOM. However, this is not the case for the Kattegat and the Western Baltic Sea, where the Atlantis model shows average higher Chl-a values on a more coarse geographical scale while HBM-ERGOM only shows high levels in fine scale coastal areas. Seasonal patterns in Chl-a are shown in Figure D in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a> and are discussed further below in relation to HBM-ERGOM output.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The time series of total biomass per group (across the entire model domain) in the 60-year long calibration run are shown for all species in the overview plot 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g005" href="#pone.0199168.g005">Fig 5</a>. The biomasses of all functional groups reach a balanced equilibrium with a spin-up period of 10 years for most of the groups. For some groups like the harbour porpoise, phytoplankton and gelatinous zooplankton, it takes a longer spin-up time of about 35 years. The simulated fluctuations for most of the functional groups arise from the seasonal variability. The largest variations in these fluctuations are found for the lower trophic level groups, 10 million tons biomass amplitude for the diatoms and small zooplankton, 20 million tons biomass difference for the small phytoplankton and 30 million tons difference for the mesozooplankton. Benthic organisms do not show such variation. Comparing the modelled biomasses with the input showed that most of the groups fall in the border of 0.5 times lower or higher than initial values (Figure E, Table S in 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>). Some groups that ended up with a biomass higher than 0.5 times the initial level are sprat, gelatinous zooplankton, seagrass and labile and refractory detritus where sprat biomass is 2.72 times the initial biomass.

However, there are some exceptions in which the model can be improved (e.g. mysids, macroalgae, seagrass). Microzooplankton and mesozooplankton as well as large and small phytoplankton are grouped together to zooplankton and phytoplankton respectively, for which combined groups the spatial distribution is given. Phytoplankton spatial distribution is also shown through the distribution of Chl-a (

The higher up the trophic level, the lower the difference with the baseline.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Labile detritus, mysids and Nephrops are the most impacted, and their biomass levels decreased according to the magnitude of nutrient reduction in the Kattegat and Western Baltic Sea. Detritus is an important food source for Nephrops (see Figure F in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>, panel 13). The decrease of Nephrops biomass was less in scenario #4 given that the nutrient reduction was lower in scenario #4 for Kattegat, only a 15% reduction, because this scenario followed the BSAP plan, whereas the scenario #3 had a 33% reduction by Denmark, Sweden and Germany together.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the functional groups biomasses decreased with lower nutrient input (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g010" href="#pone.0199168.g010">Fig 10</a>). Some groups do not have a consistent pattern over the different scenarios and might increase as well. Cod increased up to 4% in the fifth scenario, where both adult and juvenile cod biomass increased (Figure K in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>). The cod dietary pattern changed in scenario #5 with a decrease in sprat for adult cod, while juvenile cod had an increase in prey biomass of the benthic filter and deposit feeders, and of the polychaetes (Figure L in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>). Benthic invertebrate biomass decreased for all scenarios, though with a maximum of 2%. For scenario #5, sprat decreased for 18%. Looking at the age structure, it is apparent that mostly the adult sprat decreased. Besides the biological responses, abiotic factors do also react to the nutrient change. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g011" href="#pone.0199168.g011">Fig 11</a> shows an increase in oxygen concentration in the bottom water layer for several polygons. The most impacted polygons are the coastal ones in the Western Baltic Sea and Baltic proper. Many of the small changes, caused by the scenarios, would be so small as to be written off as noise in the real world and should be treated with caution given the uncertainty of the model.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When inducing reduced fishing mortalities (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g012" href="#pone.0199168.g012">Fig 12</a>) for the main pelagic short lived forage fish species like sprat, and for a benthic long lived predatory fish species like cod, the model responds for the fished species or adjacent trophic levels. A 5% increase in cod biomass was observed when halving cod fishing mortality (#6) compared to the 2005 level. Similar, a sprat biomass increase of 2% was observed when halving the fishing mortality (#7). This is consistent with much lower sprat fishing mortality in 2005 than the cod fishing mortality, and that sprat fishing mortality in general is very low. In the last scenario with a more severe increase in fishing mortality, a greater decrease in biomass is simulated throughout the whole ecosystem (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g012" href="#pone.0199168.g012">Fig 12</a>, scenario 10). The effect goes from a decrease in harbour porpoises, up to -14%, but an increase in sprat and zooplankton, up to 12% and 4% respectively. The largest change is for the mysids, with a decrease in biomass of 85%.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are very small decreases in the NPV (Net Present Value) for the total fishery between status quo and the four nitrogen reduction scenarios which are within the uncertainty levels of both models (
   <a rid="pone.0199168.t004" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0199168.t004">Table 4</a>). In scenarios #3 and #4, total NPV decreased by 4.1% and 1.7% respectively. The decrease in the Western Baltic is higher than the one in the Kattegat. There is a very small NPV decrease also in Kattegat in scenario 3, but it is on the third digit and therefore not shown in the table. The smaller trawling vessels (12–15 meters) increased their total revenue for both scenarios #3 and #4, while it decreased for the bigger trawlers and the gillnetters (Table T in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>). The fuel cost increased for the smaller vessels (12–15 and 15–18 meters) for scenario #3 and #4, for the bigger trawler vessels (18–24 meters) it decreased for scenario #3 but increased for #4, while it decreased slightly for the gillnetters (Table U in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>). The total costs for the small trawling vessels increased for scenario #3 and #4, while it decreased slightly or stayed the same for the other vessels (Tables V-Y in the 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>). This explained the decrease in NPV for scenario #3 and #4. However, the total profit increased for the 12–15 meters trawlers, while it decreased for the others (Table Z in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001" href="#pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</a>). Similarly as was shown above, the changes in scenario #2 were so small that also here they didn’t show any differences with the status quo scenario.
