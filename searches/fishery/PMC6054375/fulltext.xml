Such tools should integrate the complexity of the ecosystem and enable exploration of different natural and anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, eutrophication and fishing pressures in order to compare alternative management strategies. We present a new framework, with a Baltic implementation of the spatially-explicit end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model linked to two external models, to explore the different pressures on the marine ecosystem. The HBM-ERGOM initializes the Atlantis model with high-resolution physical-chemical-biological and hydrodynamic information while the FISHRENT model analyses the fisheries economics of the output of commercial fish biomass for the Atlantis terminal projection year. The Baltic Atlantis model composes 29 sub-areas, 9 vertical layers and 30 biological functional groups. The balanced calibration provides realistic levels of biomass for, among others, known stock sizes of top predators and of key fish species. Furthermore, it gives realistic levels of phytoplankton biomass and shows reasonable diet compositions and geographical distribution patterns for the functional groups. By simulating several scenarios of nutrient load reductions on the ecosystem and testing sensitivity to different fishing pressures, we show that the model is sensitive to those changes and capable of evaluating the impacts on different trophic levels, fish stocks, and fisheries associated with changed benthic oxygen conditions. We conclude that the Baltic Atlantis forms an initial basis for strategic management evaluation suited for conducting medium to long term ecosystem assessments which are of importance for a number of pan-Baltic stakeholders in relation to anthropogenic pressures such as eutrophication, climate change and fishing pressure, as well as changed biological interactions between functional groups.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Danish Council for Strategic Research</institution></funding-source><award-id>09-067259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>J.

The Baltic Sea ecosystem is subject to many interconnected and area specific pressures originating from natural changes and human activities (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), and human pressures are increasing [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An initial holistic assessment of ecosystem health for 2003&#x02013;2007 indicated that the majority of the Baltic Sea was in a state of "poor" or "bad" health [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The area is geographically peripheral with respect to marine and freshwater conditions and low winter temperatures, and some ecosystem groups are therefore vulnerable to environmental changes [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since the early 2000s, surface temperature has increased from an overall average of around 7&#x000b0;C to 9&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and salinity has decreased with varying magnitude across the basins [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The Western Baltic Sea is characterized as a transition zone with temperature and salinity conditions that vary substantially both seasonally and annually depending on the magnitude of saline inflows [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Eutrophication and pollution, partly due to run-off from land based activities, as well as ocean acidification and climate change induce environmental impacts in the Baltic Sea [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, so do fisheries, transport/shipping, renewable energy exploitation, gravel extraction, tourism, etc. These are other anthropogenic pressures that induce environmental impacts and also have socio-economic importance [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Some of these pressures can be managed on national or local levels such as energy platforms, but several require a regionally, basin-wide integrated or even globally coordinated management approach because they have a wide spread distribution and are diffusive activities, e.g. fisheries and nutrient loads [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, despite measures taken to reduce national inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to the whole Baltic Sea, up to 18% from 1994 to 2010, the system is still characterized as highly eutrophic [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As the system doesn&#x02019;t seem to recover, the Baltic Sea eutrophication problem is therefore increasing [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Challenges for Baltic Sea ecosystem models and the evaluation of natural and anthropogenic pressures</title><p>Besides fishery, eutrophication is a strong pressure on the Baltic Sea ecosystem. Studies of the biological effects of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea are numerous. Significant effects on primary production, both total area production and distribution in the water column, phytoplankton biomass, plankton community composition, water clarity and oxygen conditions have been documented (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). In [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], modelling simulations exploring the potential effects of changing oxygen and nutrient load conditions on the benthic community in the Baltic Sea have been conducted, showing significantly changes in the biogeochemical functioning of the ecosystem. Direct effects of eutrophication on fish stock recruitment is not evidenced by a number of correlative studies and a literature review ([<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and references therein). The meta-analyses in [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] finds only two fish stocks in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea where the recruitment dynamics can be related to changes in nutrient levels (Kattegat and Eastern Baltic cod). Accordingly, while there in the Baltic may be links between eutrophication and changes in fish stocks and fisheries the full chain of causality is yet to be documented. In contrast, a decrease in abundance of Baltic cod due to climate change (sea water temperature) has been documented (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). The complexity of the interactions also likely means that the direction of change is not uniform across species and/or regions [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In general, the main challenge in studies of complex systems is to find occurrences where one pressure at a time varies, all other being equal, which is usually impossible given the variety of human activities (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), as well as to integrate the ecosystem complexity adequately. Capturing this complexity is relevant in supporting different national and international policies and directives&#x02014;such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU MSFD), the Water Framework Directive (EU WFD), the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) and the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive (EU MSP).</p><p>To consider several ecosystem drivers simultaneously, a possibility is to apply models that integrate a wide range of pressures and processes in a common framework that enables holistic evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To construct such models has several advantages: they tend to increase understanding of system dynamics within and across ecosystems, help identify major processes, drivers and responses, highlight major gaps in knowledge, and inform future monitoring schemes [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, the final models make it possible to test management strategies virtually before they are implemented in reality [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These so-called end-to-end or whole-of ecosystem models [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], enable simulations of ecosystem dynamics and interactions from plankton to humans. Previous ecosystem modelling attempts in the Baltic include the EcoSim-EcoPath (EwE) modelling framework [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] used this framework to analyze trophic cascades and regimes shifts under scenarios of altered top-predator pressure as well as eutrophication (via assumed shifts in primary production). However, EwE has not been applied to the Western Baltic Sea, and explicit testing of eutrophication scenarios with EwE and its spatially-resolved Ecospace module would require linking with coupled physical-plankton models (e.g. POLCOMS-ERSEM) or with dedicated eutrophication models (e.g. Corps of Engineers Integrated Compartment Water Quality Model in Chesapeake Bay; [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). Another approach for testing ecosystem effects of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea involved linking the HBM-ERGOM bio-geo-chemical model (see below) and the Stochastic Multi Species (SMS) model (see below), providing a novel platform for operational ecology as part of the FP7 Marine OpEc project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://marine-opec.eu/">http://marine-opec.eu/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Moving towards a holistic management evaluation platform</title><p>To construct a holistic management evaluation platform, a new whole-of ecosystem and cyclic full-feed-back Atlantis model [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] is here implemented covering the whole Baltic Sea, including the Western Baltic Sea and Kattegat. The Atlantis model [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] is designed as a tool capable of providing medium to long term management strategy evaluation, which has broad relevance and interest to many stakeholder groups. It is not, on the other hand, meant to provide short term accurate forecasts and, thus, should not be used for generating short term absolute and tactical advice [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Besides the key parameters and processes relevant for a specific region, the model also includes complex interactions between the different processes and actors. It consists of a hydrographic, a species community and a fisheries sub-model which are all interlinked with one another on a spatially (horizontal/vertical) and seasonally explicit scale. Besides its potential to meet the challenge of implementing an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the fast development in a global perspective of the Atlantis model to integrate new marine sectors offers opportunities for balancing conflicting user objectives in marine resource management (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). In this context, the different implementations of Atlantis across a number of marine ecosystems around the world has been evaluated in many peer-reviewed publications and technical reports (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]) and this also increases relevance of a Baltic implementation for comparative purposes. The model has previously been successfully applied to support strategic decision making around marine resources and to optimize the marine monitoring of e.g. Australian and the United States [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Lately, the implementation of Atlantis in European and North-Eastern Atlantic regional seas has been conducted in several areas such as the Sicily Straits, English Channel [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], Nordic and Barents Seas [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], North Sea (EU-FP7-VECTORS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marine-vectors.eu/">http://www.marine-vectors.eu/</ext-link>) and the Baltic Sea (current study).</p><p>Although the Atlantis model is the core of the present approach, some more detailed information, which will improve this holistic management evaluation platform, is more extensively available through other existing models. The HBM-ERGOM provides the Baltic Atlantis with high-resolution physical-chemical-biological and hydrodynamic information of the calibration year (2005) and the Atlantis output from the terminal projection year is processed with the FISHRENT fisheries economic model.

For the Danish areas, both the Atlantis model and the HBM-ERGOM model receive river data from the catchment model DK-QNP, for the other Baltic Sea rivers, the catchment model HBV or HELCOM data is used.</p><p>The second link is between Atlantis and a bio-economic fisheries model. The Atlantis output of the terminal projection year feeds into the FISHRENT model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which is a bio-economic multi-fish-stock-multi-fishing-fleet-model for Kattegat and the Western Baltic fishery (FISHRENT KWB henceforth; [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]).</p><p>The way the three models (HBM-ERGOM&#x02013;Atlantis&#x02013;FISHRENT) are connected is based on a one-way offline linking. Information is fed from one model to another without accounting for any potential dynamic coupling or feedback processes. Information about hydrodynamics obtained from the HBM-ERGOM model is passed on as input to the Baltic Atlantis for the 2005 calibration year, and information about changes in biological production obtained from the Baltic Atlantis is, with respect to fish species biomasses, passed on as input to the FISHRENT KWB model, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g001">Fig 1</xref>.

Furthermore, year 2005 is characterized by lack of extreme events, in either physical forcing (river discharge, Baltic inflow) or significant ecosystem changes. In absence of data or other model outputs from that period for a given variable or parameter, the temporal search radius is extended to one year before and after 2005 until the closest estimate in time is found. Spatially averaged data were then averaged per quarter whenever data was available at a seasonal resolution. The process of informing the large number of biological parameters in the Baltic Atlantis model was based on an extensive review of literature to minimize the number of poorly constrained parameters. In a majority of cases, previous estimates of equivalent model parameters were already reported (e.g. length at infinity, mortality rate, recruitment constants), or it was possible to derive first order approximations from available data (e.g. survival rates of juvenile mammals). However, there were also a few Atlantis-specific parameters which had to be provided. The process to find these is described further down.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Input from HBM-ERGOM</title><p>The HBM-ERGOM model (Figure A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>) provides physical, chemical and hydrodynamic parameters to the Baltic Atlantis for the 2005 calibration year. It is a 3D ecosystem model coupling an ocean circulation model with a biogeochemical module describing the major pathways for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and silica. It is driven by atmospheric forcing and nutrient loads (N, P, Si), and simulates the responses to climate changes and changing nutrient loadings. The HBM drives the transport of physical and biogeochemical properties while the biogeochemical model ERGOM simulates primary production and cycling of nutrients (N, P, Si) through 3 phytoplankton groups, 2 zooplankton groups, detritus and the sediment [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].

A first group is the temperature, salinity, exchange volume (i.e. currents) and the external tracers for the dynamic boundary Box 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g002">Fig 2</xref>)&#x02013;representing the entire transport between Baltic Sea and North Sea. They are parameterized with 12h time steps for 2005, which is repeated for each projection year in Atlantis. Temperature and salinity values are fields which are calculated per box and per depth layer, while the currents are fluxes, calculated per box face. The second group consists of the tracers of atmospheric deposition fluxes and riverine inputs. These forced sources are annually averaged, but applied daily at even rates. Atmospheric deposition rate of nutrients is fixed in time and is a spatially-uniform estimate of 0.15 mmol-NH4/m<sup>2</sup>/day following [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], in line with atmospheric sources used in HBM-ERGOM. Even though these parameters are provided by the HBM-ERGOM model, there is no cyclic feedback between HBM-ERGOM and Atlantis in the projection. Accordingly, the biogeochemical cycling is explicitly modelled in the Baltic Atlantis, with nitrogen being the currency of the model while silicate and oxygen fields and fluxes are also tracked.

We do not provide a similar comparison for invertebrates and the lower trophic levels for which we did not have accurate or equivalent data to start with. However, their values are set according to the best available knowledge.

While we apply a constant vertical mixing rate across the majority of the model domain, these mixing rates needed to be adjusted in order to better simulate nutrient replenishment in the offshore surface waters. Other vertical transport processes occur across the water-sediment interface via bioirrigation and bioturbation of sediments, sediment resuspension and erosion; as well as in the water column via particle settling. Also horizontal and vertical light fields are calculated internally by the model. Daily and seasonal cycles of photosynthetically active radiation are obtained from calculations of the theoretical net incoming shortwave radiation at given longitude and latitude. The vertical extent of the light profile in the water column is an exponential decay function scaled by physical and biological light attenuation parameters (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>The Baltic Atlantis model application: Structure and processes</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Biological functional group structure</title><p>The Baltic Atlantis model has 30 biological functional groups. <xref rid="pone.0199168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of the biological structure of the model by indicating which and how many functional groups there are for each ecosystem level, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g003">Fig 3</xref> illustrates their habitats and the general interactions between the biological groups in the model.

The number of recruits is modelled following the standard Beverton-Holt relationship [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], where the recruitment is a function of the total species biomass and the amount of spawning produced, scaled by temperature, salinity and oxygen conditions (Table D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>). Details on how this is done can be found in section B.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>&#x02013;Demographic profiles, mortality rates &#x00026; reproduction functions. Currently, the number of recruits for mammals and seabirds is also modelled following this approach to create a density dependence relationship with the environment they live in. The effects of temperature and salinity on the recruitment of harbour porpoises and seals are however not seen as an influential factor and are turned off for those two species accordingly. Besides recruitment processes, oxygen concentration conditions also affect all groups while living (for equations on the processes and detailed explanation see section B.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>&#x02013;Demographic profiles, mortality rates &#x00026; reproduction functions). Benthic invertebrates experience an increased mortality when oxygen drops below their minimum tolerance levels (Table F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>) as they cannot escape the oxygen minima that easily, while fish and other vertebrates are assumed to swim away. Although, if no suitable habitat is found (i.e. if the entire area was to become anoxic), they would be completely lost from the model. A potential uncertainty lies in the precise formulation of the fish recruitment dynamics in the Baltic Atlantis. As there are large regional differences in recruitment parameters calculated for different important fish stocks in the Baltic, the selected values are not always equally representative of both the eastern and western stock components. The final values for the Beverton-Holt stock recruitment relationship were chosen based on the ability to reach a long-term equilibrium biomass.</p><p>Age structured functional groups, i.e. all vertebrates (<xref rid="pone.0199168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), also have a maximum growth rate and clearance rate for each of the age groups, while biomass pool functional groups, i.e. all invertebrate groups (<xref rid="pone.0199168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), only have one specific value (Tables E and F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>). Growth for primary producers is defined as a function of the maximum specific growth rate and by additional potentially limiting factors such as nutrient, light and space limitations. For consumers, growth is determined by the intake (grazing) and assimilation efficiency. Maintenance or respiration costs for age structured groups are implicitly represented in the assimilation efficiency, i.e. the rate is set lower to represent losses to respiration, as well as incomplete assimilation of food. Grazing is modelled using a modified Holling type II relation [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], where the grazing is a function of the amount of biomass of a specific prey available and the time-invariant maximum growth (grazing) rate and clearance rate (the search volume of a predator). Limitations of the available prey biomass are the time-varying spatial overlap and predator condition, the available habitat for refuge and the gape size of the predator. This together will define the amount of prey consumed, which means that the diet is not a priori determined (as in other models such as EwE), rather an emergent property of the Atlantis model.</p><p>While the initial values of vertebrate growth and consumption rates per age class were fairly well constrained using field data on morphological characteristics and physiological rates, and size-based scaling laws of metabolic theory, up to an order of magnitude adjustments had to be made for some groups. The two criteria used to adjust these rates were: (i) obtaining a close to initial structural and reserve weight per age group, and (ii) obtaining a stable and ecologically-sound diet composition.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Atlantis spatial domain structure</title><p>The Baltic Atlantis model resolves horizontal processes based on 29 polygon-shaped boxes, including 26 dynamic and 3 boundary boxes, and a total of 100 faces (borders) between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g002">Fig 2</xref>), delineated using a Geographical Information System, following the standard procedure for all Atlantis implementations [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The polygon structure is designed as a compromise between the need to account for spatial heterogeneity in bathymetric and hydrodynamic patterns, physical-chemical and biological habitats, biological composition and existing fisheries and spatial management units. In the vertical dimension there are eight water layers: 0-5m, 5-10m, 10-30m, 30-40m, 40-50m, 50-100m, 100-200m, &#x0003e;200m; and one sediment layer of 0.5m depth. The depth of the vertical water layers is variable with a higher resolution for layers shallower than 50m depth. This higher resolution helps the model to resolve key vertical processes around the halocline in offshore areas of the Baltic. The last vertical layer is a sediment cell. Which types of abiotic habitat this sediment cell has, is specified based on the high resolution topographic map information from HELCOM (Table I in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>There are a few limitations when modelling the different functional groups in this spatial domain structure. Firstly, the spatial distribution of primary and secondary producers in the model is complementary where large and small phytoplankton rarely coexist in the same polygon, similarly for micro- and mesozooplankton. While this implementation allows for the effective representation of the total biomass of both groups, the biomass by individual polygon might be biased due to the model set up. Complementary groups are therefore aggregated over polygons when plotted spatially. Secondly, the spatial distribution of the vertebrates is forced seasonally for the species, based on survey data and literature and does not allow for free movement between polygons (see section B.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>&#x02013;Quarterly abundance distribution of vertebrates). The distribution pattern is also limited by the single uniform fishing mortality imposed on all individuals of a given biological functional group. This current implementation potentially leads to approximate fishing mortalities per subareas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Nutrient load reduction scenarios and fishing pressure change sensitivity</title><p>In the current study, four nutrient load reduction scenarios have been evaluated and five model sensitivity runs with changed fishing pressure for key fish species were conducted. This was done to test the model sensitivity and its capability to respond similarly to realistic situations. There was one &#x0201c;status quo&#x0201d; scenario to compare against which assumed no changes in nutrient loads or fishing pressure. The sensitivity tests of fishing pressure reduction was made for fishing mortality on cod as a major benthivorous and piscivorous predator fish and on sprat as a major planktivorous prey fish in the Baltic, which are both important target species in the Baltic international commercial fishery. All scenarios were run for a period of 60 years including a &#x0201c;spin-up period&#x0201d; of 35 years after which equilibrium is reached and at which point the nutrient loads are changed depending on the scenario. Like any simulation from the Atlantis model the results of these scenario runs do not represent an actual 25-year time series forecast of the response to nutrient change, rather, they represent a possible future time slice after the biological system had adjusted to the new forcing conditions and the bio-economic model had optimized its performance. Here we use five-year averages of the terminal projection period. The model adjustment time to new nutrient load and/or fishing pressure conditions is not uniform for all ecosystem components, therefore a complete equilibrium is not guaranteed (however, equilibrium was actually reached in all cases but one). Moreover, the change in forcing in the model occurs instantaneously instead of a more likely gradual shift, as this is how the model is set up for the moment. This adjustment or model spin-up time is longer than the 10-year time scale assumed in previous similar numerical experiments (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) performed on much simpler ecosystems.</p><p>There were four nutrient load scenarios and five fishing mortality scenarios set up and simulated within the Baltic Atlantis model and management evaluation framework. <xref rid="pone.0199168.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> provides a summary of the different scenarios and the corresponding relative (%) reductions of total nitrogen river load assigned to each Baltic Atlantis polygon per nutrient load scenario and of the corresponding fishing mortalities used for each of the last five scenarios. The changes in fishing mortality were intentionally kept simple for testing purposes rather than trying to replicate complicated management options. The original fishing mortality of adult cod, applied in the Baltic Atlantis model, is 0.32 and the original, SMS-derived fishing mortality for adult sprat is 0.07. Minimum observed fishing mortality was not included in the scenarios as it was considered sufficient to look at the halved mortality rate (i.e. scenario #6 and #7). In the current settings of the Atlantis model, the fishing mortality is a constant mortality factor for the whole Baltic Sea, split into juvenile and adult. There is also no differentiation between different stocks in the current model, so there is only one fishing mortality for the juvenile and one for the adult group of the species for the whole area. In the evaluation of eutrophication scenarios with Atlantis, we keep fishing mortality constant to focus on nutrient load induced pressures and relative changes. In the subsequent FISHRENT evaluations, we accordingly evaluate relative fisheries consequences of the changed biomasses of key exploited fish stocks from the eutrophication scenarios only. We therefore have kept stock biomass and recruitment constant in the fisheries projections in FISHRENT to isolate the relative effects of the eutrophication scenarios.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0199168.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0199168.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Relative (%) reduction of total nitrogen river load applied to certain Baltic Atlantis polygon according to the four nutrient load scenarios (#2&#x02013;#5) and the changes in fishing mortality for the five fishing mortality scenarios (#6&#x02013;#10).</title><p>Scenario 1 is the baseline to compare the results against.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0199168.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0199168.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" style="background-color:#D9D9D9" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Scenario #1</bold></td><td align="left" style="background-color:#D9D9D9" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Scenario #2</bold></td><td align="left" style="background-color:#D9D9D9" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Scenario #3</bold></td><td align="left" style="background-color:#D9D9D9" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Scenario #4</bold></td><td align="left" style="background-color:#D9D9D9" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Scenario #5</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">'Status quo'</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nutrient load reduction</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nutrient load reduction</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nutrient load reduction matching BSAP2<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t002fn001">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nutrient load reduction</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Area</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Denmark</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Denmark, Sweden &#x00026;

First, the overall balance of all biological functional groups was evaluated after running the model for a 60 year projection period, to see whether equilibrium was reached. There is no guarantee that the model reaches irreversible global equilibria, it can be quasi-equilibria. However, the equilibria did generally not change when using 120 years projections compared to 60 years (Figure B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>). Next, the levels of the final biomasses were compared with the initial input biomasses, especially for those groups where external abundance estimates were available. Furthermore, we compared the diets versus data to check whether the realized model diets were realistic. Due to the emergent property of the diet in the Atlantis model, we can still use the calibration data to check the output against. Besides the dynamics of the total relative prey composition over the full simulation period, the diets of juvenile and adult predators were also checked separately, averaged over a timespan of the last five years of the projection period. Next, we also explored the population demography according to age frequencies, i.e. distribution of the number of individuals over the age groups. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the biomasses as well as the oxygen level in certain areas and vertical layers were checked against what is known from literature or field surveys. We finally investigate the results of the scenarios by comparing their biomass levels with those in the baseline run, in order to evaluate the sensitivity and realism of the model response to the change in drivers and pressures. These biomass oriented evaluations are augmented for the age structured groups&#x02014;mammals, seabirds and fish functional groups&#x02014;where a more detailed demographic evaluation of the model projections is possible.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Economic analysis of the Atlantis output in Kattegat-Western Baltic</title><p>The FISHRENT model [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] was used to analyze the final year output of the Atlantis model. FISHRENT is a multi-stock multi-fleet bio-economic model which was developed from best practice knowledge on fisheries gained from similar models used in Europe over the past decade (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]). FISHRENT enables consideration of a diverse array of policy aims, including Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and Maximum Economic Yield (MEY) goals. The main outputs from FISHRENT describe the likely trajectories and status of the modelled fisheries and fleets over a predetermined time-period given the status of the main fish stocks exploited per area and the policy aims considered. The model contains five modules: biological, economic, market, behavior, and policy (Figure C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>). A key characteristic of FISHRENT is that the necessary fleet and economic data have been structured in the same way as the data collected on a national basis as part of the EU Data Collection Framework (EU DCF). This enables consistent analysis to be conducted across nations ensuring that best available national data is used.

The decrease of Nephrops biomass was less in scenario #4 given that the nutrient reduction was lower in scenario #4 for Kattegat, only a 15% reduction, because this scenario followed the BSAP plan, whereas the scenario #3 had a 33% reduction by Denmark, Sweden and Germany together.</p><p>Most of the functional groups biomasses decreased with lower nutrient input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Some groups do not have a consistent pattern over the different scenarios and might increase as well. Cod increased up to 4% in the fifth scenario, where both adult and juvenile cod biomass increased (Figure K in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>).

Benthic invertebrate biomass decreased for all scenarios, though with a maximum of 2%. For scenario #5, sprat decreased for 18%. Looking at the age structure, it is apparent that mostly the adult sprat decreased. Besides the biological responses, abiotic factors do also react to the nutrient change. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g011">Fig 11</xref> shows an increase in oxygen concentration in the bottom water layer for several polygons.

Here we evaluated eutrophication and fishery pressures on the whole ecosystem on a spatial explicit scale. This established model framework will help us to evaluate the performance of alternative management strategies on mitigating human and natural pressures in the long term. We discuss the current model calibration and the realism of the baseline given the model uncertainty, as well as the application to nutrient load reduction scenarios and sensitivity analyses to fishing pressure levels to test the ability of the model to capture the dynamics in the ecosystem according to the changes. As the model is only for strategic use and due to the many assumptions, limitations and overall uncertainty, we only focus on the direction of changes in the relative evaluations rather than short term absolute predictions.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Model parameterization and initialization</title><p>The system perspective supplied by the Baltic Atlantis model makes it a unique and useful tool for the region, enabling investigation of changes in eutrophication pressure while accounting for bio-physical interactions and feedbacks across all important trophic levels in all the basins of the Baltic. Nonetheless, the complexity of the nature of the interacting pressures on the system creates the limitation as it can be very difficult (even in a model) to separate the effects of a specific key factor, agent or process in the ecosystem, and quantitatively estimate its role under a given scenario. While the confounding can be somewhat controlled in the model it can not be completely removed as a faithful representation of the system requires a representation of the many interacting drivers. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the model parameterization cannot be equally well constrained for all groups and processes. When looking at Nephrops, they could potentially respond to drastic shifts in biomass levels of their main prey, i.e. detritus as well as benthic species. On the other hand, they may also be affected by oxygen depletion with respect to changed mortality or distribution. Although the model seems to capture those interactions, which are evaluated in the scenarios, estimates of Nephrops have showed that their biomass has remained surprisingly constant over the last decade or more [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. This is however, under the current environmental conditions with relatively high nutrient levels in their habitats. In the long term, Nephrops have most likely increased in Kattegat according to field observations. The parameterization of these interactions and potential feedback effects is complex and difficult to comprehend and evaluate without a well-calibrated ecosystem model. Better constraints on the simulated ecosystem dynamics, while still accounting for complexity, can only be achieved by increasing the input information to the model&#x02014;including data availability and promoting coordinated monitoring efforts in different regions across the Baltic Sea. See details in section B.2-C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>.</p><p>A lack of phosphorus cycling and cyanobacteria in the model also affects the model results in response to scenarios of reduced nutrient loading, especially in the Northern Baltic areas. While code now exists within the model framework for these components, it was not available in a timely manner and so has not yet been implemented for the Baltic. Cyanobacteria are likely to positively respond to significant reductions in nutrient inputs as they gain a relative advantage over diatoms, which primarily rely on the supply of new (non-regenerated) nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Prevalence of blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in the main sub-basins of the Baltic Sea implies that nitrogen fixation is an important process that slows down the recovery from a eutrophic state (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]). However, the effects of this underrepresentation of nitrogen fixation is not expected to have an influence on the main commercial species such as cod, sprat and herring in the Baltic proper, Kattegat and Western Baltic areas, where the focus of the current implementation of the model is.</p><p>Not only sources but also sinks of nitrogen are very well represented in HBM-ERGOM, and [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] estimated that nitrogen removal by denitrification in sediments varied between 48 and 73% of the external nitrogen inputs delivered via rivers, coastal point sources and atmospheric deposition. In the Baltic Atlantis, in order to avoid a buildup of nutrients in some coastal boxes, especially along the eastern German and western Polish coasts (box #14), we introduced implicit decay terms of labile and refractory detritus to better balance the sources and sinks in the model. These processes are proxies for sediment burial and implicit effects of denitrification, adding to the likely underestimated model explicit denitrification, with overall aggregate sink rates being in line with the rates reported by [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].</p><p>Several such aspects limit the model capability to evaluate the results of scenario analysis in absolute terms and in the short term. However, the model is still useful for longer term projections and its set-up enables us to identify key sensitive parameters for which we need more information or need to make the foci of sensitivity analyses and robustness testing. This is a very important capacity of the modelling approach and management evaluation framework applications in general.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Baltic Atlantis projections and dynamic full feedback mechanisms</title><sec id="sec029"><title>Biomasses of biological functional groups</title><p>The current calibrated version of the Atlantis implementation in the Baltic meets the goal of simulating a stable and balanced marine ecosystem where all biological functional groups survive from one model year to another in a long term equilibrium state with biomass levels close to the best available knowledge (Figure E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>). Despite the increased biomass level for the model output of sprat, it was still accepted as the 2005 sprat assessed abundances was considerably lower than all other years in the assessment year range [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In general, the model stability reached after the spin-up period (section B.5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>), is on a satisfactory level, however it should be noted that the available input data and information on the lower trophic levels are uncertain. Overall, the current calibration of the model can run uninterrupted for at least 120 simulation years, without any groups going extinct from year to year and season to season (Figure B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>The biomasses of most of the functional groups exhibit a seasonal oscillation around the same mean biomass level.

In our model, benthic organisms exhibit little if any seasonal variability which is in line with model results of [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, for Baltic benthic fauna, field observations reveal significant inter-annual variability in particular in response to prolonged changes in oxygen concentration and predation patterns. Furthermore, seasonal changes in coastal hypoxic conditions may also influence benthic biomass losses as perceived in the evaluation of the nutrient load scenarios (see below). A more complete picture of the interactions and flows between the different groups can be achieved by looking at the production instead of the biomass. This was however not possible in the current setting of the model. We argue though that, achieving equilibrium for the biomass for each of the functional groups, also means that the production is in equilibrium. This is because biomass would most likely not reach equilibrium if production is not in equilibrium.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Diets of biological functional groups</title><p>The results of the emergent fish dietary pattern are in accordance with our current knowledge. We can compare this to stomach data observations synthesized and modeled for example in the SMS model, previous estimates in mass balance models such as EwE (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), or reported diet and consumption estimates in published regional studies. The age-specific diet allows for a different diet for adults versus juveniles. So does the diet of adult cod consists of a greater proportion of larger planktivorous fish, such as sprat and herring (Figure F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>, panel 4), while the diet of juvenile cod constitutes mainly of polychaetes and benthic crustaceans, such as the isopod <italic>Saduria entomon</italic>, which is an important food source for the early life stages of cod [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. This is in general accordance with observations from stomach sampling programs and from SMS output [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The results also indicate that the model is capable of incorporating bentho-pelagic couplings. Although we allow for a cod cannibalism interaction in the model, this process is still underestimated in the current model version. For a relatively small population of harbour porpoise in the Western Baltic, there are accurate data concerning their diet composition [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. As expected, cod constitute around 80% of the diet composition in the model with an underestimation of whiting, the second most important prey item (Figure F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>, panel 1). The dietary patterns of the grey seal were observed from stomach sampling programs in the Baltic Proper and in the Gulf of Bothnia [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Observations show that the majority of their diet consists of herring, with sprat and cod being the second most important prey species, followed by carps and perches. This is similar with the diets modelled with Atlantis, except that sprat is an equally important prey species next to herring for adult seals (Figure F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>, panel 2). However, the study dated from 2010, and the geographical overlap between the species, partly due to change in seal distribution, has very likely changed over time compared to the 2005 situation (and may have changed even more since 2010).</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Population structure and demography</title><p>The distribution of numbers per age group shows a realistic exponential decline for all the age disaggregated functional groups, where the youngest individuals of a population are prone to the highest mortality. The age distribution is most even for seals because they have the most homogeneous survival rates once they survive the first vulnerable year. The abundance of that first age group is determined by the recruitment. Considering that exact mechanisms controlling recruitment are still not fully understood despite abundant data available (e.g. cod; [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]) and many studies on the topic, or are simply not known (small pelagics, small demersals), or are principally mediated by the changing environment anyway (e.g. sprat; [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]), it is difficult to evaluate the potential uncertainty of the fish recruitment dynamics in the Baltic Atlantis.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Spatial distribution of biological functional groups</title><p>The spatial distribution shows no extinctions in any polygon for all the vertebrates, with biomass fluctuating seasonally. The higher fluctuations of the vertebrates represent migrations between spawning and feeding grounds. This is why for instance cod biomass in certain polygons reaches zero (this type of migration is further discussed in section B.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>&#x02013;Quarterly abundance distribution of vertebrates). The fluctuations of the phytoplankton biomass show a spatial variation in the amplitude of those seasonal biomass peaks. The differences are likely due to the coastal versus off-shore physical conditions. Coastal areas have a continuous high nutrient load due to the riverine inflow all year round and they exhibit the highest variations in temperature with the lowest temperature reaching zero [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Off-shore areas also have a continuous N load in the surface areas [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] so primary production and standing stock biomass does not go to zero [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], but they show much less temperature fluctuations, especially with respect to the extreme minima. That is why we do not expect as high temperature driven fluctuations in primary production in the off-shore areas as we see in the coastal ones (Figures D and M in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>However, it should be noticed that the limitation of finding vertical/horizontal mixing parameters could lead to a lack of adequately representing the nutrient distribution, stratification and so the primary production, despite extensively testing these parameters. On top of that, there exists only limited knowledge on the spatial distribution of the phytoplankton communities in the Baltic Sea due to the limited spatial and/or temporal coverage of previous research [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Similar for the Baltic total zooplankton biomass (microzooplankton, mesozooplankton and gelatinous zooplankton), the grazing and its distribution patterns in the Baltic Sea likely remains the least constrained level of the ecosystem. This is partly due to similar challenges in adequately sampling and monitoring, and partly due to the large fluctuations arising from observed patterns that also show high fluctuations on narrow spatial and temporal scales in different water layers. In the Bornholm Basin there are spectacular shifts in observed zooplankton community composition and grazing pressure (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]), and although this area is sampled regularly, it still imposes many difficulties and challenges for model attempts in relation to those specific processes. Future improvements in properly constraining this ecosystem bottleneck will be fundamental to the successful evaluation of ecosystem-wide interactions in the Baltic Sea realm.</p><p>Another proxy useful for evaluating the geographical distribution of total phytoplankton biomass is the surface Chl-a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The reason why Atlantis seems to overestimate the Chl-a in coastal waters for the Western Baltic, the Gulf of Riga and Gulf of Finland regions, compared to the ERGOM model, could be because of the spatial resolution of the two models, where the ERGOM model has a very fine resolution in comparison with the coarse Atlantis polygon sizes. However, the ERGOM model also tends to underestimate the surface Chl-a concentration when compared to observational data, especially in the offshore Bornholm Basin and Gotland Basin [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] which makes the Atlantis estimates closer to the observations.</p><p>In the offshore polygons, Atlantis simulates quite similar surface Chl-a concentrations relative to the HBM-ERGOM output, except for the northern Bothnian Sea where Atlantis has a slightly lower estimate of the Chl-a concentration in the off-shore polygon. This may be explained by the lack of cyanobacteria in the Atlantis in comparison with HBM-ERGOM. The current Baltic Atlantis results are calibrated without considering phosphorus and carbon cycling. Consequently, cyanobacteria are not included in the model simulations since they are mostly distinguished from other pelagic primary producers by a higher phosphorus requirement for growth. In the Baltic Sea, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria contribute significantly to primary production, especially during the summer months in the northern Baltic Proper and more Northerly Baltic areas (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]).</p><p>Lack of cyanobacteria probably does not affect the secondary production in the model, because they are not an important food source for zooplankton. Sedimentation and subsequent degradation of cyanobacteria are also not included in Atlantis and may lead to slight underestimation of hypoxia in the open areas of the model. Not accounting for these phenomena is unlikely to compromise the results of the current analyses because the salinities in the Kattegat, Western Baltic regions and southern Baltic proper regions, except in the immediate vicinity of the coast, are beyond the typical &#x0003c;12 salinity range where cyanobacteria appear in the Baltic [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Finally, the attenuation of light in the Baltic Atlantis water column accounts for total phytoplankton biomass but does not explicitly represent attenuation due to colored dissolved organic material (CDOM). The potential overestimation of light levels due to lack of CDOM as well as cloud cover effects on light availability are partially offset by adjusting the light attenuation coefficients of phytoplankton groups.</p><p>Furthermore, HBM-ERGOM outputs reveal that in Kattegat and the Western Baltic there exist very sharp gradients between very narrow but highly productive zones and offshore areas with low annual average phytoplankton standing stocks. These features are unlikely to be fully captured in Baltic Atlantis without a more detailed map of time-varying riverine and point source inputs to the model, such as the one offered by the DK-QNP model used to force HBM-ERGOM. Although such high spatial resolution details need not be considered to force the dynamics of fisheries, they are more important in better constraining biogeochemical cycling, and its control on seasonal and inter-annual variability in primary production.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>Nutrient load reduction scenarios</title><p>The nutrient load reduction scenarios allowed us to test our newly developed model in its responsiveness to system disturbances. The nutrient load reduction scenarios where chosen because the Baltic ecosystem is already characterized as a highly eutrophic system [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The scenarios are purely for testing the model though and do not reflect an actual reduction plan. The four different scenarios gradually increase the reduction of nitrogen in the ecosystem. This is done by including more and more river point sources, linked to certain polygons, which carries a reduced amount of nitrogen. Even though the spatial scale of the Atlantis polygons might, to some extent, limit the resolution of fully representing bio-geochemical and primary production responses to changes in eutrophication pressures, it still allows for the separation of different processes in narrow coastal versus larger off-shore polygons (section B.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>). This spatial explicit approach is necessary because the eutrophication issue in the Baltic Sea is on such a large scale. Besides the spatial explicit approach, the interactions of physical with biological processes need to be included to investigate this issue, which is why this end-to-end model is applied.</p><p>In the model, it is mainly the dietary interactions that determine the response of planktivorous and piscivorous fish biomass for the analyzed nutrient reduction scenarios. However, the model parameterization could not be equally well constrained for all groups and processes. For instance, the prey-predator interactions involving cod, sprat and herring are well informed using abundant field data and robust model results from the Baltic SMS or EwE. On the other hand, there is little data to quantitatively describe the dietary interactions of many benthic animals, or if locally available, the issue of extrapolating accurately over many types of habitats remains. Benthic organisms, especially in the coastal zones, are known to be susceptible to changes in ambient oxygen conditions [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], strongly affected by riverine nutrient inputs. As a result, the biomass fluctuations in the nutrient load scenarios of these less constrained groups could strongly affect the development of their predators, such as juvenile cod, or other bottom dwelling fish. (See also section B.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>&#x02013;Demographic profiles, mortality rates &#x00026; reproduction functions).</p><sec id="sec034"><title>Biomass</title><p>For all scenarios, the overall biomass decreases, with a stronger signal when there are large reductions in river load. This is in line with the results from [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who used a NPDZ model to show that a reduction in nutrients lead to a decrease in biomass for diatoms, flagellates and zooplankton, with a maximum decrease in primary producers. According to the Atlantis results, there is a bottom-up and cascading effect where the change is observed for all trophic levels [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. However, there is no consistent pattern found for all functional groups because of the complex foodweb interactions that the model comprehends. The amount of change differs also from polygon to polygon with higher changes in the near coastal ones as they are more directly affected by the river inflow, which is also shown in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The changed fish biomass under the scenarios of decreasing fishing mortalities on commercial fish stocks is much smaller than the uncertainty of the model (i.e. difference due to an altered set of initial conditions and uncertainty of the input data). However, the scenario #5 leads to a sprat biomass reduction of 18% and an increased cod biomass levels as was expected. The largest decrease of biomass for scenario #5 was that of the mysids. The mysids react only for the last two scenarios though. This is because of the way they are spatially distributed. Their limited spatial occurrence does not mean that their production is equally limited. Especially because sprat and herring have a broader spatial occurrence and do feed for a large part on the mysids.</p><p>Significant changes in Nephrops and detritus biomasses were as expected for the nutrient load reduction scenarios. For scenario #3 and #5, Nephrops decreases around 20% due to a decrease in their main food source, detritus. Labile and refractory detritus are a pool of fixed nutrients from faeces and non-predation mortality products. The decrease of this detritus pool is caused by a decrease of production of the rest of the ecosystem due to the reduced river load. In the scenario following the Baltic action plan, the Nephrops stock is reduced by 11%, less than for other scenarios. Consequently, the model response is proportional to load reduction and shows expected patterns and levels of effects on the different functional groups given current knowledge. This can be seen in context of a general propagation of the effect of the river load reductions through the whole ecosystem. When the small changes in biomass, which are generated in the scenarios, accumulate, then this might lead to a more extensive change of the detritus pool. This in turn can have an effect on those groups feeding on detritus, such as filter feeders, polychaetes, deposit feeders and Nephrops. Those multitudes of interactions is an argument for using an end-to-end ecosystem model to comprehend the more realistic perception of effects of nutrient load reductions taking into consideration the broader and complex biological processes, effects and interactions.</p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title>Oxygen</title><p>Distinct benthic oxygen concentration increases were simulated in many areas according to nutrient load reductions, especially in the Western Baltic and the Baltic proper areas while less distinct in the deeper areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199168.g011">Fig 11</xref>). Oxygen conditions in the bottom water layers improved with up to two to three times the amount of oxygen for scenario #4 and #5 compared with the baseline. Reducing the river load caused a reduced production of biomass which presumably lowered the need for oxygen in order to decompose all the organic matter. It must be emphasized though, that the benthic-pelagic coupling and sediment processes in general require further calibration and validation before we can apply a greater certainty to the above and below model output.</p><p>The increase of cod biomass might be linked with the increase in oxygen concentration for two reasons. First of all, benthic invertebrates have a higher survival chance due to the increased oxygen conditions. They are also the main food source for juvenile cod, especially the isopod <italic>Saduria entomon</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Secondly, the improved hydrographical conditions in the bottom water layers may have a positive effect on cod egg survival as it increases the reproductive volume [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. This is the volume of water in which the cod eggs develop and it is the key driver of its recruitment success. The reproductive volume is delimited by a concentration of oxygen &#x0003e;2mL L-1 and a salinity of &#x0003e;11 psu [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. While we didn&#x02019;t explicitly represent oxygen effects on the egg and larval stage it would affect new settlers so the model captures some of the potential recruitment effects, but not all.</p><p>The simulations mainly show an increase for the cod age-groups of 2&#x02013;4 and rather than in the 1<sup>st</sup> age group. This implies that the increase in food sources for the juvenile cod has a larger effect than the higher survival of its eggs (Figure L in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>). So, despite an increased production for the benthic organisms, their total biomass decreased due to accentuated predation by juvenile cod.</p><p>Anoxic zones have been known in the Baltic for long time and are severely impacting the ecosystem [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], because benthic species are unable to escape. Anoxic zones cause severe losses on entire benthic communities, which are seen as one of the causes for changed levels of fish catches since the 1970s combined hydrographical driven fish recruitment patterns [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>Sensitivity to change in fishing mortality for key fish species</title><p>When halving the fishing mortality, we did not see a doubling of the biomasses. This effect could be expected from a single species model, but not from an ecosystem model where the changes in fishing mortality results in changed biological interactions. As such, we for instance see cascading changes in the ecosystem food web which mitigate and buffer the effects. This is another reason that well-informed and evaluated complex ecosystem models are necessary to comprehend and project the full and long-term effects of changed fishing pressure.</p><p>The cod and sprat functional groups show expected effects of increased biomass when fishing pressure decrease and vice versa. The smaller reaction of sprat in comparison to cod when halving the fishing mortality is because of the already low fishing mortality for sprat in the Atlantis model, i.e. 0.07 in 2005. When the maximum observed fishing pressure of cod and sprat observed in recent years stock assessments ([<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199168.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] 1.2 and 0.6 respectively) is applied, then we see a stronger top down effect throughout the whole ecosystem. This stronger effect, propagating over multiple trophic levels, is off course to be expected since there is a large difference between the fishing mortality of scenario #8 and #9 versus #10. However, the different fishing mortalities do not have the purpose of testing different management scenarios, rather trying to see whether the model is reacting to and realistically reflecting changes in fishing pressure, which is shown with this example.</p></sec><sec id="sec037"><title>Fisheries economic evaluations of selected nutrient load reduction scenarios</title><p>The NPV decrease is according to the model framework caused by the lowered catch possibilities given the lower biomass when nitrogen load reduction is imposed. However, a biomass decrease does not necessarily leads to a NPV decrease. Lowered catch possibilities can, in some cases, also lead to reduced fishing costs, and thus an increase in NPV. Furthermore, given the reduced catch possibilities which are different for the different species, reallocation of effort among fisheries may actually lead to higher catches overall and thus higher catch values for some fleets [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] in such a case the fisheries management system would not constrain the catches with TACs.</p><p>Even though the Nephrops is a commercially high valuable species, its 10&#x02013;20% reduction in biomass did not seem to have a linear response in the FISHRENT output as there was no difference in the NPV for the Kattegat area, where Nephrops is caught. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, Nephrops is a choke species in FISHRENT. This means that a vessel can be forced to stop fishing because it exhausted the quotas for Nephrops, despite underutilized quotas for other species. Accordingly the fishery and its outcomes are not directly dependent on the Nephrops stock biomass as it has a constant quota set, which cannot be exceeded. The likely reason why the decrease is most pronounced in Western Baltic is due to the decrease in the herring stock in scenario 3 as the TAC of herring is not choking. The quotas were kept constant and equal to the values in Table J in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199168.s001">S1 File</xref>. Secondly, the FISHRENT model does not distinguish the fleets between the Western Baltic and the Kattegat, i.e. it considers the catches of the four fleets over a year in both areas. Thus, if less is caught of Nephrops leading to reduced NPVs for the fleet segments catching Nephrops this decrease is distributed proportionally on Kattegat and the Western Baltic according to the revenue and cost distribution keys.</p></sec><sec id="sec038"><title>Perspectives and future developments within the framework</title><p>There are a number of ongoing or planned developments within both Atlantis and the coupled framework. First of all, inclusion of more finely resolved vertical mixing will enable us to better capture the seasonal pattern of the nutrient distributions and processes such as changing mixed layer depth. This will enhance the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton and of oxygen mixing/non-mixing due to stagnation. Secondly, both levels and equilibrium of the production of the different functional groups will be evaluated besides the biomass in Atlantis. Next, the constant linear fishing mortality, applied equally across the whole Baltic Sea will be replaced in Atlantis by a spatial- and fleet specific fishing effort and mortality levels (resolved to the level of the spatial polygons in the model). This will also include information on fisheries economics such as revenue, costs and profit (Gross Value Added, GVA) to enable full fisheries economic analyses within the Atlantis model. Accordingly, the management- and economic module within the Atlantis model will be elaborated to avoid the need for an external bio-economic model and to dynamically model the feedbacks in the underlying processes. Lastly, the model sensitivity of the Atlantis model according to forcing from different bio-geo-chemical and hydrodynamic forcing models will be extensively explored.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec039"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this paper we have introduced a new calibrated Baltic Atlantis model and an integrated end-to-end modelling framework to examine ecosystem-wide responses under scenarios of human-induced changes in the Kattegat, Western Baltic Sea and southern Baltic proper regions with a focus on eutrophication, nutrient load reductions, and sensitivity to fishing pressure and climate factors. The Baltic Sea Atlantis model presented here for the first time forms the core of the established integrated framework. We have described the current setup of the framework with focus on the sensitivity of the Atlantis model to nutrient load reduction scenarios and fishing pressure changes; this demonstrates how the framework can be used to evaluate ecosystem and economic impacts: HBM-ERGOM, Baltic Atlantis and FISHRENT (noting that the FISHRENT KWB component of the framework only covers the Kattegat and the Western Baltic). Using four hypothetical eutrophication scenarios we demonstrated the capability of Atlantis and the framework to evaluate resulting changes in biological production and their long term biological consequences and economic impacts on the fishing catch sector, also taking into consideration fishing pressure as another anthropogenic impact. In light of the current assumptions and model limitations, we also have discussed the current and envisaged future improvements to the Atlantis model and the framework. The models have the potential to help evaluate conflicting objectives and alternative management strategies for better strategic management of human and natural pressures in relation to impacts on marine resources and in relation to an ecosystem based approach to management taking into consideration a sufficient complexity of processes and biological interactions in the ecosystem and the technical interactions in the fishery. They can also help with identifying knowledge gaps and recommendations for addressing them, e.g. regular benthos monitoring, and integrated data management for Baltic States.</p><p>Integrating marine ecosystem components for the purpose of providing integrated ecosystem advice currently relies primarily on an array of indicator-based assessment tools [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In the Baltic Sea, ecosystem status is evaluated both as a response to an individual pressure (using HELCOM HEAT 3.0; [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) or as a cumulative effect of many pressures via an integrated ecosystem assessment (HELCOM HOLAS; [<xref rid="pone.0199168.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). Such a purely statistical basis for advice can neither explain the underlying dynamics, processes, and mechanisms of change, nor can it project future responses to potential scenarios of altered pressures. Our proposed integrated (and in the long term perspective marine spatial planning and cross-sector) modelling platform offers means of an exploratory analysis of future scenarios of ecosystem-state responses to human-induced pressures, here demonstrated on the example of the eutrophication process impacting across fish stocks and fisheries. Further development of the Atlantis model and the modelling framework can be complementary to the indicator-based assessment tools (e.g. HELCOM HEAT and HOLAS tools) and, thus, be of interest to numerous stakeholders and policy makers interested in sustainable ecosystem-based management of marine resources in the Baltic Sea waters. In particular, the Atlantis-based framework can serve as a powerful holistic and long term strategic management strategy evaluation tool for such governing organizations as the ICES Working Group on Integrated Assessments of the Baltic Sea (ICES WGIAB) and their joint efforts with the HELCOM Group for the Implementation of the Ecosystem Approach (HELCOM GEAR), which has been established with the purpose of steering a managerial level process of successful implementation of the HELCOM BSAP. This is in order to help with meeting the ecological objectives and achieving good ecological/ environmental status of the Baltic Sea by 2021 at the latest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec040"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199168.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>Supporting Information A.
