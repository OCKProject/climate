The A4D model defines the territory as a socio-environmental system, that is to say, as the interrelations between social relations (links between actors) and environmental relations (links to nature). Therefore it aims at qualifying the relations between individuals (an actor's social profile), whether they are strong (powerful) or weak actors; and the relations between humans and non-humans (an actor's environmental profile), whether they are future generations or other species [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). It was developed both as a theoretical and as a methodological model. It aims to examine actors' perceptions on environmental and social issues, on a given space. It was designed to understand the overall stakeholders' dynamics on a territory, based on the analysis of different practices, representations and knowledge between actors about the environment and about the actor system.<fig id="fig0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Explanations of social and environmental profiles (taken from [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]).</p></caption><alt-text id="at0010">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="par0055">The A4D results allow producing what their authors call the "territorial footprint", an illustration of social and environmental profiles on a territory forming a spider web graph (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).<fig id="fig0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>A4D territorial footprint of a local fisherman in Maio, Cape Verde.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0015">Fig. 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p><p id="par0060">Each stakeholder (actor of the system) has an individual footprint, which is produced by the compilation of 32 variables (described and defined in Annex 2) comprised in eight sub-dimensions, making the model both qualitative, by the approach chosen, and quantitative, by the results analysis chosen. The four main dimensions of the model are: <italic>cooperation</italic> and <italic>conflict</italic> (social profile); and <italic>cohabitation</italic> and <italic>domination</italic> (environmental profile). The 8 sub-dimensions of the model (<italic>esteem; esteemed; criticize; criticized; attached; preserve; distant; spoil</italic>) inform about direct and indirect positioning of an actor within the SES, each footprint being informed by the actor discourse about himself (one of the assets of the A4D model is this reflexivity) as well as the others discourses about the actor. The A4D investigates within its social profile if an actor criticizes/esteems others and in return, if he is esteemed/criticized by others. Following the same logic with the environmental profile and based on the idea that actors influence the territory as much as the territory influences them, we analyze if an actor appears attached/distant to his environment, and if he appears to preserve/spoil natural assets. The 32 variables give different information on the actors' tendencies within those dimensions through the analysis of their practices, representations and knowledge. The footprint, illustrating stakeholders' involvement and interactions, allows one to analyze common and divergent points between individuals and groups (if multiple individual footprints are grouped by making an average of actors&#x02019; indicators&#x02019; notation, detailed in Annex 4). Footprints comparison underlines common values, which can be useful to work towards new environmental governances.</p><p id="par0065">In order to study actors' positions in their SES, the A4D model is based on 1&#x02013;2&#x0202f;h long semi-structured interviews that ask actors specific and broader questions on their environment and its governance. In this specific case (the study of Maio&#x02019;s marine governance), 43 actors from various backgrounds and sectors have been interviewed. The interview guide is composed of 5 sections: structural data; ecological assets; social assets; personal actions and prospective (Annex 3 presents an example of an interview guide for fishermen). Each interview is decrypted through a discourse analysis (qualitative approach) and informs the territorial footprint (quantitative approach).</p><p id="par0070">For instance, questions related to the social realm, in the dimension <italic>conflict</italic> and sub-dimension <italic>criticizes</italic> would be: "whom most deteriorates the environment; who are your enemies/opponents?". Depending on the actors' answers, the <italic>vision of others</italic> component would score low (0: the actor doesn't talk about others, or only talks positively about them) to high (5: the actor stands against some other actors' projects and clearly identifies its enemies/opponents). The result would then be reported on the spider web, in front of the <italic>vision of others</italic> component (Annex 4 shows how answers can be translated into indicators' scores). <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows a fisherman's footprint (hand line fishing). It appears that its left side (<italic>cooperation</italic> and <italic>cohabitation</italic>) is wider than its right side (<italic>conflict</italic> and <italic>domination</italic>). This actor especially preserves (via a simple and non-invasive lifestyle) and is attached (even if he sees some issues, limiting its attachment) to his environment (environmental profile). His social profile shows that he is esteemed (for his traditional and vital role in Maio's community) but that he is involved in important social issues (in this case, mostly with industrial fishermen).</p><p id="par0075">The A4D can reveal important information about the actors' interactions and has the potential to be used by governance agents and actors themselves, by improving the dialogue on environmental issues. Managers could use this information and the whole footprint to better understand communities and actors' dynamics (all questions and related scores for the indicators are detailed in Annex 3 and 4). If discussed in a participatory governance process, it could help to target where mediation efforts need to be concentrated, what underlying elements explain the actors' perceptions, and where different interests need to be thoroughly discussed and negotiated. The A4D and its resulting territorial footprint thus can be a vehicle of data and debate, representing an operational tool for a mediator, and transferable to multiple territories and resources [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0015"><title>Method validation (data that validate the method and connect the SES and A4D frameworks)</title><p id="par0080">In order to parallel the A4D with Ostrom's framework, this part is dedicated to specifying links between both approaches, and Annexes 1 &#x00026; 2 detail those indicators with definitions. We focus here on the components of the actors' category of the SESF, where the analysis of perceptions takes an important place. This subsystem notably reflects how interviewees see themselves as well as other actors in relation with the environment (i.e., A4D's social and environmental profile).

Even if the number of actors may inform the sample size, and thus involve a relative representativeness, it does not inform the actors' degree of power or influence. Effectively, an actor may have an important influence on other actors or on specific resources, making its general input on the SES more important than another with less assets.

Furthermore, the sub-dimensions on place attachment and place distance explore the attraction and repulsion of specific objects of the territory, and thus inform on the liked and disliked physical objects of the territory, precisely located.</p><p id="par0145">Maio island being very isolated from Santiago (Cape Verde's capital) and other islands due to a great lack of appropriate transportation between islands, and because of its small size (275&#x0202f;km<sup>2</sup>), the island and its (vital) surrounding waters are the most appropriate scale to study SES.</p></sec><sec id="sec0045"><title>A5 Leadership</title><p id="par0150">Leadership is defined as a useful skill to organize collective action (people tend to follow actors with good leadership).</p><p id="par0155">In the A4D, leadership is illustrated by the sub-dimensions <italic>esteem</italic> and <italic>criticize</italic>, and especially by the indicators <italic>degree of involvement</italic>, which concerns the extent to which one actor respects the system's norms and values (passively or pro-actively, with more leadership); and the indicator <italic>room for maneuver</italic> that reflects the actor's capacity to mobilize his assets to negotiate with other actors.

In fact, as every fisherman does his own business and survives as such, without important collaboration effort, they appear to be satisfied with their low influence on others. Even if they don't respect (recognize and value) the actual system and institutions, fishermen are generally poorly motivated by the idea of more involvement to change this imperfect but still functional system.</p></sec><sec id="sec0050"><title>A6 Norms and social capital</title><p id="par0165">Norms and social capital are defined as the degree by which individuals can draw upon or rely on others for support or assistance in times of need: in brief, it represents their trust in others.</p><p id="par0170">In the A4D, indicators of the <italic>esteem</italic> and <italic>criticize</italic> sub-dimensions are relevant to inform on the degree of trust of the actors, especially the indicators <italic>actor's vision of others</italic> and <italic>respect of institutions</italic> on the cooperation side, and <italic>actor's vision of others</italic> and <italic>non-compliance with institutions</italic> on the conflict side. Those indicators respectively refer to the actor's positive perception about others and their projects (thus including trust and support); to the actor's compliance and mobilization in conformity with state and institutions' norms and programs; to the actor's critiques of others and their projects (i.e. distrust and dissidence); and finally, to the actor's disagreement degree on institutions and programs (which is often linked with distrust and lassitude toward unsuccessful initiatives).</p><p id="par0175">Maio's fishermen showed little respect for institutions and others. Even if they don't formally disagree with institutions, they feel an important lassitude and exasperation towards their ineffectiveness. They also criticize other actors, industrial fishermen first, but also corrupted or lazy managers. They consider that local police, managers and responsibility-tasks employees don't thoroughly do their jobs. However, they explain this attitude by the small size, small population and low technical, human and financial means of the island, which prevents people from properly enforcing laws and positive initiatives.</p></sec><sec id="sec0055"><title>A7 Knowledge of SES and mental models</title><p id="par0180">Knowledge of SES is defined as the degree to which stakeholders understand and make sense of the characteristics and/or dynamics of the SES.</p><p id="par0185">Apprehending convergences and divergences of knowledge among actors is a great part of the A4D model, therefore it is expressed through various indicators. On the social profile, <italic>vision of common action</italic> (<italic>cooperation</italic>) and <italic>vision of social issues</italic> (<italic>conflicts</italic>) inform about the type of knowledge mobilized by the actor on social issues. On the environmental profile, <italic>vision of environmental issues</italic> (<italic>cohabitation</italic>) and <italic>vision of man-nature relationship</italic> (<italic>domination</italic>) inform about the type of knowledge mobilized by the actor on environmental issues. These indicators respectively relate to an actor's understanding of his social environment; to his perception of antagonist actors and issues; to his awareness and feelings towards environmental issues; and finally, to his perception of actors and issues that are detrimental for the environment.</p><p id="par0190">Maiense's fishermen consider that there are important social and environmental issues in the SES, the most important one being foreign and industrial fisheries, that increasingly deplete the stocks they used to feed on (e.g. tunas) and come always closer to (and even enter sometimes) their restricted local fishing zone (3 nautical miles from shore). They consider fishing agreements in Cape Verde's waters, boat motorization and the arrival of scuba diving tanks as past events that increased the SES vulnerability. In future years, some feel apprehension of mass-tourism while others wish it could enrich their island.</p><p id="par0195">Fishermen present specific and detailed knowledge on the species they fish or used to fish, on social roles of other actors, on certain groups' corruption, etc. However, Maio's community doesn't like to dig too far in their peers' lives, making them unaware of some problems or preventing them from acting to improve the SES.</p><p id="par0200">Fishermen see their own action as positive for the SES (the <italic>Vision of environmental issues</italic> indicator rates 4/5 and the <italic>Vision of man-nature relationship</italic> indicator rates 0.5/5), which reflects their awareness on the SES, and their attitude of preservation and low domination on the socio-ecosystem.</p></sec><sec id="sec0060"><title>A8 Importance of resource/resources dependence</title><p id="par0205">This element is defined as the source of monetary income, livelihoods, cultural values, practices and services coming from the resources to the benefit of the actors.</p><p id="par0210">In the A4D, all indicators of place attachment and detachment (<italic>attached</italic> and <italic>distant</italic> sub-dimensions) directly inform this variable.

This is due to declining stocks, to harsher fishing conditions as they need to go further at sea with their small embarkations, and to changing climate and sea conditions, making their work increasingly unsafe and unpredictable. <italic>Social implication of attachment</italic> (3.2.3) is also quite high (4/5), explained by the fact that a degradation of fishermen entity (fishing stocks; fishing capacities, etc.) makes some of them wish to quit fishing, while others still want to continue their life vocation. <italic>Spatial implication of attachment</italic> (3.2.4) is also high (4.25/5) because fishermen are greatly aware that a decline of their entities means a threat for the whole SES. They also would like to transmit to future generations the pristine and rich sea that they used to know, as well as traditional activities like line fishing. In summary, fishermen are attached to their SES, but they strongly feel the necessity to distance from it because of their beloved and subsistence entities' decline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0065"><title>Nota bene</title><p id="par0220">Although this paper scopes Ostrom's SESF <italic>Actor</italic> tier in order to parallel with the A4D model, we wish to end this part by adding that other elements of the SESF can also be informed by the A4D, such as <italic>Governance, Interactions</italic> and <italic>Outcomes</italic> subsystems. As an example, for the <italic>Interactions</italic> subsystem, the conflicts sub-tier constitutes a whole dimension of the A4D, being thus addressed with lots of details, as well as social bounds (ex: <italic>Interactions'</italic> sub-tiers on self-organizing and networking activities). Concerning the <italic>Outcomes</italic> subsystem, the A4D measures socio-economic and ecological performance through actors' perception of types of social and environmental bounds, and through the importance that they give on the mentioned issues.

The Social-Ecological Systems framework (SESF) was created by Elinor Ostrom to better understand them [<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It received much attention since 2007 [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, even if the SESF is an important analytical framework [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], its operationalization remains elusive [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Also, even if stakeholders' participation is promoted by many authors [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and even if Ostrom encourages researchers to build their own frameworks in collaboration with the system stakeholders, the SESF has been criticized for its difficulty in showing and explaining diverse actors' viewpoints, perceptions or intentions [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which influence SES interactions and outcomes.</p><p id="par0230">S&#x000e9;bastien and Paran [<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] developed the Actor in 4 dimensions methodology (A4D) in 2006 [<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in order to analyze and model an actor's relationship with other actors (social profile), and his relationship with nature (environmental profile) [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this regard, the A4D model informs specifically the <italic>Actors</italic>' sub-system of the SESF, even if it can also give useful insights for other framework's sub-systems.<xref rid="fn0015" ref-type="fn">3</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec0075"><title>Additional information: discussion on the A4D comparison with the SESF</title><sec id="sec0080"><title>Individual perceptions and discourses</title><p id="par0235">The first contribution of the A4D model towards the SESF is that of the analysis of individual perceptions. The A4D is designed to gather and study individual perceptions (including intentions), or mental models and belief systems [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which influence interactions between individuals, and between individuals and their environment, with unique outcomes from one person to the other. As the SESF only analyses groups of actors, it can be blind to some individuals that would make a difference on the whole system [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In our case study, this is what happened with a fisherman who dives to gather buzios (gastropods) in huge quantities almost each day. Even if most other fishermen are respectful of the laws and of the environment, one single fisherman with a high degree of social conflict and environmental domination could greatly affect the SES (without being identified in the global picture of the SES; see <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).<fig id="fig0025"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of grouped footprints (12 local fishermen to the left - A) and individual footprint (spearfisher/diver - buzio fisherman - on the right - B).</p></caption><alt-text id="at0025">Fig. 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig></p><p id="par0240">SESF is a great schematic representation of a complex system. However, it could better incorporate individual perceptions and their impacts on the system [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The A4D methodology and its territorial footprints provide a tool to better understand the diversity, repartition and impacts of these perceptions.</p><p id="par0245">In the same line, Thiel et al. [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] highlighted the lack of discussion on the role of discourses in 20 studies using SESF. By analyzing each actor's discourse and by underlining which elements of their vocabulary best reflect their mindset on different issues, the A4D allows researchers to use discourses to explain <italic>Interactions</italic> and <italic>Outcomes</italic> of the SES. For instance, some fishermen considered that the sea is more powerful than everything; that it can recover from any harm. They thus see fish stocks declining, but remain confident in their natural/spontaneous recovery, which is also related to their religious fervor (beliefs). This may explain an attitude of certain laxity towards national decisions that may affect their marine environment, and <italic>in fine</italic>, their subsistence and livelihoods. Their discourses therefore reflect personal viewpoints, on themselves (their activities and position in the SES) and on others (other's activities and place in the SES).</p><p id="par0250">Another unique attribute of the A4D theory, methodology and model, is its reflexivity. The A4D illustrates others' visions and discourses on an actor as well as reflecting the actor's individual perceptions on himself. In the course of an A4D interview, actors are asked about how they see themselves in the SES: if they think that they have a beneficial or detrimental effect on the environment; if they think that other actors appreciate their work and role in the SES, etc. This does not seem to be integrated in Ostrom's framework, although people perceptions of themselves, of their capacity to change the SES, etc. are essential elements affecting their real action on the SES [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The A4D then informs the <italic>Actor</italic>'s sub-system and second-tiers and goes further into the actors' analysis through this reflexivity.</p></sec><sec id="sec0085"><title>Power relations and global governance</title><p id="par0255">Of the 20 case studies analyzed by Thiel et al. [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], none or few discussed the role of power dissymmetries in explaining SES. This limitation may be due to these specific case studies or to the framework itself. Even if not central to the SESF, conflict and power relations analysis is partly integrated in the "rules in use" of the SESF by showing which group or individual's interests prevail effectively in the SES, especially when compared with formal statements [<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Still, power relations are under-represented in the SESF [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p id="par0260">As power relations are often linked to individuals' assets (goods, contacts, job positions, or other elements such as blackmail), it is easier to include power stakes into discussion when analyzing individuals and their perceptions in the SES, instead of groups. Power relations are at the heart of the A4D, which aims at analyzing which actors and elements influence the most environmental issues and governance. For instance, indicators of the "esteemed" and "criticized" sub-dimensions refer to power relations based on money, on knowledge, on assets uniqueness and on social position and influences. Regarding the environmental profile, power relations appear mainly in the ability of actors to protect or destroy environmental assets on the territory.</p><p id="par0265">By classifying actors as <italic>strong</italic>, <italic>weak</italic> and <italic>absent</italic> actors within a SES, the A4D deals with unequal power relations [<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While <italic>strong actors</italic> will generally be reflected in effective decisions and actions on the SES, <italic>weak actors</italic> are those who do not have the best assets in the negotiation (charisma, power, relations&#x02026;) to impose their choice, their moral value and defend their interests. These are underrepresented contemporary humans who can bring unthought-of elements to the territorial debate, such as vernacular knowledge, a memory of the place, territorial ties [<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. <italic>Absent actors</italic> represent biological living and future generations and are embodied by non-human actors and non-contemporary actors, those who cannot be present at the negotiating table and who are nevertheless stakeholders. While it is important to find a negotiated solution to conflicts between contemporary humans over the uses of a common good, it should not be adopted to the detriment of absent actors [<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The A4D, by identifying spokespersons speaking in the name of <italic>weak</italic> and <italic>absent</italic> actors (reflecting their interests), allows their voice to be heard, or to be integrated into the negotiation process. All actors (<italic>strong, weak</italic> and <italic>absent</italic> actors) need to be integrated into the SES analysis, because analysis based solely on strong actors' perceptions could lead to environmental degradation [<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. If all put together, or if grouped without careful attention, <italic>strong, weak</italic> and <italic>absent</italic> actors could all be mixed, thus not properly reflecting underlying power relations. This - dissociation of power relations in place - feature of the A4D, could then help to "reconnect" SES studies and decision-relevant information that policymakers could use [<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p id="par0270">In Maio, a group that appeared to be a good spokesperson for future generations as well as for marine life was fish saleswomen. Effectively, this group was very attached to the environment and to its entity (fish, for subsistence and traditional meals, but also species that had disappeared or were threatened, such as some shark and ray species). They were very concerned by Maienses future generations' ability to continue fishing and pursue their traditional livelihood activities. For that reason, they wanted to be heard in order to preserve Maio's SES. Their views on common action (participative governance) were the highest of all groups of actors. Therefore, fish saleswomen, willing to be involved in decision-making and attached to their entities (job and fish, for themselves and foremost, for future generations), are a good example of spokesperson for <italic>weak</italic> and <italic>absent</italic> actors in the A4D.</p><p id="par0275">Governance systems are guided by individuals, each having their own perceptions on social and environmental stakes, and thus influencing decision-making as well as related processes (governance communication, information and effective enforcement). Individual perceptions influence collective access to natural resources, to their property and usage rights. In Maio's case, some decision-makers think that fish overexploitation is mainly caused by local illegal practices and therefore regulated those activities. Although these need to be limited, fishing pressure from foreign fisheries is a greater threat, on most interviewees&#x02019; point of view. Therefore, decisions do not overcome the main cause of resources overexploitation. This dichotomy between perceptions (or intentions [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]) and actions can only be addressed by the SESF if it corresponds to a group's mental model, which appears more clearly in the A4D by a comparison between individuals and groups' footprints and therefore, by a comparison of their environmental and social profiles.</p><p id="par0280">Using territorial footprints also allows participative governance and information sharing between actors, an essential criteria for good co-management [<xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The A4D model can effectively help engaging dialogue among actors, by revealing individual intentions and perceptions, by allowing a debate about actor&#x02019;s values, and by proposing a negotiation between <italic>strong, weak</italic> and <italic>absent</italic> actors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0090"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="par0285">We showed that the A4D can be a useful method to complete and operationalize the SES framework, specifically its <italic>Actor&#x02019;</italic>s subsystem, by incorporating individual strategic (subjective) elements in a systemic framework and by adding a reflexive perspective. Furthermore, the association of A4D model and SES framework contributes to a reflection on governance issues, and on the necessary integration of individual perceptions and power relations in the analysis of local governance systems. In that perspective, the A4D and its territorial footprint can be powerful to go further in the SES analysis, and in its diffusion towards local actors.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Using perceptions as evidence to improve conservation and environmental management</article-title><source>Conserv.
