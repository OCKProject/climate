 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Particular attention was given to one focal species, the leatherback turtle, owing to its protected species status and influence on the design of the existing time-area closure. We quantified persistence of leatherback bycatch risk in each pixel by counting the number of days in which predicted habitat suitability was above a 25% threshold during the August to December fishing season. The temporal patterns in bycatch risk for leatherbacks were explored daily over the fishing season to examine the efficiency of dynamic closures compared to the static PLCA. While the PLCA includes a significant portion of leatherback habitat in the California Current (

We found that a dynamic closure would have required about half the area to achieve comparable bycatch risk reduction in August to September of 2012 and would have required only 11% of the PLCA area near the end of November (

In comparison, suitable habitat for leatherback turtles in 2015 was greater in area and more persistent, with a dynamic closure of 33 to 43% of the PLCA area needed to achieve similar levels of bycatch risk reduction. The same calculation was performed with a 50% threshold for the integrated risk product from August to December, resulting in dynamic closures ranging from 3 to 22% of the PLCA area in 2012 and from 13 to 28% in 2015. Overall, the PLCA is well placed for reducing leatherback turtle bycatch; however, it also greatly reduces fishing opportunity compared to dynamic closures.
