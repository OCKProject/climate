 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bycatch remains one of the most significant global barriers to fisheries sustainability, despite a range of mitigation efforts implemented in individual fisheries (

  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">
   <span class="italic">25</span>
  </a>). Innovation in effective fishery management tools is urgently required to reduce the ecological impacts of non-selective fisheries. Our data-driven, multispecies dynamic ocean management approach provides a novel solution to reducing bycatch while supporting sustained catch rates through coupling high-resolution Earth Observation data with fisheries observer and fisheries-independent data sets. Single-species dynamic ocean management approaches have been applied elsewhere, such as the voluntary framework to reduce loggerhead turtle bycatch in the central North Pacific (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>) and the mandatory framework that limits tuna fishing opportunities in the waters of Eastern Australia when bycatch quota is not available (
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>). However, this is the first example of a multispecies tool that can predict both catch probability and bycatch risk in near real time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses suggest that dynamic ocean management can support effective bycatch reduction while maintaining fishing opportunity, thereby allowing fisheries managers to meet dual objectives of ecological and economic sustainability. Our findings suggest that, by tracking daily oceanographic conditions, the California swordfish DGN fishery could access currently closed fishing areas while still protecting leatherback turtles. Previous findings have shown that the timing of the PLCA is well placed to reduce bycatch (
  <a rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" href="#R26">
   <span class="italic">26</span>
  </a>). Our hindcast model predictions show that the current static closure is well placed spatially, although at times overly conservative. When protecting the top 75% of predicted leatherback habitat, dynamic closures were at most half of the size of the current PLCA. When protecting the top 50% of high bycatch and low target catch areas from integrated EcoCast risk products, dynamic closures were a quarter of the size, highlighting the opportunity cost of the current seasonal closure. Variability in closure size was high during the fishing season, as the proportion of predicted suitable habitat for leatherbacks within the existing protected area varied by 16 and 28% within 2012 and 2015, respectively. The interannual variability between these 2 years was up to 41%, suggesting that annual adjustments to closed areas could be an improvement when daily adjustments are not feasible. Intra- and interannual variability in dynamic closure size was muted when considering multiple bycatch species. Holistically, the results provide evidence that an eco-informatics approach that responds to ocean conditions at coarse temporal scales can be more effective than static boundaries in simultaneously supporting fishing opportunities and reducing bycatch.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, using historical species distribution data to designate static or seasonal closures puts these areas at the risk of losing ecological relevance as speciesâ€™ distributions shift with a changing climate (
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>). Anomalous ocean conditions place stress on static management approaches and are likely to become more frequent in the future (
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>), highlighting the need for climate-ready fisheries management (
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>). Dynamic ocean management tools can be used to test the efficacy of existing closures under increasing climate variability or long-term change. As the distributions and conservation status of populations of nontarget species change, eco-informatics tools can adapt to varying conservation and exploitation-based economic objectives. The implementation of marine spatial planning is both a sociopolitical and an ecological enterprise, often requiring significant stakeholder engagement when balancing across multiple conflicting needs (
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>). While static approaches require a new implementation phase to adjust, dynamic ocean management approaches are designed to adjust management boundaries as new information becomes available (
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
   <span class="italic">42</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the burgeoning growth of technological products and capacity, there are greater opportunities for eco-informatics approaches to meet challenging, and often conflicting, management mandates in both marine and terrestrial systems (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>). Dynamic modeling approaches confer opportunity to proactively address multiple management objectives using hindcasts, real-time data, seasonal forecasts, and climate projections, when available (
  <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
   <span class="italic">44</span>
  </a>). Management approaches that are based on dynamic species-environment relationships offer a potential win-win outcome for protected species and fisheries and provide climate-ready solutions to respond to both ocean variability and directional change. While no model is perfect, the iterative and adaptable design of dynamic ocean management approaches can improve as new data become available and new analytical techniques are developed. The continued development of eco-informatics and dynamic approaches will provide an important pathway to support long-term economic sustainability in concert with conservation of marine biodiversity.
