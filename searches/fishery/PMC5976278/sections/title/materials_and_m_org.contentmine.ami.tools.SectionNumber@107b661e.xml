 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a data-driven, multispecies predictive habitat modeling framework termed EcoCast to create daily predictive surfaces that quantify relative target catch-bycatch probabilities over the domain of the fishery. We first determined habitat preferences of the target species, broadbill swordfish, and three non-target species that interact with the fishery [leatherback turtle, blue shark (
  <span class="italic">Prionace glauca</span>), and California sea lions]. We used two independent species distribution data sets—National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries observer data from the DGN fishery (1990–2014) and satellite-linked tracking data collected during the Tagging of Pacific Predators (

   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>) program (2001–2009)—to determine the species’ presence and absence and to sample contemporaneous environmental conditions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a> and fig. S1; see Supplemental Methods). The fishery had observers on board for 4 to 23% of the vessels annually from 1990 to 2014, and these data were used to derive swordfish catch (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 5430 catch events), blue shark bycatch (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 4591 catch events), and absence sets with no target or bycatch of species (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 4074 and 4931 sets for swordfish and blue sharks, respectively) for use in species-specific models [see the study of Scales 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>)]. Sample sizes of bycatch events for sea lions (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 157 catch events) and leatherback turtles (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 25 catch events) were insufficient to build robust models. Argos tracking data were obtained for blue sharks (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 70 individuals), female California sea lions (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 75 individuals), and leatherback turtles (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 20 individuals). Details on tagging methodology are available for sea lions (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>), and blue sharks (
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">
   <span class="italic">24</span>
  </a>). All tracks were standardized using a state space model, generating a daily regular position including uncertainty estimates to match availability of remotely sensed environmental data (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pseudo-absences (hereafter called absences) for tracking data were generated by creating a set of 20 correlated random walks for each individual, which started at the tagging location and matched the total duration of the tag (fig. S2). Each step was determined by sampling a paired step length and turning angle from the distribution of observed step lengths and turning angles from the corresponding track [see the study of Hazen 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>)]. The correlated random walks thus recreate movement characteristics that are similar to the original track but move independently of the underlying environment to sample space available to, but not used by, focal individuals. We collated tracking data and randomly selected absences into a master data set, combining locations received from all individuals sampled from each population. To account for sampling bias and reduce spatial autocorrelation issues, presences and absences from tracking data were randomly and iteratively sub-sampled 1000 times.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Presence and absence data sets were used to sample remotely sensed environmental variables using date, location, and mean position error. All environmental data fields were resampled to a common extent and resolution (0.25° × 0.25° pixel size) that matched the coarsest resolution product. Mean values were sampled at each location over a radius encompassing the mean position error in tracking data (0.5°), and SD was calculated over a 1° × 1° window. Environmental data sets were extracted via Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)/Environmental Research Division’s ERDDAP, when available (
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>), including sea surface temperature (SST) from Pathfinder and GHRSST (mean and SD), zonal wind (y-wind) speed as a proxy for upwelling from Quikscat and Ascat (mean), and chlorophyll a (chl-a) from SeaWiFS and MODIS Aqua (mean). Additional variables were extracted from Aviso+ and CMEMS (Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service) servers, including sea surface height anomaly (SSHa; mean and SD), and eddy kinetic energy (EKE) calculated from zonal and meridional current fields (mean). Sea surface temperature SD, SSHa SD, and EKE provide metrics of mesoscale activity at multiple scales. Lunar illumination, a proxy for the amount of moonlight reaching the sea surface, was calculated using the lunar package v.0.1-14 in R (v. 3.4.0), and bathymetry (mean and SD; that is, bottom depth and roughness) was acquired from ETOPO1. Although our current product may not be considered high resolution for all ocean uses, product resolution can be improved as new satellite products come online or as new ocean-modeled products become operationalized (

  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We built and validated a suite of species distribution models using boosted regression trees with a binomial (presence-absence) response to quantify the probability of the presence of each of our focal species as a function of combined environmental covariates (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>). Resultant models then were used to predict relative habitat suitability for each of the focal species at daily time steps (figs. S3 to S5). We examined the spatiotemporal variability in daily predictions at 0.25° resolution over the main period of operation of the fishery (August to December) in two contrasting years—2012, a year of typical oceanographic conditions in the California Current, and 2015, an unusually warm year resulting from a marine heatwave and the strong El Niño event of 2015–2016 (

   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To create an integrated multispecies predictive surface, we weighted each layer by the relative management risk of the focal species before averaging across layers. Species risk weightings were determined on the basis of management concern, discussion with fishers and managers, and fishery bycatch rates such that critically endangered leatherback turtles were given values twice the weighting of blue sharks and over 10 times that of sea lions. Prediction layers for each species were combined into a single surface by multiplying the layer by the species weighting, summing the layers, and then normalizing the range of values in the final predictive surface from −1 (low catch and high bycatch) to 1 (high catch and low bycatch). We assessed a suite of potential species weightings based on management concern (fig. S6) to illustrate how they influence the EcoCast predictions. Given that the weightings are arithmetically determined, increasing bycatch risk for a species by a factor of 2 would also increase risk in the integrated surface proportionally, albeit with different spatial patterns.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Target catch maintenance was equally as important as bycatch reduction in this management scenario. As such, pixels with low integrated risk and low swordfish suitable habitat (&lt;25%) were given a 0 value to ensure that fishing effort was not directed to areas of extremely low bycatch yet also low target catch. The top quartiles of species-specific predictions were plotted in time to illustrate how they changed throughout the season for a normal (2012) and anomalously warm year (2015; fig. S5). In addition, the persistence of bycatch risk for leatherback turtles within the study area was explored over the fishing season (August through November) to examine the efficiency of dynamic closures compared to the 552,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> static Pelagic Leatherback Conservation Area (PLCA). Daily pixels with leatherback turtle habitat suitability greater than 0.25 (top three quartiles) were considered to be a conservative threshold for leatherback bycatch risk. This value was chosen based on previous critical habitat threshold estimates of 0.75 for top predators (

  </a>, 
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>). Suitable-habitat pixels were summed across the 2012 and 2015 fishing seasons independently and divided by the total number of days, resulting in values of 0 to 100% persistence of turtle habitat per pixel. Hypothetical dynamic closures were then compared to the spatial area covered by the Pelagic Leatherback Conservation Area. The calculations for leatherbacks alone included more conservative habitat cutoffs (25%) than that of the integrated multispecies time series (50%). This resulted in smaller closed areas when considering multiple species compared to the conservative approach used when protecting leatherbacks alone.
