 <p>We thank the scientific teams and all those who supported animal tagging efforts including the Tagging of Pacific Predators program and equally the SWFSC fisheries observer program that collected bycatch data aboard drift gillnet vessels. We are grateful to the numerous captains and crews who provided ship time and logistical support and NOAA regional managers including H. Taylor and T. Fahy who provided feedback and support along the way. We also thank L. Hazen of Stanford’s Center for Ocean Solutions for logistical and meeting support toward achieving the NASA project goals. This project was a brainchild of the late D. Foley whose career was dedicated to incorporating oceanographic data into fisheries management. 
  <span class="bold">Funding:</span> This manuscript is the culmination of a NASA Ecoforecasting funded project (NNH12ZDA001N-ECOF) with additional support from California Sea Grant, NOAA’s Bycatch Reduction Engineering Program, NOAA’s West Coast Regional Office, and NOAA’s Integrated Ecosystem Assessment program. 
  <span class="bold">Author contributions:</span> This NASA modeling study was initiated by E.L.H., S.J.B., R.L.L., L.B.C., and S.M.M. Tracking data were collected by D.P.C., H.D., S.K., S.R.B., and T.E. Observer and tracking data were compiled by S.M.M., and oceanographic data were compiled by E.L.H., S.J.B., S.M.M., D.K.B., and K.L.S. Analyses were led by E.L.H. and K.L.S. with significant contribution from S.M.M., D.K.B., and H.W. Figures were created by E.L.H. and K.L.S. The manuscript was drafted by E.L.H. and edited by all co-authors.
