  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Swordfish (observer) were predicted to occupy the broadest portion of the California Current. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Leatherback turtles (tracking) were predicted to occupy waters offshore of the upwelling front, yet avoiding newly upwelled waters. (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) California sea lions (tracking) occupied cool, nearshore waters with proximity to their haul-out sites. (
   <span class="bold">D</span>) Blue sharks (tracking) were also broadly distributed and avoided the coolest upwelled waters nearshore. (
   <span class="bold">E</span>) Blue sharks (observer) were more closely tied to mesoscale features, incorporating both species distribution and fisheries catchability.
