  <p>Details of countries designating large-scale marine protected areas (LSMPAs), available management, and jurisdictional location. (a) The number of LSMPAs designated and promised by country where there is an identifiable management plan in force (black) or in preparation (dark gray), where no management plan could be identified (white), and where management is not applicable because the MPA is not yet legally designated (white with dashed border). (b) A breakdown of countries that have designated or promised LSMPAs (n = 35). The shaded segments indicate where all LSMPAs of that country are in remote waters (overseas territories or distant waters). LSMPAs are detailed in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" href="#sup1">supplemental table S1</a>. Note that Chile has five LSMPAs detailed in (a) to accurately reflect management differences between the designated Motu Motiro Hiva Marine Park and the promised Rapa Nui Rahui (Easter Island) MPA, which, if designated, would replace the former. To accurately represent Chile in terms of contribution to global numbers of LSMPAs, only four LSMPAs are included in (b).
