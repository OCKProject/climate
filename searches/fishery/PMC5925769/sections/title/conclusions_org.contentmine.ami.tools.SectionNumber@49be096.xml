 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human activities have expanded across the oceans, and although intensity varies, few areas remain untouched (Halpern et al. 
  <a rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib37">2015</a>). With emerging activities such as deep-sea mining and marine biotechnology fast becoming reality, history suggests that exploitation pressures on the ocean will continue to increase and affected areas expand, rendering timely and increased protection vital (McCauley et al. 
  <a rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib49">2015</a>). Although LSMPAs are assets that already meet many immediate ecological and socioeconomic goals, their value will increase as the human footprint expands across the oceans. To achieve their full potential, however, MPAs of any size require effective implementation and management backed with strong protection (Edgar et al. 
  <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">2014</a>), and so it is essential that management ambition and protection level matches stated MPA objectives.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clearly, no single strategy can protect marine biodiversity and resources. Polarized debates about the superiority of LSMPAs versus fishery or other management can divide a scientific and management community that shares the common goal of intelligently governing the future of the oceans for the benefit of humanity and all life within. Combining LSMPAs with effective management of all ocean uses, including fisheries, and other MPAs, such as smaller networked sites or dynamic MPAs, will establish a diversified management portfolio that tempers potential losses, insures against inherent ecological and management uncertainty, and ultimately enhances the probability of successfully achieving sustainably managed oceans.</p>
