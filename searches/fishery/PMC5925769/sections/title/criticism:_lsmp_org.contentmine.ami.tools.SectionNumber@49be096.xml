 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This same criticism can also be applied to good fisheries management, with which MPAs are often compared. No one tool can achieve all goals for ocean management, and LSMPAs will not be able to protect against all anthropogenic impacts, particularly those that diffuse across boundaries. That said, LSMPAs are likely to help promote ecosystem resilience and adaptation potential to changing environmental conditions. For example, LSMPAs may encompass range shifts of marine species under climate change, reduce cumulative stressors on ecosystems enabling faster recovery from climatic impacts, promote larger populations more resilient to extinction and with greater genetic diversity, and act as wildlife refugia (Roberts et al. 
  <a rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib61">2017</a>). To be effective, MPAs of any scale must be part of an environmental management package that includes improved land management for pollution, effective fisheries management, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
