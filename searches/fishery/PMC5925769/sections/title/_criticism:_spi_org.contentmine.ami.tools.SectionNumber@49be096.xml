 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phenomenon of “fishing-the-line” around MPAs is well documented and enables fishers to benefit from the spillover, or net emigration, of commercially valuable species (Di Lorenzo et al. 
  <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">2016</a>). Such a response is rational: They can fish more effectively at less expense through reduced fuel and time spent searching for fish due to greater stock densities. Furthermore, fishing-the-line provides evidence that an MPA is appropriately located for the target fish species and indicates management effectiveness.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishing-the-line may be perceived as disadvantageous to a nation that has established a LSMPA because many, but not all, extend to EEZ boundaries. Any spillover benefits at their outer boundaries will therefore accrue beyond national jurisdiction. This could be remedied by making the outer strongly or fully protected limits within national waters or by zoning the protected area to allow domestic fleets to benefit. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve, for example, the tuna purse-seine fleet (66 vessels from 10 nationalities) can be seen fishing-the-line around the reserve (Boerder et al. 
  <a rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib8">2017</a>), suggesting that Ecuador is benefiting financially through granting access.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although fishing-the-line may limit the geographic spread of spillover, it should not affect the overall amount unless fishers catch more fish than can be biologically sustained or concentrate in particularly sensitive areas. Nor will it affect the export of eggs and larvae to surrounding areas, which is one of the major and spatially most far-reaching benefits of protection (Di Lorenzo et al. 
  <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">2016</a>). Fishing-the-line also offers the opportunity to encourage stakeholder support for protective measures, although in overexploited fisheries, reductions in total fishing effort will likely be required to ensure sustainability (Kellner et al. 
  <a rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib43">2007</a>).
