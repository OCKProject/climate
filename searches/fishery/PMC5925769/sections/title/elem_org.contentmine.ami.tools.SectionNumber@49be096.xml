 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four commonly aired criticisms relating to this theme were identified (figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">3</a>). We evaluate the evidence for each in the sections below.
 </p>
 <sec id="sec4-1" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Criticism: LSMPAs can undermine social justice (e.g., De Santo et al. 
   <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">2011</a>).
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concerns about the relationship between LSMPAs and social justice must be taken very seriously given the critical need to balance and harmonize goals for biodiversity protection with human rights. Complaints about infringement of social justice are usually made where LSMPAs have been designated by top-down processes. Concerns over political motivations (e.g., Chagos Marine Reserve; De Santo et al. 
   <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">2011</a>), lack of universal support (e.g., Easter Island Marine Park; Radwin 
   <a rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib60">2016</a>), and inadequate stakeholder consultation (e.g., New Zealand's Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary; Newman 
   <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">2016</a>) have all been raised. In the case of the Chagos Marine Reserve, for example, a leaked confidential UK government memo in 2010 suggested prevention of resettlement of the archipelago by Chagossians was a motivation for the LSMPA. However, designation was under the proviso that “should circumstances change, all the options for a marine protected area may need to be reconsidered” (FCO 
   <a rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib25">2009</a>), leaving the opportunity open for island resettlement. Recent legal rulings state that the LSMPA has no bearing on the UK government's decision not to permit resettlement (UK Supreme Court 
   <a rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib67">2016</a>), whatever private communications were had. Thus, although the forced expulsion of the Chagossians in the 1960s and 1970s is undoubtedly a case of undermined social justice, the claim that the establishment of the Chagos Marine Reserve furthers this is, in our view, inaccurate.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is essential that people are considered alongside nature in any marine management decision in order to not only promote equity and justice but also improve compliance, thereby reducing enforcement costs and increasing management effectiveness (Agardy et al. 
   <a rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib2">2016</a>, Di Franco et al. 
   <a rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib22">2016</a>). For example, involvement of Native Hawaiians led to cultural heritage and the importance of an uninterrupted seascape for traditional navigation featuring prominently in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument designation (Friedlander et al. 
   <a rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib28">2016</a>). The 2016 expansion was initiated by a group of Native Hawaiians with full support from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, and the reserve has been designed to exclude commercial fishing but allow Native Hawaiians to exploit resources for subsistence and cultural purposes (Kikiloi et al. 
   <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">2017</a>). Similarly, the Pitcairn Islands Marine Reserve covers the entirety of the EEZ, excluding halos around islands and an offshore reef so that the local population can continue fishing for subsistence and trade. Likewise, the Palau National Marine Sanctuary extends from 20 nautical miles beyond coastlines to Palau's EEZ boundary (equivalent to 80% of the EEZ), with management of 0–20 nautical miles devolved and exclusive access given to local communities in accordance with land-based boundaries. More recently, continued engagement with the Rapa Nui has led to majority support for the designation of the Rapa Nui Rahui (Easter Island) MPA.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More generally, stakeholder involvement in the design of LSMPA management zones also contributes to equitable management (e.g., Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; Day and Dobbs 
   <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">2013</a>). In reality, however, there is almost never universal support for any change in management, and it is unrealistic to expect this for all MPAs, regardless of size, although where local communities are small it is possible (e.g., Pitcairn Islands Marine Reserve; Pitcairn Islands Tourism 
   <a rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib59">2017</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of the social concerns raised regarding LSMPA creation relate to potential future use of an area rather than displacement of existing activities, and focus on consumptive rather than nonconsumptive users. However, LSMPAs have generally been located in areas subject to fewer commercial interests, particularly in terms of commercial fisheries activity (figure S2). The low overlap with commercial fisheries, combined with the design of LSMPAs to permit traditional and artisanal fishing by local communities, suggests displacement of fishers is not currently a major concern for the majority of LSMPAs. Where local people are present, it is essential that LSMPAs are designated with their involvement and support. However, if they are absent, then top-down political designation may be a more valid option, so long as appropriate consideration of an area's existing uses and values occurs (Gruby et al. 
   <a rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib36">2016</a>, Ban et al. 
   <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">2017</a>, Bennett et al. 
   <a rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib7">2017</a>, Christie et al. 
   <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">2017</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At a global scale, current ocean management has, in some cases, led to situations of social injustice in which the loss of biodiversity and its associated benefits has occurred by capitalist forces at the expense of those less empowered, leading to unequal distribution of benefits at the cost of shared resources. For example, 10 countries capture 71% of the landed value of high-seas fish stocks, an area where LSMPAs could help reduce inequality in the distribution of fisheries benefits among the world's nations in a cost-effective fashion (Sumaila et al. 
   <a rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib64">2015</a>, Cheung et al. 
   <a rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib10">2017</a>). Similarly, LSMPAs zoned to allow some extractive use for local people could also be used to promote social justice and food security by enhancing local catches from spillover effects and helping to combat unsustainable fishing by industrial fleets (Standing 
   <a rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib63">2015</a>). For example, the Palau National Marine Sanctuary has been designed to redistribute benefits to Palauans by restricting access by foreign fishing fleets and promoting local management.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ocean resources are shared and of wider importance than simply direct economic value. LSMPAs are therefore well suited to address social justice and equity, including intergenerational equity, provided they are appropriately placed and consulted on (Ban et al. 
   <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">2017</a>, Bennett et al. 
   <a rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib7">2017</a>, Christie et al. 
   <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">2017</a>). Finally, the benefits arising from protection and improved ocean management will be experienced globally and include ecosystem services of wide public interest, such as climate regulation and biodiversity refugia.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The phenomenon of “fishing-the-line” around MPAs is well documented and enables fishers to benefit from the spillover, or net emigration, of commercially valuable species (Di Lorenzo et al. 
   <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">2016</a>). Such a response is rational: They can fish more effectively at less expense through reduced fuel and time spent searching for fish due to greater stock densities. Furthermore, fishing-the-line provides evidence that an MPA is appropriately located for the target fish species and indicates management effectiveness.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishing-the-line may be perceived as disadvantageous to a nation that has established a LSMPA because many, but not all, extend to EEZ boundaries. Any spillover benefits at their outer boundaries will therefore accrue beyond national jurisdiction. This could be remedied by making the outer strongly or fully protected limits within national waters or by zoning the protected area to allow domestic fleets to benefit. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve, for example, the tuna purse-seine fleet (66 vessels from 10 nationalities) can be seen fishing-the-line around the reserve (Boerder et al. 
   <a rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib8">2017</a>), suggesting that Ecuador is benefiting financially through granting access.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although fishing-the-line may limit the geographic spread of spillover, it should not affect the overall amount unless fishers catch more fish than can be biologically sustained or concentrate in particularly sensitive areas. Nor will it affect the export of eggs and larvae to surrounding areas, which is one of the major and spatially most far-reaching benefits of protection (Di Lorenzo et al. 
   <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">2016</a>). Fishing-the-line also offers the opportunity to encourage stakeholder support for protective measures, although in overexploited fisheries, reductions in total fishing effort will likely be required to ensure sustainability (Kellner et al. 
   <a rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib43">2007</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Criticism: LSMPA designation will reduce seafood supplies (e.g., Hilborn 
   <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2017</a>).
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global food security, particularly of lower-income countries, is already threatened by overexploitation of fish stocks, and this is likely to worsen under climate change (Golden et al. 
   <a rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib32">2016</a>). The fishery benefits of LSMPAs are an emerging field of study. However, in areas with high fishing effort, LSMPAs may already be providing localized fishery benefits (Ban et al. 
   <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">2017</a>). For example, the western and southwestern boundary of the Galapagos Marine Reserve attracts greater tuna fishing effort and supports a higher catch per unit effort than the remainder of Ecuador's EEZ, although declines in catch per unit effort are occurring throughout Ecuador's waters (Boerder et al. 
   <a rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib8">2017</a>). Other LSMPAs, such as the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, have been designed to enhance local seafood supplies. Spatial protection has long been a tool in fisheries management, and LSMPAs are no exception. Given that effective protection of important areas, such as spawning or nursery grounds, combined with good fishery management can help rebuild exploited fish stocks, LSMPAs may, in fact, contribute to increasing seafood supply while simultaneously achieving many other benefits, such as habitat protection and climate resilience. (Sumaila et al. 
   <a rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib64">2015</a>, Cheung et al. 
   <a rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib10">2017</a>).

 <sec id="sec4-4" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Criticism: LSMPAs are ineffective at protecting ecosystems against stressors such as climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution (e.g., Hilborn 
   <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">2017</a>).
  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This same criticism can also be applied to good fisheries management, with which MPAs are often compared. No one tool can achieve all goals for ocean management, and LSMPAs will not be able to protect against all anthropogenic impacts, particularly those that diffuse across boundaries. That said, LSMPAs are likely to help promote ecosystem resilience and adaptation potential to changing environmental conditions. For example, LSMPAs may encompass range shifts of marine species under climate change, reduce cumulative stressors on ecosystems enabling faster recovery from climatic impacts, promote larger populations more resilient to extinction and with greater genetic diversity, and act as wildlife refugia (Roberts et al. 
   <a rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib61">2017</a>). To be effective, MPAs of any scale must be part of an environmental management package that includes improved land management for pollution, effective fisheries management, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
