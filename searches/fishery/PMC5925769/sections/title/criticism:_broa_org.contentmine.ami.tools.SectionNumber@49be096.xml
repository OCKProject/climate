 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Criticism: Broadscale protection via LSMPAs is unnecessary as fisheries management can achieve better outcomes (e.g., Hilborn

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective fisheries management can achieve several of the benefits that well-managed MPAs offer; for example, reducing fishing effort can rebuild overexploited fish stocks (Costello et al. 
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">2016</a>). However, fisheries management focuses on species of commercial interest with nontarget or no longer commercially viable resources being of lesser consideration, and it often fails to account for the collateral impacts of fishing (Travis et al. 
  <a rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib66">2014</a>). Measures such as bycatch mitigation, gear restrictions, and seasonal closures may reduce some of the broader ecosystem impacts of fisheries (Graham N et al. 
  <a rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib33">2007</a>). However, MPAs embody long-term ecosystem-based management, protecting vulnerable and under- and unvalued species and helping secure ecosystem integrity through maintenance of trophic linkages, things that usually go beyond the mandate or competence of fishery managers (Travis et al. 
  <a rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib66">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">LSMPAs will also help to insure against uncertainty in fisheries management and expansion of human activities, encompass a scale approaching that necessary for protection of highly mobile species, and extend population age structures, enabling greater numbers of large individuals critical to population replenishment to build up. Undoubtedly, however, broadscale and effective fishery management is an essential complement to LSMPAs. Finally, this criticism assumes objectives of MPAs focus solely on addressing fishery problems, whereas MPAs are established to achieve a diverse range of objectives outside the remit of fishery management, including addressing threats from other activities, such as maritime traffic or oil and mineral exploration and exploitation.</p>
