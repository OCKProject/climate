 <p>Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are photosynthetic bacteria that under favorable environmental conditions produce secondary metabolites (cyanotoxins) which are harmful to the environment, including humans. The mass proliferation of harmful cyanobacteria is termed CyanoHABs. CyanoHABs can adapt to different climatic fluctuations, therefore, understanding their dynamics in freshwater systems is crucial. Variation in climatic and hydrological processes, changing land use and economic growth all influence the occurrence and distribution of CyanoHABs. There have been inadequate CyanoHAB studies at local scales, therefore their occurrence and dynamics cannot be generalized. This study reviews and synthesizes cases of CysnoHAB occurrence, magnitude, and timing and how these are linked with climatic and hydrological variations in the United Republic of Tanzania. In this study, a scoping review approach was adopted. Research articles, reports, and databases were consulted. The most common species of toxin-producing cyanobacteria were identified in different water bodies in Tanzania, as well as the record of mass fatality of birds (Lesser Flamingo) in Lake Manyara, which in almost all cases occurred during dry years. While previous studies on CyanoHAB dynamics and their links to climate, hydrological, and environmental changes have not been undertaken in Tanzania, there are studies in Lake Victoria and Tanganyika. Therefore, there should be an immediate response from water users, managers, researchers, and water authorities to address and actively engage in monitoring and managing the risks associated with CyanoHABs in Tanzania.</p>
