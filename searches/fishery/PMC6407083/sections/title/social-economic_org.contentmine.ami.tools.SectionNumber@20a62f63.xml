  <a rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib90">Suzane, 2016</a>) have indicated how CyanoHABs are associated with a wide range of economic impacts on human health, fishery, tourism, and recreational use, and monitoring and management costs. Cyanobacteria exert toxic effects on human, animals, fish, birds, and other phytoplankton that are associated with (

  <a rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib98">Wolf and Klaiber, 2017</a>) have indicated acute effects such as neurotoxicity, hyper-toxicity, diarrhoea and amnesia, abdominal pain, headache, altered pulse, respiratory failure, cardiac arrests, and even death. The principle behind is that cyanobacteria release toxins as their defense mechanism, when grazed, disturbed, and or in competition with phytoplankton (
  <a rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib76">Reichwaldt and Ghadouani, 2012</a>). This is still debatable.

 <p id="p0125" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tanzania has favorable environmental conditions (ecological, hydro-geological, and physical), and social economic activities (agriculture, industries, etc.) that support occurrence, and proliferation of CyanoHABs. A good example is the availability of several small to large standing and non-standing surface freshwater bodies (
  <a rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib21">FAO, 2016</a>). On the other hand, research activities and awareness of harmful algal blooms are lagging (
  <a rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib58">Ndlela et al., 2016</a>). Because of its heavy use of nutrients in food supplies, aquaculture can also trigger HABs proliferation. According to the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development (
  <a rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib93">The United Republic of Tanzania, 2013</a>), Tanzania aquaculture fish farmers increased from 3347 to 17511 in between the year 2000 and 2013 with a corresponding increase in ponds from 4000 to 19930 and landed fish production from 200 tons to 2989.5 tons (

  <a rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib80">Sanseverino et al., 2016</a>) have directly linked diarrhea among symptoms of exposure to cyanotoxins. This is important because diarrhea is among the leading waterborne diseases in Tanzania (
  <a rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib35">IHME, n.d.</a>). The current study does not intend to confirm that diarrhea in the study area is caused by cyanotoxins, but it is a hypothesis which needs to be tested. In summary, social-economic activities in Tanzania can be one among the route of exposure to CyanoHABs.
