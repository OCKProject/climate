 <p id="p0145" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CyanoHABs species are widely distributed in the study area and anecdotal observations suggest that they vary with seasons (dry and wet). No sufficient limnological data exist to perform time series analysis for getting a clear understanding of CyanoHABs dynamics in the region. In Tanzania the fields of CyanoHAB ecology, monitoring and management are in their nascent stage. There are however documentable cases that link seasonal variations of CyanoHABs, especially in Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika. Most of the studies are event-driven, for example, post-mortem studies although climate, hydrological variations (especially drought years and temperatures), and environmental conditions support their occurrence. Therefore, research and or academic institutions working on CyanoHABs in the country should be assessed and developed/empowered. Likewise, regular monitoring and documenting, and prediction of CyanoHABs dynamics in the regions should be considered. Future studies should focus on awareness and occurrence of CyanoHABs, epidemiological studies, toxicity occurrence and levels in the food web and timing. Due to the distribution of water bodies in varying localities (Dams, Rivers, Lakes, Ponds, and Ocean) in Tanzania, it would be wise to conduct a spatiotemporal survey of CyanoHABs and their link with environmental stressors. It is also encouraged to revisit the current management options, for example, water treatment plants for assessing CyanoHABs control efficiencies. Adapting to the risks associated with CyanoHABs occurrences, case studies that mimic future climate change scenarios (e.g. drought and heavy rains) will be more informative. Technological improvement such as the application of remote sensing for monitoring HABs should also be utilized. Policy and guidelines for dealing with algal blooms are yet to be formulated that also consider effects of climate, hydrological, and environmental (e.g. nutrients, and metals) conditions on HABs proliferations.</p>
