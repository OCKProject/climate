As noted earlier, available literature asserts the occurrence of toxic strains of cyanobacteria and their impacts in some parts of the United Republic of Tanzania. To date, the only documented reports/incidences in Tanzania is the mass fatality of Lesser Flamingos in saline lakes in Arusha and Manyara Region (

 <p id="p0065" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the mass fatalities of Flamingos in three soda lakes (Embakaai crater, Lake Natron and Lake Manyara in Arusha Region) the year 2000, 2002, and 2004, samples of both water and tissue were collected and analyzed for cyanotoxins. Same as a post-mortem study of 
  <a rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib22">Fyumagwa et al. (2013)</a>, which revealed the impact was due to cyanobacterial toxins (Anatoxin-a and Microcystins). In these studies, no detailed analysis of the environmental factors responsible for the mortality rate was conducted. In this particular study , the findings (for example pH) were more abstract (values not reported). The author (
  <a rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib22">Fyumagwa et al., 2013</a>) made a deduced that varying pH was due to prolonged drought out of no data, but it was good to speculate that anthropogenic activities could have triggered proliferation of harmful blooms. This implies that if there was regular monitoring of all environmental parameters in the lake, it would have facilitated tracking the influences of individual causal effects on HABs.

 <p id="p0070" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some others studies (
  <a rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib36">Kihwele et al., 2014</a>;

  <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">Lugomela et al., 2006</a>) in Lake Manyara found species of 
  <span class="italic">Cylindrospermum</span> (701 cells/ml) and 
  <span class="italic">Microcystis</span> (6043 cells/ml). These studies suggest repeated and unpredictable episodes of lesser flamingo fatalities which are attributed to the exposure to cyanotoxins and that the toxification may be spread to other East African Lakes. Increased water abreaction, tourism developments, and degradation of the catchment were found to be negatively contributing to the ecohydrological health of Lake Manyara (

  <a rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib44">Lugomela et al., 2006</a>). According to 
  <a rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib36">Kihwele et al. (2014)</a>, the change was constant with seasonal variability (more pronounced in the recent decade) although the study could not demonstrate the magnitude of change and climate variability.

  <a rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib48">Mdegela et al., 2011</a>). Another recent study by 
  <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Mushi (2015)</a> which compared pristine, urban and agricultural fields also found species of cyanobacteria, including toxin-producing specie of 
  <span class="italic">Cylindrospermopsis</span>.

  <span class="italic">Aphanizomenon</span> species, strains of
