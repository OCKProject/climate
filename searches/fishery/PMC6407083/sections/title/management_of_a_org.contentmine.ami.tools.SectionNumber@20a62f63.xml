 <p id="p0135" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A review by 
  <a rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib58">Ndlela et al. (2016)</a> focused on Africa noted that regarding research on CyanoHABs, little has been done. However, efforts have been made to at least formulate a global network to discuss and deliberate on matters related to CyanoHABs and their toxin risk management (
  <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">Codd et al., 2005a</a>). Further, to mitigate CyanoHABs, some solutions (technical and policies) are in place (in a global perspective); for example, land and water management, water treatment and blooms control (

  <a rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib32">Hazen and Sawyer, 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib83">Shayo et al., 2011</a>). Monitoring of CyanoHABs, treatment of algal toxins in drinking, recreational, fish farms, and irrigation waters can significantly minimize health impacts associated with their formation and dominance. Algal bloom management should be proactive because HABs are capable to adapt to a variety of climatic and other environmental conditions (
  <a rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib98">Wolf and Klaiber, 2017</a>) that promote their ability to outcompete other phytoplankton (
  <a rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib64">O'Neil et al., 2012</a>). According to 
  <a rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib2">Anderson (2012)</a>, case studies (e.g. heavy rainfall or drought) that mimic climate change scenarios should be used to understand HABs responses. 
  <a rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib90">Suzane (2016)</a> also suggest the use of case studies to quantify the social economic impact of HABs.

 <p id="p0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Managing CyanoHABs in the context of climate and hydrological variations is challenging (
  <a rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib68">Paerl et al., 2016</a>). Future studies should focus on how climate and hydrological variations affect nutrients dynamics. If nutrient reduction can significantly reduce HABs events (
  <a rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib70">Paerl et al., 2018</a>) then understanding the linkage between climate, hydrological variation, and other environmental factors are essential. There is a global and regional initiative for studying and management of HABs, for example, a global network for cyanobacteria blooms and toxin risk management (CYANONET) in which the United Republic of Tanzania is a member (
  <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">Codd et al., 2005a</a>). The project is intended for awareness, prevention and mitigating algal blooms. However, Tanzania, like many other countries policies, regulation, and guidelines on HABs management are yet to established (
  <a rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib54">Miraji et al., 2016</a>). Since there have been reports of HABs species and cyanotoxins in the study area, the opportunity for nation-wide monitoring, prevention, prediction, minimizing and suppression of HABs should be undertaken.
