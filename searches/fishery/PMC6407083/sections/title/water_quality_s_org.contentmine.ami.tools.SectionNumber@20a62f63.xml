Overall, the findings challenge water authorities on how HABs are perceived in the study area. This is also heightened by the facts that HABs have the ability to adapt to a changing environment (D.

  <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Mushi (2015)</a> found the occurrence of

  <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Mushi (2015)</a> there was no significant variation of the microbial community (Cyanobacteria inclusive) during the entire periods of the study. The claim leaves many questions, for example, predicting blooms in the study area. One would argue that the author's claim was based on limited data (short time period) and, therefore, this needs to be re-examined and evaluated.
