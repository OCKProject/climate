 <p id="p0030" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United Republic of Tanzania lies within 1–12 °S and 29–40 °E. Tanzania is blessed with a range of natural resources, for example, 6.4% of the country's area is water bodies (Lake Victoria in the North, Tanganyika to the west and Nyasa (Lake Malawi) to the south-west) and to the east lies the Indian Ocean (

  <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Drakenberg et al., 2016</a>). Regarding the climate, there is a temporal variation in both temperature and rainfall, and the trend is consistent (
  <a rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib59">New et al., 2006</a>). Tanzania's climate varies from tropical (along with the coast) to temperate (in the highlands) and there are two rainfall distribution types (unimodal and bimodal) (
  <a rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib21">FAO, 2016</a>). A well-detailed climate classification over Tanzania can be depicted from the previous climate studies (

  <a rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib73">Peel et al., 2007</a>). Several weather systems are responsible for the observed climatic variation, including thunderstorms, Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) as it moves south and north and, tropical cyclones (which pool moisture from Congo forest), Sea Surface Temperature (SST) which enhance easterly to northeasterly winds resulting into moisture influx over land (

 <p id="p0035" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Tanzania , no reports of fish kills or harm to domestic animals, including humans are directly linked to specific cyanotoxins. Guidelines and standards for algal toxin are yet to be established (
  <a rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib54">Miraji et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, in view of the above one can hypothesize that, if business, as usual, continues under a current climate change (warming, increase in carbon dioxide) CyanoHABs are likely to compromise water dependencies and in turn negatively affect our adaptation strategies.

 <p id="p0040" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the current review, we considered all published articles and reports on HABs incidences in Tanzania and how they have been associated with climate and hydrological variations. A wide range of limnological, environmental and scientific databases was also consulted for elucidating the theoretical aspects of HABs in the environment. There was no restriction on time of publications and or languages. Google search engine, webs, and journal databases were tools used in the current review.</p>
