 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seven models were performed to determine the best combination of environmental variables (i.e., the three variables that contributed most to the spatial distribution of Atlantic bluefin tuna; table S2). The model that considered each occurrence of bluefin tuna associated to a unique triplet of environmental parameters (SST, SSS, and bathymetry) displayed the highest adequacy with the observed spatial distribution (CBI = 0.84; table S2); we therefore retained this optimal configuration to assess the spatiotemporal variability in the habitat suitability of Atlantic bluefin tuna over the period 1891â€“2011.</p>
