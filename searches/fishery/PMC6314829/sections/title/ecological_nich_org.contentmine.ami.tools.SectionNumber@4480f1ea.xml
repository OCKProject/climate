 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nonparametric probabilistic ecological niche (NPPEN) model is an ENM specifically designed to be applied on presence-only data (

  </a>). This technique allows the modeling of the ecological niche of a species and the mapping of its spatial distribution by calculating its probabilities of occurrence. The first step consisted in constructing a reference matrix with environmental data corresponding to the presence records. The reference matrix was homogenized to remove as much as possible the inaccurate reporting of occurrence records, and this resulted in a multidimensional matrix, with each dimension reflecting an environmental factor (

  </a>). In the second step, the Mahalanobis generalized distance was calculated between the observations and the homogenized reference matrix. In the third step, the model calculated the probability of each grid point to belong to the reference matrix (

  </a>). Last, the probabilities of species occurrence were mapped in the geographical space. Here, the NPPEN model was applied (i) to calculate the ecological niche (sensu Hutchinson) of Atlantic bluefin tuna and (ii) to project its spatial distribution in the North Atlantic (north of 12°S, i.e., its distribution range) over the period 1891–2011 (fig. S1, analysis 2).
