  </a>). The CBI, developed for presence-only data and insensitive to pseudo-absences, was recommended for accurate evaluation of presence-only models such as ours (

   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>). A model was considered “wrong” when CBI values were below −0.5, “average to random” for values ranging from −0.5 to 0.5, and “good” for values above 0.5 (i.e., occurrences in regions with high habitat suitability). To investigate whether the random selection of data influenced the modeling of the ecological niche, we randomly selected 70% of the observed data to build the ENM, and the other 30% was used to evaluate its accuracy. This procedure was repeated 30 times for each simulation to provide the mean and SD of metric values. For each month and each run, the CBI was computed and averaged per simulation.
