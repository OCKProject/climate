 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated the partial correlations between the observed Atlantic bluefin tuna abundance index and the first four PCs obtained from the PCA applied on anomalies of probability of occurrence of bluefin tuna (fig. S4). After application of a forward/backward procedure, the first, second, and fourth PCs were used to elaborate a habitat suitability index of the Atlantic bluefin tuna (
