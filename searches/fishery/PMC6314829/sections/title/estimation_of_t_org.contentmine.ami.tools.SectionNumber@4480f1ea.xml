 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fisheries data are typically biased toward undersampling in remote areas and oversampling in known fishing grounds (

  </a>). To consider this potential bias, we tested 5 levels of homogenization of the reference matrix (see the “Ecological niche model: NPPEN” section) by using an increasing number of occurrences (from 1 to 3, 5, and 10) to evaluate the representativeness of each set of environmental conditions (i.e., SST, SSS, and/or bathymetry) on the model accuracy. The model that considered one species occurrence per triplet of environmental conditions outperformed other models (highest mean values and lowest SDs of the evaluation metric; table S2) and was selected for subsequent analyses.
