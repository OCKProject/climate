 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Atlantic bluefin tuna (
  <span class="italic">Thunnus thynnus</span>, Linnaeus 1758) is a long-lived, widespread migrating species with the largest thermal tolerance among tunas (
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">
   <span class="italic">1</span>
  </a>); it is also one of the world’s most commercially exploited marine fishes (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>). The bluefin tuna, currently managed as two separated stocks in the Atlantic (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>), has been declining in abundance until the mid-2000s (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>) and is listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Although electronic tagging programs begun in the late 1990s have provided new insights on the species’ migratory behavior to show that eastern (western) bluefin tuna may migrate to the western (eastern) Atlantic and remain there for a few months to a few years (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>), little is known about the long-term variability in the migratory behavior, regional abundance, and the spatial distribution of bluefin tuna (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bluefin tuna has shown centennial periodic fluctuations (up to threefold) in abundance in the Mediterranean Sea (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>), and the extremely rapid 1960s decline of the Nordic fishery remains one of the world’s most spectacular fisheries’ collapses (
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">
   <span class="italic">7</span>
  </a>). While the Nordic fishery collapse is attributed to overfishing without clear evidence of hydroclimatic influences so far (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>), environmental change could have played a role. Recurrent observations of bluefin tuna after the late 1990s suggest that bluefin tuna is returning to Nordic feeding grounds after three decades of depleted abundances (
  <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
   <span class="italic">9</span>
  </a>). Since stock assessments have not suggested any recovery before the mid-2000s (
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">
   <span class="italic">4</span>
  </a>), it is currently unclear why bluefin tuna has reappeared in the Nordic region. At a time when the recent increase in bluefin tuna catch quotas will exacerbate the pressure on an IUCN Red List species (
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">
   <span class="italic">5</span>
  </a>), we have investigated the basin-scale variability in the distribution of bluefin tuna. Our goal is to determine whether the current return of bluefin tuna in the Nordic region can be explained by large-scale, hydroclimatic variability and, if so, whether the environment may explain some of the historical changes in the bluefin tuna’s abundance and distribution.
