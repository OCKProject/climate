 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then investigated long-term changes in anomalies of probability of occurrence of bluefin tuna (also termed habitat suitability) obtained from the NPPEN model (fig. S1). We first calculated monthly anomalies for each geographical cell of the spatial domain, i.e., the difference between each probability of occurrence of bluefin tuna from 1891 to 2011 and the climatology of probabilities of occurrence of bluefin tuna calculated for the period 1891–2011. We then performed a standardized PCA to examine long-term changes in habitat suitability in the distribution range of bluefin tuna (i.e., the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea from 100°W to 37°E and from 12°S to 75°N). The first four PCs (55% of the total variance) reflected the main long-term changes in habitat suitability, and the normalized eigenvectors represented the correlation between changes in habitat suitability in each geographical cell and the corresponding PCs (fig. S4).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also evaluated long-term changes in habitat suitability by averaging monthly anomalies of probability of occurrence of bluefin tuna for different time periods: (i) negative (climatology from 1896 to 1928 and from 1963 to 1994) and positive (climatology from 1929 to 1962 and from 1995 to 2011) AMO phases (
