 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span> and 
  <span class="bold">C</span>) Historical records (black line) and predicted long-term fluctuations in abundance (averaged prediction as an orange line with 5 and 95% confidence intervals as gray shading) calculated from (A) 1634â€“1929 (preindustrial tuna fishery period) with no lag and (C) with a one-generation lag (16 years). (
  <span class="bold">B</span> and 
  <span class="bold">D</span>) Mean relative influence [and associated SD (standard deviation)] of the four hydroclimatic variables used to reconstruct bluefin tuna abundance.
