 <p>In order to achieve the objectives of resource conservation, it is important to recognize that habitats are connected by material and energy flows, and that humans often play a central role, directly or indirectly. Hence, ecological research should be designed that treats all interlinked habitats, including human populations, as one ecosystem. Examples would be coastal habitats that are impacted by effluent from the upland, which in turn can be generated by deforestation and harmful agricultural practices. All of these aspects, including the river systems that deliver run-off, should be included in the investigation. This approach entails a carefully articulated hypothesis or set of hypotheses drawing on the natural as well as social sciences, and an appropriate sampling and statistical design. It clearly imposes high demands on resources, financial and otherwise. But the continued compartmentalization of efforts along disciplines and specializations will likely slow down progress in environmental conservation.</p>
