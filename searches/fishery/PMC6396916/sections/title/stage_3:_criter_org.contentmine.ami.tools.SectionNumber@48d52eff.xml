 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While interesting, results from basic ranking and pairwise comparisons do not shed light on how the four data collection alternatives compare in relation to specific criteria. For example, project participants clearly preferred the status quo alternative overall, but how might they feel if they were asked to choose the most accurate data collection strategy or the least intrusive one? Questions like the one posed above can be answered by incorporating an understanding of what criteria affect preferences fishermen have about each data collection alternative.</p>
