 <div class="title">Results of ANOVA and chi-square tests comparing vessel length and previous experience with human observers (n = 72).</div>
 <p>(Table A). ANOVA results (n = 72) comparing vessel length and previous experience with human observers. If the p-value is less than 0.05, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis (that the mean, or average, value of the dependent variable experience with human observers is the same for all vessel lengths). (Table B) Chi-square results (n = 72) comparing vessel length and previous experience with human observers. If the p-value is less than 0.05, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis (that the two characteristics are independent).</p>
