regulatory alternatives that are desirable, objectionable, or important, in the judgement of fishermen. This knowledge could facilitate consideration by fishery managers of additional regulatory alternatives with high likelihoods of meeting program objectives, minimal disruption to fishing operations and lifestyles, and high levels of acceptance and compliance from the fishing fleet. In this case study, we interviewed Pacific halibut fishermen (n = 76) in four communities across Southeast Alaska, to document their preferences about different types of data collection methods on their vessels. We demonstrate how to use interviewing to gather preference data from a relatively small group of fishermen and get a reliable snapshot of preferences across an entire region. Pairwise comparisons from interviews were analyzed using a three-stage analytic hierarchy process model. Results characterize the variability of fishermen&#x02019;s preferences about data collection methods.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-0801720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9358-2422</contrib-id><name><surname>Figus</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Pollock Conservation Cooperative Research Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks</institution></funding-source><award-id>2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9358-2422</contrib-id><name><surname>Figus</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Mount Holyoke College Alumnae Fellowship</institution></funding-source><award-id>Bardwell 2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9358-2422</contrib-id><name><surname>Figus</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Northern Gulf of Alaska Applied Research Award</institution></funding-source><award-id>2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9358-2422</contrib-id><name><surname>Figus</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants from The National Science Foundation Marine Ecosystem Sustainability in the Arctic and Subarctic (MESAS) IGERT [grant number DGE-0801720 to E.F.]; a 3-year fellowship from the Pollock Conservation Cooperative Research Center [2014 to E.F.]; a Northern Gulf of Alaska Applied Research Award [2014 to E.F.]; and a Mount Holyoke College Alumnae Fellowship Bardwell Fellowship [2014 to E.F.].

Different stakeholder groups (e.g., fishermen, scientists) often hold different preferences which can be characterized as different weights on the various elements of society&#x02019;s multiple objectives [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Increased stakeholder participation in the regulatory process can also increase compliance with fishery regulations [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>For these reasons, there has long been a call to increase stakeholder participation in environmental regulatory processes beyond public comments [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to include structured, systematic information gathering.

However, it remains uncommon for fisheries managers to analyze fishermen&#x02019;s preferences for incorporation in the decision-making process in structured or systematic ways.</p><p>Analyzing and incorporating preferences of fishermen may be uncommon because agency personnel are unfamiliar with social science methods [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], because the human dimensions objectives of a management strategy are not clearly articulated [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or because data collection methods such as the public comment process may assign disproportionate weight to input from particular stakeholders [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Issues such as unfamiliarity with social science methods might only be resolved through capacity building within management institutions (e.g., hiring new staff). Guarding against assigning disproportionate weight to input from particular stakeholders could be addressed by refining the use of social science methods in existing processes. This research explores a mixed method of interviews and decision analysis for refining the use of social science methods in existing fisheries management processes.</p><p>The goal of this paper is to present results of a case study in Alaska demonstrating how preferences of fishermen can be documented in a structured, systematic way for incorporation into existing fisheries management processes. We assessed preferences fishermen have about four alternatives that could be considered for collecting data about commercial fishing catch and discards. We assessed preferences in three stages: (Stage 1) Determine the strength of fishermen&#x02019;s ranked preferences across four hypothetical types of data collection on their vessels (called &#x0201c;alternatives&#x0201d;); (Stage 2) Determine the strength of fishermen&#x02019;s preferences between pairwise comparisons of the four data collection alternatives, while considering attributes of fishing operations that might underlie those preferences; and, (Stage 3) Determine how well each alternative performs in relation to a suite of standards (called &#x0201c;criteria&#x0201d;) that influenced fishermen&#x02019;s preferences. We present a case study of the Pacific halibut (<italic>Hippoglossus stenolepis</italic>), hereafter &#x0201c;halibut,&#x0201d; commercial fishery off Southeast Alaska. We used semistructured interviews [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to gather the information necessary to understand the strength of preferences halibut fishermen have about data collection on their vessels, as well as criteria affecting those preferences.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Case study</title><p>The Alaska region commercial fishery for halibut involves over 1,000 vessels, most of which are less than 18 m. in length overall [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These vessels deploy demersal longline gear&#x02014;several hundred baited hooks spaced at regular intervals along a weighted line anchored to the seafloor. Longlines are retrieved after &#x0201c;soaking&#x0201d; for several hours. The halibut fishery is managed across ten regulatory areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212537.g001">Fig 1</xref>) set by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC). For this study, we focused on IPHC regulatory Area 2C, which covers the Southeast Alaska region. Focusing our study in one region allowed us to analyze preferences while controlling for factors that vary across the regulatory areas (e.g., incidental catch/discard regulations). Southeast Alaska includes 28 different communities that landed a combined 100,250 tonnes of fish and shellfish in 2016, with an ex-vessel value of $218 million [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0212537.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0212537.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>IPHC regulatory areas (courtesy of IPHC).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0212537.g001"/></fig><p>The halibut fishery off Alaska is managed under a system of Individual Fishing Quotas (hereafter &#x0201c;quota&#x0201d;) with mandatory dockside monitoring of all landings and very low incidence of illegal or unreported catch [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In 2013, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (hereafter &#x0201c;Council&#x0201d;) extended their observer program to include vessels commercially fishing for halibut off Alaska [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The observer program aims to collect data on catch, bycatch, and discards of fish, interactions with protected species, and biological samples to inform the conservation and management of federal groundfish fisheries [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The program initially applied to vessels &#x0003e; 18.3 m. length overall. In 2013, the observer program was expanded to include halibut fishing vessels over 12.2 m. in length. Since 2013, fishing vessels over 12.2 m. long must register to be randomly selected to carry an observer. The program continues to evolve, and at the time of this publication a halibut vessel selected to take an observer carries the observer for the duration of a single fishing trip. The observer records characteristics of fishing sets while keeping a tally of the different species that come up on each hook of the longline gear.</p><p>In the halibut fishery, the observer program is intended to systematically collect data about undersized halibut and other fish species discarded at sea by halibut fishermen. However, expansion of the observer program to small vessels created logistical and operational challenges and was costly to the overall program (over $1,000 per day of fishing observed in 2015) [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For example, the Alaska Longline Fishermen&#x02019;s Association (ALFA) explained:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x02026; our members support at-sea monitoring and are willing to pay a fair share of at-sea monitoring costs &#x02026; however, small boats represent 90% of the vessels directly regulated under the new observer program, and placing human observers on these vessels presents special problems [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></disp-quote><p>During the first years of the restructured observer program, exemptions were granted to vessels unable to accommodate observers for reasons related to limited bunk space and insufficient life raft capacity [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The large number of these exemptions resulted in data that were not spatially representative across the halibut fleet [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and led to changes in sampling design (e.g., re-organizing deployment categories, such that vessels targeting halibut were subject to carrying observers on a trip-by-trip basis, instead of for months at a time). In addition, the Council implemented an electronic monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] alternative data collection method for the halibut fleet in 2018 [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>At the beginning of this study, we conjectured that systematic <italic>ex-ante</italic> (forecast) analysis of halibut fishermen&#x02019;s preferences might have provided managers with reliable insights into characteristics of data collection alternatives that were desirable, objectionable, or important to fishermen. This knowledge might have facilitated serious consideration of additional data collection alternatives for halibut vessels, including EM, during the 2013 program restructure. In turn, considering EM earlier on might have mitigated exemptions in the first years of the restructured observer program, resulting in improved, spatially representative data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We interviewed halibut fishermen in four communities across Southeast Alaska, to document their preferences about data collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212537.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Three of the communities&#x02014;Juneau, Petersburg, and Sitka&#x02014;are the ports with the largest offloads of halibut in the region [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The fourth community&#x02014;Hoonah&#x02014;was chosen as an example of many small rural coastal communities in the region, with a strong historical connection to the halibut fishery, but with low participation in the commercial fishery today. During the winter of 2014, we sent a letter to every halibut quota holder in the four study communities (<italic>n</italic> = 503, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s001">S1 File</xref>) informing them of our project and inviting them to participate in an interview. Over 100 quota holders responded to those letters. We then set up semistructured interviews [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with respondents who were available to meet during the spring 2015 and used snowball sampling to recruit additional fishermen from the study communities to participate in interviews (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s002">S2 File</xref>). The vast majority of interviews were organized through the initial letter contacts, with fewer than ten resulting solely from the recommendations of interview participants (i.e., snowball sampling). A few interview participants agreed to interviews after the initial letter and were also recommended by other fishermen to participate.</p><fig id="pone.0212537.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0212537.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Map of regulatory area 2C, Southeast Alaska, with study communities labeled (created by the corresponding author).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0212537.g002"/></fig><p>During January 2015, the interview protocol was tested with 12 halibut fishermen in the community of Haines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212537.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Between February and May 2015, we recorded one-on-one interviews with 76 halibut fishermen residing in Juneau, Petersburg, Sitka, and Hoonah (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212537.g002">Fig 2</xref> and Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s003">S3 File</xref>). Interview questions were part of an interview that explored additional aspects of the halibut fishery [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Prior to completing interviews, the project was explained to each participant. Each individual was given a written consent form to review (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s002">S2 File</xref>). Once any questions were resolved, an individual who agreed to participate was asked to sign the consent form. At this point, we retrieved the form for our records and provided the participant with an additional un-signed form for their records.</p><p>Interview sampling was neither random nor stratified for demographic characteristics (although information about age, years of fishing experience, gender, ethnicity, and fisheries income was collected). Because demographic information about quota holders is not collected by the agencies and because we did not collect demographic information about quota holders we did not interview, we are unable to determine if the demographic characteristics of quota holders we interviewed are representative of the demographics of the population of quota holders. Because we have access to information about the type and amount of quota held by all quota holders, we were able to determine that the mix of quota types held by the interviewees was similar to the mix of quota types held in their communities. Based on information provided by the interviewees, we were able to test for differences among subsamples of our interviewees stratified by vessel size class, fishing operation characteristics, and the age and years of experience of quota holders.</p><p>There were not enough responses from underrepresented and marginalized groups (including indigenous people) in the interview group to be able to explore subgroup differences beyond age and years of fishing experience in any quantitatively or qualitatively meaningful way. There was, however, ample representation across vessel size categories and fishing operation characteristics to allow for testing of differences in preferences across these variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s002">S2 File</xref>). After the fact, the interview group was found to comprise an average of 20% of the quota shares held by residents across all the study communities (see Table B and Figure A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s003">S3 File</xref>). Delineations of quota types&#x02014;class A, B, C, or D&#x02014;for the interview group were also reflective of the communities as a whole (see Figure A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s003">S3 File</xref>). We did not determine representativeness of our results beyond Area 2C halibut IFQ holders.</p><p>During interviews, fishermen described characteristics of their fishing operations (Table A and Table B and Table C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s004">S4</xref> Files), as well as their preferences about data collection methods on their halibut fishing vessels. Interviewees were asked to carry out basic ranking as well as pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s005">S5 File</xref>) across four hypothetical alternative methods for data collection. The four hypothetical alternatives were developed at the onset of the research to reflect data collection methods considered possible but not necessarily carried through to the final analysis for 2013 expansion of the observer program. The hypothetical alternatives were intentionally general, to elicit clear responses from fishermen interviewed for this project. Hypothetical alternatives included:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Human Observers, i.e., agency-contracted observers to record everything that comes up on a random sample of hooks;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Electronic Monitoring, i.e., using agency-specified electronic cameras to record everything that comes up on every hook;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Detailed Logbooks (submitted to the management agency), i.e., a system where the fisherman would be responsible for recording everything that comes up on every hook (Note: vessels in this fishery are subject to random boarding at sea by U.S. Coast Guard or NOAA Enforcement officers. During the inspections, among other things, the boarding officers review permits, logbook entries, and retained catch); and,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Status Quo ante, i.e., maintenance of basic logbook records (submitted to the management agency) as required before the 2013 restructuring of the observer program.</p></list-item></list><p>While ranking and comparing the four alternatives, interviewees were encouraged to explain the criteria that influenced their decisions. Fishermen were also asked about their general thoughts concerning the observer program, previous experiences with observers, and data collection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s002">S2 File</xref>). All interviewees completed the rank and compare exercises. We hypothesized that preferences about data collection methods might be related to characteristics of fishermen and their fishing operations. Therefore, we also gathered information on each interviewee&#x02019;s age and experience, as well as their principal fishing grounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s004">S4 File</xref>), their community, vessel length, gear type, seasons fished, and whether they also target sablefish (<italic>Anoplopoma fimbria</italic>, Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s003">S3 File</xref>).</p><p>The analytic approach applied in this paper is the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], a multiple criteria decision analysis approach to structured decision-making. Decision analysis methods have traditionally treated social preferences in terms of an overarching objective such as the maximization of expected monetary benefits. This has been recognized as an oversimplification of how individuals or groups might go about making decisions in fisheries management to achieve socially preferred outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, multiple criteria decision analysis can reflect a plurality of objectives, not all of which are monetized [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>AHP is a broadly used decision tool [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and has long been recognized as useful in the context of fisheries management [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], as it solves for policy alternatives that are likely to receive the most support and the least opposition within or across stakeholder groups. AHP focuses on the preferred solution as it may be characterized by stakeholders, without being constrained to assumptions about rational-actor theory or statistical representativeness. AHP was designed for implementation in a series of face-to-face meetings [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] but can also be carried out using a serial survey/questionnaire approach [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Instead of meeting or communicating multiple times with groups of fishermen to gather information about their preferences, we gathered all the information needed for parameterizing the AHP model using one semistructured interview with each fisherman. A key advantage of one-on-one interviews is that each participant could spend as much time as they wanted to answer open-ended questions about the criteria influencing their preferences about data collection on their vessel.</p><p>We explored the criteria that influenced the preferences fishermen had, to determine how well each alternative performed in relation to those criteria. We defined the suite of criteria through inductive content text analysis [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], carried out in the Atlas.ti software program [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. During text analysis, recurrent themes were grouped and counted to weight each one relative to the number of times it was mentioned. The following quote is one example of a response to the open-ended question relating to how the observer program has affected an interviewee&#x02019;s outlook on the future of the halibut fishery:</p><disp-quote><p>I&#x02019;ve seen a lot of changes in a lot of regulations, and&#x02014;you know, and I&#x02019;ve rolled with them, and I&#x02019;ve just reached the point where if now I have to sleep on the floor to go fishing [to accommodate an observer], I just&#x02014;I just won&#x02019;t do it.</p></disp-quote><p>This quote was identified during text analysis in a code group titled, &#x0201c;Space.&#x0201d; In other words, the space an extra person takes up on a fishing vessel played a role in how this fisherman felt about carrying human observers (vessels that carry an observer are required to provide workspace on deck and accommodations, including a bunk and bathroom, that ensure privacy in keeping with gender identity).</p><p>During inductive coding, interviews were coded into six code groups and 58 total codes. Codes for each alternative were cross-referenced with 33 codes related to preference criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s008">S8 File</xref>). The list of 33 codes corresponded to 16 criteria <italic>themes</italic> and were assigned positive, negative, or neutral values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212537.s008">S8 File</xref>). For example, if an interviewee cited space as an important consideration when thinking about an alternative but did not accompany that statement with a directional qualifier, that portion of their transcript was coded as &#x02018;Space.&#x02019; If an interviewee cited an alternative as taking up too much space, that portion of their transcript was coded as &#x02018;Space -,&#x02019; in relation to the given alternative. The same quote from above provides an example of the code for &#x02018;Space&#x02019; with a negative qualifier for the human observer alternative:</p><disp-quote><p>Q: Is there any other way that this observer program has affected your outlook on the future of the halibut fishery?</p><p>A: I&#x02019;ve seen a lot of changes in a lot of regulations, and&#x02014;you know, and I&#x02019;ve rolled with them, and I&#x02019;ve just reached the point where if now I have to sleep on the floor to go fishing [to accommodate an observer], I just&#x02014;I just won&#x02019;t do it.</p></disp-quote><p>If an interviewee cited an alternative as being a space-saver, that portion of their transcript was coded as, &#x02018;Space +,&#x02019; and so on. Once all the open-ended questions were coded, text analysis results were used to expand simple pairwise comparisons into a multilevel AHP model that considers weighted criteria. Finally, weighted criteria for preferences about the alternatives were added into the AHP model.</p><p>Our AHP model organizes the decision problem into a hierarchy under the overall decision problem (&#x0201c;How to collect high quality data necessary for conservation and management&#x0201d;), followed by criteria fishermen consider important in judging the performance of the four data collection alternatives, and fishermen&#x02019;s preferences regarding those alternatives. Our AHP uses a series of layered calculations to produce a single score for each alternative. The alternative with the highest score is assumed to be the preferred alternative by the group of fishermen interviewed for this study.

These results implied strong support throughout the interview group for the alternative that was perceived to produce the least amount of change or disruption in the lives of halibut fishermen.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0212537.t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0212537.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>AHP using the geometric mean, across pairwise comparisons of human observers (&#x02018;Observers&#x02019;), electronic monitoring (&#x02018;EM&#x02019;), detailed logbooks (&#x02018;Logbooks&#x02019;), and the status quo (&#x02018;Status Quo&#x02019;) alternatives for data collection at sea.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0212537.t003g" xlink:href="pone.0212537.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Observers</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EM</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Logbooks</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Status Quo</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scores</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Consistency<break/>Measure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Observers</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.08</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.06</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.08</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.08</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.01</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EM</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.24</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.18</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.19</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.16</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.19</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Logbooks</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.33</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.31</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.33</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.33</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.32</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Status Quo</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.34</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.45</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.41</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.41</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.40</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scores</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.25</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.25</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.25</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.25</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.00</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Consistency Ratio</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.01</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>At the same time, a subgroup of fisherman in the interview group indicated strong support for human observers.

For example, if accuracy, lifestyle, logistics, and space are the only criteria considered in our model, the preferred data collection alternative shifts from the status quo (scoring 0.278) to electronic monitoring (scoring 0.285) (<xref rid="pone.0212537.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0212537.t007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0212537.t007</object-id><label>Table 7</label><caption><title>Weighted criteria and overall rank of human observers (&#x02018;Obs.&#x02019;), electronic monitoring (&#x02018;EM&#x02019;), detailed logbooks (&#x02018;Log&#x02019;), and the status quo (&#x02018;SQ&#x02019;) alternatives for data collection at sea across four criteria.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0212537.t007g" xlink:href="pone.0212537.t007"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Theme</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Specific Criteria</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Obs.</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EM</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SQ</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Log</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Accuracy</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Accurate/Efficient/Reliable Method</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.261</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.246</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.265</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.276</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.213</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lifestyle</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fewer Alterations to Lifestyle/Fishing Behavior</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.171</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.153</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.279</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.276</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.292</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Logistics</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fewer Logistical/Technical Inconveniences</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.359</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.176</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.247</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.309</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.267</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Space</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Space Saver</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.210</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.158</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.380</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.228</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.234</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Overall Rank</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.187</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.285</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.278</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.250</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>Asking fishermen to rank a suite of alternatives thus provides more information than simply asking them to identify their preferred alternative. Rankings and pairwise comparisons elucidate their perceptions of second-best and third-best alternatives. This can be important to decision-makers who may find convergence on a second or third-best alternative as more viable than choosing among disparate first-choice alternatives. Asking fishermen to express their preferences between each pair of alternatives (pairwise comparisons) provided even more information about the strength (weight) and consistency of those preferences. However, even pairwise comparisons did not shed light on the basis for preferences. We followed our presentation of simple rankings and pairwise comparisons across the alternatives with a presentation of weighted decision criteria in an AHP model. The AHP model identified a preferred alternative based on fishermen&#x02019;s judgments about the importance of decision criteria and the performance of the alternatives in relation to those criteria.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec009"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this paper, we have demonstrated how a management body might gather reliable descriptions of fishermen&#x02019;s preferences with a relatively small investment of time and money: analyzing semistructured interviews with a relatively small sample of fishermen in a three-stage AHP process. We collected preference data from halibut fishermen across four communities in a region, distilled that information using inductive content text analysis, and then applied a quantitative decision analytic method&#x02014;AHP&#x02014;to identify the strength of preferences across alternatives and the features of the alternatives that underpin fishermen&#x02019;s preferences. The findings demonstrated remarkably consistent, relatively homogenous preferences fishermen had about data collection methods on their vessels. This entire process can be completed in a relatively short time period (e.g., 12&#x02013;18 months), which aligns with the timeframe of management decision-making in this fishery.</p><p>Fisheries scientists and managers have increasingly adopted stock assessment and management strategies that are robust to the presence of biological uncertainty and environmental variation [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, it remains uncommon for fisheries managers to analyze fishermen&#x02019;s preferences for incorporation in the decision-making process in structured or systematic ways. When the restructured observer program was implemented in the halibut fleet during 2013, it was anticipated that there would be challenges associated with the shift [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Application of the methods presented in this paper during the regulatory review process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212537.g003">Fig 3</xref>) could have provided managers with greater understanding of fishermen&#x02019;s preferences and the tools necessary to anticipate and mitigate some major alterations to program design (e.g., resulting from vessel exemptions) that emerged during the first few years of the observer program in the halibut fleet [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Systematic <italic>ex-ante</italic> analysis of halibut fishermen&#x02019;s preferences might have provided reliable insights into characteristics of potential data collection alternatives that were desirable, objectionable, or important to them. This knowledge could have facilitated consideration of additional data collection alternatives for halibut vessels. Systematic consideration of those preferences could provide managers with the tools necessary to understand areas where fishermen&#x02019;s preferences and management objectives converge or diverge. Through assessing type and strength of fishermen&#x02019;s preferences related to management actions, it becomes possible for fisheries managers to choose confidently from the best (or least worst) decisions from multiple stakeholder perspectives at once. Managers can also use AHP to prioritize management plans [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] or to assess multispecies management and resource allocation among user groups [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This could lead to regulatory decisions with high likelihoods of meeting program objectives or data needs with minimal disruption or cost to fishing operations and lifestyles, as well as high levels of acceptance and compliance from the fishing fleet. In the case study of Pacific halibut, AHP could also be a useful tool to highlight ongoing perceptions fishermen have about data collection alternatives and to determine what drives those perceptions. This could inform future modifications of alternatives for data collection in the halibut fleet (e.g., reducing costs).</p><p>Understanding the relative importance of multiple objectives in fisheries management decisions supports development of the most appropriate strategies [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. An AHP decision-making process similar to that presented in this paper could be used regularly and across multiple fisheries to provide insights into characteristics of decision alternatives that are desirable, objectionable, or important for fishermen. Managers could potentially increase acceptance of alternatives by stressing how well they perform in relation to each criterion and how important each criterion is to meeting data/management needs. Managers could also look at where proposed alternatives fare poorly on certain criteria and work to assure that proposed alternatives better reflect fishermen&#x02019;s preferences and judgments.</p><p>AHP can function as a useful decision-support tool without replacing existing decision-making methods [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Using a three-stage AHP to document preferences of fishermen is compatible with broader trends in the management and sustainable use of fishery-ecological systems, including Management Strategy Evaluations (MSE) [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The MSE framework outlines strategies for effectively managing uncertainty in decision-making. Within the MSE framework, there is increased space for systematically considering fishermen&#x02019;s preferences, and for allowing social outcomes and preferences to play a direct role in decision-making. Characterizing fishermen&#x02019;s preferences may facilitate decreased uncertainty during the decision-making process while increasing compliance on fishing grounds. AHP modeling is one way to characterize those preferences.</p><p>This paper did not aim to be statistically random in its sampling strategy (although the methods we illustrate could be used in conjunction with a statistically random sample frame). Instead, we sought to gain information from willing and interested fishermen. We have measured preferences in terms of consistency and strength across a set of criteria defined by the fishermen who participated in this study. In this instance, these opinions are so strongly invariable that it is likely they represent a large portion of the halibut fishermen in the region. That said, marginalized populations (including those based in ethnicity and gender) in the halibut fishery were not assessed in terms of their preferences, which may differ from the prevailing preferences reported in this paper.</p><p>Interview sampling for this project was not stratified or targeted to reach specific ethnic or gender distributions, and there were not enough responses from underrepresented groups to be able to explore subgroup differences in any meaningful way through subsampling the interviews conducted for this paper. However, future studies could contribute to a growing body of literature focusing on marginalized and underrepresented groups [<xref rid="pone.0212537.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] to allow for demographic comparisons using the same methods presented here. AHP can provide an avenue for affected fishermen to play a role in designing policies that shape and reshape relationships between society and the life supporting marine ecosystems upon which human well-being depends. The three stage AHP methods described in this paper could be used to improve practices in the management of fisheries and other natural resources around the world.</p><p>Note: The term &#x0201c;fishermen&#x0201d; is used to refer to fishermen and women in Alaska throughout this paper.
