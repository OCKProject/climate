 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to time correlate the oscillations found in the fisheries time series with climatological events possibly affecting the study region, we used time series of some known climatic indices. Owing to known linkages of climatic events such as the El Niño- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the variability of the SST fields in the Atlantic Ocean [

  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref040">40</a>], we used the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) and the Inter-Hemispheric SST Gradient of the Atlantic (GITA). The time series of MEI and NAO indexes were obtained from

The GITA index was calculated by the diference between SST anomalies in the North and the South Atlantic Ocean [
