 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other meteorological data apart from rainfall were obtained from the NCEP/NCAR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction / National Center for Atmospheric Research) Reanalysis Project. We used data from both N/N Reanalysis [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref034">34</a>] and Reanalysis 2 [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref035">35</a>] databanks. Monthly averages were used, distributed in a Gaussian Grid with a spatial resolution of 1.8758 km x 1.9058 km (latitude/longitude). The variables studied here were zonal (u) and meridional (v) wind surface (10 m) anomalies, surface (2 m) specific humidity (SPFH), minimum air temperature (TMP), soil temperature (TMPsfc), potential evaporation (PEVPR), latent heat flux (LHF) and runoff (RUNOF). The meteorological data is publicly available on-line (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monthly sea surface temperature (SST) data were also obtained in a 4 × 4 km grid along the coast of Pará and Amapá states in the Brazilian Amazonia, as well as for the mouth of the Amazon River. This oceanographic variable was obtained from the “Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature Version 2—First Guess SST Field” dataset, processed with the NLSST (Non Linear Sea Surface Temperature) algorithm, available on the database of the Pathfinder project v.5.
