 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Information on catch per species and fishing effort from January 1993 to December 2004 was collected on a daily basis for each fishing trip by means of interviews with the skippers or those responsible on the vessels that dock in the major catch landing ports of the study area [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref015">15</a>]. The time series of fisheries data included 163,546 identification records of fishing units, where each record corresponds to a single fishing trip. With the selection of attributes–fishing boat and gill net–the series were reduced to 19,484 records for the river environment and 37,624 records for the floodplain lakes, only considering here the fisheries in the Lower Amazon. This selection is justified since it is known that gill net is the main fishing method in the Lower Amazon, and the fishing boats (boats with their own crew for catching fish) are the most representative units of this artisanal fleet, accounting for over 80% of all the fisheries production in the region [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref033">33</a>]. A criteria for reducing the number of species studied here from all species caught in the Lower Amazon region included the use of a multivariate analysis (discussed later on this text). The analysis was performed over a number of fish families that represented about 80% of the local fish production in each of the two environments studied here: river and floodplain lakes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the low abundances and small importance on the regional fisheries, some fish families were not considered here. They are: Anostomidae, Serrasalmidae and Loricariidae at Óbidos (for the river environment); Loricariidae and Doradidae at Óbidos and Clupeidae at Monte Alegre (for the floodplain lakes). The most representative fish families of our study area were the Pimelodidae (in the Amazon Rover and especially during the dry season) and the Hypophthalmidae (in the lakes and especially during the wet season).</p>
