 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishing is a major activity in the Amazon River since the origins of the earliest native communities in the region [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref001">1</a>]. In the Lower Amazon, this activity is different from other regions due to the large amount of species explored, their production and their different impacts on each of the human communities present in the region [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref002">2</a>]. The fishery in this region is essentially artisanal and based on a diversity of fishing methods, with different degrees of technological development. Different fishing tactics are frequently applied, depending on the target species and the local environment [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref003">3</a>], contributing to increase the uncertainties of our understanding of the fisheries in the Amazon.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimated number of fish species in the Amazon ranges from 1500–2000 to 8,000 species according to different authors [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref004">4</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref005">5</a>]. However, the commercially exploited species varies within a narrow range of six to twelve species that correspond to about 80% of the total fish biomass landed [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref002">2</a>]. The composition of the catch is related to the specific environment that predominates where the fishery is made as well to the nature and costumes of the regional communities. This is well exemplified by the predominance of scale fishes relative to catfish in the Central Amazon region which is echoed in the fish supply of the local markets [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref002">2</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fish species exhibit adaptative tactics to cope with the seasonal changes in the hydrological cycle in the regions where they occur: either the floodplain lakes and/or in the main course of the Amazon River [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref002">2</a>]. In order to understand the dynamics and composition of these fish species, it is critical to document their adaptative tactics and, therefore, new research is needed to better understand the biological cycles, feeding strategies, metabolism, individual growth and development and migration behaviour of the Amazonian fish.

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution and ecology of fishery resources in the Amazon region are determined by the natural surroundings, availability of environments, meteorological characteristics and variability of the hydrological cycle. With a higher discharge, the Amazon River floods its banks and expand itself over the surrounding floodplains [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref002">2</a>]. Thus, the flooding dynamics is expected to act over the fishery dynamics. Early works show that there is a strong relationship between the Amazonian hydrological cycle and the local fish catches throughout the year [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref015">15</a>]. Floodplains and wetland forests are extremely valuable in ensuring the success of Amazonian commercial fisheries, which leads to the consequent need for their conservation [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref016">16</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref019">19</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To ensure a sustainable fishery and its long-term conservation, the concept of managing landscape units should be considered: we ought to understand the resources within the environment as a whole and their variability within the river-flooding plains system. Likewise, when considering the climate variability and changes, the ecological approach taken to understand the fisheries should consider the meso to macro spatial scales. This is paramount if we aim to strengthen our public conservation policies and improve the management of the fisheries resources in the Amazon River Basin region. These aspects indicate the importance of understanding the direct interactions between the living resources and their environment [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref002">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some authors have studied the variability of the hydrological cycle and its relationship with the dynamics, recruitment and catch of commercial species in inland waters, in diverse places in the world [
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref020">20</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0157050.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0157050.ref032">32</a>], but not in the Amazon River Basin. To contribute to this lack of knowledge, this paper aims to study the spatial-temporal variability in catch of the main fisheries resources in the Lower Amazon, considering the different aquatic environments, i.e., the Amazon River and the floodplain lakes. This paper also aims to describe the relationship between fishery productivity using the variable CPUE (Catch per Unit Effort) and anomalies of some environmental variables of the river-atmosphere-ocean system, determining the influence of the environment on the the success of the local fisheries.
