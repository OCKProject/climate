 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two different fish markets in our study region. Industrial fish processing companies are located in Óbidos and Santarém while local consumption markets are mainly located in Santarém and Monte Alegre. This fact contributes for the fisheries dynamics in the Lower Amazon region. In order to improve our future multivariate statistical analysis, we took into account the fish market as well as the different fish sites and the environmental variables. A fish market index was produced here in order to account for the fisheries destination, aiming to take into consideration the economical drivers of the Lower Amazon fisheries. The market index is set to be 1 (one) when the monthly fish production was destined toward the industrial processing companies and 0 (zero) when it was destined toward the local consumption markets. The estimate of the market index was made using the following equations:

  <sub>Rv</sub> is the marked index for the River Amazon environment; MKT
  <sub>Lk</sub> is the marked index for the lake environment; PI is the catch of Pimelodidae and HY is the catch of Hypophthalmidae, the two more representative families in the two studied environments. Market indexes were computed for the two different environments and also for the different fishery locals.
