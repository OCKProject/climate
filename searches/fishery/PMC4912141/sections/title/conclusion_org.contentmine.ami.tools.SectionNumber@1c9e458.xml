 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Environmental variables such as the air, water and soil temperatures, atmospheric humidity, the water level, the local winds as well as climatic variables measured indexes such as the MEI, NOA and GITA act at distinct temporal scales promoting an clear effect on the multispecies fisheries of the Lower Amazon region;</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between the monthly average CPUE of different taxonomic family of target fish presents different behavior depending on the environmental or climatic variable considered;</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fishery productivity in the study area presents different patterns in respect to the environment and climate depending if it is originated from the river or from the floodplain lakes. A clear variability occurs both along the River Amazon extend in the Lower Amazon (longitudinal gradient) and laterally across the river (latitudinal gradient) for each kind of fishery studied here. This depends on the ecological characteristics and life strategies of each target taxonomic family considered in the fishery;</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The intensity of fish exploration in the Lower Amazon region is apparently still moderate;</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The preservation of the landscape and the equilibrium of the energy and hydric balances should be considered for future fish management policies;</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">New programs aiming the long term collection and processing of fishery statistics data in the Amazon River Basin should be put forward and incentivized. In a Global Change scenario with perceived changes in the vegetation cover of the Amazon region we believe that the strengthening of our knowledge about the relationship of the environmental and climatic variables with the fisheries is crucial for any future environmental modeling of the region;</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future research should also drive attention towards the identification of new variables to be included into the multivariate models. Possible new environmental variables should include the positioning and frequency of the instability lines of clouds in the atmosphere responsible for the region's rainfall patterns, the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone and the Bolivian Height positioning and persistence, the fluvial breeze, water quality variables (for example the phytoplanckton, nutrients, pollutants and dissolved oxigen concentrations). Ideally, new fisheries data should be produced in a better georefering interface such as a Geographical Information System.</p>
