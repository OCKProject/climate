 <div class="title">Process to simplify the initial CATCH mixed model (CATCH
  <span class="sup">1</span> + random(Season)).
 </div>
 <p>This process was performed after identifying the mixed model as the most fitted model structure for CATCH. Variables included: Year (Yr), Month, hours fished (HRSF), number of fisherman (NFMEN), first and second axis of Principal Coordinate Analysis based on species abundance (PCO1 and PCO2) and presence (PCO1.2 and PCO2.2). Asterisks are illustrating the variables that were included in each candidate model. We selected the model with the minimum AIC (i.e., equal to 0 delta AIC) as the final model for assess the temporal trend in bonefish catch (highlighted row).</p>
