 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the last decade, there has been a recognition that recreational fisheries, including catch-and-release fisheries, can be subject to population collapse and stock depletion [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref004">4</a>]. Recreational fisheries resilience has been compromised by numerous factors, including increasing pressure from competing commercial and artisanal fisheries, and threats such as intensified coastal land use, habitat and hydrological modification, pollution, eutrophication, hypoxia, and species invasions [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref005">5</a>]. For example, in northern Australia, species-specific studies have shown the importance of the quantity and timing of freshwater inflows to coastal fisheries production [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref006">6</a>]. Recreational salmon fisheries in the USA have also been affected by the modification of river networks and watershed land-use changes [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref005">5</a>]. In Florida (USA), a combination of extreme weather events and intense recreational pressure have induced major declines in common snook (
  <span class="italic">Centropomus undecimalis</span>) stocks, leading to the implementation of management measures that ensure the viability of this fishery [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref008">8</a>]. At the same time, seagrass and coral reef habitat loss have been linked to the decline of recreational fish populations throughout the Atlantic coast of the USA and the Caribbean [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref009">9</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref011">11</a>]. Finally, recreational harvest and catch-and-release practices have been identified as a prime source of population declines for some species (e.g., trout, walleye, red drum) [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref001">1</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref012">12</a>], or have been found to interact with habitat disturbances and deterioration effects already operating to negatively affect targeted species [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref013">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extensive quantitative data are needed to assess recreational fisheries stocks, reconstruct historical abundance trends, and determine factors regulating their population levels, yet frequently, data to conduct effective stock and harvest assessments are lacking [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref014">14</a>]. Fisheries-dependent data (FDD) from mandatory catch return cards, logbooks, sale slips or interviews often represent the only available data source, providing estimates of abundance needed for temporal trend assessments [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref015">15</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref016">16</a>]. FDD can be analyzed with statistical models to generate estimates of catch, effort, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) that inform individual and multispecies stock assessments [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref015">15</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref017">17</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref018">18</a>]. In addition, FDD have been successfully used to assess how disturbance events (e.g., extreme climate events, fishing-related disturbances) influence ecological processes, community resilience dynamics, and regime shifts in fisheries [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref019">19</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref022">22</a>]. FDD may be considered a traditional data source in fishery science, and often can be a powerful tool to inform data-limited fisheries, particularly when long time-series are available [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref015">15</a>]. In this study, fishing guides catch reports were used to reconstruct temporal dynamics for the data-limited bonefish (
  <span class="italic">Albula vulpes</span>) recreational fishery in Florida Bay, and to make inferences about changes in bonefish abundance, particularly in relation to potential drivers of decline.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bonefish constitute an economically-important fishery throughout the Caribbean [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref023">23</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref027">27</a>]. In South Florida, where the fishery is exclusively catch-and-release and bonefish are a key part of a popular flats fishery that focuses on sight fishing in shallow seagrass habitats, it is estimated that one bonefish is worth $3,500, with a possible lifetime worth of approximately $75,000 (i.e., based on a maximum age of 20 years)[
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref026">26</a>]. A recent economic assessment estimated that approximately $466 million of the total economic impact of saltwater angling in Florida is generated by the Florida Keys flats fishery alone [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref025">25</a>]. Yet, despite this high value both locally and regionally, the availability of stock assessments and bioecological studies are limited, and key data on spawning and recruitment dynamics, habitat use patterns, and life history remain unknown [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref023">23</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref027">27</a>] (i.e., data-limited fishery).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We propose that this data-limited recreational fishery would benefit from studies that comprehensively assess its resilience, particularly given that numerous stressors may increasingly jeopardize the sustainability of the fishery. For example, fishing effort targeting bonefish throughout Florida Keys and Florida Bay has been increasing over the last several decades [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref023">23</a>]. At the same time, coastal environments in Florida Bay, some of which constitute essential habitat for bonefish (i.e., foraging grounds, nursery habitats, spawning aggregation areas), have been subject to a series of anthropogenic disturbances [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref028">28</a>], largely associated with altered freshwater deliveries throughout the Everglades watershed [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref029">29</a>]. These disturbances, in combination with natural droughts, have caused hypersalinity and seagrass die-off events that have impacted up to 30% of Florida Bay (i.e., 1987–89 and 2015 seagrass die-offs [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref028">28</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref030">30</a>]). These events have caused marked state shifts in Florida Bay, unleashing a cascade of ecological effects including epibenthic community loss and shifts in structure, algal blooms, sponge mortality, and reductions in shrimp and spiny lobster landings [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref028">28</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref031">31</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref032">32</a>]. However, our understanding of the effects of these major events and other extreme climate events on economically-valuable recreational fisheries such as bonefish remains unknown [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref022">22</a>]. The socio-economic importance of the Florida Bay bonefish stock and the high demand it experiences by recreational anglers, highlight the need to assess temporal trends in catch (i.e., gradual vs. breakpoint changes) and identify possible drivers of population state, decline or recovery.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, fishing guides in Florida Bay and the Florida Keys have reported a concerning decline in bonefish numbers [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref023">23</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref033">33</a>], thus adding to the list of recreational fisheries in decline due to a myriad of anthropogenic and environmental factors [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref027">27</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref034">34</a>]. These assessments of a decline have been largely based on qualitative data that stem from anglers’ perceptions and experiences (i.e., local ecological knowledge, [
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref033">33</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref035">35</a>, but see 
  <a rid="pone.0184776.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0184776.ref023">23</a>]). Thus in our study, we built a retrospective bonefish catch timeline over the past 34 years using FDD from fishing guide reports with the objective of quantitatively assessing temporal trends of bonefish fishery patterns (i.e., annual catch, catching success, and catch species richness) in Florida Bay and to identify major shifts in temporal patterns. Given the present and past environmental events affecting Florida Bay (e.g., seagrass die-offs, algae blooms) and the reported increase in fishing pressure in South Florida and the Caribbean region, we hypothesized that the bonefish catch trend would display drastic shifts and nonlinear declining patterns that likely reflect disturbance events that degraded the spatial cover and quality of bonefish habitats [
