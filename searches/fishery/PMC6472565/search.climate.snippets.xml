  <result pre="vulnerability. Despite these significant developments, scientific and technical approaches to" exact="climate" post="change continue to dominate, leaving the underlying social drivers"/>
  <result pre="We therefore draw crucial attention to social scientific approaches to" exact="climate" post="change vulnerability by identifying and synthesizing signal contributions to"/>
  <result pre="the observation that while nobody can escape the impacts of" exact="climate" post="change, some social groups experience greater loss of resources"/>
  <result pre="access to resources and the ability to reduce exposure to" exact="climate" post="hazards are not randomly distributed across society but are"/>

  <result pre="roles in creating patterns of unequal access to resources. Simultaneously," exact="climate" post="change will increase the exposure of populations to environmental"/>
  <result pre="social changes. Second, we consider how governance affects vulnerability to" exact="climate" post="change: how local governments, private firms, and civil society"/>
  <result pre="governments, private firms, and civil society plan for and manage" exact="climate" post="change risk. Representation and empowerment are fundamental parts of"/>
  <result pre="and environmental justice issues are weighed. Because the impacts of" exact="climate" post="change are experienced where people live, many aspects of"/>
  <result pre="Nuttall, 2009). Communities have developed complex ways to adapt to" exact="climate" post="risks, including robust bodies of place‐based knowledge and practice."/>
  <result pre="we examine the multidimensional nature of knowledge and information about" exact="climate" post="risk. We advocate moving beyond the knowledge‐deficit model because"/>
  <result pre="the knowledge‐deficit model because it implies that emergency management and" exact="climate" post="risk agencies need only share more information, such as"/>
  <result pre="share more information, such as by presenting scientific findings on" exact="climate" post="change‐related threats and hazards. Instead, we emphasize that information"/>

  <result pre="are often less resistant to the impacts of weather and" exact="climate" post="change. Cheaper, less‐desirable housing sites such as floodplains and"/>
  <result pre="as floodplains and unstable hillsides are often more exposed to" exact="climate" post="hazards (e.g., Wisner, 2001). Buildings may be poorly constructed,"/>
  <result pre="2001). Buildings may be poorly constructed, thereby increasing sensitivity to" exact="climate" post="impacts (Austin &amp;amp; Schill, 1994; Bolin, 1986; Greene, 1992;"/>
  <result pre="Hallegatte, 2012; Phillips, 1993). This renders poor people vulnerable to" exact="climate" post="change in and of itself, but it also broadens"/>
  <result pre="et al., 2016). In the case of coastal impacts of" exact="climate" post="change, such inequalities are increased financially through the unequal"/>
  <result pre="people are affected similarly by exposure to a given local" exact="climate" post="impact, various activity spaces—defined as, &quot;a geographic extent in"/>
  <result pre="travel (Silm &amp;amp; Ahas, 2014). Programs to reduce vulnerability to" exact="climate" post="change should therefore be designed for specific social contexts"/>
  <result pre="of power, poverty, race, caste, and gender will require transforming" exact="climate" post="change governance practices. 4 GOVERNANCE The processes of governance—how"/>
  <result pre="addressed by governments and other organizations—both shape and respond to" exact="climate" post="change vulnerability. The concept of governance extends well beyond"/>
  <result pre="governance is fundamental in reducing vulnerability. NGOs can help reduce" exact="climate" post="change vulnerability. Organizations that speak for vulnerable populations may"/>

  <result pre="is promoting new kinds of partnerships across sectors. For example," exact="climate" post="change has significant impacts on health (Watts et al.,"/>
  <result pre="or jointly, all engage in efforts to reduce vulnerability to" exact="climate" post="change. Their activities involve establishing priorities for action, allocating"/>
  <result pre="Governance challenges are obvious in many municipal efforts to reduce" exact="climate" post="change vulnerability, particularly in relation to hazards and extreme"/>
  <result pre="p. 14653; see also Adger et al., 2005). Governance of" exact="climate" post="risks, therefore, can fail to reduce vulnerability if projects"/>
  <result pre="population, geographical area, issues, or time scale of concern. Addressing" exact="climate" post="hazards and other environmental issues thus often requires large‐scale"/>
  <result pre="extreme events. Increased public engagement depends on people's understanding that" exact="climate" post="risks are relevant to their own lives and challenges."/>
  <result pre="society institutions and initiatives involved in building adaptive capacity include" exact="climate" post="action social movements, such as the People's Climate March;"/>
  <result pre="for Tribal Environmental Professionals; the Indigenous Environmental Network; and the" exact="Arctic" post="Circumpolar Council, which is composed of representatives from Eskimo"/>

  <result pre="both tangible and intangible. Consistent with disaster preparedness, assessments of" exact="climate" post="change vulnerability tend to focus on the tangible: infrastructure,"/>
  <result pre="and health, such as food supply and clean water. But" exact="climate" post="change also indirectly disrupts life's intangible aspects, including social"/>
  <result pre="and social significance that is often invisible to those calculating" exact="climate" post="change impacts (Adger et al., 2009). &quot;Expert‐only politics runs"/>

  <result pre="increases vulnerability: if people do not initially perceive risk from" exact="climate" post="impacts, then they will not put measures in place"/>
  <result pre="(Rice et al., 2015, p. 257) which revealed changes in" exact="weather" post="across the years and connected them to concrete experiences."/>

  <result pre="For these reasons, cultural heritage is now listed by the" exact="United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change" post="as a component of noneconomic loss and damage (UNFCCC,"/>
  <result pre="(UNFCCC, 2013). Similarly, studies of food security and health under" exact="climate" post="change typically focus on physiology and nutrition, &quot;while other"/>
