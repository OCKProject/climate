  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Amazon region is made up of vast areas of primary and secondary forest, and a few (mainly) small (&lt;50 thousand inhabitants) urbanized areas with a racially mixed population. Several tribal groups—most already acculturated, but others still non-contacted—inhabit the region, creating complex social-biological diversity. As the rivers remain the main communication pathways in the area, hydrological fluctuations strongly modulate the social-cultural dynamics [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amazonian forests significantly contribute to the regional and global regulation of climate [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>], being important in a climate change context. The climate of Central Amazon is hot and humid, with a mean annual temperature of 26.6 °C. During the dry period, evaporation can surpass precipitation [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. During the warm ENSO-phases (El Niño) flood levels are typically lowered, and aquatic phases are shortened, while high and prolonged flooding is associated with cold ENSO-phases (La Niña) [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data was collected between June and October 2013 through interviews with commercial fishers that use the Panair fishery harbor in Manaus, Central Amazon (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). This is the main fishery landing and commercial center of central Amazonia, receiving 25 % of the fish

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Semi-structured questionnaires (see 
   <a ref-type="sec" rid="Sec12" href="#Sec12">Appendix</a>) were applied to 91 artisanal commercial fishers. A stratified random sample was applied by separating the population into strata based on fishermen’s experience (“novice fishers”- less than 15 years of experience; and “experienced fishers”- fishers with 15 plus years of experience) to assure the representativeness of the sample and the perception of the error [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. The interviews followed standard recommendations for ethnoecological research [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. They lasted for about 30 min and were given in Portuguese. Participant observation and historical timelines were applied to the questionnaires [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. Questions dealt with various social and cultural themes, e.g., time of fishery experience, education, sources of information and ecological knowledge related to fish, fishing and climate, including perceived impacts of extreme weather impacts on local fishery resources. All research was conformed to the ethical and legal obligations of the author’s institution and the Federal government (license number: 13813613.9.0000.0006).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sources of knowledge of extreme climatic events were classified as familiar (grandparents, parents, brothers and cousins) and non-familiar (magazines and personal experience). Differences between sources of knowledge for each experience category (experienced/novice) were assessed. Fishers’ educational level was classified as literate (basic, primary/new fundamental education) or illiterate (“did not study”). Differences between educational level and Fisher categories (experienced/novice) were assessed.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two methodologies were used to evaluate the fishers’ knowledge of past extreme climate events: a consensus analysis and an integrative fishers/meteorological analysis. The consensus analysis [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>] was performed and validated using anthropological theory [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. In this approach, the cultural consensus is defined as the “pattern or agreement or consensus among informants that permit to make inferences about their differential competence in knowledge of the shared information pool constituting the culture. It is assumed that the correspondence between the answers of any two informants is a function of the extent to which each is correlated with the truth” [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. To support this analysis we estimated and plotted the annual distribution frequency of quotes by drought events and by flood events.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The integrative fishers/meteorological analysis was based on hydrological records of water levels were retrieved from the Manaus harbour website [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>]. Extreme flood/drought events were classified as those causing a water level of above 28 m or lower than 17 m, respectively, according to the criteria of Bittencourt and Amadio [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]. Fishers’ memories of extreme events were classified as being “in Accordance with the Hydrological Records” (AHR) or “Not in Accordance with the Hydrological Records” (NAHR).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Pearson’ chi-squared test with Yates’ continuity correction was used to compare fishers’ experience categories with 1) sources of extreme events knowledge (Familiar/Not Familiar) and with 2) education levels (Literate/Illiterate).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Pearson’ chi-squared test with Yates’ continuity correction was also used to test differences in AHR between experience categories (experienced/novice) and between fishing grounds (one or more than one fishing ground) for each of the extreme events. Finally, differences in AHR between types of event (flood/drought) were also assessed. All statistics were performed in the 
   <span class="italic">R</span> software environment [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>], and all the statistical tests were at the 5 % significance level.
