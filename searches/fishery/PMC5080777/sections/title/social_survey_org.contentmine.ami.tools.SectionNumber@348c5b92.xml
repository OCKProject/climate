 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The information sources for knowledge of extreme events were similar for experienced and inexperienced fishers (
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.08). Even so, differences in familiar knowledge acquisition were found as we have only noticed familiar restricted sources (brother, parent, grandparent, cousin) for old fishers and familiar nuclear sources (parent and brother) for novice fishers (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). No significant association was found between educational level and experience category (
