 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Artisanal fishers are clearly very knowledgeable about extreme climatic events in the past. Both the cultural consensus and complementary approaches were similarly effective in identifying past extreme events. Furthermore, fishers had detailed perception about drought impacts on fisheries resources. In South America, research has only been conducted on fishers’ perceptions of birds biology [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>], the interaction between birds and fishing [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>], and territorial use rights [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]. However, the study contributes to the global literature of fishers’ perceptions of environmental change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>], and similar results were recorded by West and Vásquez-León [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>] and Puri [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>] for farmer’s perception of meteorological records.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence was found that fishers with different levels of experience use different knowledge sources. However, fishers’ experience, the number of fishing grounds and educational level did not affect their recall. Such results are concordant with the historical dynamics of environmental, social and economic conditions in Central Amazon. An integrated environmental-economic example is the implementation and maintenance of new fishing technologies and the spread of commercial-scale fishing during the 1960s [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Rapid social change and intergenerational differences in knowledge, as reported in this study, are common phenomena in subsistence cultures [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>]. However, the adaptive character of local knowledge allows effective responses to changing conditions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. This is broadly supported by our results since fishers appear to be using different knowledge sources to identify the extreme events and to make inferences about them.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishers had the capacity to identify the different impacts that extreme droughts and floods had on fishing resources. Specifically, they identified an increase in fish abundance during the initial phase of extreme droughts—as during ‘normal’ drought conditions. However, during peak periods of extreme droughts they perceived fish mortality to be unusually high (and varied between species) and a reduction in fish quality. From the fishers’ perspective, these events are memorable since they necessitate considerable changes in fishing behavior as access to common fishing grounds become harder.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishers’ observations effects of drought on fishes in our study are concordant with scientific data from the USA [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>], which identifies factors such as 1) fish population decline; 2) loss of habitats, and; 3) agglomeration of fish. More generally, adverse effects of droughts on food production have been reported by Nakashima et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>] for various crops, who note that local communities believe that “ENSO- related period of drought tend to be related with little to no production of ceremonial yams and kava, while wetter years produce the contrary effect”. Although too obvious, this is an example how traditional knowledge of local people links natural resource fluctuations to climatic events.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent increase in severity and frequency of extreme climatic events [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>] was clearly perceived by the fishers. Such sensitivity to subtle changes in climate has been reported as contributing to the better understanding of the local expressions of global climate change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>]. Taking into consideration that “memory” is a cognitive process [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>] - understood in anthropological studies as a valuable tool to build system resilience [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>] - those eventual, but remarkable, events are key for strengthening communities to react to future increases in climatic extremes. Furthermore, the capacity to identify [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>] and anticipate changes in future weather conditions is one of best adaptation measures to climate changes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>], addressing the dual challenge of resource conservation and poverty alleviation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" href="#CR68">68</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resource users knowledge of past climatic events is a potentially valuable source of information on the intensity and timing of climate change and can provide additional information that has not been recorded by scientific research [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" href="#CR67">67</a>]. More detailed information to increase our understanding of spatial-temporal climatic-resource dynamics in the region could be gained through participatory mapping, widely used in studies of environmental conservation, cultural preservation, and climate change adaptation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>]. Furthermore, since local ecological knowledge was a strong source for the identification of extreme events, the development of educational programs are recommended to increase the local fishing communities’ resilience facing climate change notwithstanding other social benefits from education. Learning material explicitly based on cultural perceptions can motivate technological/behavioral adaptations and innovations, strengthening fishers’ power during negotiations with the representatives of government agencies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>].
