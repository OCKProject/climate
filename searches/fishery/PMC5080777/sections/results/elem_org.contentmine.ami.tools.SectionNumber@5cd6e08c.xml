  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishers were relatively proficient at identifying the dates of extreme climatic events, whether assessed by cultural response consensus or integrative fishers/meteorological analysis. According to the consensus analysis, interviewers identified 16 different years with extreme flood events. Additionally, the four most cited years accounted for 71 % of all responses - the flood of 2012 was cited by 42 % of interviewees, and the floods of 1953, 2009, and 2011 were recognized by 29 % of the fishers (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Similarly, 20 different years were identified as those remarkable for extreme drought events, the seven most cited accounting for 77 % of the quoted events (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), including four consecutive unusual droughts (2009–2012). Moreover, the proportion of answers that were concordant with the hydrological records were similar for flood and drought events (
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.28). Fishers that fish in one or more than one fishing ground also provided similar responses (
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.11). Furthermore, many of the fishers interviewed mentioned that droughts and floods are becoming more intense and more frequent, indicating that they may be perceiving the influence of anthropogenic climate change.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceptions of extreme climatic impacts were grouped according to the ecological conditions that occur during this type of event (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>). Fishers were more able to identify the impacts of extreme droughts (73 %) than floods (37 %). Extreme flood events are considered favorable in the initial phase, as fish growth is thought to be higher than in advanced conditions of a flood. Fishers aggregate at the river and lakes mouths in the early phases of the flood. However, as the flood event advances this scenario changes because some species disappear, and other commercially important fishes such as the black pacu (
   <span class="italic">Colossoma macropomum</span>) decrease. Finally, fishers also have difficulty in accessing the 
   <span class="italic">igapós</span> (flood forest) where fish remains (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the beginning of drought events, fishers described that they typically have access to large quantities of fish as ecologically appropriate decrease in area. However, further reduction in the water level reduces the connectivity of the lakes, forcing fishers to carry canoes by hand and reducing the total catch. As the drought advances, there is also a significant increase of commercially valuable fish in lakes, mainly the silver and flagtail prochilodus (
   <span class="italic">Semaprochilodus</span> spp.) and black prochilodus (
   <span class="italic">Prochilodus nigricans</span>). Close to the minimum water level, fish are no longer available for fishers due to lack of access or complete loss of fish stocks. Fishers were also able to detect a delayed response regarding fish mortality (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>).
