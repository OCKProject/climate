 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Advances in fishing technology (GPS, monofilament nets, scuba, etc.) have greatly increased the efficiency of harvesting coral reef fishes in Hawai‘i. Despite their effectiveness in Hawai‘i, nets and spears are used far less often than line, which means further regulation on nets and spears could possibly reduce overall catch while not affecting the majority of fishers. Gill nets are regulated in some areas in Hawai‘i (e.g., Kailua, a large portion of the south shore of O‘ahu, number of locations in West Hawai‘i, and the entire island of Maui) (
  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Division of Aquatic Resources, 2017</a>). Justification for these bans was the indiscriminate catch, including juvenile fishes, and a high bycatch of threatened and endangered species (e.g., sea turtles, marine mammals) (

  <a rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-20">Donovan et al., 2016</a>). Certain methods of spear fishing such as nighttime and/or on scuba are highly efficient, particularly for parrotfishes, which sleep on the reef at night and are easily harvested at that time (

  <a rid="ref-87" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-87">Sabetian &amp; Foale, 2006</a>). Scuba-based spear fishing is now banned in West Hawai‘i, along with many Pacific Island nations and territories (

  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Division of Aquatic Resources, 2017</a>). Despite the selective nature of spearfishing gear, it is used rather non-selectively in many cases (
  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Fenner, 2012</a>). Restriction on or banning of gill nets, nighttime and/or scuba-based spear fishing could potentially be quite effective and should be considered for other locations as well (

  <a rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-14">Cinner et al., 2009b</a>). Fishers are usually more supportive of gear restrictions than fisheries closures since they can often switch to another gear type (
  <a rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-67">McClanahan, Maina &amp; Davies, 2005</a>). In addition, gear restrictions are also preferred by fishers because they are easier to circumvent than other fisheries management strategies (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parrotfishes and other herbivores have been protected in a number of locations owing to their importance in reducing macroalgal abundance and enhancing the dominance of crustose corallines, which are necessary conditions for the maintenance of healthy reef communities. Management of herbivores (e.g., parrotfishes) has been successfully implemented on Maui with bag limit on parrotfishes and Kahekili’s herbivore management area (

  <a rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-18">Division of Aquatic Resources, 2017</a>). These are promising solutions that could be deployed in other geographies or at a scale to further bolster reefs against impacts of climate change. Hawai‘i Division of Aquatic Resources has developed and implemented numerous output controls including size, season, and bag limit rules. However, these controls should be adapted as new knowledge emerges of the geographical variability in spawning cycles and growth characteristics of various reef fish among locations (
