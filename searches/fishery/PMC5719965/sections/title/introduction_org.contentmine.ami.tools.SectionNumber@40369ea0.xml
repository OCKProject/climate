 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fisheries contribute 20% of the protein for &gt;3 billion people and 17% of global protein consumed, representing a crucial contribution to global food security (
  <a rid="ref-101" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-101">UN FAO, 2016</a>). In the tropics, coral reef fisheries support &gt;6 million reef fishers in over 100 countries, providing critical and diverse services, including food, income, livelihoods, and cultural significance (
  <a rid="ref-99" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-99">Teh, Teh &amp; Sumaila, 2013</a>). Nowhere are coral reef fisheries more important than in the developing economies and communities in the Pacific (

  <a rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-38">Gillett, 2016</a>). In Hawai‘i, these fisheries are relied upon for economic, social, and cultural services, including important livelihood and food provisioning (
  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">Friedlander, Shackeroff &amp; Kittinger, 2013</a>). Approximately a third of Hawai‘i residents identify themselves as fishers, and the diversity of cultures that live in Hawai‘i all place a high importance on fishing (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite their importance, many small-scale reef fisheries, both commercial and non-commercial, in the Pacific have significant capacity gaps in management, threatening the food security and livelihoods that these fisheries provide to communities (

  <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">Friedlander, Nowlis &amp; Koike, 2014</a>). Many of the challenges currently hindering sustainable management and fisheries sector development strategies are associated with a lack of information for these multi-species, multi-gear small-scale coral reef fisheries (

  <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">Fenner, 2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most persistent knowledge gaps for scientists and managers surrounds the dominant harvesting modes and magnitude of current fishing activities, including the total production of the fishery and its value to local communities and economies. This gap is largely due to a lack of assessments of fishing activities and fish stocks, a challenge that is common in un-assessed or otherwise data-poor fisheries, which account for more than 80% of the global fisheries catch (
  <a rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-17">Dalzell, 1996</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-88" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-88">Sale, 2008</a>;

  <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">Friedlander, 2015</a>). The lack of investment in monitoring is primarily due to low technical and financial capacity in many coral reef geographies, as well as the complexity of these small-scale fisheries, which precludes an accurate understanding of fisheries status, which is required to develop effective, evidence-based regulations (
  <a rid="ref-78" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-78">Pauly, 2006</a>;

  <a rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-79">Pauly &amp; Zeller, 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To develop better management strategies, scientists and managers need more accurate estimates of how much fish biomass is in the water, how much is being fished, what fishing gears are used, and whether the rates and amount of catch are ecologically sustainable. A variety of methods have been advanced to address this gap (
  <a rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-74">Nadon et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-82" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-82">Prince et al., 2015</a>;

  <a rid="ref-86" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-86">Rosenberg et al., 2017</a>), but the data necessary to accomplish these assessments remain a major limitation. An empirical method for fisheries assessment that has worked effectively at local community scales is the creel survey approach, which focuses on estimating total catch, gear types used, selectivity of gear types (i.e., variety in targeted species), and other aspects of fishing behavior (
  <a rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-62">Malvestuto, 1983</a>). Creel surveys, utilizing estimates of fishing effort paired with fisher interviews, have been particularly useful in assessing the nearshore fisheries and total economic value to local communities in several locations in the Pacific (

  <a rid="ref-104" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-104">Weijerman et al., 2016</a>), and particularly in Hawai‘i (

  <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">Everson &amp; Friedlander, 2004</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-52">Kittinger et al., 2015</a>). The name ‘creel survey’ comes from the woven basket, or creel, that freshwater anglers use to hold their catch (
  <a rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-63">Malvestuto, 1996</a>). In Hawai‘i, these surveys are referred to by the Hawaiian name for a tin basin used to hold nets called a pakini (
  <a rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-52">Kittinger et al., 2015</a>). Surveys are typically conducted at access points where fishers are asked about their fishing activities. This approach is generally more effective than studies that do not engage the local community, because the information gathered stems from the fishers themselves (
  <a rid="ref-106" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-106">Whyte, Greenwood &amp; Lazes, 1989</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-90" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-90">Scholz et al., 2004</a>; 
  <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">Kittinger, 2013</a>). Some creel surveys, especially for more recent survey efforts, have been led by communities, in a “co-design” format. Creel surveys offer tremendous advantages in terms of accuracy at a particular location. However, they are resource-intensive to implement, and are therefore often limited in their spatial and temporal scope, precluding researchers, managers, and communities from recognizing larger-scale trends necessary for managing targeted fish stocks in reef fisheries (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The purpose of our study was to gather, collate, and synthesize with unparalleled geographical coverage and detail, a clearer picture of the reef-associated fishing effort, catch, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), and fate of the reef catch at a regional-scale, using a unique dataset and case study approach in Hawai‘i. This work addresses long-standing interest in information about coastal fisheries in Hawai‘i and similar coral reef geographies, which have remained poorly quantified, particularly in terms of non-commercial fishing effort and catch. The patterns found here are determined through, arguably, the most accurate and high-resolution methodology: through fisher surveys conducted at 18 sites across the archipelago. This broad regional coverage provides unique insights into the current state of nearshore fishing effort and catch, and demonstrates the value of creel surveys as a community-level monitoring technique producing information critical to effective fisheries management by assessing distinct spatial patterns in: (1) gear usage; (2) annual catch; and (3) disposition of the catch.</p>
