 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local fisheries management that is driven and informed by traditional knowledge has been shown to be effective in certain locations in Hawai‘i, as well as other locations in the Pacific (

  <a rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-9">Birkeland, 2017</a>). A diverse range of management options needs to be developed through a collaborative approach. There is a strong movement in Hawai‘i toward decentralized fisheries management, with a revitalization of community-based fishery management based on customary practices and knowledge (

  <a rid="ref-102" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-102">Vaughan &amp; Vitousek, 2013</a>), including a recent legal mandate for collaborative management between the state and local communities to establish community-based subsistence fishing areas (

  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Ayers &amp; Kittinger, 2014</a>). There are over 20 community initiatives currently active in Hawai‘i (
  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Ayers &amp; Kittinger, 2014</a>), which is among the most promising developments in nearshore fishery management. In Hawai‘i, the cultural diversity and isolation of the islands lead to many expressions of self-determination; one of those expressions is the desire for “local production for local consumption, under local control” (
  <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">Loke &amp; Leung, 2013</a>). At all sites where fish flow surveys were conducted, the majority of fish caught was either kept or given away for local consumption, demonstrating the high food security and cultural value of these non-commercial subsistence/recreational fisheries for the people of Hawai‘i, particularly in rural areas.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Direct translation of traditional practices into a modern management context is often not possible for political and historical reasons. Current management strategies are often an adaptation and melding of traditional with the contemporary (

  <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">Ayers &amp; Kittinger, 2014</a>). Movement towards the establishment of more co-management arrangements is also driven by recent findings that locations under community-based management have similar amounts or greater fish biomass compared to no-take protected areas (
  <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">Friedlander, Shackeroff &amp; Kittinger, 2013</a>). Both of these management regimes harbor higher biomass than partially protected or completely open-access areas, clearly indicating that community-managed areas can be effective in providing positive ecological outcomes by sustaining both ecosystems and ecosystem benefits (
