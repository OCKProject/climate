 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several ways to assess the sustainability of reef fisheries. While a range of yield estimates for sustainable harvest have been proposed for coral reefs (

  <a rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-66">McClanahan et al., 2011</a>), by most measures the nearshore fisheries in Hawai‘i are in poor health (

  <a rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-31">Friedlander et al., 2017</a>). By pairing creel surveys with fish flow surveys, it is possible to assess human use patterns and drivers of behavior in nearshore fisheries in greater detail, as well as the extent of fisheries benefits to communities. Such information can help communities develop a more informed understanding of the drivers of marine resource harvest and the state of the resources. This, in turn, helps inform effective, sustainable community-based fisheries management.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Managers have the difficult task of addressing multiple drivers of fishery decline in Hawai‘i, in order to sustain the important sociocultural and economic values these activities provide for local communities and visitors (

  <a rid="ref-77" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-77">OmniTrak, 2011</a>). In order to manage these resource systems, fisheries managers have at their disposal a range of tools that can be tailored to the specific context and challenges of a fishery to sustain, and in some cases, rebuild fisheries (

  <a rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-44">Hilborn &amp; Ovando, 2014</a>). Many of these management tools were developed hundreds of years ago by indigenous peoples, and these strategies were particularly well developed in the Pacific Islands due to their heavy reliance on, and scarcity of these resources (
  <a rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-47">Johannes, 1978</a>). In general, these tools include input controls (which restrict effort) and output controls (which restrict catch), which are further supported by a range of technical measures (such as monitoring, assessment, and enforcement) (
