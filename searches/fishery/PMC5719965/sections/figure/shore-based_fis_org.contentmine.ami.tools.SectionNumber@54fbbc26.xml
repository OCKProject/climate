  <div class="title">Shore-based fishing effort by gear type.</div>
  <p>Pie sizes are scaled to represent annualized estimates of total fishing effort by shore-based line, net, and spear fishing activities at each site. If annualized estimates of effort hours were not quantified for the gear types but the survey reported the most commonly used gear type (e.g., gear with highest frequency of occurrence or density of fishing activities by gear type), a symbol indicating the most commonly used gear was added to the map to document this gear preference.</p>
