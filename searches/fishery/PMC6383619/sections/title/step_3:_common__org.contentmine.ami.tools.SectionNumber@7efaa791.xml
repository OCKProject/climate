 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third step consisted in looking for direct narrative links between climate change and maritime security. This was done by looking at the common collocates between the node word 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and each node word related to 
  <span class="italic">maritime security</span> (words with an asterisk in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). An example of visualising common collocates between two node words can be seen in Fig.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As can be seen in Table 
  <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>, only eight common collocates between climate change and maritime security were found in the entire corpus of the IMO. Most pairs had only one common collocate. Logically, one of the node word pairs, 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
  <span class="italic">maritime cyber risk</span>, had no common collocates at all. The rare common collocates show a common emphasis on the institutional framework (&lt;UN&gt;, &lt;united nations&gt;, &lt;framework&gt;, &lt;global&gt;) and on the need to do something in a proactive way (&lt;combat&gt;). The most relevant common collocate (also found in Tables 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> and 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>) was found in the 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
  <span class="italic">human trafficking</span> node word pair: &lt;migration&gt;. Indeed, as mentioned above, migration (and displacement) is also a collocate of climate change. Thus, the only occurrence of an indirect link between climate change and maritime security can be found via migration. The literature has suggested that climate change (negatively) impacts on food security and population well-being, then potentially generating (illegal) migration or human trafficking, with migrants travelling (or being trafficked) by sea (Jasparro and Taylor 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2008</a>; Kaye 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2012</a>), thus a link to maritime criminality and maritime security issues.

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a> shows a graph of common collocates between 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
  <span class="italic">migration</span>. In addition to the direct collocation between climate change and migration, common collocates do not indicate any more precise connection with maritime security. Building on this, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows the concordances of some common collocates (i.e. &lt;displacement&gt;, &lt;degradation&gt;) between 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
  <span class="italic">migration</span> adding a qualitative insight. Examples of concordance tend to corroborate the existence of indirect links between climate change and maritime security via potential increased migration, although concordances also refer to land migration.

This speaks to the weakness of the narrative link between concepts but also hinders readability. However visual distinction between individual collocates is not required in statistical methodologies such as corpus linguistic. Such figures are visual representations of the complexity of lexical interconnections.)

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then took a closer look at the concordance lines of each common collocate, in order to find further possible links between climate change and maritime security. Once again, the concordance lines of the eight common collocates did not show evidence of narrative links between climate change and maritime security. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a> and Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>, for example, present the concordance lines of 
  <span class="italic">combat</span>, a common collocate of 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
  <span class="italic">armed robbery/smuggling</span>. None of the concordance lines show a link between 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
  <span class="italic">armed robbery/smuggling</span>, beyond the fact that the word &lt;combat&gt; is anyway used in two different lexical contexts, i.e. dealing with the threats posed by real criminals versus dealing with the negative impacts of climate change.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, however, links were observed between 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and the node word 
  <span class="italic">pollution</span> in the control group, which contains the node words related to non-security (i.e. safety) maritime issues. As we checked the concordance lines of the common collocates presented in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10</a> (i.e. &lt;reduce&gt;, &lt;harmful&gt;, &lt;responding&gt;, &lt;warming&gt;, &lt;environment&gt;, &lt;atmospheric&gt;), 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
  <span class="italic">pollution</span> were both linked to harmful environmental effects. For example, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig11">11</a> shows the concordance lines of 
  <span class="italic">environment</span>, a common collocate of 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
  <span class="italic">pollution</span>, in which climate change is directly addressed as a threat to the environment, in the same way pollution is. This confirms that there seems to be a stronger narrative link between climate change and non-security maritime issues, although connections between 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> and other node words in the control group (i.e. 
  <span class="italic">marine environmental protection</span> and 
  <span class="italic">maritime accident</span>) are not strong according to textual data.
