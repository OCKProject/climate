   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the visualisation of the collocates of 
   <span class="italic">climate change</span>. Collocates which are closer to the node word are stronger than the ones that are further apart. Collocates with a darker colour in the dot are more frequent than the ones with a lighter colour. The positions (R or L) of the collocates on the graph echo their positions on the concordance lines as well. Concordancing is “a means of accessing a corpus of text to show how any given word or phrase in the text is used in the immediate context in which it appears” (Flowerdew 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">1996</a>, p.87). A concordance line is a line from a text of the corpus which contains the node word to be studied. Data show that climate change in the IMO narrative is mainly associated with (1) institutional processes/frameworks (e.g. &lt;cop&gt;, &lt;conference&gt;, &lt;unfccc&gt;, &lt;framework&gt;, &lt;united nations&gt;) and (2) policy requirements/settings (e.g. &lt;adaptation&gt;, &lt;mitigation&gt;, &lt;address/addressing&gt;, &lt;responding&gt;, &lt;reduce&gt;, &lt;combat&gt;, &lt;urgent&gt;). This fits with the technical discourse adopted by international organisations in the field of environment and development (e.g. Ferguson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1990</a>) as well as a tendency to favour short-term, problem-solving approaches.

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four interesting collocates appear when it comes to negative impacts of climate change: &lt;disaster&gt;, &lt;gender&gt;, &lt;displacement&gt; and &lt;migration&gt;. Disaster may refer to the effects of climate change on natural ecosystems but also on human systems, since an increased frequency of natural disasters (especially in the poorest regions of the world) can negatively impact on human security via health and food supply issues. Also, extreme weather events and disasters can damage the maritime economy and negatively impact on food security (Allison et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2009</a>). The reference to gender issues may well point at the supposed gender dimension of the impacts of climate change, i.e. women are either more vulnerable to these effects or, on the contrary, better prepared to respond to these changes (for a critical discussion of these propositions, see Arora-Jonsson 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2011</a>). Displacement and migration are interesting collocates, since, represented as potential negative outcomes of climate change, they can point towards an indirect link between climate change and maritime security narratives, which will be further discussed below.
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> lists statistics of the collocates of 
   <span class="italic">climate change</span>. The ‘Position’ column shows whether the collocate is located on the left or right of the node word 
   <span class="italic">climate change</span> on average. ‘Frequency (corpus)’ shows the total frequency the collocate appears in the corpus. ‘Frequency (coll.)’ shows the frequency of its collocation with the node word 
   <span class="italic">climate change</span>. It is worth noting that the collocates are arranged in descending order of significance, given by the MI scores. We can see that the 10 most strongly collocated words are indeed a mixture of institutional processes (i.e. &lt;cop&gt;, &lt;unfccc&gt;), policy requirements (i.e. &lt;adaptation&gt;, &lt;mitigation&gt;, &lt;mitigate&gt;) and negative impacts of climate change (i.e. &lt;warming&gt;, &lt;degradation&gt;, &lt;displacement&gt;).

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second step consisted in analysing the collocates of the node word 
   <span class="italic">maritime security</span> (c.f. Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). It appears that maritime security in the IMO narrative is mainly associated with (1) the need to develop or improve relevant institutional frameworks (e.g. &lt;contractors/contracted&gt;, &lt;diplomatic&gt;, &lt;fund&gt;, &lt;guards&gt;, &lt;imo-led&gt;, &lt;multi-agency&gt;, &lt;mschoa&gt; (Maritime Security Center Horn of Africa), &lt;private/privately&gt;, &lt;regime&gt;, &lt;workshop&gt;, (2) policy settings (e.g. &lt;compliance&gt;, &lt;definition&gt;, &lt;education&gt;, &lt;guidance&gt;, &lt;innovation&gt;, &lt;legislation&gt;, &lt;register&gt;), and (3) generic calls for action and cooperation/coordination (e.g. &lt;enhanced/enhancing&gt; &lt;guide/guidance&gt; &lt;harmonized&gt;, &lt;implementing&gt;, &lt;improving&gt;, &lt;respond&gt;, &lt;strengthening&gt;, &lt;supporting&gt;). The only collocate to another node word from the 
   <span class="italic">maritime security</span> group is &lt;counter-piracy&gt;. Statistics of collocates of

  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As can be seen in Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a>, only eight common collocates between climate change and maritime security were found in the entire corpus of the IMO. Most pairs had only one common collocate. Logically, one of the node word pairs, 
   <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
   <span class="italic">maritime cyber risk</span>, had no common collocates at all. The rare common collocates show a common emphasis on the institutional framework (&lt;UN&gt;, &lt;united nations&gt;, &lt;framework&gt;, &lt;global&gt;) and on the need to do something in a proactive way (&lt;combat&gt;). The most relevant common collocate (also found in Tables 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> and 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>) was found in the 
   <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
   <span class="italic">human trafficking</span> node word pair: &lt;migration&gt;. Indeed, as mentioned above, migration (and displacement) is also a collocate of climate change. Thus, the only occurrence of an indirect link between climate change and maritime security can be found via migration. The literature has suggested that climate change (negatively) impacts on food security and population well-being, then potentially generating (illegal) migration or human trafficking, with migrants travelling (or being trafficked) by sea (Jasparro and Taylor 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2008</a>; Kaye 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2012</a>), thus a link to maritime criminality and maritime security issues.

   <span class="italic">climate change</span> and

   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows the concordances of some common collocates (i.e. &lt;displacement&gt;, &lt;degradation&gt;) between 
   <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
   <span class="italic">migration</span> adding a qualitative insight. Examples of concordance tend to corroborate the existence of indirect links between climate change and maritime security via potential increased migration, although concordances also refer to land migration.

Once again, the concordance lines of the eight common collocates did not show evidence of narrative links between climate change and maritime security. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a> and Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>, for example, present the concordance lines of

   <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
   <span class="italic">armed robbery/smuggling</span>, beyond the fact that the word &lt;combat&gt; is anyway used in two different lexical contexts, i.e. dealing with the threats posed by real criminals versus dealing with the negative impacts of climate change.

  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, however, links were observed between 
   <span class="italic">climate change</span> and the node word 
   <span class="italic">pollution</span> in the control group, which contains the node words related to non-security (i.e. safety) maritime issues. As we checked the concordance lines of the common collocates presented in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10</a> (i.e. &lt;reduce&gt;, &lt;harmful&gt;, &lt;responding&gt;, &lt;warming&gt;, &lt;environment&gt;, &lt;atmospheric&gt;), 
   <span class="italic">climate change</span> and

   <span class="italic">climate change</span> and 
   <span class="italic">pollution</span>, in which climate change is directly addressed as a threat to the environment, in the same way pollution is. This confirms that there seems to be a stronger narrative link between climate change and non-security maritime issues, although connections between 
   <span class="italic">climate change</span> and other node words in the control group (i.e.
