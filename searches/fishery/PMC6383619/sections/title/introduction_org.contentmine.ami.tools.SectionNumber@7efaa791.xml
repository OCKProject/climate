 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the turn of the twenty-first century, political actors such as states and international organisations have developed and promoted a discourse that links climate change and security (e.g. Commission of the European Communities 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">2009</a>; UN Security Council 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2007</a>; Department of Defense 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2015</a>). The extent, significance and practical implications of this discourse have generated many academic studies (e.g. Parsons 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2010</a>; Scott 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2008</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2012</a>; Trombetta 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2008</a>; Von Lucke et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2014</a>; on the actual links between climate change and security, see notably Barnett 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">2003</a>; Barnett and Adger 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2007</a>; Gemenne et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2014</a>; Gleditsch 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2012</a>; Hsiang and Burke 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2014</a>; Scheffran et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2012</a>). At the same time, the expansion of the security agenda and 9/11 have generated fears about the power of nuisance of non-state actors operating at sea, such as terrorists, pirates, smugglers and even illegal fishers (e.g. African Union 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2012</a>; Council of the European Union 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2014</a>; French Government 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2015</a>; HM Government 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2014</a>). The upsurge of piracy at the Horn of Africa in 2007/08 has also strengthened this trend. This has resulted in a growing narrative emphasising the need to control ocean space (Germond 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2015</a>), which translates into maritime security practices by states and international organisations, such as counter-piracy and counter-human smuggling operations, maritime surveillance and the adoption and implementation of dedicated norms and regulations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the existence of a narrative on climate change and security and a narrative on maritime security at the highest level of decision-making, there is currently no known/visible narrative linking climate change impacts and the occurrence of maritime criminality. Academics and practitioners alike seem to have somewhat neglected the actual interlinkages between the two sets of issues. In other words, the links and dependencies between climate change and maritime security have not been the focus of many studies (rare examples include Cordner 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2010</a>; Jasparro 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2009</a>; Jasparro and Taylor 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2008</a>; Kaye 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2012</a>; Mazaris and Germond 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2018</a>; Rahman 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2012</a>; Rahman and Tsamenyi 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2010</a>). Against this backdrop, this article aims to unravel the extent to which this narrative is indeed absent from political discourses or whether there are embryonic signs of its development. To clarify this matter, we carry out a hybrid corpus and discourse analysis of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) public documents/website (c.f. methodology section for a justification of the case study).
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main research question consists in searching the extent to which a narrative linking climate change and maritime security/criminality can be found in the IMO textual production. Then, if this narrative exists, how is the relationship conceptualised/presented? Can we find some ‘vectors’ linking climate change and maritime criminality, such as coastal populations’ vulnerability or sustainable development? If it does not exist, then how to explain the absence of such a discourse? How does the conceptualisation of climate change on the one hand and of maritime security on the other hand contribute to this lack of interlinkages in narrative? The findings will contribute to the academic effort consisting in fostering the recognition of complex interlinkages between climate change and maritime security, while helping practitioners reflecting on their priorities and on the extent to which they frame their responses to the two issues in a separate way.</p>
