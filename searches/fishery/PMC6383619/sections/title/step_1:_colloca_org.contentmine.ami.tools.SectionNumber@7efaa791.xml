 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the visualisation of the collocates of 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span>. Collocates which are closer to the node word are stronger than the ones that are further apart. Collocates with a darker colour in the dot are more frequent than the ones with a lighter colour. The positions (R or L) of the collocates on the graph echo their positions on the concordance lines as well. Concordancing is “a means of accessing a corpus of text to show how any given word or phrase in the text is used in the immediate context in which it appears” (Flowerdew 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">1996</a>, p.87). A concordance line is a line from a text of the corpus which contains the node word to be studied. Data show that climate change in the IMO narrative is mainly associated with (1) institutional processes/frameworks (e.g. &lt;cop&gt;, &lt;conference&gt;, &lt;unfccc&gt;, &lt;framework&gt;, &lt;united nations&gt;) and (2) policy requirements/settings (e.g. &lt;adaptation&gt;, &lt;mitigation&gt;, &lt;address/addressing&gt;, &lt;responding&gt;, &lt;reduce&gt;, &lt;combat&gt;, &lt;urgent&gt;). This fits with the technical discourse adopted by international organisations in the field of environment and development (e.g. Ferguson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1990</a>) as well as a tendency to favour short-term, problem-solving approaches.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four interesting collocates appear when it comes to negative impacts of climate change: &lt;disaster&gt;, &lt;gender&gt;, &lt;displacement&gt; and &lt;migration&gt;. Disaster may refer to the effects of climate change on natural ecosystems but also on human systems, since an increased frequency of natural disasters (especially in the poorest regions of the world) can negatively impact on human security via health and food supply issues. Also, extreme weather events and disasters can damage the maritime economy and negatively impact on food security (Allison et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2009</a>). The reference to gender issues may well point at the supposed gender dimension of the impacts of climate change, i.e. women are either more vulnerable to these effects or, on the contrary, better prepared to respond to these changes (for a critical discussion of these propositions, see Arora-Jonsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2011</a>). Displacement and migration are interesting collocates, since, represented as potential negative outcomes of climate change, they can point towards an indirect link between climate change and maritime security narratives, which will be further discussed below.

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> lists statistics of the collocates of 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span>. The ‘Position’ column shows whether the collocate is located on the left or right of the node word 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span> on average. ‘Frequency (corpus)’ shows the total frequency the collocate appears in the corpus. ‘Frequency (coll.)’ shows the frequency of its collocation with the node word 
  <span class="italic">climate change</span>. It is worth noting that the collocates are arranged in descending order of significance, given by the MI scores. We can see that the 10 most strongly collocated words are indeed a mixture of institutional processes (i.e. &lt;cop&gt;, &lt;unfccc&gt;), policy requirements (i.e. &lt;adaptation&gt;, &lt;mitigation&gt;, &lt;mitigate&gt;) and negative impacts of climate change (i.e. &lt;warming&gt;, &lt;degradation&gt;, &lt;displacement&gt;). This mirrors findings from Fig.
