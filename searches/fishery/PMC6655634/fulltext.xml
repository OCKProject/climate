Within this sector, our first goal was to produce quantitative distribution maps of all six ontogenetic life stages of krill (eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii, calyptopes, furcilia, juveniles, and adults), based on a compilation of all available post 1970s data. Using these maps, we then examined firstly whether &#x0201c;hotspots&#x0201d; of egg production and early stage nursery occurred, and secondly whether the available habitat was partitioned between the successive life stages during the austral summer and autumn, when krill densities can be high. To address these questions, we compiled larval krill density records and extracted data spanning 41 years (1976&#x02013;2016) from the existing KRILLBASE-abundance and KRILLBASE-length-frequency databases. Although adult males and females of spawning age were widely distributed, the distribution of eggs, nauplii and metanauplii indicates that spawning is most intense over the shelf and shelf slope. This contrasts with the distributions of calyptope and furcilia larvae, which were concentrated further offshore, mainly in the Southern Scotia Sea. Juveniles, however, were strongly concentrated over shelves along the Scotia Arc. Simple environmental analyses based on water depth and mean water temperature suggest that krill associate with different habitats over the course of their life cycle. From the early to late part of the austral season, juvenile distribution moves from ocean to shelf, opposite in direction to that for adults. Such habitat partitioning may reduce intraspecific competition for food, which has been suggested to occur when densities are exceptionally high during years of strong recruitment. It also prevents any potential cannibalism by adults on younger stages. Understanding the location of krill spawning and juvenile development in relation to potentially overlapping fishing activities is needed to protect the health of the south-west Atlantic sector ecosystem.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) (grant number NE/L002531/1) to FAP.

The first circumpolar distribution maps of krill were compiled from data collected during the <italic>Discovery Investigations</italic> during the 1920s and 1930s which have been been fundamental to our understanding of krill [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These maps revealed that the circumpolar distribution is assymetric, with higher concentrations in the south-west Atlantic, the sector where the current fishery now operates. More recent studies have added further detail, showing that the sector 0<sup>o</sup>-90<sup>o</sup>W contains 70% of the total stock [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>While the heterogeneous distribution of adult krill in the Southern Ocean is now well documented, differences in the relative distribution of the life stages within the south-west Atlantic sector are not so well known. Krill have a complex ontogeny and a lifespan of up to seven years [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The larval stage lasts for the first twelve months and is comprised sequentially of the following: the descent ascent development cycle which begins with eggs sinking up to 1250-1850m through the water column [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] until they hatch as nauplii and begin swimming back to surface waters; the metanauplii stage (lasting nine days at 0.5 <sup>o</sup>C [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) where the larvae remain in a non-feeding state; the calyptope stages when the larvae feed for the first time; and the furcilia stages which outlast the first winter. After the furcilia stages the krill moult to post-larval juveniles, continuing to grow to adulthood in subsequent years. A better knowledge of the relative distribution of these different life stages would help us to understand the regional distribution of spawning and recruitment [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], identifying hotspots that may be sensitive to influences such as climate change and fishing.</p><p>The <italic>Discovery Investigation</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] krill density maps typically presented the data as a series of overlain bubble plots of abundance, based on a composite of surveys spanning over a decade. Although these composite maps are hard to draw quantitative insights from, they are still valuable, and continue to be used as a source reference for the distribution of each life stage [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, since then the environmental system has changed, with warming and a changing suite of krill predators, and furthermore a wealth of data has been collected in the modern era since the 1970s. These include a series of large-scale, semi-synoptic surveys that have been used to determine the distributions of krill, including FIBEX 1981 [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], SIBEX 1984&#x02013;85 [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], CCAMLR 2000 [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Southern Ocean GLOBEC 2001&#x02013;2005 [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], US AMLR 2011, and Palmer LTER [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, a series of maps of krill life stage distributions (some including larval stages) have been produced from single surveys [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. All of these studies are valuable to our understanding of krill but, being based on one or a few surveys, they are spatially and temporally limited and provide only snapshots of krill life stage distribution, each of which can vary substantially between surveys [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. There has been no attempt, so far, to map the relative distribution of each krill life stage using all available modern era data, equivalent to the old <italic>Discovery</italic> approach.</p><p>The overall aim of this paper is to quantify and compare the distributions of all the life stages of krill within the south-west Atlantic sector during the modern (post 1970s) era. The approach is similar to that of the &#x0201c;<italic>Discovery Investigations</italic>&#x0201d; in combining all available data for each life stage from multiple surveys to produce a &#x0201c;climatology&#x0201d; map of mean distribution. The much greater volume of data available since the 1970s allowed us to plot the data quantitatively as mean densities within grid cells. To achieve this we compiled all available egg and larval krill abundance data from the modern era into a single new database. For the postlarvae we integrated the data provided from two existing databases, namely KRILLBASE-abundance and KRILLBASE-length frequency. Our first objective was to identify krill spawning hotspots to highlight potential source regions for krill recruitment. The second objective was to compare the relative distributions of the life stages to investigate whether the habitat was partitioned during the summer season. Distributions of both krill and krill sampling are heterogeneous so, in addition to the gridded maps, we included simple &#x0201c;habitat analyses&#x0201d; based on water depth and mean temperature to provide alternative visualisations of the distribution of each life stage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Overview of the krill databases used for this study</title><p>In this analysis we combined two existing post-larval krill databases, entitled KRILLBASE-abundance and KRILLBASE-length-frequency (KRILLBASE-lf) and compiled an additional database on density of the eggs and larval stages specifically for this study.

Only a few records were in October or April, and only the larval database had any records in May (29 stations).</p><p>We aimed to use a wide span of coverage (October to May) as we wanted to maximise the available sample size to provide a robust comparison between the early and late parts of the season. The sample numbers were indeed small from each ends of the season so in reality they had little effect on our grid-scale averaging. Giving the fact that there was no clear reason to exclude them we therefore chose to include them.</p><p>For this paper we defined &#x0201c;year&#x0201d; as austral season, such that, for example the year 1980 spanned October 1979 to May 1980. Within each year we further divided all data as being either &#x0201c;early season&#x0201d; (defined here as 1 October&#x02013;December 31) or &#x0201c;late season&#x0201d; (1 Jan&#x02013; 31 May). The majority of the larvae were recorded in the late season, thus providing a natural division for our analysis of habitat partitioning, while retaining large sample sizes.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>KRILLBASE-abundance database</title><p>KRILLBASE-abundance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/krillbase">https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/krillbase</ext-link>) is an open access database of net-based juvenile and adult (post-larval) Antarctic krill and salp densities [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Because the database is a composite of multiple sampling methods with variable efficiency in catching krill, all densities (nos. m<sup>-2</sup>) used in this analysis have been standardised to account for variation in sampling method. This procedure is detailed in Appendix 1 of [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and its rationale is further explained in [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In brief, we used the KRILLBASE abundance dataset to derive a series of conversion factors based on the net mouth area, sampling depth, time of day and time of year of sampling. These factors were used in an empirical model to multiply the catch values for the non-zero krill densities to those of a single and relatively efficient net sampling method; namely a night-time RMT8 net sampling from 0&#x02013;200 m on 1 January. Prior analyses [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] have showed that this standardisation procedure yields a very similar geographic pattern of krill distribution to that based on un-standardised krill densities, although mean values were overall higher.</p><p>For our study, we filtered the database for standardised numerical densities of post-larval krill that fell within the previously outlined spatiotemporal parameters, with additional filtering on sampling depth following Atkinson et al., (2008). Namely, the upper sampling depth was within the topmost 20m and the bottom sampling depth was at least 50 m depth. This resulted in a total of 7,627 usable stations out of a possible 12,758.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>KRILLBASE-length-frequency database</title><p>The full KRILLBASE-length frequency database contains the individual length measurements for &#x0003e;1,000,000 krill, with sex and maturity stage as additional variables for a portion of these. These values were obtained from both scientific hauls and commercial fisheries. Most of these were oblique or targeted hauls (often towed horizontally) within the top 200m layer. Unlike the other two databases we included horizontal hauls in this study to enhance sample sizes, based on our unpublished prior analyses that showed that the trends in krill length were congruent between the two sampling methods. After filtering for the spatiotemporal criteria stated in section 2.1, we ensured that any records outside of the following parameters were removed: Krill &#x0003c;15mm were excluded, since krill this size would likely be furcilia, counted in the larval database. Records sampled with a &#x0003e;6mm mesh were excluded due to the possibility of net mesh selection and under-representation of the smaller krill. This removed both commercial trawl data and some of the scientific trawls. Data from some scientific nets were further excluded where mesh size was not stipulated, including nets described as trawls. This left 530,018 measured krill from 4,394 stations.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Egg and larval database</title><p>We collated the larval database for this study and it contained density estimates for eggs and individual larval stages. The component surveys and sampling details are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219325.s001">S1 Table</xref>. These data were not standardised in the same way as the postlarval density data, given the decreased net escape responses of the small larvae. Further, the nets compiled were restricted to those that provided a reasonable estimation of egg and larval densities (i.e. 100&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;m. mesh mesozooplankton nets&#x02013;see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219325.s001">S1 Table</xref>). An important difference in the screening compared to the postlarval data was the requirement for the top depth to be the surface and the bottom depth to be at least 200 m, to ensure that the densities of calyptopes and furcilia, known to undergo extensive diel vertical migrations, were represented consistently. We stress that sampling even in the whole of the top 200m layer will under-sample eggs and nauplii due to the deep developmental cycle, and discuss this issue in section 4.1.</p><p>Our compiled larval database contains detailed information on densities of a range of early life stages, and includes depth distributions of life stages from stratified hauls. We combined the results from stratified hauls at each station to provide densities (no. m<sup>2</sup>) within the whole sampled water column, and for four larval stages; eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii (hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;nauplii&#x0201d;), calyptopes, and furcilia. Low data availability and the fact that larvae were relatively rare before January meant that we could only provide late season distributions for these four larval stages. For our analysis we extracted 1,623 usable stations out of the total 3,449 in this database.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Producing grid maps of krill life stage densities</title><p>Baseline maps of land masses were plotted using the WGS 1984 Antarctic Polar Stereographic co-ordinate system using Arc GIS v 10.2.2. To these maps, a grid of cells, 1<sup>o</sup> of latitude by 2<sup>o</sup> of longitude, and the Antarctic Polar Front position was overlaid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g001">Fig 1</xref>). By joining each of the three databases separately to this grid, we derived a series of mean krill indices for each grid cell, both for early and late season where data allowed. These indices included densities for each of our four larval groups (eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii combined, calyptopes and furcilia), as well as total post-larval density. From the KRILLBASE length frequency database extracted for each grid cell, we determined the fractions of juvenile and adult krill (defined respectively as 15&#x02013;30 mm and &#x0003e; 30 mm following ref [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) and the sex ratio for these adult krill. By multiplying the appropriate indices for each cell we calculated the mean density of female and male adult krill, juvenile krill, in addition to those of the four larval groups. Calculations of juvenile and adult densities could only be made if there were values from both the density and length-frequency databases in any given grid cell. This led to 389 grid cells being excluded due to lack of length frequency data, and 41 grid cells being excluded due to lack of post-larval density data. These exclusions obviated the need to interpolate between grid cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Selection of environmental data</title><p>One of our objectives is to use environmental descriptor data, alongside the plots themselves, to illustrate the degree of habitat partitioning among krill life stages. We stress that krill life stage distribution has been linked to a wide range of environmental factors such as sea ice, phytoplankton concentration, oceanographic fronts, eddies, bathymetry and temperature [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is beyond the scope of this paper to examine how all of these the factors influence the distribution of each life stage. In any case, the timespan of the data pre-date the satellite era, and matching environmental data, specifically chlorophyll data, are unavailable for most of the 41 sampling years. Instead, for this analysis we selected both mean water depth and mean water temperature within each grid cell as our habitat descriptor variables. While water depth is clearly invariant across the 41-year timespan of observations, mean water temperature changes both seasonally and over longer timescales. The purpose of this temperature index was therefore to provide an internally consistent index to portray the radically different distribution patterns of the life stages across the sector.</p><p>To derive these two habitat descriptors, ocean bathymetry was sourced from the GEBCO data series. The most up-to-date GEBCO data available was version GEBCO_2014 grid (The GEBCO_Grid, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gebco.net/">www.gebco.net</ext-link>). These data were used to create isobaths and to derive mean water depth for each of the grid cells used for analysis in ArcGIS. Water depth can be used as a rough proxy for a grid cell&#x02019;s position relative to land; 0-1000m being the shelf region, 1000-2000m the shelf break/slope, 2000-3000m off shelf, 3000-4000m being oceanic and &#x0003e;4000m ocean trench. To derive mean sea surface temperature (SST) for each grid cell, data from 1 January 1979&#x02013;1 December 2014 were downloaded from the European centre for medium-range weather forecasts, specifically the European re-analysis interim dataset. An average February value was taken for our study area, as described in [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], it contains the least ice cover.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Environmental habitat analysis</title><p>As described in section 2.3 there are numerous variables which may influence the distribution of Antarctic krill [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We sought to summarize key physical habitat characteristics with a simple index which combines water depth and climatological mean temperature since these portray the differing habitats of each krill life stage. For our water depth and temperature analyses, we first obtained mean water depths and temperatures for each cell of our 1<sup>o</sup> latitude by 2<sup>o</sup> longitude grid. For each sampling station we then related each available life stage density to its grid mean temperature and depth value. This matrix of linked krill and physical data was then divided into broad categories of temperature (-2-0 <sup>o</sup>C, 0&#x02013;2&#x000b0;C, 2&#x02013;4&#x000b0;C, &#x0003e; 4&#x000b0;C) and of depth (0-1000m, 1000-2000m, 2000-3000m, 3000-4000m, &#x0003e;4000m). While other finer divisions were trialled, these broad categories preserved relatively large sample sizes, while still being able to depict the large differences in habitat that we found between the life stages. Within each of these combinations of temperature and depth we calculated the arithmetic mean krill density for each of the life stages.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Overview of sampling coverage and life stage distribution</title><p>Temporally, the most intensively sampled period in our analysis was 1996&#x02013;2005 (5,102 stations), with the least sampled being 2006&#x02013;2016 (1,766 stations) (<xref rid="pone.0219325.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

However, there is some evidence for a seasonal change with respect to bathymetric distribution, this being congruent across both sexes. In the early part of the season before January, males and females are most abundant near shelf and slope waters, whereas in the late season the highest densities of both sexes are seen off shelf.

High densities were recorded during a 2011 survey in the Marguerite Bay area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219325.s001">S1 Table</xref>) and these are reflected in a secondary high density area in this area in the composite maps of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g004">Fig 4</xref>.

There are clear population centres evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g004">Fig 4</xref>, both at the Antarctic Peninsula shelf and around the South Georgia shelf. Exceptionally high juvenile densities seen at South Georgia have been associated with several notable spawning successes, for example in 1981 and 1996.

In October-December the smallest in this size range may be nearing 1- year old (i.e. 0+ age class) whereas the largest may be one year older (1+ age class). Whatever their age, they have a clearly more oceanic distribution (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g006">6</xref>), albeit with the same broad range of habitat temperatures as late season juveniles.

We believe that a synthesis of these krill life stage distribution data from the modern era into a series of quantitative maps is useful for a number of reasons.

Second, it allows the identification of specific habitats that may be particularly sensitive for krill, for spawning, nursery of larvae or for recruitment, allowing improved spatial planning for fisheries management or conservation. Third, given the ongoing rapid climate change within this region, we hope that the data and maps can be used for future efforts to model past, present and future krill distributions and how these may respond to environmental change [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><sec id="sec019"><title>How well do composite maps represent krill life stage distributions?</title><p>While net sampling has contributed much to our knowledge of krill, there are several factors that might affect the quality of data collected.

Previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] have argued that there is significant under sampling of the juvenile stage of krill, potentially because of avoidance [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the mesh size used for nets [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For the younger stages, the early developmental descent and re-ascent cycle [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] will mean that only a portion of the standing stocks of eggs, nauplii, metanauplii and even calyptopes will be retained by net sampling, which is typically only to 200 m depth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219325.s006">S1 Fig</xref>). Even the post-larval stages make extensive vertical migrations to over 3000m, leading to underestimates of density based on net sampling in the upper layers [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

For all of these reasons, the emphasis of this study is on horizontal patterns of abundance of each stage within the surface layers rather than comparisons of densities across life stages.</p><p>Our maps are generated from composite data collected over many seasons and should not be interpreted as single-season snapshots. They are thus akin both to the <italic>Discovery</italic> maps and more recent coarser-scale composite maps of the circumpolar distribution for calyptopes, furcilia and postlarval krill [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A number of large-scale, short-term synoptic surveys have been used to determine the distributions of krill (FIBEX 1981, SIBEX 1984&#x02013;85, CCAMLR 2000, Southern Ocean GLOBEC 2001&#x02013;2005, US AMLR 2011). These examples form part of the composite database analysed here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219325.s006">S1 Fig</xref>). Larval distributions, in particular, vary between surveys such that some of these surveys provided similar distributions to ours and others did not.</p><p>A potential issue for all distribution maps is the uneven distribution of sampling effort. To address this, all of the data have been averaged by grid cell to provide estimates of mean no. m<sup>-2</sup>. However, given the patchiness of krill, the precision of these mean values will inevitably be much lower in the less intensively sampled oceanic areas. This leads to juxtaposed grid cells with high and low calculated mean density in the distribution plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g004">Fig 4</xref>.

Importantly, these areas of elevated densities of calyptopes and furcilia are much more restricted than those of adult krill or eggs. The reasons why calyptopes and furcilia are located only in parts of the adult distributional range are unclear. It has been suggested [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] that the presence of warmer Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) water along the Antarctic Peninsula speeds the development time of eggs, allowing the hatched nauplii to return to the surface waters with greater energy reserves, giving them more time to find food. This interpretation suggests that the chance of an egg reaching the calyptope stage is dependent on having suitable environmental conditions. Temperature has already been shown to have an impact on the developmental capacity on the early larval stages [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The metanauplii stage is the last non-feeding stage; once they have metamorphosed into calyptopes they must be able to feed. So one explanation for the relatively localised larval krill distribution is that they exhibit both suitable environmental conditions for rapid egg development [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], coupled to high levels of the correct food sources both for spawning females [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and for the calyptope and furcilia stages.</p><p>The next conundrum is where the eggs that successfully reach the furcilia stage were spawned. Our density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and analyses (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g006">6</xref>) show that the greatest densities of eggs, nauplii and metanauplii are found on the shelf or shelf slope around the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Orkneys. Importantly, we found very few eggs present in the areas where there were high densities of calyptopes and furcilia. One explanation for this is a disproportionately high mortality of eggs laid over shelf habitats, either through sinking to the seafloor and being unable to undertake the developmental cycle or due to elevated predation [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>An alternative (and non-mutually exclusive) explanation for the disconnect between the distributions of feeding and non-feeding larval stages is that eggs laid near the shelf edge were being advected offshore, in a general northerly and easterly direction [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Modelling of particles released along the continental shelf break to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula shows that they are carried north-northeast by Ekman drift into the path of the fast flowing ACC [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Modelled trajectories of larval krill across the Scotia Sea yielded maps of distribution [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] that are similar to those presented here. Importantly some models have also shown that the speed of particle advection allows enough time for larval development. It has been suggested [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] that krill from the Antarctic Peninsula could potentially reach South Georgia within 140&#x02013;160 days. Therefore, we suggest that the presence of calyptopes and furcilia in the middle of the Scotia Sea is the result of spawning on the continental shelf break region off the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and subsequent advection. As these life stages develop, they are advected further off shore by the hydrographic regime.</p><p>Calyptopes and furcilia have also been found around Marguerite Bay at the base of the WAP. The importance of Marguerite Bay for krill populations has been noted in the past [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Interestingly the hydrographic systems along the WAP mean that Marguerite Bay is a retention point for krill [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Further modelling work has shown that particles released as far north as ~65&#x000b0;S along the WAP will be moved southwards in the coastal current [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This evidence suggests that eggs spawned along the WAP (as far north as ~65&#x000b0;S) could end up within Marguerite Bay. It is also possible that these larvae originate from local spawning, but there are no data to corroborate this.</p><p>Notwithstanding our uncertainties over spawning locations, the evidence from the overall distributions of adults, eggs, nauplii and metanauplii suggests that spawning occurs over wide areas including both shelf and adjacent deep water habitats, and from the Antarctic Peninsula up to South Georgia. However, the much more restricted distribution of calyptopes and furcilia suggests that many of these advected early stages fail to reach the feeding larval stages.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Partitioning of habitat by different life stages</title><p>We found strong evidence for habitat partitioning, visible both on the distribution maps themselves and through the use of water depth and mean temperature as simple habitat descriptors (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g006">6</xref>). While these are not complete descriptions of the krill habitat (which would include sea ice, food levels and other factors) they are sufficient to illustrate clearly that differing spatial distributions of the life stages exist. We have attempted to trace the strong differences in distribution between the life stages and between the early and late halves of the austral summer season in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g007">Fig 7</xref>. This illustrates the spatially-separated distributions of the larvae and juveniles, as well as the opposing on-shelf&#x02013;off-shelf shifts in distributions of adults and juveniles throughout the season.</p><fig id="pone.0219325.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0219325.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Schematic of seasonal change in onshelf&#x02014;offshelf distributions of krill life stages.</title><p>This illustration is based mainly on our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g005">Fig 5</xref>.

It builds on a schematic published in Fig 2.6 of [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but includes the observed redistribution of juvenile krill from oceanic waters back to shelf waters throughout the austral spring. This schematic simply reports the changing distributions seen in our study and does not propose candidate mechanisms such as advection, migration or differential mortality.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0219325.g007"/></fig><p>The strong on-shelf&#x02013;off-shelf divide between larvae and juveniles is clear in all our depictions of distribution. Eggs were found in greatest densities in cooler, (-2&#x000b0;C&#x02014;0&#x000b0;C) shallower waters (1000m-2000m) than furcilia, which were found in warmer (0&#x000b0;C-4&#x000b0;C), deeper water (2000m-4000m). This partitioning could be driven partially by the hydrological processes described above, that advect developing larvae from regions of egg production into downstream oceanic waters of the Scotia Sea. The survival of the calyptope and furcilia in the offshore region will likely also depend on food availability. This was highlighted by previous research that modelled the transport of larval stages across the Scotia Sea and found that it could only be successful under certain food conditions [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>Food availability is thought not only to determine the success of larval stages but, through intraspecific competition for food, large scale population fluctuations in adults [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Across this whole sector, the density of postlarval krill can vary both coherently and greatly between years [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] reflecting high recruitment success only once or twice per decade [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This episodic recruitment leads to episodic one or two-year periods with enormous numbers of small krill (e.g. 1981/1982, 1996/1997). For schooling species, local grazing impact may be intense in years of high abundance, and only partially alleviated by dietary diversity [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and by their nutrient excretion and fertilisation effects [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. During years of exceptionally high abundance of larval and juvenile krill, the partitioning of the main habitat between the life stages would reduce this competition for food.</p><p>In addition to its role in reducing food completion among the numerous early life stages of krill, habitat partitioning may also have other advantages. It would reduce cannibalism, recorded in post larval krill in the laboratory (49,71, 74) in the field [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and in larvae in the laboratory [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. It may also have advantages in food acquisition. Some studies report a shelf-ocean gradient in phytoplankton size with microphytoplankton (20&#x02013;200&#x003bc;m) dominating the onshore regions and nanophytoplankton (2&#x02013;20&#x003bc;m) in offshore regions [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], in which case the small and larger life stages may have access to differing size ranges of food. While the feeding behaviours of the life stages (including cannibalism) have seldom been compared, differing distributions of the life stages may have advantages beyond the reduction in intraspecific competition.</p><p>Whatever the advantages, the mechanisms behind the differing distributions of furcilia and juveniles are difficult to explain based on our current understanding of krill. The furcilia show a very clearly-defined distribution over waters between 1000 and 4000m deep and 0&#x000b0;C-4&#x000b0;C; these are characteristic of the Scotia Sea. In contrast, the juveniles have a strong affinity for shelf and shelf slope habitats (0-2000m) which are both upstream and to the south. As our main distribution patterns are compared for the &#x0201c;late season&#x0201d; period (i.e. January&#x02013;May), this means that these late-season juveniles will be one year older than the corresponding calyptopes and furcilia. This suggests that, during this intervening year, the developing juveniles have travelled south-west onto shelf habitats of the Scotia Arc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The Antarctic Peninsula experiences annual sea ice cover, and the association of krill furcilia and juveniles to sea ice has been well documented [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The roles of sea ice for krill is an issue of active study [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] but the prevailing drift, both with ice and currents, transports larvae in a general north-easterly direction towards the Scotia Sea [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. To counter this, it could be that the juveniles migrate back to the southern Scotia Arc where they concentrate during the summer. This possibility is in line with previous suggestions of horizontal migrations of krill throughout the season, for example, the concept of an offshore spawning migration [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] and inshore migrations to overwinter [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Contrasting early and late season bathymetric distributions of juveniles and adult male and female krill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g006">Fig 6</xref>) provide further support for the concept of an active migration.</p><p>In contrast to all of the other life stages, the adult krill (males and females in both the early and later season) are much more ubiquitous throughout the study area. The very highest densities are found in habitats with very deep water (&#x0003e;4000) and relatively warm temperatures (2&#x000b0;C-4&#x000b0;C) that are characteristic of the north-eastern Scotia Sea. Adult krill can maintain swimming speeds of 10-15cms<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and advection must clearly play a strong role in governing their distribution [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. However, the ability of krill to swim may allow them to move perpendicularly to the dominant flows [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. This ability to influence their destination, in combination with a multi-year adult lifespan that allows time for dispersal, could explain such a broad distribution of the adult stages of krill.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Wider implications</title><p>Notwithstanding our uncertainty over the driving mechanisms, our study shows that life stages of krill are partitioned between a range of habitats within their population centre in the south-west Atlantic sector. For a krill to reach adulthood, these different habitats must be utilised sequentially over the course of their development. Our study emphasises the importance of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula to krill, being the only location where we find high densities of eggs, adults and juveniles, and where the high densities of calyptopes and furcilia could originate from.</p><p>The localised nature of krill spawning and nursery is also evidenced by the composite maps from the <italic>Discovery Investigations</italic> in the 1920s and 1930s [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Marr&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] multi-season composite bubble plots also show eggs concentrated at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, with high densities of calyptopes and furcilia in the middle of the Scotia Sea. However, recent work [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] has shown that for post-larvae, their centre of distribution in this sector has contracted southward by about 440 km between the <italic>Discovery</italic> era and the 1996&#x02013;2016 period, commensurate with the substantial warming observed in this sector over that period [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, while the temperature-based distribution of the life stages may be responding as the climate of the sector changes, the basic concept of hotspots of spawning and early-stage nursery appears to hold both for the <italic>Discovery</italic> and the modern era.</p><p>This localised nature of successful spawning is important in the context of the krill fishing industry. Since the mid-1990s almost all krill fishing in the Southern Ocean has taken place in the south-west Atlantic, particularly around South Georgia, the South Orkneys and the South Shetland Islands and, more recently, in the Bransfield Strait [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The overlap of areas targeted by the fishery and the location of high adult densities is not surprising. However the presence of eggs in fished locations and the short time between spawning and hatch (~7 days at 0.5 <sup>o</sup>C [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]), suggests that the fishery also overlaps with spawning sites. An objective of krill fishery management is to maintain stable recruitment of the target stock [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. This objective might be harder to achieve if fishing intensity at spawning sites increases due either to an overall increase in fishing effort or a concentration of effort in these sites. CCAMLR aims to develop a finer scale management approach than the large subarea catch limits shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219325.g001">Fig 1</xref> [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Information on the location of spawning, such as that provided here, should be considered in the development of this approach to help minimise fishery impacts on recruitment.</p><p>Our study adds to the evidence that within the south-west Atlantic sector there are relatively localised hotspots of activity, including krill spawning and early stage development, foraging of land-based predators, fishing, tourism and scientific research [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. We have identified the Southern Scotia Arc as one such hotspot for the krill life cycle. This area is also a focus for many human activities, increasing the potential for anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystem. The region is also undergoing long-term climatic warming and krill distribution and abundance appear to be changing in response [<xref rid="pone.0219325.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Given the need to understand how krill will respond to future change, we hope that our data and maps describing the key areas for life-cycle completion form a baseline for future modelling initiatives.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219325.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Source of larval krill data, arranged with each row of data corresponding to a single research cruise.</title><p>The complete larval database was larger than this, but the records listed here correspond to the screened subset of data that were used for plotting the distributions.
