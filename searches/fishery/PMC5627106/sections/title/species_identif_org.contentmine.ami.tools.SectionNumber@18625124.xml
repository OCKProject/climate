 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ichthyoplankton that were visually identified as rockfishes were removed, counted, and measured for total length with a dissecting microscope and micrometer. A few rockfish species, such as shortbelly, bocaccio, and older stages of cowcod can be morphologically identified to species, and these were enumerated visually under a microscope. The vast majority of rockfish larvae, however, are not identifiable to species based on morphology, and these were identified genetically by sequencing the mitochondrial cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> gene (see the electronic supplementary material, appendix S1) and matching sequences to a genetic library developed by Hyde &amp; Vetter [
  <a rid="RSOS170639C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C34">34</a>]. Previous analyses demonstrated that this gene can discriminate all rockfish species from southern California [

  <a rid="RSOS170639C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C35">35</a>]. All larvae that were morphologically identified as cowcod and bocaccio were sequenced to confirm their identity, but most shortbelly were not sequenced as previous analyses indicated that 100% of visually identified shortbelly were indeed this species [
  <a rid="RSOS170639C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C26">26</a>]. Unfortunately, most larvae from 2003 were poorly preserved and unable to be sequenced; we thus excluded 2003 samples from the analyses. We also eliminated from analyses stations where at least 50% of the larvae failed to sequence. These eliminated stations were randomly distributed and thus probably did not induce any systematic bias to the analyses. To standardize for minor differences in tow lengths and/or depths among stations, larval count data were multiplied by a standard haul factor (SHF), which is calculated by dividing the volume of water filtered by the tow depth and expressed as larvae under 10 m
