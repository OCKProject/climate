 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested whether larval abundance systematically changed throughout southern California by correlating mean larval abundance per year against year with a general linear model. Annual winter means were calculated using the delta-mean technique that helps account for high numbers of samples containing zero values [
  <a rid="RSOS170639C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C38">38</a>]. Analyses were restricted to common species (at least 300 larvae under 10 m
  <span class="sup">2</span> summed across all years). We also removed an extreme outlier station in 2004 that contained abundances of cowcod, pygmy and bocaccio that were between approximately two and three times greater than the next highest station in the entire dataset (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). We calculated the proportion of species that were historically targeted and non-targeted by fishing (as defined by Love

  <a rid="RSOS170639C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C19">19</a>]) that increased significantly (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.10) through time. Our goal was to determine if there were similar patterns between targeted and untargeted rockfishes rather than determine the significance for any one species; therefore, we did not apply a Bonferroni correction.
