 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) programme has been regularly monitoring fixed stations in the SCB since 1949 [

CalCOFI uses 0.71 m diameter, 505 µm-mesh bongo nets towed obliquely from a depth of 210 m to collect plankton samples, and conductivity, temperature, and depth instruments (CTDs) to record oceanographic variables (e.g. temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, and chlorophyll

From 1949 until 1997 samples were fixed and stored in 5% formalin but subsequent to 1997 samples from the portside bongo net were preserved in 95% ethanol (formalin degrades while ethanol preserves DNA; contents of the starboard net continued to be placed in formalin). This study focuses on ethanol-preserved samples collected annually from 1998 to 2013 during the winter (January--February; the peak spawning period for the majority of rockfishes in this region) from 36 CalCOFI stations (
