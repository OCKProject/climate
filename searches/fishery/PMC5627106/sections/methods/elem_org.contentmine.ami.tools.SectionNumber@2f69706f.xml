  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) programme has been regularly monitoring fixed stations in the SCB since 1949 [
   <a rid="RSOS170639C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C31">31</a>]. CalCOFI uses 0.71 m diameter, 505 µm-mesh bongo nets towed obliquely from a depth of 210 m to collect plankton samples, and conductivity, temperature, and depth instruments (CTDs) to record oceanographic variables (e.g. temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, and chlorophyll 
   <span class="italic">a</span>) [
   <a rid="RSOS170639C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C31">31</a>]. From 1949 until 1997 samples were fixed and stored in 5% formalin but subsequent to 1997 samples from the portside bongo net were preserved in 95% ethanol (formalin degrades while ethanol preserves DNA; contents of the starboard net continued to be placed in formalin). This study focuses on ethanol-preserved samples collected annually from 1998 to 2013 during the winter (January--February; the peak spawning period for the majority of rockfishes in this region) from 36 CalCOFI stations (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ichthyoplankton that were visually identified as rockfishes were removed, counted, and measured for total length with a dissecting microscope and micrometer. A few rockfish species, such as shortbelly, bocaccio, and older stages of cowcod can be morphologically identified to species, and these were enumerated visually under a microscope. The vast majority of rockfish larvae, however, are not identifiable to species based on morphology, and these were identified genetically by sequencing the mitochondrial cytochrome 
   <span class="italic">b</span> gene (see the electronic supplementary material, appendix S1) and matching sequences to a genetic library developed by Hyde &amp; Vetter [
   <a rid="RSOS170639C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C34">34</a>]. Previous analyses demonstrated that this gene can discriminate all rockfish species from southern California [

   <a rid="RSOS170639C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C35">35</a>]. All larvae that were morphologically identified as cowcod and bocaccio were sequenced to confirm their identity, but most shortbelly were not sequenced as previous analyses indicated that 100% of visually identified shortbelly were indeed this species [
   <a rid="RSOS170639C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C26">26</a>]. Unfortunately, most larvae from 2003 were poorly preserved and unable to be sequenced; we thus excluded 2003 samples from the analyses. We also eliminated from analyses stations where at least 50% of the larvae failed to sequence. These eliminated stations were randomly distributed and thus probably did not induce any systematic bias to the analyses. To standardize for minor differences in tow lengths and/or depths among stations, larval count data were multiplied by a standard haul factor (SHF), which is calculated by dividing the volume of water filtered by the tow depth and expressed as larvae under 10 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> of sea surface area to the depth of a tow (200 m or 10 m from the bottom for shallow stations) [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested whether larval abundance systematically changed throughout southern California by correlating mean larval abundance per year against year with a general linear model.

   <a rid="RSOS170639C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C38">38</a>]. Analyses were restricted to common species (at least 300 larvae under 10 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> summed across all years). We also removed an extreme outlier station in 2004 that contained abundances of cowcod, pygmy and bocaccio that were between approximately two and three times greater than the next highest station in the entire dataset (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). We calculated the proportion of species that were historically targeted and non-targeted by fishing (as defined by Love 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. [

   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.10) through time. Our goal was to determine if there were similar patterns between targeted and untargeted rockfishes rather than determine the significance for any one species; therefore, we did not apply a Bonferroni correction.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to cessation of fishing pressure, environmental conditions can contribute to changes in larval rockfish abundances. To determine dynamic habitat preference for the common species, we used generalized linear models (family = binomial, link = logit) to test whether the presence/absence (we initially used two-stage models that evaluated environmental effects separately on presence/absence and abundances of non-zero stations but found that the abundance component did not improve model performance) of larvae at each station and year was affected by temperature (°C), salinity (psu), oxygen (ml l
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) and chlorophyll 
   <span class="italic">a</span> (μg l
   <span class="sup">−1</span>). Covariance was low among these independent variables (
   <span class="italic">r</span> &lt; 0.57) and all were included in the analyses. Because the vast majority of rockfish larvae occupy the upper 100 m of the water column [
   <a rid="RSOS170639C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C39">39</a>], we computed mean values for each environmental covariate between 3 and 100 m. We limited these analyses to include only larvae that were less than or equal to 5 mm total length (TL) based on previous findings that these young larvae had mostly not been advected far from their natal location [
   <a rid="RSOS170639C24" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C24">24</a>,
   <a rid="RSOS170639C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C26">26</a>]. Residuals for each species model were not found to be spatially autocorrelated but were temporally autocorrelated (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). To account for temporal autocorrelation we included year as an autocovariate; residuals of these models were not temporally autocorrelated (electronic supplementary material, figure S3). We again calculated the proportion of targeted and untargeted species whose presence/absence correlated significantly (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.10) with a covariate. To provide a sense of how oceanographic conditions during the study compared with long-term patterns, we calculated yearly winter averages of the environmental variables from the time-series data and compared them to long-term winter averages obtained from CalCOFI hydrographic data from 1983 to 2013.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the CCAs positively influenced rockfish production, we would expect larval abundances to increase at a greater rate inside compared to outside of the protected areas for targeted species, but not for untargeted species. However, environmental conditions can also affect production dynamics and thus obscure MPA effects. To isolate CCA from environmental effects, we paired each of the six stations within the CCA to one outside of the MPA. Pairs were chosen based on habitat similarity. We conducted a Bray–Curtis cluster analysis on stations based on means from 1998 to 2013 of the four environmental variables (oxygen, chlorophyll 
   <span class="italic">a</span>, temperature and salinity), as well as two stationary variables, depth and percentage of hard substrate, that are known to affect adult rockfish distribution [

   <a rid="RSOS170639C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSOS170639C32">32</a>]. Proportion of hard substrate was obtained from the Seafloor Mapping Lab at California State University, Monterey Bay (

We then selected six stations outside of the protected areas that most closely matched habitat conditions of the six CCA stations (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). Next, we calculated annual delta means for each species with a total abundance of ≥150 larvae under 10 m
   <span class="sup">2</span> during the study for the six stations inside and six outside of the CCAs. Four targeted species, bank
   <span class="italic">,</span> bocaccio
   <span class="italic">,</span> speckled and olive, and six non-targeted species, squarespot, shortbelly, pygmy, stripetail, swordspine and whitespeckled, were abundant enough to be analysed. Blue rockfish also met the abundance threshold but was excluded because it was almost always found north of the Channel Islands and thus was unable to be affected by the CCAs (electronic supplementary material, figure S5). As with the previous analysis we only used individuals that were less than or equal to 5 mm TL. We then conducted a type III analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for each species with year, station location (inside/outside the CCAs) and an interaction between these terms as the dependent variables. This interaction was particularly important as significance indicates that abundances changed at a different rate inside versus outside the CCA. We thus determined the proportion of targeted and untargeted species where the 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-value for the interaction between year and CCA was less than 0.10. All analyses and figures were made using the statistical analysis software R v. 3.2.3 [
