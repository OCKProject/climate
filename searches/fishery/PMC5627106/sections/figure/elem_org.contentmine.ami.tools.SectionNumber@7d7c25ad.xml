  <p>Relationship between larval abundance and year for targeted species with at least 150 larvae under 10â€‰m
   <span class="sup">2</span> summed across 12 paired stations (six inside and six outside of the CCAs) during the study. Red and blue colours depict stations within and outside of the CCAs, respectively. Best-fit linear regression lines and 95% confidence intervals are shown for species where there was a significant interaction between year and CCA.
