Transfer these actions to column 2 of Worksheet 1A as additions to run them through Activity 1; color code these actions to distinguish them as ‘new’ actions being added to the original list of ‘existing’ actions.</td>

This documents the logic for why the action is needed/how it addresses the impacts of particular climate stressor-interactions as identified in the vulnerability information.</td>
