 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this activity, Worksheet 2 (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>) is used to help identify actions that could be added to a management plan. Key vulnerabilities that are not sufficiently addressed in the existing plan can be examined, in conjunction with the Compendium, to brainstorm and craft actions to fill those gaps. Or, if there is no existing plan and it is being developed for the first time, Activity 2 is equally effective for brainstorming a list of actions from scratch. The CCAP Compendium developed for coral reefs (Box 
  <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">1</a>; Parker et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2017</a>); West et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2016</a>)) informs the activity by providing general adaptation strategies, adaptation options, and climate-smart design considerations compiled from an intensive review of the literature. The ecologically-based, general adaptation strategies provide a structure for considering the full range of available adaptation options. In Worksheet 2, general ideas are converted into specifically-defined actions appropriate to the particular reef’s unaddressed vulnerabilities. These are then run through Activity 1 in order to apply climate-smart design.

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The culmination of these two activities--an expanded list of climate-smart actions—is intended to provide the fullest range of ideas possible for evaluation and selection (Step 5; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) and for potential inclusion in a new or revised (more climate-smart) plan. The list is comprised of better-crafted actions with respect to climate change implications for timing, placement (siting), engineering, and other physical aspects of design. Sometimes, putting pre-existing actions through Activity 1 may reveal that some actions will no longer be feasible as climate changes. In that case, Activity 2 can be used in a more targeted manner to replace those eliminated actions.

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the next section, we present the results of expert consultations carried out with practitioners in Pacific and Caribbean reef locations. These results were used to improve the tool and draw lessons-learned for adaptation planning moving forward.</p>
