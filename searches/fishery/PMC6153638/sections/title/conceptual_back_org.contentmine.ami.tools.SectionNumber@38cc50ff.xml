 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned, the first phase of the CCAP project (West et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2016</a>) adapted the general climate-smart cycle (Stein et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2014</a>) and assessed its applicability to coral reefs. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> shows the adapted climate-smart cycle, which includes general steps in a typical planning process where climate change information can be used to improve management effectiveness. This facilitates accounting for climate change effects in everything from defining goals and objectives; to assessing vulnerabilities from interacting climate and non-climate stressors; to identifying, selecting and implementing climate-smart management responses; to monitoring effectiveness. Making use of extensive vulnerability and resilience information already available for coral reefs (Step 2), we focused on how such information can be applied for brainstorming and designing potential management adaptation options (Step 4) and—once priority actions have been selected (Step 5)—how to further specify more detailed design for implementation (Step 6). While this paper will primarily focus on Step 4, we will touch on Step 6 as well as implications of results for other steps where appropriate. This applicability to multiple steps is consistent with the iterative nature of management planning, where adjustments may become necessary at any step—leading to potential changes in other steps in response--as new and improved information becomes available. These concepts are explored further below.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The adaptation design framework (center of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) was used to build a Compendium of adaptation ideas for coral reef managers, drawn from an extensive review of the literature (West et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2016</a>). The Compendium organizes information according to seven general adaptation strategies (Box 
  <a rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec4">1</a>) (West and Julius 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" href="#CR98">2014</a>), placing ideas for specific adaptation options into these ‘bins’ to ensure that all categories of approaches are considered. Central to the entire framework is the concept of climate-smart design considerations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In order to make a generic adaptation idea truly climate-smart for a specific reef system in a particular location, it is necessary to apply two categories of design considerations (Box 
  <a rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec5">2</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feedback from participants engaged in the initial testing of these general concepts (reported in West et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2016</a>)) affirmed the value of addressing climate-smart design considerations for making their watershed and coastal management activities more climate-smart. Participants also recognized the complexity of the considerations raised and articulated a need for an expanded, step-by-step process to break the design consideration concepts (presented in general form in the Compendium) into more detailed and specific place-based questions for their own locations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new Design Tool presented in this paper was developed in response to this need. It is structured to aid in ‘unpacking’ climate-smart design considerations into a series of questions that lead the user through the process of brainstorming and crafting climate-smart adaptation actions. As a result, the Design Tool provides a link between climate change vulnerability assessment and the design and implementation of on-the-ground management adaptations that are climate-smart. It is based on the premise that management actions must work in the context of and adjust for global stressors. In Step 4 of the planning cycle (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), the Design Tool provides a systematic, transparent and defensible approach to help managers to do the following: (1) integrate climate-smart design considerations into their existing management actions; and (2) build out an expanded set of actions based on options found under general adaptation strategies using information from the literature or from expert consultation.
