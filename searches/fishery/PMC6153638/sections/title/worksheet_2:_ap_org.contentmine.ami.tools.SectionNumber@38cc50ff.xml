 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using Worksheet 2 (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>), participants identified new adaptation options that filled gaps in plan coverage by identifying vulnerabilities not addressed by current management actions. Using the CCAP Compendium (Parker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2017</a>; West et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2016</a>) along with the summary vulnerability assessments provided, participants converted general adaptation options into place-based actions appropriate for their management context.
 </p>
 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Guánica Bay participants reviewed the Compendium and identified additional adaptation options that would contribute to more comprehensively addressing climate change impacts, and tailored them as place-based actions specific to the Guánica Bay Watershed. For example, the group felt that sewage and waste water treatment problems are major concerns in coastal and island communities. This stimulated the identification of an action to ‘convert all homes with on-site sewage disposal systems to tertiary level waste-water treatment’.</p>
 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The West Maui participants recognized that the current plan did not include actions to address the vulnerability of coral reefs to bleaching events, such as that which occurred during the 2014–2015 El Niño. As a result, the group identified new management actions, which included expanding or duplicating herbivore replenishment areas in reefs in the five watersheds and adjacent source areas and targeting for protection those reefs with a history of exposures to multiple stressors such that they may have acclimated or adapted to challenging conditions.</p>
