 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the diverse effects of climate change have become increasingly apparent, natural resource management has grown to include adaptation to current and future climate change stressors in addition to traditional management of local stressors. One community of practice that recognized early on the need to adapt to climate change was coral reef managers. The extent and severity of increasingly frequent heat-induced mortality episodes at the global scale (Done et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" href="#CR104">2017</a>) catalyzed efforts by coral reef researchers and managers to evaluate actions to address the impacts of climate change on reefs. Early recommendations focused on accelerating the implementation of existing management plans to reduce local pressures that impair the ability of corals to withstand thermal stress, and developing coral bleaching assessment information for early detection and monitoring (Aeby et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2008</a>; Hendee et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">2000</a>). Over time, the urgent need to both adapt existing management actions and adopt new strategies became evident, not only for coral reefs (Anthony et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2016</a>; Hale et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">2009</a>). On the basis of a growing mechanistic understanding of both the direct effects of climate change and the interactions of climate change with other stressors, scientists and practitioners are striving to develop new and adapted management techniques that protect and enhance the ecological properties that underlie resilience (Allen et al.

 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, designing and implementing ‘climate-smart’ management adaptations has proven problematic for a variety of reasons. There has been increasing recognition that top-down regulatory and technology-driven responses are not sufficient to address environmental challenges that occur at multiple spatial scales, unfold over long temporal scales and have possible global implications (Grossarth and Hecht 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2007</a>). Furthermore, these challenges may be difficult to define, unstable, and socially complex, have no clear or single solution and extend beyond the understanding of one discipline or the responsibility of one organization (Bradley and Yee

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">1967</a>; National Research Council (NRC) 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">2012</a>; Rittel and Webber 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">1973</a>; Stahl 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" href="#CR86">2014</a>). To tackle such ‘wicked’ problems (Rittel and Webber 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">1973</a>), a variety of conceptual models have been used to help understand the interactions and cause-effect relationships in complex social-ecological systems in order to develop management strategies and actions (Binder et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2013</a>; Bradley and Yee 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2015</a>; Conservation Measures Partnership 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2013</a>). With the continuously growing understanding of climate change risks to coral reefs and other ecosystems, there is a need to revisit these conceptual models through a climate lens and reevaluate the appropriateness or feasibility of existing and planned management activities.
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is in this context that several critical needs were identified by the authors when working with U.S. and international practitioners in natural resource management. In particular, how do we apply climate-smart principles within our current understanding of ecosystem management to redesign and re-engineer management plans and actions to address the new realities posed by climate change? Initially, it was difficult for science and management to move beyond existing conceptual frameworks that have guided management under relatively stable climate conditions for many decades (West et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">2009</a>). As a result, management remained focused on non-climate stressors and continued to emphasize accelerated implementation. Another limitation was difficulty matching available climate change vulnerability information with management actions. Vulnerability assessments are often produced at a scope and scale (e.g., regional or national) and by individuals or groups not directly linked with natural resource management (which is generally more localized). Thus, vulnerability information has to be summarized and applied from larger scale studies that might not provide appropriate or sufficient information to inform local management. Climate change is associated with many uncertainties (e.g., climate change projections, ecosystem responses) and surprises (e.g. unanticipated threshold changes, unexpected differences in sensitivity to bleaching among coral species). Therefore, managers need a systematic method to account for unpredictable outcomes and support an adaptive management process where continual refinement and adoption of new strategies should become the norm.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the continuing crisis surrounding coral reef degradation and associated management needs at multiple scales, our initial focus for adaptation methods has been coral reef systems. At the local scale, coral reefs are threatened by a variety of anthropogenic stressors, including polluted runoff, land-use practices in adjacent watersheds, coastal development and near-shore dredging (Acevedo et al.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">2014</a>), which is increasing the force of wave action in coastal areas (Hamylton et al.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Adaptation Design Tool described in this paper was undertaken with the above challenges in mind. Availability of a specifically-applicable tool to help address climate change adaptation will enable natural resource managers to take a systematic approach and engage in more focused evaluation of interactive climate and non-climate impacts on targeted ecosystems and management actions. The Adaptation Design Tool is a product of the Corals &amp; Climate Adaptation Planning (CCAP) project, a collaborative effort of the Climate Change Working Group of the interagency U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, whose mission is to tailor and test general principles of climate-smart adaptation (Stein et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">2014</a>), specifically for coral reef management. In the first phase of the CCAP project, West et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2016</a>) developed a ‘Compendium’ of adaptation options from the literature, to help coral reef managers consider new climate-smart adaptation strategies and management actions as part of their existing management portfolios.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper, we describe the next phase of the project: the development and testing of the Adaptation Design Tool (hereafter called the Design Tool). The Design Tool consists of a structured process that is supported by worksheets (Tables 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>, 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a> and 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>), instructions and examples to help managers (1) analyze and adapt existing management actions in the context of climate-smart design, and (2) identify new adaptation options using the Compendium. The Design Tool was developed and tested over a three-year period in collaboration with coral reef managers, scientists, and practitioners. We begin by providing an overview of the Design Tool in the context of the climate-smart cycle (West et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">2016</a>), followed by a description of the basic components and workflow for using the tool (Parker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">2017</a>)
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" href="#Fn1">1</a>. The results from testing the Design Tool in two coral reef settings--Guánica Bay, Puerto Rico and West Maui, Hawai’i--are compared in order to examine similarities, differences, and lessons learned. Insights gained from this process are discussed in terms of tool effectiveness and efficiency, value-added benefits from the thought process, and overarching issues of scale and uncertainty. Conclusions highlight the tool’s role in advancing assessment theory and practice, informing higher-level strategic planning, and facilitating systematic, transparent and inclusive dialogue to address climate change vulnerabilities.
