 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two consultations with experts in coral reef and watershed management were conducted to test the draft Design Tool. The goal of the expert consultations was to solicit feedback on the use and relevance of the tool in incorporating information on climate change vulnerability into coral reef management using specific case studies. These consultations were conducted in Guánica Bay, Puerto Rico (November 2015) and West Maui, Hawaiʻi (January 2016), areas identified as priority coral reef watersheds by the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force (USCRTF). These two settings (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>) represented a range of management contexts for testing the utility of the tool. Both consultations were 1 ½ days in length, allowing for several management actions to be put through the tool.

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Guánica Bay watershed is highly modified, having been artificially increased in drainage area by a series of inter-watershed transfer channels, five reservoirs and two hydroelectric plants. It was designated as a priority watershed by the USCRTF because its associated coral reefs are threatened by extensive land-based sources of pollution. Therefore, coral reef protection and recovery efforts have a significant focus on watershed management. In 2008, the Center for Watershed Protection developed a watershed management plan (Center for Watershed Protection (CWP) 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2008</a>) outlining a comprehensive set of actions and an overall management strategy for improving and protecting the Guánica Bay watershed from pollution from land uses and alterations. In 2010–2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency held a series of stakeholder workshops that resulted in a comprehensive list of potential management actions to supplement those in the 2008 plan that was undergoing revisions (Bradley et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">2014</a>; Bradley et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2016</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In West Maui, the planning scale consists of five watersheds and adjacent reefs. Management issues recognized by USCRTF priority watershed designation include nutrient inputs from injection wells, unsustainable fishing practices, and land-based pollutant runoff. A Conservation Action Plan for the reef area itself, plus three watershed management plans, have been developed through a multi-agency effort (Barger and Clark 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2012</a>; Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2014</a>; Sustainable Resources Group International

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">2012b</a>). Planning for two additional watersheds was underway at the time of the consultation.
