 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this activity, two worksheets are used to apply climate-smart design considerations (BoxÂ 
  <a rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec5">2</a>) to existing management actions. Worksheet 1A (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>) guides coral reef managers through a series of information-gathering steps designed to address Category 1 design considerations about how climate change is expected to affect the stressor(s) that are being targeted by or accounted for in each management action. Worksheet 1B (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>) carries forward the outputs of Worksheet 1A to explore the implications of these stressor changes for the effectiveness of the management action, and consequently what adjustments are needed in location, timing, or structural design in order for it to remain effective given climate change.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The final output is captured at the end of Worksheet 1B as a redesigned version of the management action, which incorporates climate-smart design considerations. Also of key importance are insights that emerge during this thought process, which are recorded in the Notes columns of each worksheet. Documentation of reasoning, assumptions, information gaps, supporting science citations, and issues related to applying actions is of paramount importance, not only for immediate needs in design and implementation, but for future reference for adaptive management. Supplementary Output (SO) worksheets are offered to help organize this information so it can be carried forward to: inform data-gathering and research needs (SO1); and understand synergies, trade-offs and sequencing among actions (SO2), which is relevant for evaluation and selection of a final priority list. These SO worksheets are provided in the Design Tool user guide (Parker et al.
