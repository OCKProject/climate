 <result pre="using the tool helped inform the specific needs for revised" exact="climate" post="vulnerability information and thus directed attention back to Step"/>
 <result pre="through a set of management actions in the face of" exact="climate" post="change. Given the importance of setting realistic, achievable goals"/>
 <result pre="and development trajectories often have important interactions and feedbacks with" exact="climate" post="change effects, as well as critical influences on what"/>
 <result pre="ultimately what adaptation strategies are selected. In some cases, divergent" exact="climate" post="change projections for the area of interest (e.g., the"/>
 <result pre="as in the West Maui) must be considered. Uncertainty surrounding" exact="climate" post="change projections must therefore be incorporated into the Design"/>
