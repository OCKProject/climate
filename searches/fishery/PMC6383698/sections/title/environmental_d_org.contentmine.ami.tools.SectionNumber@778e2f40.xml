 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To test whether environmental conditions in the EGB could explain the observed temporal change in the proportion of the two species in GoF and AS, we looked for a relationship between the relative abundance of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the study areas and the RV in the EGB for the year in which the fish of each cohort were born (“birth year”). The RV describes the spawning and early life conditions of pelagic flounders, and is defined as the volume of water where salinity and oxygen conditions are suitable for spawning and for the survival of eggs and larvae (i.e., 10.7–12 psu and [O2] of &gt;1 ml/L). Estimates of RV calculated at bimonthly intervals for the period 1970–2005 were obtained from Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0002">2</a> in Ustups et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0064">2013</a>), for each year in which sampled fish were born. The time of the year expected to be most important in determining flounders' spawning success and propagule survival is May–June, the period during which spawning and early development occur (Bagge, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0002">1981</a>; Hinrichsen et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0027">2017</a>; Nissling, Nyberg, &amp; Petereit, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0046">2017</a>). However, environmental conditions in earlier months, when aggregation at spawning sites may start, could also be important: for example, hypoxic conditions could disturb aggregations of adult fish at spawning sites. We therefore looked for a linear relationship between the percentage of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the GoF and AS and the RV at and immediately after the time of spawning (May–June of the year of birth), as well as in the preceding (March–April) and following months (July–August), using major axis regression (reflective of the fact that both dependent and independent variables are measured with error). The same data were also analyzed using a logistic regression to determine whether there is a “threshold” in RV after which most of the individuals are likely to be 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>. In this analysis, each individual was treated as an observation (i.e., it can be either 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> or 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>): the probability of an individual being 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> was the dependent variable, while RV in the EGB was the explanatory variable. Analyses were performed separately for the two sampling locations. P‐values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Holm–Bonferroni correction. All statistical analyses were performed using the R computing environment (R Core Team, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0054">2017</a>).

    <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>. There is no linear (b) or logistic (c) relationship in the AS, while in the GoF (d), reproductive volume explained 57% of the variation in the proportion of
