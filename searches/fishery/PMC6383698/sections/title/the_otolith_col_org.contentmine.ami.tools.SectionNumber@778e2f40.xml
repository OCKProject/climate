 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The otolith collection</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the relative contribution of 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus </span>to local populations, we used selected samples from a collection of more than 29,000 flounder otoliths, which have been collected as part of sampling by the Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute (now the Finnish Natural Resources Institute, Luonnonvarakeskus, LUKE) annually from 1975 to 2011.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1975–1998, primary data were collected mainly from flounder commercial gillnet catches (mesh size 60–80 mm) and gillnet flounder by‐catches (mesh size 45–55 mm) targeted for other species (e.g., pike‐perch, perch, whitefish, and bream). Sampling was conducted as a random sampling design during the main fishing seasons (mainly year quarters 3 and 4) by sampling whole daily flounder catch/fisherman (catches varied between 10 and 50 kg per fisherman). In both areas, length and age compositions of catches and by‐catches were recorded for stock assessment. Both sagittal otoliths were sampled for age determination. This sampling scheme was connected to ICES flounder stock assessment and monitoring of the state of the flounder stocks in the Baltic.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1999–2011, the sampling scheme was changed by an internationally coordinated sampling program in order to standardize sampling between countries and areas. As before, the whole daily flounder catch/fisherman was recorded, and details of gillnets and their properties were recorded. Sample size varied between 10 and 50 kg per fisherman. A normal length‐based stratified sampling strategy was used for otoliths. The whole catch was weighted and specimens measured according to 1 cm classes. For age determination, the aim was to collect 10 otoliths/each cm length class per year quarter (quarters 3 and 4).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whole sagittal otoliths were used for age determination. All otoliths were read only by one person 1975–2004 for subdivisions 29–30 (see Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a> for a map of ICES subdivisions in the Baltic Sea) and throughout the whole sampling period for subdivision 32, to minimize age reading error. Having both sampling date and age estimate from each sample, the birth year of each individual fish could be determined. We obtained DNA from 480 individuals, representing multiple time points and cohorts within two sampling areas (see below). The rationale for selecting sampling areas and for sub‐sampling individuals are outlined in the two following sections.
