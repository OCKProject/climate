 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 444 individuals were successfully genotyped, out of which 433 were identified to species level with more than 99% probability and 439 with more than 95% probability (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0002">2</a>). If a 95% posterior probability is chosen as a threshold for assignment, only 1% of the samples remain of uncertain identity. In both the GoF and the AS, the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> was lower in contemporary samples than at the start of the time series (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0002">2</a>a). In the GoF, 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> dominated the flounder assemblage (87% of total) in 1983, had disappeared entirely in 1993, and showed low proportions (10%–11%) in 2003 and 2011 (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0002">2</a>a). In the AS, 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> was dominant throughout the sampling period (&gt;70% of total; Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0002">2</a>). In 1976, 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> contributed a larger proportion (30% of total) to the local assemblage, but this was largely due to a single cohort (40% of fish born in 1971 were 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> vs. only 18% of fish born in 1970), and already in 1983, the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> had dramatically declined and showed similarly low occurrence (2% of total) in all remaining sampling time points (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0002">2</a>a).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was a positive relationship between the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the GoF and the RV in the EGB in May–June (Holm–Bonferroni adjusted 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.042, adjusted 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.57, Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0002">2</a>d), but not with the RV in March–April and July–August (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05, Supporting information Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12738-sup-0001">S1</a>). The relationship between the RV in May–June and the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the GoF was not perfectly linear, and logistic regression analyses (Holm–Bonferroni adjusted 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 8.7 × 10
  <span class="sup">−12</span>, 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.575) suggest that when the RV in the EGB increases over 300 km
  <span class="sup">3</span>, there is an abrupt increase in the probability of sampling 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> individuals (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0002">2</a>e). As expected, there was no relationship (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05) between EGB reproductive volume and the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the AS (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0002">2</a>b,c, Supporting information Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12738-sup-0001">S1</a>). When comparing the flounder landings from the GoF (ICES, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0033">2017</a>) to the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the GoF samples, there is an almost perfect concordance between the two (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0003">3</a>), so that landings were higher at times when the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the GoF was higher, and the abrupt decline in landings closely matches in time the shift from a 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>‐dominated to 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span>‐dominated flounder assemblage.
