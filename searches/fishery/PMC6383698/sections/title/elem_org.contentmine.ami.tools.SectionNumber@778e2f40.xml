  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine the relative contribution of 
   <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> and 
   <span class="italic">P. flesus </span>to local populations, we used selected samples from a collection of more than 29,000 flounder otoliths, which have been collected as part of sampling by the Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute (now the Finnish Natural Resources Institute, Luonnonvarakeskus, LUKE) annually from 1975 to 2011.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1975–1998, primary data were collected mainly from flounder commercial gillnet catches (mesh size 60–80 mm) and gillnet flounder by‐catches (mesh size 45–55 mm) targeted for other species (e.g., pike‐perch, perch, whitefish, and bream). Sampling was conducted as a random sampling design during the main fishing seasons (mainly year quarters 3 and 4) by sampling whole daily flounder catch/fisherman (catches varied between 10 and 50 kg per fisherman). In both areas, length and age compositions of catches and by‐catches were recorded for stock assessment. Both sagittal otoliths were sampled for age determination. This sampling scheme was connected to ICES flounder stock assessment and monitoring of the state of the flounder stocks in the Baltic.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1999–2011, the sampling scheme was changed by an internationally coordinated sampling program in order to standardize sampling between countries and areas. As before, the whole daily flounder catch/fisherman was recorded, and details of gillnets and their properties were recorded. Sample size varied between 10 and 50 kg per fisherman. A normal length‐based stratified sampling strategy was used for otoliths. The whole catch was weighted and specimens measured according to 1 cm classes. For age determination, the aim was to collect 10 otoliths/each cm length class per year quarter (quarters 3 and 4).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whole sagittal otoliths were used for age determination. All otoliths were read only by one person 1975–2004 for subdivisions 29–30 (see Figure 
   <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a> for a map of ICES subdivisions in the Baltic Sea) and throughout the whole sampling period for subdivision 32, to minimize age reading error. Having both sampling date and age estimate from each sample, the birth year of each individual fish could be determined. We obtained DNA from 480 individuals, representing multiple time points and cohorts within two sampling areas (see below). The rationale for selecting sampling areas and for sub‐sampling individuals are outlined in the two following sections.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sampling areas</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two areas, representing the Åland Sea (the western Åland Archipelago; Finnish National Square 49) and the Gulf of Finland (the Helsinki area; Finnish National Squares 54/53), were selected for the study (henceforth referred to as “AS” and “GoF,” respectively; Figure 
   <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>). The two sampling locations were selected for two main reasons. First, in both areas we had access to a large number of samples obtained at multiple time points, and we were therefore able to obtain reasonable sample sizes (≥48 individuals) at regular intervals for the past decades (see next paragraph for details). Second, and most importantly, based on bathymetry and water circulation patterns (see Figure 
   <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>b,c and Supporting information Figures 
   <a rid="eva12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12738-sup-0001">S2–S5</a>) we predict that larval subsidies from the EGB are likely to be transported by currents to the GoF, but not to the AS. The low salinity precludes the possibility of pelagic spawning in both areas (Figure 
   <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>a), and hence, 
   <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> occurring in the AS and the GoF are likely to be the result of either larval subsidies or adult spillover from the EGB. 
   <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> larvae are spawned in deep waters of the EGB, and they can maintain neutral buoyancy only below the 10 psu isohaline. Initial dispersal is therefore expected to happen along deep‐water currents. Prevailing deep‐water currents in spring flow northward in the Easter Gotland Basin (Yi et al., 
   <a rid="eva12738-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0067">2013</a>). South of the Åland archipelago, the depth of the Northern Baltic Sea decreases to less than 60 m, and the deep‐water current flowing northward from the EGB is deflected eastward toward the GoF (Yi et al., 
   <a rid="eva12738-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0067">2013</a>; Figure 
   <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>b). While we do not have access to circulation data for past four decades, data from the past two decades (accessed through E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information, 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://marine.copernicus.eu/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://marine.copernicus.eu/</span>) suggest this pattern is consistent through time (see examples in Figure 
   <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>b and Supporting information Figures 
   <a rid="eva12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12738-sup-0001">S2</a>–S5). Therefore, deep‐water currents could transport pelagic propagules from southern spawning grounds into the GoF, but not to the AS. In the western Åland archipelago, there is also a prevailing and strong north to south flow of surface freshwater from the Bothnian Bay in spring (Maslowski &amp; Walczowski, 
   <a rid="eva12738-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0041">2002</a>; Yi et al., 
   <a rid="eva12738-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0067">2013</a>, see also Figure 
   <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>c and Supporting information Figures 
   <a rid="eva12738-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#eva12738-sup-0001">S2–S5</a>), which would present an additional barrier to the northward dispersal of flounder eggs and larvae.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both areas, four time points were sampled (Table 
   <a rid="eva12738-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#eva12738-tbl-0001">1</a>). These time points were chosen to ensure sampling occurred as much as possible at regular intervals within the past four decades, (a) including periods before and after the decline in landings and CPUE in the GoF in the 1980s, and (b) so that the samples’ birth years included times in which the EGB RV was very high (e.g., the late 1970s), very low (late 1980s) and somewhere in between (late 1990s and 2000s, see Ustups et al., 
   <a rid="eva12738-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0064">2013</a>). In the GoF area, we sampled the Finnish National Square 54 for every year except 1992, when the adjacent square (Finnish National Square 53) was used instead to secure the required number of samples.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We extracted DNA from a total of 480 otolith samples, aiming at a minimum number of 48 samples per area for each sampling time point. From each study area, we sampled 24 individuals from two distinct cohorts (either 4‐ and 5‐ or 5‐ and 6‐year‐old fish), with the exception of year 1983 in square 54 from which we sampled five cohorts. The 24 individual otoliths analyzed for each cohort and sampling location combinations were chosen by randomly sampling individuals for each cohort and sampling location combination available in LUKE's otolith collection. This way we obtained data for all in all 9 and 11 birth years for the AS and the GoF sampling areas, covering time periods of 1970–1998 and 1973–2007, respectively. DNA was extracted using a modified salting out procedure, optimized for otolith samples (see protocol in the Supporting information).</p>

The time of the year expected to be most important in determining flounders' spawning success and propagule survival is May–June, the period during which spawning and early development occur (Bagge, 
   <a rid="eva12738-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0002">1981</a>; Hinrichsen et al., 
   <a rid="eva12738-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0027">2017</a>; Nissling, Nyberg, &amp; Petereit, 
   <a rid="eva12738-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0046">2017</a>). However, environmental conditions in earlier months, when aggregation at spawning sites may start, could also be important: for example, hypoxic conditions could disturb aggregations of adult fish at spawning sites. We therefore looked for a linear relationship between the percentage of 
   <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the GoF and AS and the RV at and immediately after the time of spawning (May–June of the year of birth), as well as in the preceding (March–April) and following months (July–August), using major axis regression (reflective of the fact that both dependent and independent variables are measured with error). The same data were also analyzed using a logistic regression to determine whether there is a “threshold” in RV after which most of the individuals are likely to be 
   <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>. In this analysis, each individual was treated as an observation (i.e., it can be either 
   <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> or 
   <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>): the probability of an individual being 
   <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> was the dependent variable, while RV in the EGB was the explanatory variable. Analyses were performed separately for the two sampling locations. P‐values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Holm–Bonferroni correction. All statistical analyses were performed using the R computing environment (R Core Team,
