 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unobserved genetic diversity, whether in the form of within‐species genetic structuring or of the presence of cryptic species (morphologically indistinguishable biological groups incapable of interbreeding), is of major importance for the conservation and management of global biodiversity in the age of rapid environmental changes (Bickford et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0008">2007</a>; Dirzo et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0019">2014</a>). Biodiversity assessment at the level of morphospecies (species that can be distinguished by quantifiable morphological characteristics) is likely to greatly underestimate species diversity across taxonomic groups and biogeographic regions (Pfenninger &amp; Schwenk, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0051">2007</a>), and thus hamper the estimate of biodiversity loss due to environmental changes (Bálint et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0003">2011</a>). Unveiling hidden genetic structure resulting from local adaptation (Benestan et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0006">2015</a>; Bradbury et al.,

  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0052">2011</a>) and cryptic speciation (Bradbury et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0010">2014</a>, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0011">2010</a>; Fennessy et al.,

  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0044">2017b</a>) is important in the delineation of conservation and management units for exploited or threatened species (Funk et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0024">2012</a>), as well as for the identification of suitable protected areas that maximize biodiversity representativeness and complementarity (Cook, Page, &amp; Hughes, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0017">2008</a>). Cryptic species complexes that consist of rare or threatened taxa are especially vulnerable, as each taxon can be even rarer or more threatened than the one nominal unit being considered and may respond differently to environmental change (Schönrogge et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0057">2002</a>). Unveiling cryptic species and populations also enables more accurate estimates of taxon‐specific biological traits (e.g., Feckler et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0021">2014</a>) that determine resilience to environmental change and exploitation (Hilborn, Quinn, Schindler, &amp; Rogers, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0026">2003</a>). The presence of cryptic taxa poses serious challenges to understanding the causes and effects of population change, since it can confound our understanding of past and present demographic changes, source–sink dynamics, population connectivity, and trophic interactions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unobserved genetic diversity has especially important implications for the management of exploited marine resources. Fishery management has been based on the assessment of stocks, usually defined as genetically homogeneous and demographically independent populations which were often unrealistically assumed to have clear and temporally stable geographic boundaries (Begg, Friedland, &amp; Pearce, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0004">1999</a>). The past three decades of fishery research demonstrate that this is seldom the case: single‐species fisheries may exploit multiple, demographically independent but morphologically indistinguishable stocks that at times co‐occur in the same geographic location (Bonanomi et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0009">2015</a>; Campana, Chouinard, Hanson, &amp; Fréchet, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0014">1999</a>; Jónsdóttir, Marteinsdottir, &amp; Campana, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0036">2007</a>; Lindegren, Waldo, Nilsson, Svedäng, &amp; Persson, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0040">2013</a>; Schuchert, Arkhipkin, &amp; Koenig, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0058">2010</a>). A failure to recognize this unobserved diversity can lead to overestimated maximum sustainable yields, and therefore to overharvest of the more vulnerable stock components (Hutchinson, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0031">2008</a>; Sterner, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0061">2007</a>). Examples of mixed‐stock fisheries include the cod fisheries in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Ruzzante, Taggart, Lang, &amp; Cook, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0056">2000</a>) and the Kattegat (Lindegren et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0040">2013</a>), which were traditionally considered as single‐stock fisheries but turned out to be mixtures of stocks that aggregate during feeding but segregate during spawning.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences between stock components may be behavioral (e.g., different spawning ecotypes) and/or genetic (locally adapted populations) instead of clearly morphological and are therefore likely to be overlooked by fishery managers and fishermen (Reiss, Hoarau, Dickey‐Collas, &amp; Wolff, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0055">2009</a>). Furthermore, cryptic species or unrecognized populations of the same species within a mixed‐stock fishery may respond differently to fishing pressure and to natural and anthropogenic environmental change, leading to undetected spatiotemporal shifts in their relative contribution to local stocks (Bonanomi et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0009">2015</a>). Such processes may lead to dramatic fishery collapse, as demonstrated in a recent study on the West Greenland cod fishery (Bonanomi et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0009">2015</a>). Using diagnostic SNPs genotyped from archived samples, Bonanomi et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0009">2015</a>) reconstructed the spatiotemporal relative contribution of two biologically distinct (but morphologically indistinguishable) major stock components: the local and cold‐adapted West Greenland offshore cod population and the Iceland offshore cod population, the contribution of the latter being correlated with higher sea surface temperature (SST). The authors revealed that the collapse of the West Greenland cod fishery in the 1970s was the result of the gradual disappearance of the local West Greenland offshore population (due to overfishing), and the subsequent decline of Iceland offshore cod due to a period of unfavorable (colder) SST.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact that separate stock components may respond very differently to environmental change and fishing pressure is of concern in the age of rapid climate change (Hoegh‐Guldberg &amp; Bruno, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0030">2010</a>), coastal eutrophication (Smith, Tilman, &amp; Nekola, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0059">1999</a>), and overfishing (Pauly, Christensen, Dalsgaard, Froese, &amp; Torres, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0050">1998</a>). Spatiotemporal tracking of the contribution of different genetic populations to mixed‐stock fisheries (Bonanomi et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0009">2015</a>; Dahle, Johansen, Westgaard, Aglen, &amp; Glover, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0018">2018</a>; Ruzzante et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0056">2000</a>) may therefore play a pivotal role in future adaptive management aimed at avoiding further fishery collapse that may be only partially dependent on local fishing pressure and may be affected by environmental changes occurring in spawning areas hundreds of kilometers away from the fishing grounds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Flounders (
  <span class="italic">Platichthys</span> spp.) in the Baltic Sea show two distinct reproductive strategies: offshore spawning of pelagic eggs and coastal spawning of demersal eggs (Nissling, Westin, &amp; Hjerne, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0047">2002</a>; Solemdal, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0060">1967</a>). Pelagic spawning occurs exclusively in deep offshore basins of the southern and central Baltic Sea (
  <span class="italic">viz</span>. the Arkona Basin, the Bornholm Basin, and the Eastern Gotland Basin) where salinity is sufficiently high (&gt;11 psu, see Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>a) for eggs to achieve neutral buoyancy (Nissling et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0047">2002</a>). Flounders with demersal eggs can spawn successfully in salinities as low as 6 psu (Nissling et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0047">2002</a>), in conditions routinely encountered in coastal waters of the Northern Baltic Proper (NBP) and the Gulf of Finland (GoF).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a recent study, Momigliano et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0044">2017b</a>) demonstrated that Baltic Sea flounders with pelagic and demersal eggs are a pair of closely related species arising from two independent colonization events of the Baltic Sea from the same ancestral population following the end of the last glaciation. The Baltic Sea flounders with demersal eggs have since been officially described as a new species: the Baltic flounder 
  <span class="italic">Platichthys solemdali</span> (Momigliano, Denys, Jokinen, &amp; Merilä, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0042">2018</a>). Based on studies from the past decade, European (
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>) and Baltic (
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span>) flounders are considered parapatric, with both species co‐occurring in some areas of the central Baltic Sea. For example, the species meet around Gotland, which is assumed to be the northern limit of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>’ distribution (Florin &amp; Höglund, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0023">2008</a>; Hinrichsen et al.,

  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0047">2002</a>), and at the southwestern entrance of the Gulf of Riga, where 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> co‐occur in similar proportions (Momigliano et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0044">2017b</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two flounder species are fished throughout the Baltic Sea, where they are caught both as by‐catch in the cod fishery and directly targeted using gillnets. In 2014, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) convened the Benchmark Workshop on Baltic Flatfish Stocks (WKBALFLAT, ICES, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0032">2014</a>), which separated the Baltic flounder fishery into four assessment and management units: ICES subdivisions (SDs) 22–23, SDs 24–25, SDs 26 and 28, and SDs 27 and 29–32 (see Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>a for a map of ICES SDs). The first three are assumed to be dominated by 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus </span>(but it is recognized that both species co‐occur in SD 28), while the flounder fishery in the Northern Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Finland (SD 27 and SDs 29–32) is considered a single stock of 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali </span>with no significant contribution 
  <span class="italic">of P. flesus. </span>Within SD 27 and 29–32, most of the fishing effort is concentrated in two areas: the Åland Sea (AS, the northwestern part of SD 29 between the Åland Archipelago and the Swedish coast, Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>a) and the Gulf of Finland (the entire SD32, Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>a), where flounders are targeted mainly by Estonian and Finnish fishing fleets (ICES, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0032">2014</a>). In the past ten years, catches in SD 27 and 29–32 averaged at approximately 200 tonnes per year (t/y), but in the first few years for which yearly estimates are available (1980–1984), catch estimates were above 1,500 t/y and started to decline in the second half of the 1980s. The most dramatic decline in landings took place in the GoF: In the early 1980s, more than 1,000 t/y were landed, whereas in the last ten years, landings averaged below 100 t/y (ICES, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0033">2017</a>). While there are some doubts on how reliable catch estimates in the 1980s were, particularly from the USSR, catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from fish surveys on the Finnish coast confirm a decrease of over 60% from 1975 to 1995, and over 90% decrease from 1975 to 2012 (Jokinen et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0034">2015</a>), suggesting that the temporal decline in landings was not entirely a reflection of inaccurate reporting or lower fishing effort.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Momigliano et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0042">2018</a>, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0044">2017b</a>) discovered that 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> can, in fact, be found at low density throughout the NBP (including the AS) and the GoF, and that they do not interbreed with 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> (both studies found no evidence of hybridization in &gt;300 individuals sampled throughout the Baltic Sea). The co‐occurrence of both species has been likely overlooked because 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> can only be distinguished based on genetic data, gamete morphology, and physiological differences that cannot be routinely assessed by fishers and managers (Momigliano et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0042">2018</a>). One explanation for the occurrence of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus </span>in the AS and GoF, where there are no suitable spawning grounds (Figure 
  <a rid="eva12738-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#eva12738-fig-0001">1</a>a), is that these locations are “sinks” (Pulliam, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0053">1988</a>; Underwood &amp; Fairweather, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0063">1989</a>), sourced through either larval subsidies or adult spillover from spawning grounds in the central Baltic Sea—as is the case for cods in the Gulfs of Finland and Riga (Aro, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0001">1989</a>; Casini et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0016">2012</a>). This discovery raises the question of what the historical contribution of immigration from southern spawning grounds to local flounder stocks in the AS and GoF was, and whether changes in immigration of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> from more productive areas in the central Baltic Sea may be related to local declines in the GoF (Jokinen et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0034">2015</a>; Jokinen, Wennhage, Ollus, Aro, &amp; Norkko,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the northernmost spawning ground for 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>, the Eastern Gotland Basin (EGB), the reproductive volume (RV, i.e., the volume of water where [O
  <sub>2</sub>] and salinity are suitable for spawning) fluctuates through time based on changes in salinity and oxygen content following major saltwater influxes and stagnation periods (Hinrichsen et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0027">2017</a>; Nissling et al.,

  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0064">2013</a>). At the same time, eutrophication and climate change are causing a rapid increase in hypoxia and anoxia in bottom waters of the Baltic Sea (Carstensen, Andersen, Gustafsson, &amp; Conley, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0015">2014</a>). Consequently, the suitable spawning habitat of

This could have reduced larval subsidies and adult spillover to the Gulf of Finland, thus providing a plausible explanation for the declining trend seen in this area. However, changes in local environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, salinity) affecting reproduction of 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> in the GoF and a decline in habitat quality of local nursery areas have also been suggested as potential causes of recent local declines in the Gulf of Finland (Jokinen et al.,

  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0044">2017b</a>). Our main aim was to test for possible temporal changes in stock composition in coastal areas of the Northern Baltic Sea. In particular, we explored the hypothesis that 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> from the EGB are a source population seeding the GoF, and that past fluctuations in stock size were influenced by environmental changes in geographically distant source populations. Specifically, we wanted to know how the relative proportions of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> have changed over time in the study region, and how these changes relate to RV in the EGB. To this end, we reconstructed the relative proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> over the past four decades in two locations, one likely to receive larval subsidies from the EGB (GoF), and another that is less likely to receive larval subsidies (AS) given the prevailing water current patterns in the Baltic (Maslowski &amp; Walczowski, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0041">2002</a>). We hypothesized that if larval subsidies of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> from the central Baltic are an important factor in the demographics of flounders in the GoF: (a) the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the GoF, but not in the AS, should be correlated with environmental conditions favorable to pelagic spawning in the EGB, (b) there should be a temporal decrease in the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the GoF reflecting worsening environmental conditions in the central Baltic Sea, and (c) this temporal trend should coincide in time with the reported stock decline in GoF.
