 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We employed a Bayesian approach where the probability of a fish to be assigned to one species is calculated as a function of its genotype and prior belief that the sample belongs to a given species; this probability is then updated as more genetic tests are performed in succession. The very same Bayesian approach has been used by Toli, Calboli, Shikano, and Merilä (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0062">2016</a>) for sex identification after multiple consecutive genetic tests, and the full conceptual framework and the mathematical formulation of this approach are detailed in that paper. Because every sample can be drawn from two possible species, calculating the probability that a sample has been drawn from one immediately provides also the probability that the sample has been drawn from the other, because 
  <span class="italic">p</span>
  <span class="italic">(P. solemdali</span>) = 1 – 
  <span class="italic">p</span> (
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Briefly, we determined the allelic and genotypic frequencies at five loci for 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus </span>and 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> based on 235 samples (128 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> and 107 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>) whose species identities had been previously determined with certainty (see Momigliano et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0044">2017b</a>; data available from Momigliano et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0045">2017c</a>); this information provided us with the specificity and sensitivity of each genotype for attributing each sample to one (or the other) species using the approach described by Toli et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0062">2016</a>). We chose a conservative (uninformative) prior of 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.5, and we used the genotype of the sample at a first locus and its relative frequency in the two species to calculate a posterior probability that the sample was drawn from 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span>. This posterior probability was then used as the prior for the next test, based on the sample's genotype at the next marker and its relative frequency in the two species. The result of this calculation was then an updated posterior probability that the sample belongs to 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span>. This iterative process was carried for all subsequent genetic tests, allowing us to update and refine the posterior probability. Samples whose final posterior probability of being 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> was 1 (or close to one) can be considered as the demersal‐spawning species with a high degree of confidence, and samples whose final posterior probability of being 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> was 0 (or close to 0) could be confidently identified as 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>.
