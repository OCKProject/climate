 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five SNPs (SNPs 3556_15, 1822_9, 3599_4, 4474_34, and 886_19) that had been previously identified as under divergent selection in the two species (Momigliano et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0044">2017b</a>) and able to unambiguously assign unknown individuals to the correct species (Momigliano et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0042">2018</a>) were genotyped using a SNaPshot™ Multiplex Kit (Thermo Fisher). All loci were amplified in a single, multiplexed PCR using the primers developed by Momigliano et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0042">2018</a>) targeting the regions flanking the outlier loci (GenBank Accession numbers: KY933571–KY933582) sequenced by Momigliano et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0044">2017b</a>). The primers target very short DNA fragments (~100 bp in length), enabling amplification from highly degraded DNA recovered from otoliths. SNPs were genotyped using the SNaPshot™ probes designed by Momigliano et al. (
