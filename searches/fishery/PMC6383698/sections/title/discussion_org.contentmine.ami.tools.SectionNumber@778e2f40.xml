 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has long been assumed that only demersal‐spawning flounders (
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span>) occur in the GoF and that the two species only co‐exist in the Central Baltic Sea (ICES, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0033">2017</a>). Our results demonstrate that, as was suggested by Momigliano et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0044">2017b</a>; 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0042">2018</a>), this is not the case. Both species co‐occur in the AS and the GoF, and at different times, either species can dominate local assemblages. There was a major temporal shift in the relative proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> in the GoF that was correlated with changes in environmental conditions in the EGB (Nissling et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0047">2002</a>; Ustups et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0064">2013</a>). In the GoF, 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> made up the overwhelming majority of the flounders in all the cohorts from 1973 to 1979, and since the late 1980s, they consistently contributed to less than 10% of the individuals (see also: Florin &amp; Höglund, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0023">2008</a>, Momigliano et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0044">2017b</a>, Momigliano et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0042">2018</a>). These results reveal that the flounders of the GoF not only do not represent a single entity and fishery stock, but are indeed a mixture of two distinct species, each of which can dominate local assemblages at different points in time. These results highlight the fact that defining fishery stocks and management and conservation units based exclusively on the contemporary distribution of ecological and genetic diversity may lead to erroneous assessment, as this may represent a snapshot in time of a complex, dynamic picture.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The shift from 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus‐</span> to 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span>‐dominated assemblages coincides with the timing of the decline in GoF landings (ICES, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0033">2017</a>), as well as with a sharp decline in flounder CPUE in fishery‐independent Finnish coastal fish surveys between 1975 and 1995 (Jokinen et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0034">2015</a>). Since salinity in the GoF is too low for 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> reproduction even under the most favorable conditions (Nissling et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0047">2002</a>), these findings suggest that either larval supply or juvenile and adult spillover from southern populations may have been important factors in shaping flounder abundance in the GoF. The fact that a similar temporal shift was not observed in the AS, which is not reached by northward deep‐water currents from the EGB and where the prevailing surface currents flow southward and therefore are unlikely to carry larval subsidies from the south, brings further support to the hypothesis that changes in larval supply, rather than reduced adult spillover, are the main underlying cause of the shift from 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> to 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> dominance in the GoF. The observed change in the relative contribution of the two flounder species could also be explained by an increase in the local population of 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span>. However, this is unlikely, since the shift in dominance from 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> to 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> has happened against the backdrop of an overall decline in flounder landings and CPUE in the GoF (ICES, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0033">2017</a>; Jokinen et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0034">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A previous study demonstrated that larval abundance of flounders in the EGB is correlated with both spawning stock biomass (SSB) and RV (Ustups et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0064">2013</a>). The authors found no correlation between larval supply and recruitment in the EGB, suggesting that recruitment was regulated at the post‐settlement stage (Ustups et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0064">2013</a>). However, only a small proportion of the larvae released in the EGB would eventually be transported to the GoF, and hence, it would not be surprising if recruitment of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus </span>in the GoF was supply‐limited. Recruitment in flatfish is usually a reflection of density‐independent factors affecting egg and larvae at the local scale (Leggett &amp; Frank, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0039">1997</a>), and shows higher variation close to the species’ distribution margin. Density‐dependent processes in the phase immediately following settlement, such as competition for space and resources in overcrowded nurseries, may also play an important role in regulating recruitment and dampening inter‐annual variability (Beverton, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0007">1995</a>). However, when larval supply is low, density‐dependent mortality within nurseries becomes less important and recruitment is mostly a result of density‐independent mortality during the egg and larval stages (Van der Veer, Berghahn, Miller, &amp; Rijnsdorp, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0065">2000</a>). Jokinen et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0035">2016</a>) discovered that contemporary juvenile densities in the Finnish coast are much lower than those at the end of the 1970s and in the early 1980s. They hypothesized that a combination of disturbed larval supply and decreasing nursery quality due to eutrophication was the underlying cause of reduced recruitment (Jokinen et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0035">2016</a>). Our results are consistent with this hypothesis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marine populations are almost always open, and fluctuations in larval supply can have important effects on local population dynamics (Caley et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0013">1996</a>; Doherty, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0020">1982</a>; Underwood &amp; Fairweather, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0063">1989</a>). Changes in environmental conditions in spawning grounds for 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> could affect larval supply to the GoF, but would not affect local populations of 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span>, and therefore provide a likely explanation for the patterns observed in this study. However, environmental conditions in the EGB are only one of the factors that are likely to shape recruitment of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus </span>to the GoF. Fluctuations in SSB in the EGB and changes in deep‐water currents at the time of spawning are also expected to affect, respectively, the number of larvae produced and the proportion of larvae that would reach the GoF. Unfortunately, SSB estimates for the EGB are only available from some of the years from which we have sampled cohorts (Hinrichsen et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0027">2017</a>; Orio et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0049">2017</a>; Ustups et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0064">2013</a>). Therefore, we were unable to explore the possible relationship between SSB and the decline of the proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> in the GoF. Similarly, it is possible that deep‐water currents have changed through time, affecting larval transport to the GoF, but we do not have access to data on water velocity preceding 1993. Hence, the readers should be aware of the fact that these potentially important factors may also have changed over time and be correlated with the RV in the EGB. Therefore, while the hypothesis put forward in this study is plausible and supported by the available data, further work will be needed to reach a definitive conclusion on the causes of the cessation of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> larval subsidies to the GoF.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timing of the shift from 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>‐dominated to 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span>‐dominated assemblages in the GoF closely mirrors the rise and fall in cod biomass in the Gulf of Riga (GoR) (Casini et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0016">2012</a>). As the GoF for the 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span>, the GoR is a “true sink” habitat for cod as there are no suitable spawning grounds. Cod biomass in the GoR increased in the decade 1977–1987 as a result of a combination of larval supply from the Baltic proper as well as by active migration of juveniles and adults, but as soon as environmental conditions in the Baltic Proper became unfavorable, cod almost entirely disappeared from the GoR (Casini et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0016">2012</a>). A similar pattern was also seen in the GoF cod (e.g., Aro, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0001">1989</a>). Cod eggs require higher salinity than 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus’ </span>eggs (&gt;13 
  <span class="italic">vs.</span> &gt;10 psu), yet both cod's and 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus’ </span>RV in the EGB greatly increased following the multiple inflows of high salinity, oxygen saturated waters (MBI, Major Baltic Inflow) from the North Sea into the deep Baltic Sea basins in the 1970s (Karaseva &amp; Zezera, 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0037">2016</a>; Nissling et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0047">2002</a>). Hinrichsen et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0027">2017</a>; 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0028">2018</a>) used a hydrodynamic model coupled with Lagrangian simulations to estimate the effect of fluctuating [O
  <sub>2</sub>] and salinity on flounder reproductive success and egg and larval survival in the central Baltic. The authors discovered that the EGB had the highest intra‐ and inter‐annual variability in spawning success as well as egg and larval survival, and that while most released larvae are locally retained, propagules from the EGB are also transported northward (though the GoF was not included in their simulations). Altogether, these results suggest that fluctuations in environmental conditions in the EGB may have far‐reaching effects in shaping the abundance of important fishery stocks in the GoR and the GoF.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jokinen et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0034">2015</a>) discovered that the flounder stock on the Finnish coast has declined dramatically (75%–95% drop in abundance) since 1975. The first decline (60%) occurred in the period 1975–1997, coinciding with the temporal shift in dominance from 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> to 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span> observed in this study. The subsequent decline, which largely happened in the early 2000s, likely reflects the decline of 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali</span>, which reproduce locally and are better adapted to the low salinity conditions of the GoF (Nissling et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0047">2002</a>). Jokinen et al. (
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0035">2016</a>) found a negative correlation between vegetation cover in shallow nurseries and juvenile flatfish occurrence, suggesting that eutrophication has decreased the value of local nurseries. This interpretation suggests that we are not witnessing the gradual decline of a single flounder stock, but rather the successive decline of two distinct, closely related species of flounders. This scenario bears resemblance to cases of fishery collapse caused by the successive disappearance of previously unobserved, demographically independent stock components, such as the collapse of the West Greenland cod fishery (Bonanomi et al., 
  <a rid="eva12738-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#eva12738-bib-0009">2015</a>). It is not entirely clear whether the low proportion of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> and the low commercial landings and CPUE recorded in the past three decades in the GoF are symptoms of a transient phase of unfavorable environmental conditions or are entirely a result of anthropogenic habitat degradation. Nevertheless, these results raise concern over the future of 
  <span class="italic">P. flesus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">P. solemdali </span>in the GoF.
