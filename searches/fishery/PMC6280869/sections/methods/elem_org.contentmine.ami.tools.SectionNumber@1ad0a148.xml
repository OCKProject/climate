  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Identifying components of resilience relevant for PHE and integrated development programming</div>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand better which components contribute to building resilience in the context of PHE programming, we conducted an extensive literature review and interviewed PHE practitioners (Meyers and Hardee 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2017</a>; PRB 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">2016</a>). Based on these reviews and a 2016 expert meeting held in Arusha, Tanzania, we identified a number of broad components of resilience for which questions can be added to quantitative and qualitative surveys conducted as part of PHE projects. We sought to quantify resilience to shocks that households in economically and geographically isolated regions adjacent to protected areas typically face and often have to resolve on their own: health crises (e.g., cholera outbreaks), food insecurity, and natural resources management within the context of climate change. Because this research was linked to the Tuungane Project’s planned 2016 household survey, we focused on indicators of resilience that can be measured at the family or household level. We were interested in how people cope with environmental change. Eight initial components and their hypothesized linkages to resilience in the context of integrated PHE programming were social capital/social cohesion (engagement, participation, trust, and support); natural resources management (protecting and rebuilding resources); livelihoods and food security (multiple income sources, caloric intake, food reserves); water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) (public health infrastructure); health (physical ability to respond to a crisis); education (information access and processing); knowledge of and experience with climate change (increasing adaptive capacity); and attitudes toward population growth (perceived population pressure on ecological sustainability and community wellbeing).

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the literature, we hypothesized that there would be a positive link between resilience and family planning plus access to reproductive health care.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Survey and sample</div>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data come from a 2016 cross-sectional survey of 1010 households in 16 villages near the Mahale Mountains National Park in western Tanzania along the coastline of Lake Tanganyika (Hess et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2017</a>). The 16 villages formed the survey sample frame, and the sample division over these villages was proportional to the village size (number of households). Tanzanian villages are administratively divided into sub-villages, and for logistical and cost reasons, two sub-villages were selected per village (each village had between three and eight sub-villages). If a village directly bordered Lake Tanganyika, one lake side and one inland sub-village were selected, with the village sample divided over the selected sub-villages proportional to the combined population size of all coastal and inland sub-villages in that village. Complete household lists of the selected sub-villages were drawn up from which households were randomly selected.
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the purpose of this research, a household was defined as a group of people who live together and usually share their food. The average household size was 6.2 people, and 17% of households were female headed. Children under age 15 comprised 52% of the household population in the sample. A majority of household heads (60%) completed primary school or more, while nearly a quarter (22%) of household heads did not have any formal education.</p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interviews were conducted using computer-aided personal interviewing (CAPI). The survey instrument included an overall household section and a reproductive health section. The former was answered by one adult household member, preferably the household head, with sufficient knowledge about the household. Nearly half the respondents to this section were male (49%); at the time of the interview, they were 39 years old on average; respondents were the household head (in 60% of the interviews), his or her spouse (31%), a child of the household head (6%), or another household member (3%). The reproductive health section was answered by one female household member between 18 and 49 years old, if present in the household and available. The reproductive health section was completed in 767 households (76% of the sample); respondents were the spouse of the household head (74%), the household head herself (9%), a child of the household head (10%), or another household member (7%). Sometimes, the same respondent answered both sections of the questionnaire. Most of the households without reproductive health section interviews had no eligible female household members (61%). For the remainder, the reasons for not conducting the section interview were not documented. Because refusal rates for the overall interview were very low (1%), it is assumed that refusal was rare and the unavailability of eligible female household members was the primary reason. As much as possible, the interviews were conducted privately to avoid bias, especially the reproductive health section. Enumerators recorded that 95% of these section interviews were not overheard.</p>

  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the components of resilience identified above as a guide, and with all of the components in the analysis relating to those theorized prior to the survey, in this section, we describe the variables used to measure the different components of resilience, as well as variables used to measure family planning. For consistency, we use the headings of the final components of resilience in the model described below. Differences between the theorized and final components are explained below and in the findings section. The modeling was an iterative process in which different variables and components were tested. All examined variables and components that were tested are described in this section; Table

    <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure the livelihoods and assets dimension of this construct, respondents were asked about the

Female respondents of the reproductive health section were asked whether they slept under a mosquito net the night before the interview. Other health variables that were considered as additional proxies for health behavior include general disease prevalence, malaria incidence, and measles immunization for children. However, general disease prevalence did not correlate highly with any other health variable, and neither malaria incidence nor measles immunization for children had enough variation to sufficiently discriminate between groups and therefore could not be used in the analysis. Although our health component may not capture the full importance of health behavior within resilience, we elected to include the above proxy as we did not want our model to imply that health behavior is not important for resilience.

This factor included both family planning and maternal and child health care because health and development programming commonly integrates these two services. Respondents were asked whether they 
    <span class="italic">know what family planning is</span>, whether they 
    <span class="italic">approve of using family planning</span>, whether their household had

    <span class="italic">Unmet need for family planning</span> is a composite indicator and was determined through a series of questions in the reproductive health section, e.g., the desire to avoid pregnancy, the use of contraceptives, marital status, and fecundity. The indicator was calculated following Bradley et al. (

Model households are volunteer households that receive training around health, hygiene, the environment, and the relationship between these issues, and then serve as peer educators in their community. Finally, whether a household’s village was located in the project’s northern or southern areas was also included as a control variable to capture differences in remoteness, ethnic makeup, and livelihoods of the areas.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analytic strategy</div>
  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to measure the hypothesized components of resilience, as well as resilience itself. CFA is a theory-driven analysis of the relationships between observed variables that tests whether the covariance matrix of the observed data matches the covariance matrix of a hypothesized model (Schreiber et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2006</a>). Using this approach, it is possible to estimate exogenous latent constructs that are shared by a set of observed variables, which are considered endogenous or determined by the latent construct. In a structural equation modeling framework (SEM), CFA is also called a measurement model. Besides measurement models, SEM also allows the estimation of structural models, which estimate relationships between latent and observed variables using regression. The goal of measurement and structural models in SEM is to minimize the difference between the covariance matrix of the hypothesized model and the actual covariance matrix of the observed data. In addition to allowing us to model the complex relationships hypothesized in our model, SEM also allows us to estimate unbiased coefficients despite potential multicollinearity (see Appendix Table 
   <a rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" href="#Tab5">5</a> for the correlation matrix). SEM models require sufficient sample size, with a minimum of 10 observations for each estimated parameter (Schreiber et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">2006</a>). In our most complex model, we estimate 74 parameters. With a sample size of 1010, we have a ratio of observations to parameters of 13.7:1.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We followed a two-step process to develop a comprehensive measure of resilience using CFA. First, we estimated first-order measurement models for each multi-item construct that was hypothesized to be a component of resilience (i.e., 
   <span class="italic">social cohesion–participation; natural resource protection attitudes; food security and livelihoods and assets; water, sanitation, and hygiene; and climate change awareness</span>). We repeated the same process to create a measurement model of 
   <span class="italic">family planning and access to MCH care</span>. Second, we estimated a second-order measurement model that incorporates the aforementioned first-order measurement models of the components of resilience, as well as three observed variables (i.e., adult use of mosquito bed nets, women’s highest education level, and changed behavior due to climate change).
  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once satisfactory measurement models had been fitted, we used SEM to examine the association between 
   <span class="italic">resilience</span> and 
   <span class="italic">family planning and access to MCH care</span>. We also tested the hypothesized structural model with the inclusion of all covariates. Finally, we examined the direct association between 
   <span class="italic">family planning and access to MCH care</span> and each individual component of resilience to assess whether an association with a particular component of resilience is driving the overall relationship.
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All measurement and structural models were estimated using Mplus 6.1 (Muthén and Muthén 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2012</a>) with maximum likelihood estimation using weighted least squares estimators using a diagonal matrix with robust standard errors and the Satorra–Bentler chi-squared test for model fit. This estimation approach is most appropriate for models that include binary or ordered categorical dependent variables, as well as non-normally distributed continuous data, as is the case in our models (Brown 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2006</a>; Savalei 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">2014</a>). Pairwise deletion was used to address missing data, which uses information from any observation with available data for both variables in a pair to estimate the correlation matrix. While pairwise deletion results in different numbers of observations being used for different parts of a model, this approach maximizes the data available. This approach is adequate when data are missing at random (MAR), that is, when missingness is explained by observed variables (Allison 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2001</a>). Given that the vast majority of missingness is related to whether households participated in the reproductive health section, this is a reasonable assumption.
  </p>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all measurement and structural models, model fit was evaluated using a combination of three model fit statistics, since each goodness-of-fit statistic operates on different assumptions (Hoyle and Panter 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">1995</a>). The comparative fit index (CFI; Gentler 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1990</a>) ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfectly fitted model. Values of 0.9 or higher signify good model fit (Bollen 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">1989</a>; Hoyle and Panter 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">1995</a>). The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was also used in this study, and values below 0.05 are considered evidence of good model fit (Browne and Dudek 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">1993</a>). Also presented here is the 
   <span class="italic">χ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> statistic; a non-significant value indicates good model fit. However, the 
   <span class="italic">χ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> statistic is sensitive to sample size and the large sample size of this study renders this statistic largely undiagnostic. Therefore, the 
   <span class="italic">χ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> ratio (
   <span class="italic">χ</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span>/df) is also presented, as this adjusts for sample size. Good fit is indicated by a

   <span class="sup">2</span> ratio between 1 and 3 (Arbuckle and Wothke
