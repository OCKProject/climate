 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interest in enhancing the resilience of individuals, households, and communities to contend with climate change-induced and other shocks and stressors in lower- and middle-income countries is growing (Mancini and Bowen 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2009</a>; Field et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2014</a>; Meyers and Hardee 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2017</a>), as is interest in measuring resilience (Quinlan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2014</a>). Resilience has a range of definitions and operates at different scales, but it is generally understood as the ability of an individual, household, community, or system to cope with shocks and stressors, which can be environmental, by responding in ways that maintain their essential functions while expanding their capacity to adapt to change (Folke et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2010</a>; Field et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">2014</a>; UNISDR 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">2007</a>; Walker et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">2004</a>). Social and ecological resilience are distinct, but closely linked in literature, particularly in rural areas where communities are reliant upon natural resources for their livelihoods (Adger 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2000</a>; Folke et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2010</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a growing literature on what resilience looks like in practice. In social systems, networks between friends and family, community organization members, and citizens and institutions help build resilience (Adger 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2000</a>; Aldrich and Meyer 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2014</a>). Resilient ecological systems contain a diversity of flora and fauna that can adapt to environmental changes (Adger 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2000</a>; Gunderson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2000</a>). In social–ecological systems, resilience-building practices include adaptive governance (Karpouzoglou et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">2016</a>), ecosystem management (Virapongse et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">2016</a>), and disaster risk management (Collier et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2009</a>). When social and ecological systems are resilient, they can more readily recover from environmental change and shocks, avoid recurring crises, and develop sustainably (Adger 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2000</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increased attention to the concept of resilience has inspired research into how to best build people’s resilience and ascertain which factors contribute to enhancing resilience. Existing frameworks of resilience have largely ignored the role of population dynamics and the potential for family planning and better reproductive health care to contribute to resilience (Malone 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2009</a>; Bremner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2015</a>; Bietsch et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016</a>; Meyers and Hardee 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2017</a>; Sathar et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">2018</a>). However, one exception is USAID’s Program Guidance for Resilience, which states that meeting the unmet need for family planning may be a necessary part of a larger strategy to build resilience (USAID 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">2012</a>). Furthermore, family planning has been mentioned as a key component in reaching sustainable development goals (Starbird et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">2016</a>) and as a factor that works on multiple levels to shift people’s ability to adapt to crises, including environmental and climate changes (Smith and Woodward 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">2014</a>; Husain et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2016</a>; Bremner et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While research indicates that integrating family planning and improved reproductive health care into sectors known to contribute to resilience, such as natural resources management, livelihoods, food security, nutrition, and water resources, could further increase that resilience (De Souza 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2014</a>; Crist et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2017</a>; Naik and Smith 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">2015</a>; Smith and Smith 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">2015</a>; Patterson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2018</a>), establishing and measuring the pathways through which resilience is enhanced and the links, if any, among various sectors, is a challenge (Berkes et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2003</a>). Currently, the two main links between resilience and family planning and improved reproductive health care found in the literature are (1) the positive effects of the ability to space and plan births on the health of mothers and children (Kock and Prost 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2017</a>) and (2) the association between fertility and environmental change. The former fits within the wider link between health and resilience, which posits that good health at the population and individual level are important for short-term response to and long-term recovery from disturbance (NBSB 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2014</a>), and that healthy individuals are better able to physically and psychologically withstand events like natural disasters and emotionally cope with the trauma that accompanies any sort of major disturbance (Werner 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">1995</a>). For the second link between fertility and environmental change, the evidence is mixed, with some studies showing that reduced fertility is related to environmental change, while others show the opposite (Sasson and Weinreb 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">2017</a>; Brauner-Otto and Axinn 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2017</a>; Seller and Gray 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">2018</a>). More research is therefore needed to more fully understand the link between family planning, reproductive health care, and resilience (PRB and Worldwatch 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2014</a>; Yavinsky et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2015</a>; Bietsch et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2016</a>; Peterson and Giles 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2016</a>; Garenne 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2017</a>; Grace 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Community-based development projects that simultaneously address livelihoods, natural resources management and conservation, primary health, and reproductive health―commonly known as Population, Health, and Environment or PHE projects―provide an opportunity to study how to measure multiple dimensions of social and environmental resilience and their links with family planning and reproductive health care (Robson et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2017</a>). A 2015 synthesis of 35 PHE projects recommended that such projects conduct research to determine whether and how PHE and other integrated projects may contribute to building resilience at the household and community level (Yavinsky et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This research is the first effort to do just that. The paper identifies components of resilience that could be measured in PHE and other integrated development projects, and uses data from a PHE project in western Tanzania to measure resilience and better understand the links between resilience and family planning. The research aims to establish which factors contribute to resilience in the project area, with the ultimate goal of understanding how to build potential resilience among people in ecologically rich regions who rely on natural resources for their livelihoods.</p>
