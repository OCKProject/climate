 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Education has been positively linked with resilience (Van der Land and Hummel

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2015</a>). As a proxy measure of the level of education of the members in a household, the highest level of education for the most highly educated woman in each household was included in the model (0 = 
  <span class="italic">none or less than primary</span>, 1 = 
  <span class="italic">some primary</span>, 2 = 
  <span class="italic">completed primary</span>, 3 = 
  <span class="italic">some secondary</span>, 4 = 
  <span class="italic">completed secondary</span>, 5 = 
  <span class="italic">higher than secondary</span>). Additionally, we considered including the education level of the household head, the highest education level of any member, and the average education level of all household members. However, because women’s education is closely linked with economic development and family and child wellbeing, the education level of the most highly educated woman in the household was deemed to be more theoretically relevant.
