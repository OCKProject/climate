 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The construct family planning and access to maternal and child health care (FP-MCH) was measured using ten questions; the questions about access to health care were included in the reproductive health section of the questionnaire and were mainly intended to measure access to maternal and child care; thus, they were grouped with family planning knowledge and uptake. This factor included both family planning and maternal and child health care because health and development programming commonly integrates these two services. Respondents were asked whether they 
  <span class="italic">know what family planning is</span>, whether they 
  <span class="italic">approve of using family planning</span>, whether their household had 
  <span class="italic">better access to family planning and health care services</span> compared to 5 years ago, and whether they currently used any method of family planning. 
  <span class="italic">Unmet need for family planning</span> is a composite indicator and was determined through a series of questions in the reproductive health section, e.g., the desire to avoid pregnancy, the use of contraceptives, marital status, and fecundity. The indicator was calculated following Bradley et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2012</a>). Respondents of the reproductive health section also provided information about whether they 
  <span class="italic">visited a health care facility</span> and whether they 
  <span class="italic">received a home visit from a health care worker</span> in the 12 months prior to the survey. Community health workers visit each household to support general maternal and child health and family planning needs. Finally, respondents were asked about the 
  <span class="italic">number of children</span> they had, the 
  <span class="italic">spacing between their children’s births</span>, and whether they wished to 
  <span class="italic">have more children</span>. In the initial inventory of potential indicator variables, we considered the variable 
  <span class="italic">peoples’ perceptions of population increase as problematic</span> as a variable related to resilience in that such perceptions might be related to family planning; however, this variable was eliminated in favor of more direct attention to family planning and access to maternal and child health services.
