 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We included two distinct dimensions of social cohesion: participation and trust. To measure the participation dimension of social cohesion (SC-P), five questions were used. Respondents were asked about their perceived 
  <span class="italic">influence on village government decisions</span>; whether people in their village have a 
  <span class="italic">positive relationship with TANAPA</span>; whether any household member was 
  <span class="italic">part of a village organization</span>; whether any member had 
  <span class="italic">attended a public meeting</span> about village land-use planning, health issues, lake management, or forest management in the last year; and whether any household member 
  <span class="italic">participated in a Beach Management Unit</span> (BMU), a community governance body that manages the local fisheries.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure the trust dimension of social cohesion (SC-T), we used three questions about whether 
  <span class="italic">people in the respondentâ€™s village can be trusted</span>, whether 
  <span class="italic">people in other villages can be trusted</span>, and whether 
  <span class="italic">local government can be trusted</span>.
