 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seven items were used to measure respondents’ attitudes toward natural resource protection (NR), a proxy for natural resources management. Measuring natural resource management practices directly in a household survey can be problematic given the propensity for social desirability bias to become a factor. While differences can exist between people’s attitudes and practices, we expect changes in attitudes to be reflected in changes in practices over time. Respondents were asked whether 
  <span class="italic">forests should be conserved</span>, 
  <span class="italic">wildlife should be conserved</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">the Mahale Mountains National Park should be conserved</span>. Respondents were also asked whether they believe 
  <span class="italic">deforestation causes siltation</span>, whether they believe that 
  <span class="italic">siltation harms fish</span>, whether the 
  <span class="italic">national park provides benefits to the community</span>, and whether they believe that 
  <span class="italic">there is sufficient forest close by to meet day-to-day needs</span>.
