 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, in order to examine whether the association between 
  <span class="italic">family planning and access to MCH care</span> and 
  <span class="italic">resilience</span> is driven largely by an association with a specific component of 
  <span class="italic">resilience</span>, we also used SEM to estimate the direct associations between the components of 
  <span class="italic">resilience</span> and 
  <span class="italic">family planning and access to MCH care</span>. The results of these simultaneous regressions are presented in Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, in which regression coefficients are standardized. The model, which included all control variables, fit well (CFI = 0.866, RMSEA = 0.032, 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> (df) = 1149.524 (569), 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> ratio = 2.020). The results show that 
  <span class="italic">family planning and access to MCH care</span> was significantly associated with all components of resilience except 
  <span class="italic">food security and livelihoods and assets</span>. However, 
  <span class="italic">family planning and access to MCH care</span> was most significantly associated with 
  <span class="italic">social cohesion–participation.</span> Specifically, a 1 SD increase in 
  <span class="italic">family planning and access to MCH care</span> was associated with a 0.60 SD increase in 
  <span class="italic">social cohesion–participation</span> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01). 
  <span class="italic">Family planning and access to MCH care</span> was also strongly associated with 
  <span class="italic">climate change awareness</span> (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.42, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01), 
  <span class="italic">natural resource protection attitudes</span> (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.41, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01), and adult use of mosquito bed nets (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.40, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01). Though the associations were lower, 
  <span class="italic">family planning and access to MCH care</span> was also significantly associated with 
  <span class="italic">water, sanitation, and hygiene</span> (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.33, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01); observed behavior change due to climate (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.29, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01); and women’s education level (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.22, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01).
