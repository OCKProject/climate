 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Nature Conservancy and Pathfinder International have implemented the Tuungane Project since 2012 in collaboration with the Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA), local government authorities, and rural communities. The project aims to improve the health of people, forests, and fisheries in the Greater Mahale Ecosystem through strengthening local governance, improving access to social services (particularly health services), and promoting more sustainable use of natural resources (TNC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">n.d.</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Tuungane Project was selected for this data collection and research because the social and environmental challenges facing the local communities provide a good case study in which to examine resilience, and because relevant questions could be added to the project’s midterm survey. The area is remarkable for its rich biodiversity, including 250 endemic species of fish (Coulter 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">1994</a>) and more than 90% of Tanzania’s endangered chimpanzees (Piel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2013</a>). The communities in the project are extremely remote and therefore have very limited access to physical and social infrastructure. They are heavily reliant on their surrounding natural resources for nearly all of their needs. Access to major markets is poor due to a lack of roads, and the nearest major market (Kigoma) is 20 to 30 h away by ferryboat, depending on weather conditions on the lake (Hess and Leisher 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2011</a>). The few health facilities must serve large numbers of people, yet are often far from communities and severely undersupplied and understaffed.
 </p>
 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A baseline assessment found that the under-five mortality rate in Mahale was among the 20 highest in the world (Hess and Leisher 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">2011</a>). Virtually all (95%) of the households were reliant on farming, yet frequently face drought conditions, which contribute to food security issues. Income from fishing, which is the main source of cash income in the area, is threatened by overfishing, especially in fish breeding areas close to shore. Fishermen also faced resource supply challenges. Fully 80% of fishers said the average catch had declined compared to five years prior. Findings from a 2011 assessment of health facilities showed an urgent need to address the primary health care needs of people living in the villages around Mahale Mountains National Park (Pathfinder 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2011</a>). Infrastructure, staffing, and medical supplies were of concern in all facilities; none had running water or electricity. In addition, a number of barriers prevented access to health services: transportation, spousal permission to seek care, availability of staff at health facilities, quality of services, cost of services, and the ability to access necessary health-related commodities (Pathfinder International 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change-induced stress is expected from temperature increase and changes in rainfall patterns: climate change models suggest the average temperature in western Tanzania has been warming at a rate of 0.12 °C per decade since the 1950s, and will increase by 1.3 to 2.2 °C over the next 40 years; precipitation will increase slightly, with more rainfall during the rainy season but less during the dry season (Gray 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2010</a>). Rainfall is also projected to be less predictable (Gray 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">2010</a>; Girvetz et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2014</a>). In short, the vulnerability of residents in the Tuungane Project areas is multidimensional, encompassing factors such as poor health and nutrition status, poverty, illiteracy, gender inequality, degraded natural resources and low agricultural productivity, and governance failures―all of which will be exacerbated by changes in the climate.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using household survey data from the Tuungane Project’s 2016 midterm review, this paper fills two gaps in the literature. First, we provide a new approach to identify and measure the components of resilience relevant for PHE programming within a structural equation model framework. With this we aim to show the possibility of more broadly incorporating the measurement of resilience into surveys associated with PHE and other integrated development programming. Second, we provide new evidence of the association between resilience and family planning combined with the use of maternal and child health care facilities, which has been theorized in the literature as important for policy and programming, but for which there is a dearth of evidence.</p>
