 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unstandardized factor loadings are presented to show significance. Standardized factor loadings are presented, with the variance of the latent factor set to 1.00, so that factor loadings can be compared. All first-order measurement models fit well, with at least two fit indices indicating good fit; all factor loadings of the observed variables on the hypothesized factors were significant. Three latent factors―
  <span class="italic">social cohesion–trust</span>; 
  <span class="italic">water, sanitation, and hygiene</span>; and 
  <span class="italic">climate change awareness</span>―are perfectly fitted because these two factors include only three observed variables and use all degrees of freedom, which means that the models are as complex as the covariate matrices that they explain.
 </p>
 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The latent factor 
  <span class="italic">social cohesion–participation</span> (SC–P) was indicated by respondents’ perception of their influence on village government decisions, their perception of the village’s relationship with TANAPA, membership in a village organization, attendance at public meetings, and participation in a beach management unit (BMU). Membership in a village organization loaded most highly on this factor (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.77, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). The latent factor 
  <span class="italic">social cohesion–trust</span> (SC–T) was indicated by respondents’ trust in people in their village, in people in other villages, and in the village government. Trust in people in respondents’ own village loaded most highly on this factor (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.87, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). The latent factor 
  <span class="italic">natural resource protection attitudes</span> (NR) was indicated by a respondents’ opinion of whether forests, wildlife, and the national park should be conserved, whether deforestation causes siltation, whether siltation harms fish, and whether the national park provides community benefits. The opinion that wildlife should be conserved loaded most highly on this factor (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.91, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). The variable measuring belief about the presence of sufficient and proximate forest for day-to-day needs was excluded from the final measurement model because of a notably low factor loading and poor model fit.
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The latent factor food security and livelihoods and assets (FLA) reflects the physical livelihoods factor of resilience and was indicated by a household’s ability to meet daily needs, the lack of food shortages, the food consumption score (FCS), the number of crops and livestock animals, and an assets index. Having no food shortages loaded most highly on this factor (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.56, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). The two dimensions of this factor were combined into a single latent construct based on the evaluation of measurement model fit, and the need to have at least three variables per factor. Three observed variables were excluded from this model based on very low factor loadings and poor model fit: household dietary diversity, the amount of owned or rented farm or forestland, and number of income sources. The latent factor 
  <span class="italic">water, sanitation, and hygiene</span> (WASH) was indicated by a household’s access to a safe water source during the dry season, improved toilet facilities, and the use of water and soap, ash, or sand to wash hands. Improved toilet facilities loaded the highest on this factor (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.54, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). The observed variable measuring access to a safe water source during the wet season was excluded from the final measurement model because of a very low factor loading and poor model fit, and because there was high correlation between access to safe water in the dry and wet seasons.
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The latent factor 
  <span class="italic">climate change awareness</span> (CC-A) was indicated by whether the respondent had heard of the term “climate change,” had observed changes in the weather, and believed that climate change would negatively impact their household. Having observed changes in the weather loaded the highest on this factor (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.81, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). The observed variable reflecting changed behavior due to observed changes in weather patterns was initially included in this factor. However, due to low factor loadings and poor model fit, it was included as a separate variable in the second-order measurement model.
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the latent factor 
  <span class="italic">family planning and access to MCH care</span> (FP-MCH) was indicated by respondents’ knowledge of family planning, approval of the use of family planning, access to family planning and health care services, and their use of a health care facility or home visit services, mainly for maternal and child health services. Knowledge about family planning loaded the highest on this factor (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.67, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). Four observed variables were excluded from the final measurement model due to very low factor loadings and poor model fit: whether respondents had an unmet need for family planning, the number of children respondents have, the time spacing between births, and whether the respondents want to have more children.
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All but three of the first-order measurement models were overidentified with degrees of freedom greater than 0. The measurement models for 
  <span class="italic">social cohesion–trust</span>; 
  <span class="italic">water, sanitation, and hygiene</span>; and 
  <span class="italic">climate change awareness</span> were identified with degrees of freedom equal to 0.
 </p>
 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, we tested our operationalization of resilience as a second-order latent factor (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). All first-order measurement models (i.e., latent factors) are included in the second-order model of resilience and in all structural models below, with the exception of the latent factor 
  <span class="italic">social cohesion–trust</span>, which was excluded due to poor model fit. Again, standardized factor loadings are presented, with the variance of the latent factor set to 1.00, to enable a comparison of factor loadings. This second-order measurement model fit well. The CFI, the RMSEA, and the 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> ratio all indicated good fit of the second-order measurement model, and all factor loadings of the first-order factors and observed variables on the hypothesized second-order factors were significant. We operationalized resilience as a factor indicated by 
  <span class="italic">social cohesion–participation; natural resource protection attitudes; food security and livelihoods and assets; water, sanitation, and hygiene; climate change awareness;</span> adult use of mosquito bed nets; women’s highest education level in a household; and reported behavior change due to observed climate change. 
  <span class="italic">Social cohesion</span>–
  <span class="italic">participation</span> loaded most highly on resilience (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.82, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). This was followed by 
  <span class="italic">natural resource protection attitudes</span> (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.73, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001), 
  <span class="italic">climate change awareness</span> (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.66, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001), and 
  <span class="italic">water, sanitation, and hygiene</span> (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.50, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). The factor loadings for the other included factors and observed variables were lower but still significant; the factor loadings for adult use of mosquito bed nets (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.42, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001), 
  <span class="italic">food security and livelihoods and assets</span> (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.41, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001), and observed behavior change due to climate change (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.41, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001) were very similar to each other. The lowest factor loading was for women’s education level (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.34, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). Including other specifications of the education variable (see “
  <a rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec6">Measures</a>” section) had very similar outcomes. This model was overidentified with degrees of freedom greater than 0.
