 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test whether the association between 
  <span class="italic">resilience</span> and 
  <span class="italic">family planning and MCH</span> care remains robust with the exclusion of MCH care access, we replicated the estimated path model with an alternative specification of the family planning factor that does not include access to MCH care. The alternative 
  <span class="italic">family planning</span> factor was indicated by respondent’s knowledge of family planning (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.57, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001), approval of the use of family planning (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = 0.49, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001), and whether respondents have an unmet family planning need (
  <span class="italic">β</span> = − 0.58, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). The factor is perfectly fitted because it includes only three observed variables (CFI = 1.000, RMSEA = 0.000, 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> (df) = 0.000 (0)). We then used SEM to test the hypothesized association between 
  <span class="italic">resilience</span> and 
  <span class="italic">family planning</span>. The results from the adjusted structural model, which included all control variables specified above, show that a 1 SD increase in 
  <span class="italic">family planning</span> was associated with a 0.71 SD increase in 
  <span class="italic">resilience</span> (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01) (CFI = 0.865, RMSEA = 0.032, 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> (df) = 1090.614 (528), 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> ratio = 2.066). This suggests that the association between 
  <span class="italic">resilience</span> and 
  <span class="italic">family planning</span> is not solely driven by the inclusion of MCH care access.
