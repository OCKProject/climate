 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure a householdâ€™s access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), four items were used. To measure whether households have a 
  <span class="italic">safe water source during the dry season</span>, two questions were combined: Respondents were asked to provide information about whether they used an improved source of drinking water during the dry season (i.e., water from protected wells, rain water, bottled water, water from a vendor, or water from a tanker truck) and whether they treated their water supply to make it safer to drink. The same question was asked about a 
  <span class="italic">safe water source during the wet season</span>. Respondents were asked whether their household regularly uses an 
  <span class="italic">improved toilet facility</span>, which was defined as a toilet facility that is not shared and consists of either a pit latrine with a concrete slab or a pour/flush latrine, and were asked to describe their 
  <span class="italic">handwashing practices</span> and show their handwashing facilities (if any).
