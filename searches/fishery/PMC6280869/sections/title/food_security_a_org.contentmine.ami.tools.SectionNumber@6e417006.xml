 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Households’ level of food security and their access to livelihoods and assets (FLA) were measured using nine items, grouped into two dimensions. To measure the food security dimension of this construct, respondents were asked whether they can 
  <span class="italic">meet their daily needs</span> and whether they had experienced any 
  <span class="italic">food shortages</span> in the last 12 months. The World Food Program 
  <span class="italic">Food Consumption Score (FCS)</span> was calculated using questions on consumption frequency in the previous week of 15 different food categories, collapsed into eight food groups (WFP 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">2009</a>). Additionally, households’ 
  <span class="italic">dietary diversity</span> was assessed based on the same questions. Households who had consumed food in four or fewer groups were considered to have low dietary diversity.

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure the livelihoods and assets dimension of this construct, respondents were asked about the 
  <span class="italic">number of crops</span> (varieties) they cultivated, the 
  <span class="italic">number of livestock animals</span> they kept, and the 
  <span class="italic">size of their owned or rented farm or forest land</span>. Respondents were also asked whether their household had the following items: a bed or mattress, an iron, a sofa, a clock, a radio, a television, a mobile phone, a refrigerator, electricity, solar panels, a generator, a bicycle, a boat without an engine, a boat with an engine, a motorcycle, and a car. This information was used to calculate an 
  <span class="italic">assets index</span> similar to the DHS Wealth Index (Rutstein and Johnson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">2004</a>) by using principal components analysis to create indicator weights, multiplying each standardized indicator (i.e., 
  <span class="italic">z</span>-score) with the corresponding weight, and then summing across weighted indicators. Finally, respondents were asked how many 
  <span class="italic">sources of income</span> (i.e., all activities providing food or cash income, including pensions/remittances) their household had.
