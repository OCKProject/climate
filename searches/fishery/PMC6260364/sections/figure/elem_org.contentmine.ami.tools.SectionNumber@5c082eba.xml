  <p>Weighted average temperature range (first image in each row), weighted average maximum temperature Tmax (second image in each row) and weighted average biological sensitivity (third image in each row) for each country based on the species representing 90% of the European production (in volume) between 2004 and 2014 across three production sectors (a) marine fisheries, (b) marine aquaculture, and (c) freshwater production. Darker hues indicate narrower temperature ranges (first image in each row), higher maximum temperature (second image in each row) or higher biological sensitivity index (third image in each row). Note that the scale is different for each production sector in order to keep the maps readable due to large numerical differences across sectors.</p>
