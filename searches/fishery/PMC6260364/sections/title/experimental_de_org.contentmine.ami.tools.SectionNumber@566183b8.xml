Data from the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, and Gibraltar were included in the UK production statistics; data from Monaco were included in the French production and data from San Marino were included in the Italian production. Production volume data were extracted from the FAO database using the custom-made interface FishStatJ (

Data are presented as an 11-year (2004–2014) average in tons for each species, within each production sector (marine fisheries, marine aquaculture, and freshwater production) for each country (
  <a rid="s0030" ref-type="sec" href="#s0030">Table 1</a>). Production volume values in tons were averaged in order to smooth out the yearly variations and cope with the poor quality of data for some countries in certain years. Species representing 90% of the production volume for each country were included. A species production volume is only recorded by FAO if it is greater than 0.5 t; therefore, production volumes below 0.5 t are recorded as 0 in

The temperature range limits (Tmin and Tmax) are the 25th and 75th percentile of the temperature preference. If a species was not included in

  <a rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" href="#f0005">Fig. 1</a> are based on a weighted average of each variable considered (temperature range, maximum temperature, and biological sensitivity). The weighting factor is the production volume for each species within each country. The weighting factor allows to take into account whether a species was harvested in large volumes and thereby would influence more the country or sector vulnerability to warming compared to species harvested in smaller volumes.
