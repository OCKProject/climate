  <a rid="s0030" ref-type="sec" href="#s0030">Table 1</a> provides a list of European countries that produce seafood through their marine fisheries, marine aquaculture, and/or freshwater production sectors. For each country, we provide a list of species (English and Latin names) and their averaged (2004–2014) production volume in tons. The species’ list corresponds to the species contributing to 90% of each country’s 2004–2014 averaged production volume for each production sector. An important addition to the production volume dataset is the temperature range, the mean temperature, and the biological sensitivity 
  <a rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib1">[1]</a> of each species harvested by each European country. This allows us to explore the vulnerability to warming of each country by production sector and of each production sector at the European level.

  <a rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" href="#f0005">Fig. 1</a> presents an aggregation and weighting of the data from 
  <a rid="s0030" ref-type="sec" href="#s0030">Table 1</a>. It is composed of nine maps of the European Region; each row representing a production sector (a. marine fisheries, b. marine aquaculture, and c. freshwater production) and each column a data type (temperature range, maximum temperature, and biological sensitivity). Darker hues indicate narrower temperature ranges (first image in each row), higher maximum temperature (second image in each row), or higher biological sensitivity index (third image in each row).

    <p>Weighted average temperature range (first image in each row), weighted average maximum temperature Tmax (second image in each row) and weighted average biological sensitivity (third image in each row) for each country based on the species representing 90% of the European production (in volume) between 2004 and 2014 across three production sectors (a) marine fisheries, (b) marine aquaculture, and (c) freshwater production. Darker hues indicate narrower temperature ranges (first image in each row), higher maximum temperature (second image in each row) or higher biological sensitivity index (third image in each row). Note that the scale is different for each production sector in order to keep the maps readable due to large numerical differences across sectors.</p>
