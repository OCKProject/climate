The production data originates from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and covers three production sectors: Marine fisheries, marine aquaculture, and freshwater production. We present the main ecological characteristics of each species produced or harvested. These species characteristics were retrieved from various published sources and include biological sensitivity to harvesting and temperature ranges for the most important species. These indices were weighted by each species production volume in order to produce maps of European country&#x02019;s color-coded by their overall temperature range, maximum temperature, and biological sensitivity within each production sector.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0005"><bold>Specifications table</bold><table-wrap position="float" id="t0005"><alt-text id="at0010">Table</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Subject area</th><th><italic>Aquaculture, Fisheries, Marine biology, Management, Policy</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>More specific subject area</td><td><italic>Fisheries and aquaculture management, European Common Fisheries Policy, sustainability, vulnerability, climate change, adaptation</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Type of data</td><td><italic>Table, Figure</italic></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">How data was acquired</td><td><italic>The data was acquired from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations website - FAO through a custom &#x02013;made interface</italic> FishStatJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en" id="ir0005">http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en</ext-link>),</td></tr><tr><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fishbase.de" id="ir0010">www.fishbase.de</ext-link><italic>,</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sealifebase.org" id="ir0015">www.sealifebase.org</ext-link><italic>and peer reviewed references (see reference section)</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Data format</td><td><italic>Raw, aggregated, averaged and partially analyzed</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Experimental factors</td><td><italic>The production volume data was acquired from FAO and averaged for the period 2004&#x02013;2014.

The species&#x02019; list corresponds to the species contributing to 90% of each country&#x02019;s 2004&#x02013;2014 averaged production volume for each production sector. An important addition to the production volume dataset is the temperature range, the mean temperature, and the biological sensitivity <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> of each species harvested by each European country.

Production volume values in tons were averaged in order to smooth out the yearly variations and cope with the poor quality of data for some countries in certain years. Species representing 90% of the production volume for each country were included. A species production volume is only recorded by FAO if it is greater than 0.5&#x02009;t; therefore, production volumes below 0.5&#x02009;t are recorded as 0 in <xref rid="s0030" ref-type="sec">Table 1</xref>.</p><p id="p0055"><xref rid="s0030" ref-type="sec">Table 1</xref> also includes ecological characteristics of each species such as their biological sensitivity (BS), the temperature range limits (minimum and maximum) and the central tendency in temperature preference (median) that they are currently exposed to (see [9] for details).

The weighting factor is the production volume for each species within each country. The weighting factor allows to take into account whether a species was harvested in large volumes and thereby would influence more the country or sector vulnerability to warming compared to species harvested in smaller volumes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>W.W.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pauly</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Signature of ocean warming in global fisheries catch</article-title><source>Nature</source><volume>497</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>365</fpage><lpage>368</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23676754</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>W.W.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitcher</surname><given-names>T.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Paly</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A fuzzy logic expert system to estimate intrinsic extinction vulnerabilities of marine fishes to fishing</article-title><source>Biol.
