  <p>Adhesion energy of wet 
   <span class="italic">Arachnocampa</span> fishing lines measured on different probe types. The energy of the single thread reaches higher values (40–45 N/m) on polar surfaces (resin block, 
   <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva mold, PVS block) than on metal bar and native 
   <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> (22–24 N/m), with outliers from 6 N/m up to 248 N/m. In triple-arranged threads, most values are doubled, only on the native 
   <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> surface, a three times increase from 24.6 N/m (single thread) to 70.5 N/m was observed. A highly significance (see also Supplement Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) could be observed for the metal bar and 
   <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva mold (a): P = 0.007), the metal bar and resin block (b): P = 0.001) as well as 
   <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva mold (c): P &lt; 0.001) and native 
   <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> (d): P = 0.001).
