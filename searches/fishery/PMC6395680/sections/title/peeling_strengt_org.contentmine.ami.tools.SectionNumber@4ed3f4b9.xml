 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Newly collected single fishing lines showed the same minimum adhesion energy of 6 N/m on different probes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10</a>). The epoxy 
  <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva mold displayed the widest range of adhesion energy (up to 113 N/m with an outlier of 248 N/m) compared to the other probes. The adhesion energy on the resin block (40.4 N/m), the epoxy 
  <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva mold (45.5 N/m) and the PVS block (40 N/m) were almost double that of the metal bar (22.4 N/m) and the 
  <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva (24.6 N/m). The low adhesion energy values for the metal bar and 
  <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva could presently not be explained from the surface energy values of those probes (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Statistically significant differences for the metal bar vs. the Zophobas mold (a: P = 0.007) and the PVS block vs. native 
  <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> (b: P = 0.062) were observed.

    <p>Adhesion energy of wet 
     <span class="italic">Arachnocampa</span> fishing lines measured on different probe types. The energy of the single thread reaches higher values (40–45 N/m) on polar surfaces (resin block, 
     <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva mold, PVS block) than on metal bar and native 
     <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> (22–24 N/m), with outliers from 6 N/m up to 248 N/m. In triple-arranged threads, most values are doubled, only on the native 
     <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> surface, a three times increase from 24.6 N/m (single thread) to 70.5 N/m was observed. A highly significance (see also Supplement Table 
     <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>) could be observed for the metal bar and 
     <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva mold (a): P = 0.007), the metal bar and resin block (b): P = 0.001) as well as 
     <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva mold (c): P &lt; 0.001) and native

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measurements with triplets of fresh fishing lines resulted in an approximate doubling of the median adhesion energies for the resin block (73.9 N/m), 
  <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva mold (88.4 N/m) and PVS block (55.5 N/m). This result is similar to tensile strength measurements. In contrast, the median adhesion energy on the metal bar was no different between single (22.4 N/m) and three threads (24.2 N/m), while adhesion energy on the 
  <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva probe was about the triple (70.6 N/m) than that for a single fishing line (24.6 N/m). 
  <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva probe also showed the widest range of adhesion energies from 20 N/m to 225 N/m. The calculated adhesion energy was statistically different between the metal bar and resin block (P = 0.001), the metal bar and 
  <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> larva mold (P &lt; 0.001) as well as the metal bar and native 
  <span class="italic">Zophobas</span> (P = 0.001) (Table
