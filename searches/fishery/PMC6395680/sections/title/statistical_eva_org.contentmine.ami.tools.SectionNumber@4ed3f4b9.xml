 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Statistical evaluation of all peeling strength data and thread strength data were performed in MS Excel and Stata 14.2 and presented as boxplot graphs.</p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The skewness-curtosis test was used to ensure that the data did not differ significantly from normal distributions (P ≥ 0.05) before further analyses. Differences between two or multiple samples were tested with the unpaired t-test and one-way ANOVA tests followed by the post hoc Bonferroni test were used for multiple samples, P &lt; 0.05 was regarded as significant, P &lt; 0.01 as highly significant.</p>
