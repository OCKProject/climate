 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to other groups of animals, insects use adhesives widely in their daily life. Its purposes are diverse and include attachment to surfaces, resistance against external detachment forces (e.g. wind gusts), defence against predators, egg anchorage to oviposition sites, prey capture, etc. (see review)

  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa</span> only lives where the humidity is high and there is low air movement such as sheltered banks in rainforest or tree-fern lined gullies and caves with streams or rivers entering them. The world-famous Waitomo Glowworm Caves and Spellbound Cave on the North Island of New Zealand have populations of thousands of individuals, providing a spectacular display of glowworm bioluminescence day and night.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The larvae construct a nest composed of a mucous tube or ‘hammock” that hangs beneath a solid substrate attached by a network of threads
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Long threads, fishing lines, with evenly-spaced adhesive droplets
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>

  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> adults) as well as crawling invertebrates (isopods, ants, amphipods, millipedes, or even small land snails) that fall or jump into the fishing lines

  </span>. A midge, 
  <span class="italic">Anatopynia debilis</span> (=

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Larvae of this midge live in the mud banks and streams within the caves and are present at high density from October to December after dawn
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Other larger insects, such as Hymenoptera (bees and wasps) and Coleoptera (beetles), are caught occasionally in the fishing lines

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earlier studies have shown that the capture thread system of 
  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa</span> differs from that of orb web spiders. The 
  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa</span> fishing line is composed of cross-β-sheet-rich silk
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>, while threads of spider webs consists of β-pleated protein sheets forming a “β-spiral” nanospring
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. The adhesive droplets of spider webs comprise (i) a small central granule, (ii) a larger glycoprotein glue region and (iii) a fluid outer layer consisting mostly of water. In contrast, the droplets on 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> fishing lines have a two-layered structure with (i) a central core attached to the silk thread, containing a variety of components and salts including urea, and (ii) are surrounded by a relatively thick layer of water
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Earlier tests have shown that most of the outer water shell evaporates at a humidity below 80%, leaving only a thin layer of water covering the central core. The dry droplet has then an irregular layer of “salt” crystals surrounding the central core. If a dehydrated droplet is exposed to high humidity it rehydrates to form a complete entity

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>.

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Ex situ</span> studies of the 
  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa tasmaniensis</span> fishing lines indicate that beside the adhesive fluid changes the silk threads also change their mechanical properties from high to low humidity conditions. Under dry conditions (&lt;30%RH), the threads exhibit a higher Young’s modulus (18.38 GPa), while the breaking strain (from 0.02 to 0.6 ln (mm mm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>)) and toughness (from 2.4 to 25.82 MJ m
  <span class="sup">−3</span>) both increase, when tested under high humid conditions (&gt;90%RH)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. Unfortunely, in this study the authors used long-term stored dried thread fragments (1 cm length), which were exposed to high humidity conditions just prior to mechanical tests

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To avoid any mechanical and molecular alteration of the fishing lines and their adhesive droplets due to long storage at low humidity, we aimed at investigating the tensile and strain properties of the 
  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa luminosa</span> fishing lines under 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> (within the cave) conditions. Additionally, 
  <span class="italic">ex situ</span> studies were done near the cave within 24 h of thread collection, with threads stored in defined humid conditions and with minimal external influence during transport. We use analyses of peeling strength to quantify the bonding strength of adhesive droplets, on different artificial and natural surfaces and provide insights into adhesive properties of the capture system.
