 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The signal was fed into the digitizing system using a gain of 200 and acquisition rate was set to 5 kHz. The 10 g force transducer was adjusted with a standard comprising a pre-weighted (750 mg) piece of wire. This was weighed periodically to check that it remained clean and that its mass remained constant. The force transducer was calibrated at both the start, and rechecked and recalibrated at the end of each individual measurement.</p>
