 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Single or triplet fishing lines were collected as above for both tensile and peeling strength tests and fixed to the same wire or frame as above (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). They were then placed in a desiccation cabinet at 24 °C and 60% RH filled with dry calcium chloride for a minimum of 24 h. Measurements of tensile and peeling strength was made as above in the laboratory (24 °C, 60% RH) immediately after removing the threads from the desiccation cabinet.

    <p>For drying the fishing lines, each thread was individually attached to a metal frame, deposited in a desiccator filled with a drying agent and transported outside the cave. After 24 h, the threads were carefully removed and attached to the metal bars for the tensile strength measurements.</p>
