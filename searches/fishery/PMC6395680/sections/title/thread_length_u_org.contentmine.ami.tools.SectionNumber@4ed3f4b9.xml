  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa flava</span> taken from the field were kept in the laboratory in artificial habitats carved from moistened phenolic foam blocks (floral foam) and stored in an aquarium with water covering the base. Individual threads were detached from a larval snare using fine forceps and mounted on a stand placed in a glass aquarium. The thread was imaged using a Sony A7S camera and 100 mm Canon macro lens, taking a photograph (4240 × 2384 pixels) every 20 sec. A ruler was photographed after each run to provide a scale reference. As soon as the thread was installed, the aquarium was sealed and dry ambient air was introduced into the aquarium through a plastic tube terminating in a bubbler stone to reduce turbulence. The air was dried by pumping it through a chamber filled with silica gel desiccating beads. For analysis, thread length was measured from the individual images using ImageJ.
