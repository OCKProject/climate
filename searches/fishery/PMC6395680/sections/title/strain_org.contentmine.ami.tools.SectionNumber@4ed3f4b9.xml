 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Newly collected fishing lines tend to have not statistically significant higher strain (0.47) than dry ones (0.40) when pulled vertically during the tensile strength tests (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6A</a>). In peeling experiments, wet threads show slightly, but not significantly higher, extensibility on all probes (0.55–0.69) than on metal bar (0.41) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6B</a>). Statistically significant differences could only be observed between the stainless steel metal bar and the resin block or the epoxy
