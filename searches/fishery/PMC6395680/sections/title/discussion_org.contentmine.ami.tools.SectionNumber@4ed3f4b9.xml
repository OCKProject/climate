 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison with data given for the fishing lines in

  <span class="italic">tasmaniensis</span> is much higher (122.77 MPa at 90% RH; 159.04 at 30% RH)
  <span class="sup">

  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> (from 1.9 MPa at RH = 100% to 4.6 MPa at RH = 60%). Also, the extensibility of the fishing lines is slightly higher under highly humid conditions (

  <span class="italic">tasmaniensis = </span>0.6; 
  <span class="italic">A</span>.

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question arises, whether these measured differences are a consequence of the different sampling and handling of the threads prior to the tests. Fishing lines from 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tasmaniensis</span> were affixed for air transport with wood working glue on a paper frame, stored for a long time under dry conditions and segments of these samples were re-hydrated for a short period at 90% RH before the test series
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. The authors, however, assure that their sample handling had no influence on the mechanical properties
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. In the present study in 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span>, in contrast, long freshly-collected segments (&gt;4 cm) of the 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> fishing lines were measured 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> with minimal handling and mechanical stress before the measurement.
 </p>
 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, it could also not be excluded that the silk composition in both species differs, leading to different mechanical properties. The element composition of the fishing line of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tasmaniensis</span> seems to contain a higher amount of sulphur beside carbon and calcium in relation to those measured for

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. Further studies are therefore planned to quantify the amino acid composition in both

  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tasmaniensis</span> as done for

  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> to confirm different mechanical properties as a consequence of its molecular composition.
 </p>
 <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this regard, the 
  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa</span> fishing line silk has also very different mechanical properties to the egg stalk threads of the green lacewing 
  <span class="italic">Chrysopa carnea</span>, those silk also exhibits a cross-β-sheet structure. The egg stalks have much higher extensibility (4–6 at RH = 100% and 2.5 at RH = 65%

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>

  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa tasmaniensis</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>, probably because “glow-worm silk is likely to have a substantially lower crystalline fraction, compared to either silkworm silk or lacewing egg-stalks”
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. However, the differences in the strain and tensile strength between hydrated and dry 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">carnea</span> egg stalks presumes that the increased extensibility and strength is largely influenced by the hydrogen bonds between the cross-β strands which results in a rearrangement of the cross-β strands into a parallel β-sheet conformation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span> with increasing humidity. In representatives of 
  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa</span>, the threads are fully saturated with water and deformation is effected by “the amorphous fraction, or due to deformation of both the amorphous fraction and the cross-β-sheet crystallites“
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>. Absence of the hydrogen bond donor may hinder this rearrangement, leading to higher tensile strength and lower extensibility.

  <span class="italic">Chrysopa carnea</span>, the

  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> fishing lines perform poorly in terms of tensile strength. In orb web spiders, a tensile strength up to 1.1 GPa was reported for major ampullate silk and 0.5 GPa for viscid silk

  </span>, bone (0.16 GPa)

  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> silk.
 </p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reason for such relatively low extensibility and tensile strength of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> fishing lines could have a functional explanation, related to their prey and habitat. For example, orb web spiders require a web with high extensibility and energy-absorbance properties, able to resist the impact of any prey hitting the web at high velocity, be it small flies, heavy beetles or grasshoppers, and, at the same time, supporting the mass of the spider
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. Moreover, spider web also has to withstand rapidly changing climate conditions (rain, winds, humidity and temperature fluctuations, UV-radiation) without breaking
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. On the other hand, glowworms build their nests directly above rivers in caves (see Fig. 1 in
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>) or under overhangs in sheltered humid environments such as adjacent to streams and these exhibit relatively minor varying climate conditions throughout the year
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Their prey comprises a high proportion of small flying dipterans (89%), about 1–4 mm long
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> and of relatively low mass as reported here for the prey 
  <span class="italic">Anatopynia debilis</span>. Large heavy arthropod prey is rarely caught by 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>. As a consequence of the degree of prey specialization, glowworms may not necessarily need silk that is as resilient as those of orb web spiders.
 </p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is also conceivable that the low strain and tensile strength values of the 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> fishing lines serve as a safety mechanism. The web structure might hold prey that are small enough to be overcome and eaten, whereas larger prey that could destroy the snare and damage the larva readily break free. Also, it may limit the number of prey items collected and their total load, thereby preventing the nest from being detached from the substratum. Glowworms do occasionally fall from nests and survive if they can find an overhang to produce a new nest
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> fishing line silk shows a low tensile strength compared to other silk-producing animals, its adhesive properties exhibit much higher values than those of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tasmaniensis</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span> and for example orb web spiders (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). In the present study, adhesive droplets of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> have a mean adhesion energy of 20–45 N/m, while the values for 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tasmaniensis</span> and different spider species range from 0.02 N/m to 0.1 N/m
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. The adhesive droplets of orb web spiders show similar bonding ability at both high (100%) and low (≈60%) relative humidity levels, while bonding in 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> is highly dependent on humidity levels. Other biological adhesives have weaker (e.g. 2.5–17.5 N/m for the ascidian 
  <span class="italic">Botrylloides</span> sp.)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span> or stronger surface energy values (97 N/m for Crucifix Toad 
  <span class="italic">Notaden bennettii</span>)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span> than 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> droplets, but the latter is comparable with some commercial products such as fibrin (20 N/m) and gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde (39 N/m)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. The bonding abilities of some biological adhesives also need to be treated with caution depending on the substrates the adhesives were tested with (e.g. sandpaper, glass, animal tissue) as the substrates can greatly influence adhesion energy.

 <p id="Par48" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present investigation confirms an earlier observation that high humidity (&gt;80% RH) is essential for 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> to catch preys with its fishing lines
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Low humidity not only affects the properties of the silk fishing lines, but it also leads to dehydration of the adhesive droplets even when re-hydrated as in the case of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tasmaniensis</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. Such water loss, (water normally comprises 98% of droplets)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span> reduces the bonding ability of the glue, making it impossible to catch prey. Adhesion by the central droplet core after dehydration, which is presumably a gluing component, only becomes possible when the fishing line is under artificially produced tension. Under desiccating conditions, threads shorten and wave about more readily, whereas wet lines with large adhesive droplets are more resistant to tangling and maintain their sheet-like spacing. The droplets, however, are hygroscopic and can rehydrate at high humidity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Thus, the prey capture system of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> can recover after a dry spell to a small extent as indicated with 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">tasmaniensis</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>, but maybe not to its initial strength. Together, the characteristics of the threads and droplets indicate that 
  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa’s</span> capture system is highly specialised to their habitat. As a consequence, we suggest that the humidity levels in glowworm tourist caves be maintained above 80%.

 <p id="Par49" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The highly-aqueous glue (water content up to 80%) of orb web spiders, is also hygroscopic

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>

  </span>. Such differences can be explained by the different environments these species strive, dictating appropriate evolution of different adhesive systems. The present study shows that capture systems of orb web spiders and 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">luminosa</span> clearly also differ biomechanically so the genus 
  <span class="italic">Arachnocampa</span> still remains only a superficial reference to the “spider-like habit of the larva, forming webs and using them for the capture of insect prey”
