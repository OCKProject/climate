   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Adding fishing, the strength of trophic interactions expressed as vulnerabilities (Vs), and the impact of a primary productivity anomaly (PP_anomaly) applied to ecosystem primary producers, increased the fit of the model reducing the SS by 62% and reducing the AIC from 256 to -1079 (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The Akaike weight for this interaction also indicated a 0.61 probability that this is the best fitted model when not including temperature (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).

   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>) show the preference of lower optimum temperatures and tolerances for north Atlantic boreal species such as herring (blue, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), and Atlantic cod, haddock, grey and harbour seals, saithe and kelp, and higher optimum temperatures and tolerances for more widely distributed eurythermal species such as horse mackerel, Norway lobster (red, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), blue whiting, sprat and mackerel. The tolerances around optimum temperatures for eurythermal species were heterogeneous across species often showing lower tolerances for benthic-demersal groups (epifauna, anglerfish, flatfish, other benthopelagic species, poor cod, and Norway lobster) (Fig.

From 2000 onwards the model produced a poor fit for the biomass and catch trends of large demersals. A poor fit was also evident for mackerel and horse mackerel biomasses, although a better fit was found for catches of these species. Contrasting results were obtained for saithe, with good estimates of the increasing trend of biomass, but very scattered catch predictions for this species. The model performed well in estimating trends of catches for all other target species. The 95% percentile of the Monte Carlo simulations with 10% variability of the model inputs (shaded areas in Fig.

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future changes of biomass and catches were assessed under constant and rising temperature scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Under the “status quo” future scenario (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) grey seal biomass was predicted to follow the increasing historical trend, reaching equilibrium by 2050. However, under the “MSY” scenario their biomass decreased to values similar to the 1990s. This decrease is due to top-down competition with fishing fleets targeting the prey species of grey seals (saithe, cod, haddock, whiting and large demersal). With fishing mortality set at F
   <sub>MSY</sub> (Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a> in method section), the predicted increase in biomass of prey species, such as cod, haddock and whiting, did not compensate for the decrease in biomass of saithe and large demersals. The reduction in grey seals is thus driven by the reduction of their prey. In the “MSY + RCP2.6” scenario, grey seal biomass slightly decreased compared to the “MSY” scenario, but remained constant to the end of the century. Grey seal biomass decreased in all the other rising temperature scenarios. A total collapse of this species was predicted by 2090 for the worst case IPCC scenario (MSY + RCP8.5).

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the “MSY” scenario, the biomass of cod, haddock, whiting and herring increased due to (i) F
   <sub>MSY</sub> being lower than F
   <sub>status quo</sub> (Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a> in methods section), (ii) lower predation rates from grey seals and saithe on juveniles, or (iii) a combination of both. The climate scenarios showed different responses to rising temperature across species. Cod and herring, with low optimum temperatures (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), were sensitive to rising temperature and strongly declined by 2060 under all the climate projections. Cod also showed large oscillations due to temperatures being close to the upper end of their tolerance (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a,b</a>), causing large variations in their ability to feed over time (Eq. 
   <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a> in Methods). Under the “MSY + RCP2.6” scenario, cod biomass increased by the end of the century associated with the lower temperatures of this climate scenario (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> and Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Haddock biomass was more resilient to warming; maintaining constant biomass under the “MSY + RCP2.6” scenario, but a large decline in other RCP projections. Saithe’s optimum temperature is higher than that of cod and haddock, but lower than whiting. Saithe is also more eurythermal than all the other gadoids (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>) and declines only under the “MSY + RCP8.5” scenario. Whiting biomass only remained stable under “MSY + RCP2.6” scenario, but showed a strong increase under the other RCP projections. These increasing trends were driven by the cumulative effects of higher optimum temperature for this species compared to the other gadoids (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>) and low predation pressure due to the predicted declines of their main predators (grey seals and cod) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>).

  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eurythermal species and those in the cooler half of their thermal range (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>), such as large demersals (consisting of 85% hake), mackerel, horse mackerel and Norway lobster, did not show any changes under rising temperature projections (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The effects of fishing are more evident for catch predictions, with large variations under the “MSY” scenario projected for saithe, large demersals, mackerel and horse mackerel, due to a sudden increase in F
   <sub>MSY</sub> from the status quo (Fig.

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mackerel, horse mackerel and saithe were the dominant species in terms of biomasses and catches (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Under the highest rising temperature scenario (MSY + RCP8.5), overall decreases of 15% and 20% for cumulative biomasses and catches respectively were predicted for these three species by 2100 (from 15.8 to 13.5 tonnes *km
   <span class="sup">−2</span> for cumulative biomasses and from 3.04 to 2.42 tonnes *km
   <span class="sup">−2</span> for cumulative catches). Of the fished species, cod, herring, haddock and whiting showed major changes in response to rising temperatures (Fig.
