The differences between surface and near-bottom temperatures were homogeneous in space over the UK continental shelf (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>) and therefore an average scaling factor was calculated for the whole continental shelf of ICES VIa (0.61 °C).
