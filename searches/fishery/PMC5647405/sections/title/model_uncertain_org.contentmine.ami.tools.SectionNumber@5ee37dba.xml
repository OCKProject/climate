 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to investigate the quality of the input data assessing the sensitivity of the best-fitted Ecosim output to uncertainty in the Ecopath basic inputs (B, P/B, Q/B and EE)

  </span>. In the pedigree-based Monte Carlo simulations the confidence interval of the production/biomass ratio (P/B) was kept at 10% as a cumulative effect of lower confidence intervals for both biomass and P/B determined a large amplification in uncertainty for the Monte Carlo simulations. 200 Monte-Carlo simulation trials for each target functional group in this study were carried out to determine the 5% and 95% confidence interval of the best fitted model (Supplementary Fig.

 <p id="Par47" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model’s capability to predict future observations (model validation) was performed creating three validation datasets (A: 22 years for model fitting, 7-year validation set; B: 24 years for model fitting, 5 year validation set; C: 26 years for model fitting, 3 year validation set). The performances of these 3 models were assessed by comparing the root mean square deviations (RMSD) between predicted and observed values across three validation subsets (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Over- and underestimation for the target species predictions were visually assessed by plotting predicted vs observed data for both biomasses and catches (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>).
