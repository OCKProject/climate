 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using an ecosystem modelling framework that accounts for environmental and human pressures alongside species ecology and biology, we built an intricate web of interactions with the aim of predicting future ecosystem changes to ensure sustainable exploitation in a changing environment. We used the WCS EwE model developed in 2005

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) showed reduced fit on predicting biomasses of large demersals, saithe and mackerel due to large observed increases of both saithe and large demersals since 1985 (Fig.

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. An improvement in out-of-sample predictability was found for overall biomass predictions as the number of observations in the model calibration increased. This pattern was not observed for catches, however, probably due to the complex ecosystem dynamics that often show non-linear and non-stationary dynamics and require longer time series to be detected

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monte Carlo simulations assessing the prediction uncertainties with changes in the input data showed larger variabilities for cod, haddock and whiting compared to saithe, large demersals, Norway lobster and pelagic species such as mackerel, horse mackerel and herring. These variabilities for cod, haddock and whiting are caused by the top-down and bottom-up interactions between the adult and juvenile stages of these multi-stanza groups (Supplementary Table

 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary production anomaly (PP_anomaly) predicted by our model showed similar trends ‘with and without’ temperature as a driver in the model, and were comparable with previous anomalies estimated by Alexander

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent increase in the biomass of grey seals and saithe (observed data, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) was well predicted by our model. These are key-species in regulating the equilibrium of the ecosystem by exerting top-down control on their prey (v
  <span class="italic">ij</span> &gt; 2, Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S7</a>). These results echo recent studies which underlined the importance of grey seals in the WCS. Grey seals have been increasing in abundance since the 1960s mainly because of the increasing availability of their prey
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span> combined with few natural predators. According to our results they can play an important role in preventing the recovery of the overexploited cod stock, which also support previous findings
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. The difference in grey seal biomass projections between the “status quo” and “MSY” scenarios indicated that good ecosystem level fisheries management could have an important impact on regulating the population of top-predators and reduce their top-down control on the ecosystem.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Low historical fishing and predation mortalities for saithe and large demersals caused large increases in biomass for both these species, whilst high predation and fishing rates caused large declines of cod and whiting (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Saithe increased fourfold between 1985 and 2013 due to low fishing and predator pressure. Conversely, the biomass of the large demersal group constituted 80-85% of hake, which showed a dramatic increase since the early 2000s in both the North Sea and the West of Scotland
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. However, our parameterisation of large demersals also include the life history parameters, diet distribution, etc. of other species included in this functional group (Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S8</a>). This might explain the poor performance of our model in predicting trends in biomass and catches of large demersals, and underlines the necessity to consider hake individually for future applications of this model, especially given the large increase in this species biomass in recent years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. Under the “MSY” scenario, grey seals declined due to competition with fishing fleets that target their prey (mainly saithe and large demersals) whilst the drop in numbers of saithe and large demersals were caused by a higher fishing mortality (F
  <sub>MSY</sub> &gt; F
  <sub>status_quo</sub>): the cumulative effect of the reduction in top-predators determined the improvements of the yields of the cod and whiting declining stocks. This prediction could not be identified and predicted by single species assessments, emphasising the importance of multi-species considerations in an ecosystem approach to fishery management.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“IPCC-RCP” scenarios were superimposed on the “MSY” scenario to better assess the impact of rising temperature on cod and whiting that otherwise showed collapsing biomasses and catches
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span> under the “status quo”. Implementing an EAF has been used to investigate fishing policy options providing maximum sustainable yields and to minimise the impact on marine ecosystems
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. In line with these analyses, our results revealed that sustainable fisheries management can improve the yields of target species in the West Coast of Scotland ecosystem (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). However, some MSY estimates, used here as best available proxies, were determined by ICES, over larger areas and multiple stocks (Table 
  <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>) and in the case of saithe, large demersals and horse mackerel the sudden changes between F
  <sub>status quo</sub> and F
  <sub>MSY</sub> caused large changes in predicted catches (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). These large variations are unrealistic as annual changes in fishing mortality are moderated to be within ±15%
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. Moreover, we used a constant fishing mortality to 2100, assuming that this level of fishing will be sustainable into the future. However, F
  <sub>MSY</sub> values will change as mortality and growth changes in response to temperature-driven changes in community structure. These aspects are obvious limitations of our study. Fishing mortality is revised yearly, based on single species stock assessments related to observed data. Fisheries projections therefore rarely extend beyond 20–30 years, while the impact of rising sea temperature is often assessed on long timescales
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. The purpose of our study was not to predict what the ecosystem will look like in the future, but to assess the potential impact of rising temperatures for important commercial stocks in an ecosystem harvested at current estimates of F
  <sub>MSY</sub>. Future work should determine an appropriate target fishing mortality which accounts for the combined effects of fishing temperature by using a more realistic fishing mortality implemented annually through a harvest control rule designed to achieve MSY.

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sensitivity of marine species to temperature changes is defined by thermal tolerance windows that link their habitat temperature within the seasonal variability

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
  </span>. Within the boreal species investigated here, we identified three groups of stenothermal species. One group, constituted by species with extreme low optimum temperatures (e.g. cod and herring, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>) was highly sensitive to relatively small changes in temperature and declines were predicted under all the IPCC scenarios. Only under the “MSY + RCP2.6” scenario, cod biomass increased by 2100 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) associated with the predicted lower temperatures of this climate scenario (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) amplified by the AMO “cooling” phase expected by the end of the century (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second group consists of boreal species that have low optimum temperatures (e.g. grey seal and haddock, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>), showing a steady equilibrium under the best case scenario (RCP2.6), but declining under the three accelerated temperature scenarios (RCP4.0, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). A different consideration is required for saithe, which represents the third group: this boreal species had a colder optimum temperature, but a wider thermal tolerance (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1b</a>). This higher tolerance limit compared to other boreal species allowed saithe to be more resistant to rising temperatures (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). A reduction in biomass for this species was predicted only under the warmest climate scenario (RCP8.5) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The spatial distribution of saithe currently extends south to the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay (

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>, albeit in smaller abundances. Future applications of this model could be developed to assess a potential deeper spatial distribution for this species.
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the other boreal gadoids, whiting is a Lusitanian species with southerly geographical distribution from the Iberian Peninsula to as far north as the northern North Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>
  </span>. Our results showed an increase in whiting biomass under all RCP scenarios, resulting from the effects of higher optimum temperature for this species combined with contemporary declines of its predators such as seals and cod. This result indicated that higher fishing mortalities could be advised for this species if the stock were to recover from the declining historical trends. However, an increase in biomass could lead to decreasing growth and/or recruitment rates due to competition, and a reduction in predation pressure could result in a lower natural mortality, which might produce lower estimates of F
  <sub>MSY</sub>.

 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mackerel, horse mackerel and Norway lobster constituted a group of eurythermal species (Fig.

 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the target species in this study, mackerel, horse mackerel and saithe were the dominant species in terms of biomass and catch and were not significantly affected by temperature changes. Under rising temperature scenarios, overall cumulative decreases of biomass and catches of up to 15% and 20% respectively were predicted. However, under the highest scenario, our results suggested that in the long term the large increases predicted for whiting could compensate for the losses predicted in biomass and catches of other species (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Excluding mackerel and horse mackerel, which showed seasonal migration patterns in the study area

Similarly, the effect that temperature will have on the general metabolism (production and respiration) of species, growth rate, which might increase or decrease size-at-age and have an impact on the total biomass and potential size-structured predator-prey dynamics, were not explicitly included in this model. An increase in temperature might increase the turnover rate (P/B ratio) of some species, and might have an effect on the recruitment of populations, which at present is also not included in this model. These impacts might have unforeseen consequences to the outcome of these simulations and for ecosystem interactions in general, which warrants more study in future. In addition, the use of Monte Carlo simulations after fitting the model, could affect the outcome of the study. If the Monte Carlo simulations were run first and different Ecopath input estimates obtained before the fitting procedure, the estimation of top down and bottom up control of predator-prey dynamics might have changed and this might change the outcome of the future projections. This is also a fruitful area of study for future work.
 </p>
 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These caveats notwithstanding, our results showed that the inclusion of temperature tolerances allows for the exploration of different management approaches in a warming ecosystem to identify those strategies that best meet a range of objectives. This is an important step to the implementation of an ecosystem approach to sustainable fisheries management in a warming ecosystem and could improve our short-term management of declining stocks such as cod, whiting and herring. Our results also show that ocean warming could jeopardise the recovery of boreal stenothermal fish species (cod, herring and haddock), causing a reduction of these stocks in the northern temperate ecosystems. While the model presented here cannot, in its present state, be used for tactical short-term decisions due to too many uncertainties relating to the numerous processes it encompasses, it may be useful in EAF to inform managers on likely future long-term trends in biomass and catches under various ‘what if’ scenarios. Similar models could be used to explore various alternative fishing management strategies under a set of climate scenarios to assess the likely outcomes for target species, their prey and predators, but also future ecosystem health, state and structure. The model-driven scenario evaluation approach would (i) inform managers on the best strategy to pursue, depending on the goal, whilst accounting for future climate change and food web effects, (ii) identify potential risks (e.g. prey species depletion) and benefits (commercial species increasing), and (iii) identify and plan for future knock-on effects such as the socio-economic consequences of having to adapt to a changing ecosystem and the resulting change in commercial species composition, and their impacts on the fishing community. Encapsulating food web functioning in the development of integrated models of ecosystems under environmental change will help us to ensure future sustainable exploitation of our marine resources as part of the transition from single-species management to the holistic ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF).</p>
