 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under scenarios that only included changes (decreases) in fishing effort (Scn2 and Scn3), the model predicted mixed trends with both significant large decreases and increases in medium trophic level groups and significant large increases in high trophic level groups (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). For example, alien invertebrates significantly decreased while vulnerable species significantly increased (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Alien shrimps, small native demersal fishes, earlier alien demersal fishes and alien herbivores significantly decreased over time (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>). This is due to the increasing predation mortality as a consequence of the recovery of top predators (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>) and also, in some cases, a result of negative impacts of sea warming. In addition, the model predicted a significant decrease of sea birds due to the fewer discards caused by the reduction of the trawl fleet (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In contrast, the model predicted significant large increases of top predators, such as hake, large native demersal fishes, alien lizardfish, demersal sharks and rays and skates (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,d,f</a>). The model also showed increasing trends for mullets, new alien demersal fishes and turtles (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), due to the reduction in fishing effort. Most of these trends were exacerbated in Scn3, with the closure of the trawl fleet. For example, the model predicted major and faster recoveries for mullets, hake, large native demersal fishes and alien lizardfish (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b,d,f</a>), while alien shrimps, small native demersal fishes, earlier alien demersal fishes and sea birds had stronger negative impacts (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under Scn4, which assessed the impacts of the new fishing regulations while keeping the biomass of alien species constant, the model showed important effects of alien species. For example, hake and large native demersal fish presented better recoveries than in Scn2 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,d</a>). For hake, this may be due to competition for resources with alien lizardfish, while for large native demersal fishes it may be due to a higher abundance of their key prey, such as rocky fishes, small native demersal fishes and earlier alien demersal fishes.

 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within these three scenarios (Scn2, Scn3 and Scn4), most of the ecological indicators presented significant increasing trends (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). For example, total biomass, invertebrate biomass, predatory biomass and total catch showed significant increasing trends (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In addition, mTLco and mTLc significantly increased (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). FCI significantly increased in all scenarios while PL had non-significant trends in Scn2 and Scn3 and decreased in Scn4 (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>).
