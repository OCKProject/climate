 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the scenario that assessed the impact of alien species forced to follow current biomass trends (Scn8), the model predicted strong impacts on the food web (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Within this scenario, native invertebrates, native fishes (both demersal and pelagic) and vulnerable species declined significantly (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For specific groups, the model predicted significant decreases of small native demersal fishes due to current thermal conditions and increasing predation mortality and competition (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>). Similarly, turtles and sea birds declined due to a decline of their main prey (Figs S2b and 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Mullets were predicted to be slightly negatively impacted, due to their initial recovery as a result of the decreasing fishing effort in 2007–2010 and the negative impacts of alien species (Figs S2b and 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>). Rocky fishes declined significantly, due to a higher abundance of competitors and predators (Figs S2b and 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6c</a>). In contrast, hake and large native demersal fishes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b,d</a>) as well as demersal sharks and rays and skates (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) significantly increased. This may be due to reduced fishing activities and a higher abundance of alien prey (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>), although native prey exhibited opposite trends (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>).
