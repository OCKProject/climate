 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under scenarios of sea warming (Scn5, Scn6 and Scn7), the model predicted different responses of species to rising SST (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The model showed significant increases of alien invertebrates and alien fishes (both demersal and pelagic), while native fishes (both demersal and pelagic) and vulnerable species decreased (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). These trends were exacerbated as temperature increased (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>).

 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For specific groups, the model predicted significant increasing trends for alien shrimps, alien crabs, goatfishes, earlier and new alien demersal fishes and sharks (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). These increases may be due to the depletion of competitors and predators (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>). In contrast, small native demersal fishes declined due to unfavourable thermal conditions, and rays and skates were projected to strongly decline (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). A total collapse of mullets was predicted under the intermediate and worst IPCC projections (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>), while hake and rocky fishes were predicted to be almost depleted in the worst case of sea warming (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b,c</a>). Large native demersal fishes were projected to be positively impacted as temperature increases (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>), although they showed negative trends due to their overexploitation. Alien herbivores and alien lizardfish biomass significantly increased in all climate scenarios, with major increases as temperature rose except for the alien lizardfish in the worst-case scenario (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5e,f</a>)

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within these scenarios, we observed significant decreasing trends for most of the ecological indicators, with stronger correlations as temperature increased (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). However, invertebrate biomass, mTLc and PL showed increasing trends (Fig.
