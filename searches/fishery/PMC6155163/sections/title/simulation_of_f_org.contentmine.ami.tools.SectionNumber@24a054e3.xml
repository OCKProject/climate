  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). With the exception of the two new alien groups (new alien demersal fishes and alien medium pelagic fishes), we used the original Ecosim configuration that was fitted to the time series of data

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. For these two new alien groups, low vulnerability values had been estimated by the model in the fitting procedure, impeding a further increase in biomass of these groups in the future. As a continuous increase in biomass of these groups is expected, we applied a high vulnerability value (
  <span class="italic">v</span> = 10) to them to allow a larger change in the baseline predation mortality. All future scenarios were run for 50 years, from 2010 to 2060, and included variations of different stressors (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Primary production, in the absence of information about projected potential changes, was kept constant in all the scenarios from 2010 to 2060.

 <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The original configuration of the dynamic model was used as a baseline simulation (Business as usual (BAU)) (Scn1). We then assessed the impact of various fisheries management strategies while keeping constant temperature levels from 2010 to 2060. Scn2 included the new fishing regulations approved by the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Israel in 2016. These regulations, among other components, consist of a reduction in fishing efforts for the trawling and artisanal sectors and impose restrictions on the recreational fishers. For the trawl fleet, a complete cessation of its activity between April and June was implemented. In addition, the trawl fleet in the northern part of the country is to be mostly eliminated. These two regulations were implemented in our scenario and represented a reduction in trawl effort of nearly 50% (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>). For the artisanal fleet, a ban between April and May was implemented and implied a reduction in fishing effort of nearly 15% (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>). For recreational fishers, the new regulation restricted their capacity to a maximum catch of 5 kg per day. In the absence of detailed data about recreational effort and being conservative, a reduction of 20% of the effort was applied (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>). In addition, some sectors of the Israeli society have called for a ban of trawling altogether. Therefore, we ran a scenario that applies the new fishing regulations with trawling eliminated within the first 3 years of the simulation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8b</a>) (Scn3). In addition, to quantify only the effects of these new fishing regulations, we ran a scenario keeping the biomass of alien species and temperature constant from their 2010 levels to 2060 (Scn4).

 <p id="Par51" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To predict the impact of sea warming on the ICS ecosystem, future SST projections of the study area were obtained from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute Climate explorer (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://climexp.knmi.nl" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://climexp.knmi.nl</span>). We calculated SST projections under the four scenarios of greenhouse emissions (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6 and RCP8.5). As SST from this explorer did not match the SST from COPERNICUS, we calculated SST anomalies for the 2010–2060 period and these SST anomalies were applied to the COPERNICUS time series (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c</a>). Due to similar trends of the intermediate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6), we applied only the RCP4.5 scenario. Therefore, the scenarios conducted to simulate potential impacts of sea warming were RCP2.6 (Scn5), RCP4.5 (Scn6) and RCP8.5 (Scn7). In these scenarios, fishing effort was kept constant from its 2010 levels to 2060.
 </p>
 <p id="Par52" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To forecast future impacts of alien species, we forced the biomass of alien groups to follow current trends (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>), while keeping fishing effort and SST constant from their 2010 levels to 2060 (Scn8).
 </p>
 <p id="Par53" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, we evaluated the combined impacts of the stressors simultaneously through three scenarios. In Scn9 (combination without forcing alien species), we merged scenarios 2 and 6, thus combining the new fishing regulations with an intermediate increase in SST, and we left alien species to change through the time (we did not force their biomass). In Scn10 (combination with forcing alien species), we merged scenarios 2, 6 and 8, thus combining the new fishing regulations, the intermediate increase in SST and an increase in the biomass of alien species following current trends. In Scn11 (combination with forcing alien species constant), we merged scenarios 2 and 6, thus combining the new fishing regulations, the intermediate increase in SST, and we force alien species to keep them at 2010 levels.</p>
