 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the baseline simulation (Scn1), the model predicted a decreasing biomass trend over time for the biomass of several groups (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Alien invertebrates significantly decreased (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), due to the depletion of alien crabs and shrimps (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Other medium trophic level organisms, such as goatfishes and small native demersal fishes, suffered significant large declines (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). These decreases were due to the increase of various predators and competitors (for trophic interactions, see Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a> (hereafter referenced only as Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>) and current negative impacts of sea warming. For example, small native demersal fishes decreased due to the increase of competitors such as earlier and new alien demersal fishes (Figs S2b and 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), the increasing predation of alien lizardfish (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3f</a>) and the negative impact of current SST. The model also showed a significant large decline of large demersal native fishes due to their overexploitation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). In addition, vulnerable species such as turtles and seabirds were projected to significantly decrease (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), due to the notable impact of fishing activities on their populations (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>).

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the model predicted significant large increases in alien fishes (both demersal and pelagic) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), such as earlier and new alien demersal fishes, alien lizardfish and alien medium pelagic fishes (Figs 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>). This may be due to their earlier overexploitation prior to the reduction in fishing effort between 2007 and 2010, which is mainly due to a recent decreasing activity of trawl fleet (the most important fleet in the area). This follows current biomass increases due to possible empty niches and the depletion of native competitors (Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>). Mullets (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), sharks and rays (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) significantly increased over time. This may be due to the decline in the fishing effort between 2007 and 2010.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within this scenario, forage fish and invertebrate biomass decreased significantly with time while predatory biomass and total catch significantly increased over time (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Community indicators, such as mTLco and mTLc, and indicators related to ecosystem development theory such as TST and FCI significantly decreased with time, while PL significantly increased (Fig.
