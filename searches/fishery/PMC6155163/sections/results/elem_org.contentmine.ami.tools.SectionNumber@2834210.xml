  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the baseline simulation (Scn1), the model predicted a decreasing biomass trend over time for the biomass of several groups (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Alien invertebrates significantly decreased (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), due to the depletion of alien crabs and shrimps (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Other medium trophic level organisms, such as goatfishes and small native demersal fishes, suffered significant large declines (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). These decreases were due to the increase of various predators and competitors (for trophic interactions, see Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a> (hereafter referenced only as Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>) and current negative impacts of sea warming. For example, small native demersal fishes decreased due to the increase of competitors such as earlier and new alien demersal fishes (Figs S2b and 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), the increasing predation of alien lizardfish (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3f</a>) and the negative impact of current SST. The model also showed a significant large decline of large demersal native fishes due to their overexploitation (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). In addition, vulnerable species such as turtles and seabirds were projected to significantly decrease (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), due to the notable impact of fishing activities on their populations (Figure

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the model predicted significant large increases in alien fishes (both demersal and pelagic) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), such as earlier and new alien demersal fishes, alien lizardfish and alien medium pelagic fishes (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>). This may be due to their earlier overexploitation prior to the reduction in fishing effort between 2007 and 2010, which is mainly due to a recent decreasing activity of trawl fleet (the most important fleet in the area). This follows current biomass increases due to possible empty niches and the depletion of native competitors (Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>). Mullets (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), sharks and rays (Fig.

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under scenarios that only included changes (decreases) in fishing effort (Scn2 and Scn3), the model predicted mixed trends with both significant large decreases and increases in medium trophic level groups and significant large increases in high trophic level groups (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). For example, alien invertebrates significantly decreased while vulnerable species significantly increased (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). Alien shrimps, small native demersal fishes, earlier alien demersal fishes and alien herbivores significantly decreased over time (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>). This is due to the increasing predation mortality as a consequence of the recovery of top predators (Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>) and also, in some cases, a result of negative impacts of sea warming. In addition, the model predicted a significant decrease of sea birds due to the fewer discards caused by the reduction of the trawl fleet (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In contrast, the model predicted significant large increases of top predators, such as hake, large native demersal fishes, alien lizardfish, demersal sharks and rays and skates (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,d,f</a>). The model also showed increasing trends for mullets, new alien demersal fishes and turtles (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a</a>), due to the reduction in fishing effort. Most of these trends were exacerbated in Scn3, with the closure of the trawl fleet. For example, the model predicted major and faster recoveries for mullets, hake, large native demersal fishes and alien lizardfish (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b,d,f</a>), while alien shrimps, small native demersal fishes, earlier alien demersal fishes and sea birds had stronger negative impacts (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under Scn4, which assessed the impacts of the new fishing regulations while keeping the biomass of alien species constant, the model showed important effects of alien species. For example, hake and large native demersal fish presented better recoveries than in Scn2 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b,d</a>). For hake, this may be due to competition for resources with alien lizardfish, while for large native demersal fishes it may be due to a higher abundance of their key prey, such as rocky fishes, small native demersal fishes and earlier alien demersal fishes.
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within these three scenarios (Scn2, Scn3 and Scn4), most of the ecological indicators presented significant increasing trends (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). For example, total biomass, invertebrate biomass, predatory biomass and total catch showed significant increasing trends (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In addition, mTLco and mTLc significantly increased (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). FCI significantly increased in all scenarios while PL had non-significant trends in Scn2 and Scn3 and decreased in Scn4 (Fig.

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under scenarios of sea warming (Scn5, Scn6 and Scn7), the model predicted different responses of species to rising SST (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The model showed significant increases of alien invertebrates and alien fishes (both demersal and pelagic), while native fishes (both demersal and pelagic) and vulnerable species decreased (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). These trends were exacerbated as temperature increased (Figs 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For specific groups, the model predicted significant increasing trends for alien shrimps, alien crabs, goatfishes, earlier and new alien demersal fishes and sharks (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). These increases may be due to the depletion of competitors and predators (Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2b</a>). In contrast, small native demersal fishes declined due to unfavourable thermal conditions, and rays and skates were projected to strongly decline (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). A total collapse of mullets was predicted under the intermediate and worst IPCC projections (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>), while hake and rocky fishes were predicted to be almost depleted in the worst case of sea warming (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b,c</a>). Large native demersal fishes were projected to be positively impacted as temperature increases (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5d</a>), although they showed negative trends due to their overexploitation. Alien herbivores and alien lizardfish biomass significantly increased in all climate scenarios, with major increases as temperature rose except for the alien lizardfish in the worst-case scenario (Fig.

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Mullets were predicted to be slightly negatively impacted, due to their initial recovery as a result of the decreasing fishing effort in 2007–2010 and the negative impacts of alien species (Figs S2b and 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>). Rocky fishes declined significantly, due to a higher abundance of competitors and predators (Figs S2b and

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). For specific groups, small native demersal fishes decreased less than Scn9 and Scn10 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Hake presented a better trajectory than Scn9 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7b</a>). This could be due to a less competition for resources with alien lizardfish, which biomass was kept at constant population levels. However, it presented a worst trajectory than Scn10 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a>), which could be due less prey availability. On the other hand, large native demersal fishes presented a worse trajectory than Scn9 and Scn10 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7d</a>), which could be also due to less prey availability. Mullets and rocky fishes presented similar trajectories than Scn9 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7a,c</a>), which may be related to similar predation rates and competition for resources in both scenarios.

  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within this scenario, ecological indicators presented similar trends to Scn9 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In several cases slightly better trends than Scn9 were observed, such as in forage fish, Kempton’s index, mTLc and mTLco, while total catch and PL presented slightly worse trends than Scn9 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>).

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, primary producers increased in most of the scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). This can be attributed to the decrease of zooplanktonic groups in most of the scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), which is due to increased predation on these groups. Alien invertebrates decreased in scenarios that only fishing reductions were applied while increasing in the other scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). This can be attributed to increasing predation and decreasing predation and competition, respectively. Alien fishes increased in all scenarios due to reductions of competition and predators except in Scn2 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), where there is a large decrease in earlier alien demersal fishes attributed to higher predation rates (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). New alien demersal fishes increased in all the scenarios, which may due to fishing reductions and/or the decrease of competition (both native and alien groups). Native fishes decreased in all scenarios except those scenarios where only fishing reductions were applied (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Specifically, small native demersal fishes decreased in all scenarios. This general pattern is due to unfavorable thermal conditions, while for specific scenarios we can add increasing predation (fishing reductions) and competition for resources (alien species scenarios) or both (cumulative scenarios) as the main drivers of the ecological patterns. Vulnerable species increased in all scenarios that implied reductions in fishing activities (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>), although sea birds decreased in all scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>).
