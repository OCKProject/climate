  <div class="title">Population trends of gray reef (green) and silvertip sharks (blue) as estimated by the SPMs.</div>
  <p>Trajectories are drawn only for periods when 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>t</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">C</span>
   <sub>t</sub> data exist and overlap. Lines are mean population estimates and transparent polygons are 80% credible intervals (CI). Carrying capacity is represented by the initial flat line and CI before 1948 (that is, we estimated that population baselines occurred sometime earlier than 1948 for both species).
