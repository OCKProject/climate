 <div class="title">Abundance indices and estimated catches of silvertip and gray reef sharks in the Chagos archipelago.</div>
 <p>Time series of the indices of abundance obtained from scuba diving surveys for silvertip (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) and gray reef sharks (
  <span class="bold">B</span>). Trend lines in (A) and (B) were predicted for illustrative purposes by fitting a weighted quadratic regression (
  <span class="italic">O</span>
  <sub>t</sub> = year + year
  <span class="sup">2</span> + Ïµ). Shown are trends both within the USSR and guess scenario of community structure for the 1970s when species-specific indices were unavailable (see the text). (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) Estimated total catch of species from longline and IUU fisheries in the BIOT. Dashed lines are posterior means of estimated catches during the period 1975 to 1995 under a scenario of censored catch records (that is, in this period, our catch reconstruction for the two species was a gross underestimation; see Results). The posterior means of estimated catches referred to the best models for each species respectively.
