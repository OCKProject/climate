  </a>). We estimated 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>t</sub> for the period 1996 to 2015 by using seizure reports of the fishery patrolling vessel (FPV, fig. S8). The Marine Resources Assessment Group (MRAG) and UK FCO compile these reports when illegal fishing operations are detected and intercepted inside the BIOT. Catch reports were only available from 2008 to 2015 and included 56 IUU operations (

  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>). From these data, we calculated the expected number of sharks caught by each boat for each species for each year (fig. S8). Because seizure reports were often incomplete (that is, missing catch records for all or some species), we fitted a GLM with truncated negative binomial distribution (TNBD) (
  <a rid="R56" ref-type="bibr" href="#R56">
   <span class="italic">56</span>
  </a>) to the positive catches and predicted the expected number of annual shark catches per vessel for the period 2008 to 2015 (see the Supplementary Materials for details). Using the TNBD was instrumental to overcome the problem of identifying true zeros and missing values in the catch data. To extend the series to 1996, we assumed that between 1996 and 2008, catches were equal to the average in the period 2008 to 2015.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we predicted the total annual number of sharks caught by multiplying the average catch rate of sharks per boat per year by the predicted number of boats that would have entered the BIOT (including those that were undetected). These were calculated by multiplying the number of boats arrested on record by 10, as previous estimates suggested that about 10% of the boats incurring in the area are successfully intercepted by the FPV (Supplementary Materials) (
