 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) 1968 to 1989. In addition to the IUU catches, we also calculated those coming from the longline fishery that operated in BIOT before the reserve’s establishment in 2010. We calculated the likely number of reef sharks caught by this fishery over the considered period by multiplying species-specific CPUEs recorded in the area by the total number of hooks deployed locally by the fishery. Standardized CPUEs were obtained from the USSR surveys by using the methods described above. To predict total catch around the Chagos archipelago, we first predicted species-specific CPUE for the average bottom depth, set depth, distance from the 30-m isobaths, and the set’s soak time of all the survey sets deployed in the sector around BIOT. We reasoned that the empirical distribution of these experimental sets might have represented a reasonable approximation of where longline-fishing fleets operated in the area. Total number of hooks deployed in this area was extracted from the online catch and effort database published by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (

  </a>). This database stratifies data in 5° geographic cells. We selected only the cells overlapping with the BIOT (that is, nine cells going from 65° to 80°E and 0° to 10°S). We then obtained the number of hooks likely deployed in the BIOT by prorating the total number of hooks recorded in this 9° cell window with the ratio between the ocean surface of the BIOT (~545,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and the total surface of the selected nine-cell square. In this way, we calculated the catches from 1968 to 1989, which is the period for which the standardized catch rates were available.

Vessels fishing within the FCMZ (that is, the BIOT’s EEZ) were required to submit comprehensive logbook data. The historical longline logbook records from within the BIOT pertain to the period July 1993 to May 2010. Data were collated by the MRAG who, on behalf of the UK government, granted and managed fishing licenses within BIOT during that period (

  </a>). For every fishing event (longline set), data on date, location (latitude/longitude), number of hooks deployed, and catch composition to the species level were available. However, sharks were lumped in the general group “elasmobranchs.” Therefore, from these data, we could extract only fishing efforts (number of hooks deployed). Independent analyses on an observer survey estimated that shark CPUE was about 3.6 individuals per 1000 hooks between 2000 and 2003 (

  </a>) and that reef sharks accounted for 7% of all sharks caught. The proportions on gray reef and silvertip sharks were not reported. Therefore, we used the empirical CPUE proportions we estimated for the USSR survey in 1987 (the most recent year in the survey, that is, gray reef shark CPUE accounted for 22% of the reef sharks and silvertips accounted for 78% of the catches). Catches for missing years between the historical and the most recent period were estimated by linear interpolation.
