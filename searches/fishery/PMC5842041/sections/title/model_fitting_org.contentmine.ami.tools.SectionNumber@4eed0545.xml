 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each species, we ran the stock assessment models under four different scenarios (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">Table 2</a>) and with both the separate and joint modeling approach (results of the joint modeling are reported in the Supplementary Materials). These scenarios reflected different assumptions about the baseline structure of the shark community and relative proportions of shark abundance in the 1970s. Model fitting was done in Stan using the R package rstan. For each model, we ran Stan with four Markov chains, each with a warm-up phase of 20,000 iterations, followed by 200,000 additional iterations, which were kept for analysis after appropriate thinning (by every 200 iterations). We assessed convergence using the Gelman-Rubin
