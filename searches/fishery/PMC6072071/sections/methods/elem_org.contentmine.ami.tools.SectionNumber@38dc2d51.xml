  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recreational vessel catches</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recreational catches for 14 coastal 
   <span class="italic">wilayas</span> (districts, with particularities relating to the national legislation) of Algeria are either not reported (most of the time) or are reported as part of the commercial catch. We estimate these catches based on annual Catch Per Unit of Effort (CPUE) data, where effort is defined as the number of actives vessels. We note that the size of the vessels, their geographic fishing range, and fishing activities are assumed homogeneous, and hence, we consider this as an appropriate measure of the fishing effort.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initial- data on artisanal commercial vessel (small-scale professional) catches recorded daily by observers were obtained from one of Western Algeria’s landing sites and analyzed. Vessel name and registration number revealed that, from January 2012 to September 2014, reported landings of small-scale professional fisheries also included catches of recreational vessels (locales fisheries authorities, unpub. data). These data were reported to the FAO, which does not distinguish between catch types [
   <a rid="pone.0201602.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref007">7</a>]. However the question remains raised with regards to how much of the remaining catch is not reported, and what is its economic footprint.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily catch and effort data for 2012 were available, which allowed to estimate the CPUE for that year. The number of fishing trips per year depends on seasons, varying from 28 (vessels fishing only in summer) to 116 (vessels fishing throughout the year). This information was available for 9 recreational vessels. The landings of each vessel were reported per day, per species, genus, or family and ‘per box’ and not by weight (locales fisheries authorities, unpub. data, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201602.s001" href="#pone.0201602.s001">S1 Table</a>). Each box is equivalent to 17 kg for pelagic fish and 14 kg for demersal fish in wet weight. We estimated the annual landing for each vessel by adding up the daily landings of all species combined. Hence, we estimated an average CPUE. we then extrapolated harbor-wide using the total number of recreational vessels, i.e. 9 vessels.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, to estimate the coast-wide catch, we first obtained the number of recreational fishing licenses (one license per vessel) from the relevant fisheries departments of the 14 coastal 
   <span class="italic">wilayas</span>, then, assuming an even distribution of landings along the Algerian coast [
   <a rid="pone.0201602.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref017">17</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0201602.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref018">18</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0201602.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref019">19</a>] we multiplied the average CPUE by the number of licensed recreational vessels.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assume here that all application for license is intended to a commercial fishing, because fishing for subsistence doesn't require any license [
   <a rid="pone.0201602.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref020">20</a>]. There is no known threshold of how much of the recreational catch is sold, however, professional fishers spoken with during the course of this study agreed that at least "most" of the catch is sold in local markets, which constitutes an unfair competition. Hence, herein, we conservatively assume that 75% of the catch is sold in local markets.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spearfishing catches</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate recreational spearfishing catches, we multiplied the number of individual licenses obtained from the 
   <span class="italic">wilayas’</span> fisheries register, where one fisher gets one license, by the number of fishing days, assessed as 50 days·fisher
   <span class="sup">-1</span>·year
   <span class="sup">-1</span>, and the average daily weight of 20 kg·fisher
   <span class="sup">-1</span>·day
   <span class="sup">-1</span> from [
   <a rid="pone.0201602.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref020">20</a>]. We assumed both the CPUE and the number of fishing days remained constant over the 2011–2015 time period.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishers’ income from recreational fisheries and government lost revenue</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Algerian government collects taxes from all commercial sectors, and given the prohibition of trade of recreationally caught fish, the Government does not collect any taxes from recreational fishers, assuming fishers abide by the law. Herein, we calculated the potential economic loss to the Government that is attributable to this unregulated fishery as the difference between the revenue that the license fees and other fees like social security, crew role, … etc would have brought in if considered artisanal (1,200 USD per vessel) and the license fees that they bring as they are considered recreational (30 USD) [
   <a rid="pone.0201602.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref020">20</a>], knowing that most recreational catch is sold in local markets (pers. observation.). The difference represents a nontaxable income to local recreational fishers.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, the total revenue earned by recreational fishers is calculated as the discount on the cost of the license and other fees, i.e. the difference between the cost of a full commercial license (1,200USD)–noting that vessel size is similar, and geographic fishing range, and fishing capacity are similar–and that of a recreational license (30 USD), plus the revenue from the catch itself (or landed value).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The operating costs (fuel and lubricant) are deduced from the total revenue, on the basis of an average number of trips of 73 days per year multiplied by a cost estimated at 2,300 DA by trip, according to small scale fishers with whom we conversed.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hence, the total operating cost is estimated as the cost per day, multiplied by the number of trips (fishing days), multiplied by the number of licenses (which reflects the number of boats, as one boat gets one license). Therefore, profits from the recreational sector gained by fishers, are estimated as the total revenue i.e. average ex-cessel price multiplied by the catch per year, plus the value they would otherwise pay if they were considered professional (i.e. lost to government), minus the operating costs.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ex-vessel price is estimated at 675 AD (Algerian Dinar) in 2015 ($1 US = 100 AD) as extracted from the Algerian National Fisheries Database (Government of Algeria, unpub. data).</p>
