 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total revenue generated by recreational fisheries is estimated at around $41.8 million US per year, of which $40, 2 million US is landed value, if we remove operational costs ($2, 288 139 US), the net income is estimated at $39.58 million US, and around $1, 607 580 US is earnings that would otherwise be taxed by the government if the sector’s catches were accordingly regulated, hence constituting a loss to the government of Algeria in taxes. The total revenue per vessel is equivalent to $2, 400 US monthly, which is almost 6.1 times higher than Algerian average salary of 392 USD (

The landed value for spearfishers is assessed at $4.9 million US, or $562 US·month

Considering the illusion that catches are not sold, none of this income is captured by the Government of Algeria, and despite regulations–which otherwise lack implementation–most of this value is captured in the form of a nontaxable, black market income.
