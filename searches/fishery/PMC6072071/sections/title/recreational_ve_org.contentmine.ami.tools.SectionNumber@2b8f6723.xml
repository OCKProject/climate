  <span class="italic">wilayas</span> (districts, with particularities relating to the national legislation) of Algeria are either not reported (most of the time) or are reported as part of the commercial catch. We estimate these catches based on annual Catch Per Unit of Effort (CPUE) data, where effort is defined as the number of actives vessels. We note that the size of the vessels, their geographic fishing range, and fishing activities are assumed homogeneous, and hence, we consider this as an appropriate measure of the fishing effort.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Initial- data on artisanal commercial vessel (small-scale professional) catches recorded daily by observers were obtained from one of Western Algeria’s landing sites and analyzed. Vessel name and registration number revealed that, from January 2012 to September 2014, reported landings of small-scale professional fisheries also included catches of recreational vessels (locales fisheries authorities, unpub. data). These data were reported to the FAO, which does not distinguish between catch types [
  <a rid="pone.0201602.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref007">7</a>]. However the question remains raised with regards to how much of the remaining catch is not reported, and what is its economic footprint.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daily catch and effort data for 2012 were available, which allowed to estimate the CPUE for that year. The number of fishing trips per year depends on seasons, varying from 28 (vessels fishing only in summer) to 116 (vessels fishing throughout the year). This information was available for 9 recreational vessels. The landings of each vessel were reported per day, per species, genus, or family and ‘per box’ and not by weight (locales fisheries authorities, unpub. data, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201602.s001" href="#pone.0201602.s001">S1 Table</a>). Each box is equivalent to 17 kg for pelagic fish and 14 kg for demersal fish in wet weight. We estimated the annual landing for each vessel by adding up the daily landings of all species combined. Hence, we estimated an average CPUE. we then extrapolated harbor-wide using the total number of recreational vessels, i.e. 9 vessels.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, to estimate the coast-wide catch, we first obtained the number of recreational fishing licenses (one license per vessel) from the relevant fisheries departments of the 14 coastal 
  <span class="italic">wilayas</span>, then, assuming an even distribution of landings along the Algerian coast [
  <a rid="pone.0201602.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref017">17</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0201602.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref018">18</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0201602.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref019">19</a>] we multiplied the average CPUE by the number of licensed recreational vessels.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assume here that all application for license is intended to a commercial fishing, because fishing for subsistence doesn't require any license [
  <a rid="pone.0201602.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref020">20</a>]. There is no known threshold of how much of the recreational catch is sold, however, professional fishers spoken with during the course of this study agreed that at least "most" of the catch is sold in local markets, which constitutes an unfair competition. Hence, herein, we conservatively assume that 75% of the catch is sold in local markets.
