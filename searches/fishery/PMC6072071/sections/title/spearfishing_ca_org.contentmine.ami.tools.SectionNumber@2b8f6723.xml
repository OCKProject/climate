 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate recreational spearfishing catches, we multiplied the number of individual licenses obtained from the 
  <span class="italic">wilayas’</span> fisheries register, where one fisher gets one license, by the number of fishing days, assessed as 50 days·fisher
  <span class="sup">-1</span>·year
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, and the average daily weight of 20 kg·fisher
  <span class="sup">-1</span>·day
  <span class="sup">-1</span> from [
  <a rid="pone.0201602.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0201602.ref020">20</a>]. We assumed both the CPUE and the number of fishing days remained constant over the 2011–2015 time period.
