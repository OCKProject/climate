  <span class="italic">A. personatus</span> from twelve populations were collected throughout the species distribution (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f001" href="#animals-08-00224-f001">Figure 1</a>). The southern and northern groups were identified according to the descriptions of Okamoto et al. and Hashimoto and Kawasaki [
  <a rid="B14-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-animals-08-00224">14</a>,

Two samples (SS, SN) belonging to the northern and southern groups were collected from the same location in Sendai Bay. Oceanographic features, including currents and annual sea surface temperatures (due to the lack of long migration in adults and vertical migration at night, the annual surface temperature was chosen), at the sampled localities are shown in

  <span class="italic">A. hexapterus</span> collected from Cape Soya, Japan served as the outgroup. Muscle samples were obtained and were either preserved in 95% ethanol or frozen for DNA extraction after specimen identification and morphological measurement. To estimate the status of independence of the different 
  <span class="italic">A. personatus</span> mtDNA lineages, the mtDNA haplotype information was taken from our previous study [
  <a rid="B15-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-animals-08-00224">15</a>]. The frequency of the two lineages for each population is given in
