 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four AFLP primer combinations yielded clear bands and amplified a total of 272 loci across two species, of which 179 were polymorphic, with the primer combination E-AAC/M-CTC amplifying the largest number of loci, and primer combination E-AGC/M-CAC amplifying the lowest number of loci.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first step of Bayesian population assignment analysis for all 247 individuals using the software STRUCTURE revealed three clades (labelled southern clade, northern clade, and 
  <span class="italic">A. hexapterus</span>) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f002" href="#animals-08-00224-f002">Figure 2</a>). In the second step, we re-ran a population structure analysis separately for the identified southern and northern clades in the first step. The presence of 2 clusters (K = 2) in the southern clade were revealed by the admixture model, identifying population SS from Sendai Bay as a single cluster (Q
  <sub>p</sub> =92.4%) and all other populations pertaining to a second cluster (Q
  <sub>p</sub> always higher than 74%). The analysis of the northern clade also identified two clusters. The first cluster dominated the populations from Cape Soya, Rebun Island, and Ishikari Bay (Q
  <sub>p</sub> varied from 59.3% to 65.7%). The second cluster dominated the populations from Sendai Bay and Hachinohe (Q
  <sub>p</sub> varied from 65.6% to 69.6%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One cluster analysis of all individuals was performed on all of the data obtained from four primer pairs. The results are illustrated as a dendrogram in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f003" href="#animals-08-00224-f003">Figure 3</a>, in which three clades were confirmed. In this dendrogram, 
  <span class="italic">A. personatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">A. hexapterus</span> are completely separate. Evidence from Bayesian population assignment analysis and the NJ tree indicated the existence of two clearly distinguishable clades (southern and northern clades) in 
  <span class="italic">A. personatus</span>, which were sympatric within Sendai Bay. The separation of southern and northern clades was consistent with the definition of southern and northern groups based on previous allozyme data. Several specific bands were found among the three clades. The NJ tree of 13 populations also showed the complete divergence of northern and southern clades (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f004" href="#animals-08-00224-f004">Figure 4</a>). Of the 211 individuals, 98 from four populations belonged to the northern clade, and 113 from seven populations belonged to the southern clade (
  <a rid="animals-08-00224-t001" ref-type="table" href="#animals-08-00224-t001">Table 1</a>). PCA analysis of the similarity data generated from the data of all five primer combinations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f005" href="#animals-08-00224-f005">Figure 5</a>) produced a picture similar to the results given by the Bayesian population assignment analysis and cluster analysis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f002" href="#animals-08-00224-f002">Figure 2</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f003" href="#animals-08-00224-f003">Figure 3</a>), which revealed no hybrid individuals. The average genetic distances between clades were northern clade/southern clade: 0.1197; northern clade/
  <span class="italic">A. hexapterus</span>: 0.2275; and southern clade/
  <span class="italic">A. hexapterus</span>: 0.2586.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the southern clade, the OD population had the highest proportion of polymorphic loci (58.48%) and number of polymorphic loci (131), whereas the KA population had the lowest number of polymorphic loci (42) and a proportion of polymorphic loci of 27.27% (
  <a rid="animals-08-00224-t003" ref-type="table" href="#animals-08-00224-t003">Table 3</a>). The proportion of polymorphic loci varied greatly in the northern clade, ranging from 48.98% to 75.43%. In general, the proportion of polymorphic loci in the northern clade was higher than that in the southern clade. The Nei’s genetic diversity and Shannon diversity index varied greatly in populations of 
  <span class="italic">A. personatus</span>, ranging from 0.0641 to 0.1531 and 0.1042 to 0.2527, respectively. Thus, there were distinct variations among the 12 populations. Compared with populations of 
  <span class="italic">A. personatus</span>, the population of 
  <span class="italic">A. hexapterus</span> from Cape Soya showed a higher proportion of polymorphic loci and higher Nei’s genetic diversity and Shannon diversity index.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were strong geographic differences in the distributions of the two clades (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f002" href="#animals-08-00224-f002">Figure 2</a>). The southern clade consisted of seven populations and dominated the southern part of the Japanese coast and the Yellow Sea. Oodose in the Japan Sea and Sendai Bay in the Pacific Ocean could represent the northern boundary of the southern clade (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f004" href="#animals-08-00224-f004">Figure 4</a>). The northern clade consisted of five populations and dominated the northern part of the Japanese coast. Sendai Ba in the Pacific Ocean was the southern boundary of the northern clade. The northern and southern clades coexisted in Sendai Bay, consistent with previous isozyme data. However, the northern and southern clades did not represent the mtDNA lineage A and B, respectively. Lineage A had a more extensive geographical distribution and was present in all 12 populations from Cape Soya to Qingdao (
  <a rid="animals-08-00224-t001" ref-type="table" href="#animals-08-00224-t001">Table 1</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f004" href="#animals-08-00224-f004">Figure 4</a>). It dominated the southern clade. Lineage B was sympatric with lineage A in seven populations, including two populations in the southern clade and all populations in the northern clade. Combination of AFLP and mtDNA data, the northern clade was originated from secondary populations of two mtDNA lineages. There was complete genetic isolation between northern and southern clades based on the nuclear makers, which represented two new species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genetic break between the northern and southern clades was also supported by AMOVA, with 44.17% of all variance partitioned between the northern and southern clades (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>CT</sub> = 0.4417, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). Populations within the northern and southern clades also showed significant geographic structures, which were consistent with the subtle structure identified by the second step of Bayesian clustering analysis performed in southern and northern clades. Within the southern clade, 12.71% of genetic variance was attributed to differences between populations (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.1271, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). Within the northern clade, 4.56% of the variance was attributed to differences between populations (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> = 0.0456, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001). Similar results were also revealed in pairwise 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> values. All pairwise 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> values were high and significant except for the 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> values between Cape Soya and Rebun Island. Within the southern clade, 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> values among populations ranged from 0.0573 to 0.2078 (
  <a rid="animals-08-00224-t004" ref-type="table" href="#animals-08-00224-t004">Table 4</a>). Similarly, pairwise 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>ST</sub> values among populations in the northern clade ranged from 0.0112 to 0.0791.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The annual sea temperatures for the southern and northern clades varied from 13.16 °C to 19.99 °C and 11.26 °C to 14.17 °C, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f001" href="#animals-08-00224-f001">Figure 1</a>). The plot figure for the relationship between the latitude and annual sea temperature of populations excluding Qingdao showed the obvious separation of the northern and southern clades by annual sea temperature (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f006" href="#animals-08-00224-f006">Figure 6</a>). The separation annual temperature between northern and southern clades were 14.17 °C. For the mantel test, pairwise temperature and geographic distance were considered as major factors significantly associated with genetic differentiation in the entire study area (
  <a rid="animals-08-00224-t005" ref-type="table" href="#animals-08-00224-t005">Table 5</a>, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f007" href="#animals-08-00224-f007">Figure 7</a>). In the southern clade, temperature was also significantly correlated with genetic differentiation, with temperature variation explaining 46% of the variation in genetic differentiation in this clade (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.02). However, there was no evidence of isolation by distance in the southern clade, with geographic distance explaining very little of the variation (r = 0.14, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.35) (
  <a rid="animals-08-00224-t005" ref-type="table" href="#animals-08-00224-t005">Table 5</a>). In the northern clades, Mantel test indicated a significant relationship (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.02) between Log 
  <span class="bold">
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>ST</sub>
  </span> and geographic distance (Log km) indicating isolation by distance, with geographic distance explaining 76% of the variation in genetic differentiation for the northern clade (r = 0.76). However, the matrix correlation explained very little of the variation (r = 0.04) and there was no significant relationship between pairwise genetic differentiation and sea surface temperature in the northern clade (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.33).
