 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study successfully identified two cryptic 
  <span class="italic">A. personatus</span> species in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean by neutral AFLP markers. The genetic patterns of the two clades of 
  <span class="italic">A. personatus</span> were greatly influenced by Pleistocene glaciation isolations, the local sea temperature, and isolation by distance. The distribution of the northern clade may be a particularly good indicator of sea surface temperature change. Under the following climatic warming scenario, the distribution of the northern group may become more restricted to high latitudes. The southern group is likely to be less dramatically affected by climate change and to maintain the stable southern boundary by summer aestivation and a shift of the northern boundary to high latitudes. Our results demonstrate that intra-species diversity and competitive release between significant evolutionary units should be taken into account to assess the influence of climate change on species. In future studies, the exact range of temperature in both groups must be assessed with a sufficient number of samples to predict the influences of global climate change on both groups.
