  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two hundred and eleven individuals of 
   <span class="italic">A. personatus</span> from twelve populations were collected throughout the species distribution (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="animals-08-00224-f001" href="#animals-08-00224-f001">Figure 1</a>). The southern and northern groups were identified according to the descriptions of Okamoto et al. and Hashimoto and Kawasaki [

Two samples (SS, SN) belonging to the northern and southern groups were collected from the same location in Sendai Bay. Oceanographic features, including currents and annual sea surface temperatures (due to the lack of long migration in adults and vertical migration at night, the annual surface temperature was chosen), at the sampled localities are shown in

   <span class="italic">A. hexapterus</span> collected from Cape Soya, Japan served as the outgroup. Muscle samples were obtained and were either preserved in 95% ethanol or frozen for DNA extraction after specimen identification and morphological measurement. To estimate the status of independence of the different 
   <span class="italic">A. personatus</span> mtDNA lineages, the mtDNA haplotype information was taken from our previous study [
   <a rid="B15-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-animals-08-00224">15</a>]. The frequency of the two lineages for each population is given in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genomic DNA was isolated from muscle tissue by proteinase K digestion followed by standard phenol–chloroform purification. DNA was subsequently resuspended in 100 μL of TE buffer (10 mmol/L Tris-Cl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH = 8.0). AFLP procedures were essentially based on Vos et al. and Wang et al. [
   <a rid="B16-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-animals-08-00224">16</a>,
   <a rid="B21-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-animals-08-00224">21</a>]. PCR products were resolved by 6.0% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for 2.5 h at 50 °C on a Sequi-Gen GT Sequencing Cell (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA) and were ultimately detected using the silver staining technique. Sequences of AFLP adapters and primers are listed in 
   <a rid="animals-08-00224-t002" ref-type="table" href="#animals-08-00224-t002">Table 2</a>. Four primer combinations (E-AAC/M-CTC, E-AAG/M-CAA, E-AAG/M-CAC and E-AGC/M-CAC) were chosen for AFLP analysis.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.3. Data Analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Negative controls were run at each step of the AFLP process to check for exogenous contaminations. Samples with poor DNA quality, such as those with fragmented genomic DNA on agarose gel, were not used. Individuals with odd profiles, in which most of the bands were not observed in other individuals, were discarded. Bands with rare alleles (less than 4 individuals present) were also discarded.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">AFLP bands were scored for presence (1) or absence (0) and were transformed into a 0/1 binary character matrix. Based on the binary matrix, genotypes, percentage of polymorphic bands, similarity indices, and genetic distance were obtained. Similarity indices were calculated using the formula S = 2N
   <sub>ab</sub>/ (N
   <sub>a</sub> + N
   <sub>b</sub>) [
   <a rid="B22-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-animals-08-00224">22</a>], where N
   <sub>a</sub> and N
   <sub>b</sub> are the number of bands in individuals a and b, respectively, and N
   <sub>ab</sub> is the number of shared bands. Genetic distances between individuals were computed using the formula D = −ln S. For the calculation of the above values, we used a Microsoft Excel-based BASIC program (AFLP Data Analyser v1.3, city, country). The proportion of polymorphic loci, Nei’s genetic diversity, and Shannon diversity index were calculated using POPGEN (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). The spatial genetic structure was examined using the Bayesian assignment probability test in the program STRUCTURE 2.3 (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA) [
   <a rid="B23-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-animals-08-00224">23</a>]. This program uses a Bayesian approach to generate posterior probabilities of assignment of individuals to each of a given number of groups. The traditional Bayesian approach using software STRUCTURE (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA) for the evaluation of genetic population structure only highlights the main genetic structure of studied populations at a wide scale. In order to identify hierarchical and more detailed genetic structure, a multistep approach has been used, which entails a separate re-analysis of the groups identified in the previous steps [
   <a rid="B24-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-animals-08-00224">24</a>]. In this study, we adopted the multistep approach that consists of running STRUCTURE a first time in order to identify a main structure and then re-running the software separately for two clusters identified in the previous step. At each step, we ran STRUCTURE according to admixture model, using a burnin period of 20,000 followed by 200,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The procedure of AFLP markers analysis in the program STRUCTURE was followed Falush et al. [
   <a rid="B25-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-animals-08-00224">25</a>]. The best k value was calculated from the online software Structure Harvester (

The genetic relationship between populations was estimated by constructing the Neighbor joining (NJ) tree based on Nei’s 1972 original distance in Mega 6.0 (Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan) and evaluated with 1000 bootstrap replicates [
   <a rid="B26-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-animals-08-00224">26</a>]. The NJ tree of all individuals was also constructed in Mega 6.0. In order to reveal the possible hybrid individuals between two clades, principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted in NTSYSpc [
   <a rid="B27-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-animals-08-00224">27</a>]. The population structure was investigated using the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and 
   <span class="italic">F</span>-statistics in ARLEQUIN 3.5 (University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland) [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A plot figure was made to infer the relationship between the sampling latitude and the annual temperature. To further link genetic differentiation with annual sea surface temperature and geographic distance, which might influence the observed genetic structure at different spatial scales, the association between genetic differentiation (
