 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use of molecular techniques in biodiversity research increasingly results in the recognition of multiple divergent mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages below the morphospecies level. However, the overlapping distribution of multiple divergent lineages raises the question of whether some of these lineages are in fact cryptic species. Assessing the status of these divergent lineages, delimiting evolutionarily significant units (ESUs), and identifying the dominant evolutionary and ecological drivers are critical components of successful wildlife conservation and management strategies. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were applied to characterize the phylogeography pattern of a cold water species, the Japanese sand lance 
  <span class="italic">Ammodytes personatus</span>, in warm and cold ocean currents. A total of 211 individuals sampled from 12 populations through the speciesâ€™ range, including samples from Kuroshio Current, Oyashio Current, Tsushima Current, and Yellow Sea, were analyzed. The Bayesian assignment probability test and Neighbor joining (NJ) analysis divided these populations into two genetically and geographically distinct clades (northern and southern clades) characterized by different sea surface temperatures. The incongruence between nuclear clades and previous mitochondrial lineages suggested that 
  <span class="italic">A. personatus</span> is indeed composed of at least two genetically divergent cryptic species. Pleistocene glaciation isolation after secondary contact, local thermal adaptation, and isolation by distance may explain the observed geographic pattern of two cryptic species and genetic structure within clades.
