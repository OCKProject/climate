 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genomic DNA was isolated from muscle tissue by proteinase K digestion followed by standard phenol–chloroform purification. DNA was subsequently resuspended in 100 μL of TE buffer (10 mmol/L Tris-Cl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH = 8.0). AFLP procedures were essentially based on Vos et al. and Wang et al. [

  <a rid="B21-animals-08-00224" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-animals-08-00224">21</a>]. PCR products were resolved by 6.0% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for 2.5 h at 50 °C on a Sequi-Gen GT Sequencing Cell (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA) and were ultimately detected using the silver staining technique. Sequences of AFLP adapters and primers are listed in
