 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference we found in the vulnerabilities of 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> to night spearfishing pressure in the lightly exploited Kia region may be surprising to some, given 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and there are protections against international trade under CITES (Vincent et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0044">2014</a>). In addition, previous analyses of UVC survey data from New Caledonia and French Polynesia, as well as a dataset collected across the geographic range of 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span>, found fishing pressure correlates to serious declines in 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> abundance
  <span class="italic">,</span> with 10‐fold decreases in densities in fished areas compared to unfished areas (Lavides et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0029">2016</a>; Sadovy et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0039">2003</a>). We believe that the results we found differ to those of previous studies because of differences in scale. Declines in both 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> are regularly attributed to excess fishing pressure (Fenner, 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0016">2014</a>) and this is likely true at a global scale, across all types of fishing (e.g., spearfishing, hook‐and‐line, nets). Information about drivers of species decline at this scale are also based on data aggregated across areas with a range of human population density, natural habitats, and reef types. However, our results demonstrate that coarse‐scale information about species vulnerability and its potential causes does not necessarily capture drivers of vulnerability at the local (i.e., meters to thousands of hectares; Poiani, Richter, Anderson, &amp; Richter, 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0034">2000</a>) or subpopulation scale. This is not surprising given the variation in fishing methods and relative level of pressure at a global or even national scale; especially for heavily populated areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is evidence for scale‐dependence in the effects of anthropogenic fishing pressure. In a study of parrotfish assemblages including 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> across eight Micronesian islands, Taylor, Lindfield, and Choat (
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0041">2014</a>) found that island geomorphology and species distribution patterns accounted for the greatest variation in assemblage structure, species richness and diversity at biogeographic scales. In contrast, the effects of fishing pressure were only strongly expressed at the within‐island scale.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are also numerous examples where a combination of local harvesting practices and the behavior of natural populations has led to extinctions and/or shifts in the spatial distribution of a species. One famous example is the northwest cod (
  <span class="italic">Gadus morhua</span>) fishery, which was rapidly depleted when trawling was introduced because schools of spawning fish could be caught more efficiently than with hook‐and‐line methods (Ames, 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0002">2004</a>). Another example is found in the Bay of Martaban, Myanmar, where nearly half of all spoon‐billed sandpipers (
  <span class="italic">Calidris pygmaea</span>) winter. The increased use of mist nets by bird catchers has significantly increased sandpiper by‐catch and hunters in this poor community are likely to eat or sell the birds, rather than release them (Zockler et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0047">2010</a>). In this case, the combination of bird behavior, the decreasing cost of mist nets, and the low economic status of the local community has led the species to the brink of extinction. Cronin et al. (
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0011">2016</a>) also found evidence that two of seven monkey species, 
  <span class="italic">Cercopithecus erythrotis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. nictitans,</span> were resilient to relatively high gun‐hunting pressure in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea; a finding which was attributed to elevated anti‐predator behavior, smaller group sizes, ecological flexibility, and life‐history traits. In each case, the effective management of the species in question depended on local‐scale information about the interactions between humans, their hunting methods, and the species’ natural behaviors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The clear management implication of this study is that local‐scale assessments within specific fisheries (or other) contexts can help to identify instances where the natural behavior of a species makes them vulnerable before an unexpected population crash occurs. Therefore, the fundamental question becomes: which species requires the most urgent attention, given the level of harm they are biologically predisposed to as a result of the predominant fishing or hunting practices? If the answer is based solely on global vulnerability studies or catch‐dependent data, the resulting conservation outcomes may be unexpected and undesirable. By the same token, the relative local‐scale vulnerabilities of species in one region (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> in Kia) are not necessarily transferable to other areas because differences in human population densities, harvesting practices and natural habitat compositions, as well as community compositions can lead to different results (e.g., Lindfield et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0030">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the Kia fishery, the subpopulation structure of adult fishes and their responses to fisheries are differentiated at much finer spatial scales than have been previously considered for management efforts. Thus, our results suggests 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> is in need of more attention in Kia; even though 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> is allocated a higher conservation priority at the global scale. While this observation itself is novel, we also demonstrate that a mismatch in scale occurs between the information and its application in decision‐making when global‐scale assessments of vulnerability are exclusively used to inform local‐scale management decisions; as a result, important phenomena such as the extreme vulnerability of 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> to night spearfishing may be missed. However, our findings do not imply that 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> are not susceptible to fishing or their current global conservation status is unwarranted. For example, there is still evidence of cyanide fishing for this species within the Coral Triangle, although this is now illegal (Gillett, 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0018">2010</a>; Sadovy et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0039">2003</a>). Spearfishing on SCUBA may also pose a serious threat to 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> as this technology becomes more widespread in the Indo‐Pacific, although this method is also illegal in many areas (Lindfield et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0030">2014</a>). Furthermore, both species have been rapidly depleted in areas of the Indo‐Pacific with much higher human densities than the Kia fishing grounds (Lavides et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0029">2016</a>). Additionally, in terms of global‐scale conservation actions, the regulations imposed by CITES on the international trade of 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> (Vincent et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0044">2014</a>) are instrumental, both symbolically and materially, in complementing local and regional strategies to prevent the extinction of the species. We have no intention of undoing this work. Nevertheless, our results clearly show that local‐scale variability exists in the relative level of vulnerability of 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> to night spearfishing without SCUBA in Kia. These local‐scale differences in species vulnerability may also play an important role in other regions and should be assessed using fisheries‐independent data, where resources permit.
