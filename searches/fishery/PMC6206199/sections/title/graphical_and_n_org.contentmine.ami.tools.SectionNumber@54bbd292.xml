 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Visual summaries suggested 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> responded differently to fishing pressure (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34501-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34501-fig-0002">2</a>). For 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span>, mean densities across different reef strata were consistently lower in areas of high fishing pressure compared to areas with low fishing pressure. In contrast, the mean densities of 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> did not vary significantly between areas of high and low fishing pressure. A numerical summary of the data (Table 
  <a rid="ece34501-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" href="#ece34501-tbl-0001">1</a>) showed the same trend between abundance, fishing pressure, and reef strata. Note that although the average densities of 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> are low (1.64 and 2.68 per hectare across all transects, respectively), this does not necessarily reflect densities within individual transects. The average densities are low because of the high proportion of transects with zero counts; 59 for 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> and 92 for 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span>. Several individual transects had densities substantially higher than average. For 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span>, 58 transects had densities higher than the average and the highest density observed on one transect was 10 fish per hectare. For 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span>, a total of 30 transects had higher‐than‐average densities and the five highest densities were 40, 33.13, 32.86, 25.44, and 20.04 fish per hectare.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the potential predictor variables for collinearity and found all GVIF values were &lt;1.9; except when longitude and latitude were included together, since these were inevitably correlated. Thus, collinearity in the predictors was not a significant issue in the models.</p>
