 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate that 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> is more vulnerable to night spearfishing compared to 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> in the Kia fishing grounds. 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> abundances were 3.6 times lower in areas that had experienced high spearfishing pressure, while 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> abundances were not influenced by spearfishing pressure. This was also true when we removed subtidal reef flats; 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> abundances were 3.4 times lower in areas of high historical spearfishing pressure but had no effect on 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span>. Given that both 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> are very large fish that are relatively abundant in the Kia region, this observed difference warrants further discussion.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We believe the aggregation behavior of 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> combined with the specific fishing strategies that were utilized in the Kia region are responsible for the differences we observed. Kia spearfishers use their extensive knowledge of their customary fishing grounds and 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> nocturnal behavior to obtain high catches through a method known as spot checking (Hamilton et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0023">2016</a>). Fishers will travel to specific locations on the reef where B. muricatum schools are known to frequently form, then snorkel along the surface until they locate 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> resting out in the open on the reef below them. If any are sighted, spearfishers free dive to spear the resting 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span>, then make a concerted effort to check the surrounding vicinity for other members of the school. If none are sighted, the fishers move on to another location where resting schools of 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> are known to often reside. This spot checking method minimizes the amount free diving effort that is required; thus affording a degree of protection to more nocturnally cryptic species such as 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> which do not aggregate at night and sleep within caves and crevices in the reef matrix; a nocturnal resting behavior that makes 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> extremely difficult to sight from the surface.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such spearfishing strategies are only effective in lightly fished areas where schools of 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> can be reliably located. Indeed, in regions in Melanesia where 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> populations have been depleted, night spearfishers adopt a different strategy, spending a considerable amount of their time continuously free diving and searching caves and crevices as they move along a reef (R.J. Hamilton, personal observation). As night spearfishers increasingly adopt an intensive free‐diving strategy, the likelihood of capturing more cryptic species such as 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> increases. The use of SCUBA gear for night spearfishing will exacerbate this even further, as seen in Lindfield et al. (
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0030">2014</a>) where the catch composition of fisheries in Guam shifted dramatically toward 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> when SCUBA was introduced.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Creel surveys of night spear fisheries that were conducted in lightly and moderately fished regions of the Western Solomon Islands in 2000–2001 provide some support for this explanation. Catch compositions from the lightly fished Tetepare Island consisted of 86% 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> and 1.8% 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span>. This contrasts with the catch composition from the nearby, but more heavily fished Nusabanaga fishing grounds, where 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> made up 56% of the catch and 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> made up 5.6% of the catch (Hamilton, 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0021">2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another possible explanation is that there is actually no difference in historical fishing pressure between zones in the Kia fishing grounds and the difference in abundance exists for other reasons. However, this is unlikely since the fishermen interviewed had vast knowledge of fishing practices around Kia (Hamilton et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0023">2016</a>). They unanimously identified Zone 1 as the zone of high historical fishing pressure, citing significant and tangible factors like proximity to the BPFC, fuel costs, and issues around customary fishing rights.
