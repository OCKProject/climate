 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We hope our findings will help to build a clearer picture of the extreme vulnerability of 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> to the common practice of night spearfishing and, in so doing, help to drive additional national and regional protection and global awareness for this species. We must reiterate, however, that our findings at Kia, with its specific habitats, local population and fishing methods, should not detract from the attention given to 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> globally and in other parts of the Indo‐Pacific. To draw conservation resources away from 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> in other fisheries based on our results from Kia would be contrary to the main point of this paper, where we have demonstrated the need for local‐scale, fisheries‐independent data to inform management decisions at relevant scales. The historical variations in the intensity of fishing across space and time, the method of fishing employed, the natural behavioral vulnerabilities of certain species that such methods exploit, and the local distribution of fishes throughout different habitats, are factors that will vary intensely at fine scales. Hence, our results regarding these specific fishes may not be reliably generalized for other fisheries. Instead, we call on regional managers to carefully assess the state of their fisheries and the dynamics affecting the vulnerability of the fishes therein to fishing pressure based on local‐scale, fisheries‐independent data to better allocate conservation resources.
