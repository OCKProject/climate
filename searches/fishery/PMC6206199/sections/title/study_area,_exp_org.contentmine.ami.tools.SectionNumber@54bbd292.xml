 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area is located in Kia District, Santa Isabel, Solomon Islands (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34501-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34501-fig-0001">1</a>). It is approximately 1,250 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in size, with Kia being the largest community in the region. The majority of Kia district residents live a subsistence‐based lifestyle and retain customary ownership of their land and shallow seas. Kia inhabitants generate income through a combination of local‐scale agriculture and fishing, as well as royalties from commercial logging (Hamilton et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0022">2017</a>; Peterson, Hamilton, Pita, Atu, &amp; James, 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0033">2012</a>). In addition, two fisheries centers were operating in Kia District at the time this study was conducted. The Bahana Provincial Fisheries Centre (BPFC) had been operating in Kia since 2000, buying locally sourced fish for domestic export to the capital, Honiara. A private fishery also began operating in the nearby community of Babahairo in 2012 (Hamilton et al.,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The environment is characterized by complex reefs with mangrove and coastal forests. Five major reef types are represented in the study area: back, fore, fringing, and patch reefs, as well as subtidal reef flats. Reefs were demarcated using maps from the Millenium Coral Reef Mapping Project (Andrefouet et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0003">2006</a>; see Supporting Information Appendix 
  <a rid="ece34501-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece34501-sup-0001">S1</a> for definitions). We also divided the study area into nine fishing zones based on interviews with 22 expert spearfishermen from the Kia district (Figure 
  <a rid="ece34501-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34501-fig-0001">1</a>). The spearfishermen unanimously agreed Zones 1A‐D had historically experienced the greatest spearfishing pressure because the outer reefs are in close proximity to the BPFC. Zones 2A‐B and 3A‐C were further afield so there was less fishing activity due to fuel costs. In addition, few Kia fishermen had customary rights to Zones 3A‐C, which further reduced fishing pressure. Each zone has a length of at least 10 km, which encompasses the reported home ranges of 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> (Green et al., 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0020">2015</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2012, we performed 146 UVC surveys on the reef surrounding Kia (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece34501-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece34501-fig-0001">1</a>). UVC sites were selected prior to the fieldwork using a Generalized Random Tessellation Survey (GRTS; Stevens &amp; Olsen, 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0040">2004</a>), which accounted for differences in the total area of each reef type. The UVC transects consisted of 20‐min timed swims (Choat &amp; Pears, 
  <a rid="ece34501-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#ece34501-bib-0008">2003</a>) and were conducted on SCUBA at depths between 2 and 12 m. Transects ranged between 174 and 848 m in length due to varying current speeds and were usually 20 m wide (126 of 146 transects). There were 20 transects where visibility fell below 10 m and these ranged between 8 and 16 m in width. Consequently, the total transect areas varied between 2,400 and 16,960 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>. SCUBA divers worked in pairs, with one diver swimming for 20 min with the prevailing current recording the size of all adult 
  <span class="italic">C. undulatus</span> (≥35 cm total length) and 
  <span class="italic">B. muricatum</span> (≥65 cm total length) sighted within the transect boundaries, while the other diver followed and towed a geographic positioning system (GPS) device along the surface. The divers conducting the UVC surveys were trained in fish identification and estimated the total length of each fish by eye. Note that we did not observe differences in the species’ responses to divers, or behavioral differences in high and low fishing‐pressure zones within species. Please see Hamilton et al. (
