Warm and cold temperatures masculinize fish with mid-range conditions producing at most 50% females. Due to sexually dimorphic growth, southern flounder fisheries are dependent upon larger females. Wild populations could be at risk of masculinization from ESD due to globally increasing water temperatures. We evaluated the effects of habitat and temperature on wild populations of juvenile southern flounder in North Carolina, USA. While northern habitats averaged temperatures near 23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and produced the greatest proportion of females, more southerly habitats exhibited warmer temperatures (&#x0003e;27&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) and consistently produced male-biased sex ratios (up to 94% male). Rearing flounder in the laboratory under temperature regimes mimicking those of natural habitats recapitulated sex ratio differences observed across the wild populations, providing strong evidence that temperature is a key factor influencing sex ratios in nursery habitats. These studies provide evidence of habitat conditions interacting with ESD to affect a key demographic parameter in an economically important fishery. The temperature ranges that yield male-biased sex ratios are within the scope of predicted increases in ocean temperature under climate change.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Climate-change ecology</kwd><kwd>Ecophysiology</kwd><kwd>Climate-change ecology</kwd><kwd>Climate-change impacts</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100005623</institution-id><institution>NC State University | North Carolina Sea Grant, North Carolina State University (NC Sea Grant)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-R/16-SFA-20</award-id><award-id>2016-R/16-SFA-20</award-id><award-id>2016-R/16-SFA-20</award-id><award-id>2016-R/16-SFA-20</award-id><award-id>2016-R/16-SFA-20</award-id><award-id>2016-R/16-SFA-20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Honeycutt</surname><given-names>J.

This raises concerns about impacts of warming habitats on marine ecosystems and resources. Loss of suitable habitat, possible shifts in distribution and larval dispersal, and changes to larval development time have been suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Northward shifts in distribution have been found for many species on the North American Atlantic coast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, including juvenile bull sharks from the same geographic region as the current study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Importantly, these shifts are predicted to continue in the future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Many species of fish and reptiles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), a phenomenon that occurs when an organism&#x02019;s sex can be permanently influenced by the temperature in their surrounding environment, typically during a critical period of early development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. When factors in the environment including temperature affect an organism&#x02019;s sex, it is termed environmental sex determination (ESD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Teleost fishes display a great deal of sexual plasticity and a wide range of sex determination patterns including those in which sex is determined by cues from the physical and social environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. There are variations of TSD/ESD where animals can exhibit true TSD/ESD, or genetic sex determination (GSD) with temperature effects (GSD&#x02009;+&#x02009;TE), however, in either case the animal&#x02019;s phenotypic sex is dictated by the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Understanding the consequences of climate change on those species that exhibit TSD and are sensitive to temperature in their environment is critical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Studies of the potential impacts of climate change on reptiles that exhibit TSD suggest that even increases in mean temperatures of less than 2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C could severely skew sex ratios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Indeed, effects of this type have been recently described in green sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef where warming temperatures were associated with biased sex ratios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Paralichthid flounder are a genus of benthic flatfish that supports major commercial and recreational fisheries throughout the world. Southern flounder (<italic>Paralichthys lethostigma</italic>) are distributed in the southeastern United States, with populations in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast in North Carolina (NC), near the northern edge of the species range. Adult flounder are batch spawners that migrate out from estuaries to coastal waters to spawn during late fall to early winter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The fertilized eggs are buoyant and will float for two to three days until hatching. After one to two months of development in offshore waters, the larvae undergo metamorphosis before moving into rivers and settling into estuarine nursery habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Juvenile southern flounder habitats typically include estuarine waters with aquatic vegetation, shells, and mud bottoms along saltmarsh edges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Southern flounder exhibit sexually dimorphic growth, with females growing larger and faster relative to males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Due to the use of a minimum size limit as a management strategy, the southern flounder fishery is heavily dependent on females, with males rarely growing to a harvestable size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. A reduction in the proportion of females translates directly into a reduction in recruitment to the fishery. Based on survey data, there are declining trends in juvenile and adult abundances, and southern flounder are under &#x0201c;concerned&#x0201d; status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Recent assessments in NC have indicated that southern flounder are overfished, and the species was updated to &#x0201c;near threatened&#x0201d; on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List in 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Southern flounder and other Paralichthids exhibit TSD/ESD and appear to use a combination of genotypic and environmentally determined systems, where an animal with an XY genotype is a genetic male and XX is female. Individuals of XY genotype will develop as phenotypic males regardless of environmental conditions, however, XX genetic females may differentiate into phenotypic males (XX males) based on the environmental parameters to which they are exposed to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. When juveniles are reared in cooler or warmer water temperatures (18&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>) or blue background color in tanks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> during a critical early developmental stage (~35 to 65&#x02009;mm total length, TL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>), genetic females develop as males leading to masculinized sex ratios. Thus, the maximum proportion of females that can occur is approximately 50%, with male-biased sex ratios possible if temperature or other factors lead to masculinization of XX females. To date, no studies have investigated the effects of environment on juvenile sex ratios of southern flounder populations or any Paralichthids in the wild. If these fish are exposed to unfavorable conditions during the sex determination window, then wild stocks could be at risk of masculinization which would negatively impact an already declining female-dependent fishery. It is currently unknown if wild juvenile southern flounder exhibit annual or geographic variation in sex ratios. When temperature is held constant in tanks, southern flounder exhibit sex reversal to males at both 18&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, while 23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C is the optimal temperature for female development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, water temperature is a dynamic variable and does not remain constant in natural environments, instead fluctuating both daily and annually. It has been suggested that studies where temperatures are held constant may not be ideal for modeling impacts of natural environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The sex-determining window for southern flounder is estimated to occur between 35 and 65&#x02009;mm TL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, while the fish are still in their nursery habitats. While gonadal sex differentiation generally occurs between 75 and 120&#x02009;mm TL, fish cannot be accurately sexed via histological or macroscopic methods until reaching at least 120&#x02009;mm TL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. It has therefore been challenging to determine sex ratios of juvenile populations by traditional methods. Because management agencies cannot assess the sex of young juveniles, most fishery models assume a 1:1 juvenile sex ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Despite considerable study of sex determination in Paralichthid flounders, to date no Y-chromosomal marker has been described for this family of fishes. To enable characterization of nursery habitat influences on sex determination, we developed and validated a molecular biomarker technique based on gonadal expression of genes involved in sexual differentiation that allows us to sex individuals at much smaller sizes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Using this approach, young southern flounder can be captured from their juvenile habitats and sexed before reaching a body size when they emigrate from nursery areas and potentially mix with other juveniles in deeper estuarine waters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Previous studies show that post-metamorphic juvenile southern flounder settle into nursery habitats and remain around these estuarine environments for the first year of life with relatively small spatial movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Because of this aspect of the flounder life history and the ability to reliably sex flounder using gonadal biomarkers prior to moving out of nursery habitats, we can evaluate effects of habitat on sex ratios of flounder populations.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we examine the sex ratios of juvenile southern flounder populations across several years and in a number of nursery locations along the coast of NC, USA that show consistent differences in water temperatures. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that patterns of temperature variation observed in NC nursery habitats that produce male-biased juvenile sex ratios are sufficient (by themselves) to generate these skewed sex ratios. By mimicking these temperature profiles under controlled laboratory conditions while other variables were held constant, we directly examined the effects of fluctuating temperature on sex determination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Temperature of Flounder Nursery Habitats</title><p id="Par8">Data were grouped into three sampling regions that span a biogeographic break resulting from the meeting of the warmer Gulf Stream and the cooler Labrador Current (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>): (1) the Pamlico region, the most northern of our sampling locations including several sites in the Pamlico River and tributaries, (2) the Neuse River; an intermediate region including three sites, and (3) South of the New River, the most southern region, primarily sampled from Mill Creek and then supplemented with fish from two other nearby creeks.

We observed two distinct size groupings of flounder in two sampling years south of the New River in Mill Creek. In May 2016, of the 57 southern flounder captured, 51 fish (37 males, 1 female, and 12 undetermined) were on average 50.1&#x02009;mm TL, five fish were on average 120.0&#x02009;mm TL (5 females) and one male was 235&#x02009;mm TL. In June 2016, of the 49 total southern flounder captured, 39 fish (34 males, 2 females, and 3 undetermined) were on average 56.1&#x02009;mm TL, and 10 fish (2 males and 8 females) that were on average 145.6&#x02009;mm TL. Similarly, in Virginia Creek, also South of the New River, in June of 2016 there were eight fish that were on average 50.8&#x02009;mm TL (7 males and 1 female), and two fish (2 females) that were on average 146.0&#x02009;mm TL. In June of 2017 there were 49 fish captured in Mill Creek that were on average 69.7&#x02009;mm TL (48 males and 1 female), four fish that were on average 146.0&#x02009;mm TL (2 males and 2 females), and two fish (1 male and 1 undetermined) that were on average 254.5&#x02009;mm TL.

Importantly, those habitats producing the highest proportions of males also had consistently warmer water temperatures than those with lower proportions of males, as was seen in more southerly versus northerly NC nursery habitats.</p><p id="Par14">As anticipated, temperature in nursery habitats varied annually. Temperatures recorded over an equivalent spring timeframe in all habitats were significantly higher in 2015 and 2017 compared to 2016. However, this disparity in temperature did not appear to directly correlate to differences in overall sex ratios observed in those years. The proportion of males was higher in the Pamlico and Neuse regions in 2016 despite recording a lower average annual temperature than either 2015 or 2017. Although all three regions produced a greater proportion of males in 2017, this was not the case for 2015, a year that produced a higher proportion of females in the Pamlico and Neuse regions. Temperature is a cue for spawning in southern flounder, with the cooler water temperatures of fall and winter initiating an emigration to offshore waters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Variable temperatures during spawning could lead to interannual differences in sex ratios as it might lead to changes in the time of spawning and subsequently when larvae are transported back inshore to settle into nursery habitats, and ultimately what temperatures they are then exposed to as juveniles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">Temperature also varied with latitude across sampled habitats, with the most northern sites in the Pamlico region producing the coolest temperatures, and sites South of the New River recording the warmest temperatures over all sampling years. Interestingly, during the period of sex determination (i.e., when flounder would be expected to be 35&#x02013;65&#x02009;mm TL), the Pamlico region averaged closest to 23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, which was the temperature found to produce the highest proportion of females in laboratory trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This region produced the greatest proportion of females each year, exhibiting close to 50:50 sex ratios in 2014 and was even slightly female-biased in 2015. Sex ratios were more variable in the Neuse River with male-biased ratios produced most years (up to 88% male) except for 2015 when the sex ratio was 59% male. The region South of the New River consistently produced male-biased sex ratios over all years (81% to 94% male).</p><p id="Par16">These patterns of latitudinal variation in sex ratios in southern flounder have parallels in another well-studied species of fish that exhibits TSD. Some of the first studies to examine TSD in fish were conducted with the Atlantic silverside (<italic>Menidia menidia</italic>) and to date, effects of the environment on sex have been extensively studied in this species in the laboratory and the field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Studies show a correlation between latitude and the degree of ESD observed in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>menidia</italic>, with ESD more predominant in northerly latitudes where the length of the growing season declines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. For southern flounder it appears that ESD is more prevalent at southerly latitudes (at least in NC), with the greatest masculinization occurring in southern habitats compared to those farther north. Spawning of southern flounder begins earlier at more northerly latitudes and progresses southward over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This suggests that flounder larvae would settle earlier into those northern environments like the Pamlico, compared to the southern habitats. Although the fish in these studies were not aged, regional differences in size are consistent with this pattern. The overall smaller body size of juvenile flounder in the southern region suggests that they could be younger, and thus would reach the critical sex-determining window later in the summer when water temperatures are much higher and more likely to promote male development, similar to the pattern found in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>menidia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In conjunction with identifying phenotypic sex, precisely determining the age of YOY southern flounder both spatially and across the months of the spring season when fish settle into their nursery habitats could more accurately characterize the timing and impact of environment and temperature on sex determination.</p><p id="Par17">Another possibility for the smaller size of the flounder collected South of the New River is that the fish in this region might grow more slowly, thereby extending the window over which they are sensitive to their environment. The growth rates observed in NC populations of southern flounder can vary considerably, from 0.35 to 1.5&#x02009;mm per day and can vary regionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The differential growth observed among juveniles across regions could be due to food size and availability, although southern flounder that spawned earlier were not shown to be larger or faster growing than those spawned later in the season<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Female southern flounder have been shown to grow faster and larger than males, but typically this sexually dimorphic growth does not begin until larger body sizes (~200&#x02009;mm TL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>). Therefore, sex differences in growth should not account for size disparities of smaller juveniles. Surprisingly, flounder from the southern region had higher HSI but smaller body sizes. We measured HSI because fish store energy in the form of glycogen and fat in their liver tissue that can be mobilized in times of stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. This index often correlates to somatic growth as shown in previous laboratory studies of southern flounder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. It seems unlikely therefore that lack of food availability is responsible for the smaller body size of fish in southern regions. However, this was a field study and other factors such as temperature or diet composition could account for the lack of concordance between HSI and body size.</p><p id="Par18">Age-0 southern flounder in South Carolina (SC) have been shown to have bimodal distributions in length at 50 and 140&#x02009;mm TL in June<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. This phenomenon is similar to what we observed over multiple years South of the New River and could suggest that the timing of spawning and juvenile growth in this region is more comparable to that of SC populations. For example, in 2016 we captured two size groups of southern flounder and they were on average 56.1&#x02009;mm TL and 145.6&#x02009;mm TL. Although we did capture larger age-0 flounder in the Pamlico and Neuse regions, there was not the clear presence of two distinct size groupings as observed in the south. Previous studies showed that bimodal length distributions in age-0 NC southern flounder were independent of sex, generally occurred around 75 to 100&#x02009;mm TL, and were likely due to a change to a piscivorous diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Interestingly, female flounder were more prevalent in the larger size group of fish we captured South of the New River, suggesting these fish determined sex at a time when conditions were more optimal for female development.</p><p id="Par19">Additionally, these studies show that when southern flounder are reared in fluctuating temperatures in the laboratory intended to mirror those of natural temperature regimes, the sex ratio differences observed among these natural habitats are recapitulated. Temperature profiles across different nursery habitats exhibited similar patterns of fluctuations, although between any two habitats temperature could differ in mean recordings more than 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. In addition, a northern nursery habitat in the Pamlico Sound (Swanquarter Bay) that produced 1:1 sex ratios had an average temperature of 23.2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in 2014 during the sex determination period. This is consistent with the observed optimal temperature for production of females of 23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C that yields 1:1 sex ratios in the laboratory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In the current study, when the temperature profile of this habitat was reproduced in a recirculating system to obtain temperature fluctuations that similarly averaged 23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C during sex determination, this regime produced the greatest proportion of female flounder (35% female), which was significantly higher than those of the 19&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (17% female) or 27&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (0% female) treatments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Although the 23&#x02009;&#x000b0;C fluctuating treatment yielded the greatest proportion of females, it was still mildly male biased at 65% male based on an expected 1:1 sex ratio. This ratio is comparable to what was observed for the northern Pamlico region for 2016 and 2017, where sex ratios were 61% and 67% respectively, while other sampling habitats farther south produced a greater proportion of males both years (82% and 94% male). The 27&#x02009;&#x000b0;C fluctuating treatment that produced 100% males was representative of the southern sampling habitats, South of the New River, which also displayed significantly male-biased sex ratios in field collections. Although previous field sampling did not include a habitat comparable to the 19&#x02009;&#x000b0;C treatment, it could be representative of nursery environments farther north of our study areas towards the Albemarle Sound, a region in NC that juvenile southern flounder are also known to inhabit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, or possibly even habitats farther north as projections of shifting habitats and species distributions northward due to climate change have been predicted for the North American coasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The results of our study, conducted with other physical parameters (i.e. salinity, oxygen, light, etc.) maintained similarly across treatments, suggests that temperature may be the predominant factor that is influencing sex determination in natural habitats.</p><p id="Par20">Warm temperatures have been strongly correlated to masculinized sex ratios in southern flounder in fish reared in tanks (constant temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, fluctuating temperatures; current study) and now in natural populations. Exposure to temperature fluctuations has been shown to impact sex ratios in fish and turtles that exhibit TSD/ESD (<italic>M</italic>. <italic>menidia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>; <italic>Carassius auratus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>; <italic>Pimephales promelas</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>; <italic>Trachemys scripta</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>). In the case of sea turtles, cool temperatures tend to produce males and warm temperatures produce more females, so global warming could feminize sea turtle populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. A recent study on sex ratios of sea turtles near the Great Barrier Reef showed variation in sex ratios across regions, with mildly female-biased ratios in cooler, southern beaches and extreme female-biased sex ratios in warmer more northern nesting sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This latitudinal variation in sex ratios of natural turtle populations shows a response due to TSD in a warming environment similar to what we observed across a temperature cline in southern flounder. This phenomenon may not be limited to turtles and southern flounder and should be investigated for other species that exhibit TSD.</p><p id="Par21">Overall, our findings indicate that there is consistent variation in the water temperatures across nursery habitats in NC that are inhabited by juvenile southern flounder during the critical period of development for ESD/TSD. These temperature differences are associated with variation in juvenile sex ratios across regions. Warmer nursery habitats in southern NC produced significantly more male southern flounder compared to those environments farther north. We were able to reprise these differences under controlled laboratory conditions, providing further evidence that water temperature is causally responsible for the sex ratio differences observed in nursery habitats. These studies provide evidence of TSD affecting a key demographic parameter in wild populations of an important fishery species. With a fishery dependent on females and global ocean temperatures projected to significantly increase, these temperature effects on sex ratios could be a significant concern for wild flounder stocks and potentially other species that exhibit TSD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sampling Wild Juvenile Southern Flounder</title><p id="Par22">Juvenile southern flounder were collected with the assistance of North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF) biologists during the routine juvenile monitoring Program 120 (P120), the North Carolina Estuarine Trawl Survey.
