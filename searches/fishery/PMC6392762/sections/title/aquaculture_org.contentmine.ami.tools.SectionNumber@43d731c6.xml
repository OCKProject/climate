 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the 1980s, aquaculture production has been increasing rapidly, making it a big contributor to seafood supply to the global market. Hence, projections of the economics of fisheries should ideally take this into account because a lower supply of wild-caught fish could well be filled by farmed fish. Here, we decided to limit the scope of our analysis to marine fisheries for a number of reasons. First, the current analysis is already massive and could lay the foundation for a more comprehensive follow-up analysis. Second, a combined analysis of the wild and farmed fish sectors under climate change is worthy of a separate study. Third, Lam 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (

   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>) undertook an analysis of different production scenarios, including supply from fish farms. The authors found that, under high CO
  <sub>2</sub> emission levels (i.e., the Paris Agreement not implemented), global marine fisheries revenues could decrease by up to 15% with faster than the recent rate of aquaculture production and increase by up to 40% with slower than recent growth rates. Aquaculture growth was estimated at 4% in 2015, which is percentage points below the 6% mean growth estimated for the period 2001â€“2015 and well below the double digits recorded throughout the 1980s and 1990s (

  </a>). Hence, the latter scenario of slower aquaculture growth explored in (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>) is more likely in the future, implying that our results may not be completely off even if aquaculture is taken into account.
