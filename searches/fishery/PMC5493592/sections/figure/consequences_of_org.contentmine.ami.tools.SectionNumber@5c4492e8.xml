  <div class="title">Consequences of non-stationary productivity for recovery of currently depleted stocks.</div>
  <p>Shown are recovery probabilities over a 10-year timeline under no fishing (
   <span class="italic">F</span>=0; 
   <span class="bold">a</span>) and under fishing at 90% of maximum sustainable yield (
   <span class="italic">F</span>=0.9
   <span class="italic">F</span>
   <sub>MSY</sub>; 
   <span class="bold">b</span>). Black circles indicate probability point estimates; vertical lines display uncertainty, where the lower (upper) limit is assessed as the proportion of trajectories exceeding the 10% (90%) posterior 
   <span class="italic">B</span>
   <sub>MSY</sub> quantile. For comparison, red circles give the predicted recovery probability for each stock based on the deterministic Grahamâ€“Schaefer theory where the intrinsic productivity is fixed at its mean historical value. In the deterministic case, a stock recovers with probability 1 or 0.
