  <div class="title">Examples of non-stationary productivity.</div>
  <p>Two example stocks are shown: Atlantic cod from the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada, fisheries region 4TVn (
   <span class="bold">a</span>,
   <span class="bold">c</span>) and bluefin tuna from the East Atlantic (
   <span class="bold">b</span>,
   <span class="bold">d</span>). (
   <span class="bold">a</span>,
   <span class="bold">b</span>) The annual surplus production for each stock (circles are observed values, 
   <span class="italic">B</span>
   <sub>obs</sub>, solid line is biomass-predicted from the stationary model with fixed 
   <span class="italic">r</span>, denoted 
   <span class="italic">B</span>
   <sub>fixed</sub>, and the dashed line is the biomass-predicted from the non-stationary model, 
   <span class="italic">B</span>
   <sub>rt</sub>). (
   <span class="bold">c</span>,
   <span class="bold">d</span>) The theoretical maximum sustainable yield (crosses are recorded catches). Grey shading indicates when productivity is higher than would be predicted based on a static productivity model (potential underfishing) and red shading indicates lower-than-expected productivity that would promote overfishing.
