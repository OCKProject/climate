   </div>=0.41 (0.36, 0.47). While many individual stocks exhibited a long-term productivity trend (
   <span class="italic">δ</span>), the overall mean was not appreciably different from zero, indicating no directed long-term change in globally averaged productivity over time (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c,d</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples of two iconic fish stocks highlight the practical consequences of productivity variation in a changing environment (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). The Gulf of St Lawrence Atlantic cod (
   <span class="italic">Gadus morhua</span>) stock collapsed and was placed under moratorium in the early 1990s after realized surplus production had gone negative, but catches remained high
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2a,c</a>). Similarly, bluefin tuna was proposed for a CITES trade ban in 2010, following a period of low realized productivity and rampant overfishing in the early 2000s (ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2b,d</a>). Inferred trends in surplus production and sustainable yield (dashed lines, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>) were observed as long-term directional changes in the case of cod (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2a,c</a>) or as oscillating regimes in tuna (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2b,d</a>). In both cases, the biomass available for harvest was at times systematically over- or underestimated in a static productivity framework and likely led to periods of unrecognized, or ‘silent’, over- and underfishing (red and grey shading in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, respectively). Fixed harvest strategies effectively reproduce the long-term historical average productivity from non-stationary models (equal red and grey areas, 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>) and, therefore, poorly capture contemporary productivity over much of the observed period. These examples illustrate how changes in the underlying stock productivity are ignored by static models but can be tracked within a non-stationary framework.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For depleted populations, systematic productivity variation suggests that recovery should be forecast from recent observations that best characterize the current productivity state and its variability, rather than from observations back in time. Examples of non-stationary biomass forecasting are provided in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>. Historical variation in

   </div>) is estimated from the observed time series such that the interannual changes in biomass are accurately predicted within measurement uncertainty (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a,b</a>). Ensemble forecasts based on realizations of the non-stationary productivity model are then propagated into the future with associated biomass predictions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3c,d</a>). Note that the positive contemporary productivity regimes for Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod results in upward trending biomass forecasts, while in contrast, biomass trajectories are trending downwards for North Sea herring, which occupies a negative productivity regime at the end of the observed period (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3c,d</a>). The recovery probability for a stock after a period into the future is taken from the relative overlap in the histograms with respect to the posterior distributions of the forecasted biomass and the estimated rebuilding target (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3e,f</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the assumption of no fishing (
   <span class="italic">F</span>=0), posterior ensemble forecasts estimate that 57% of depleted stocks are predicted to recover within a 10-year time window (defined as having probability of recovery greater than half; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>); however, appreciable uncertainty exists in the ensemble and some proportion of all stocks’ trajectories do not recover because of a nonzero probability of low-productivity regimes in the future (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). This contrasts with results from traditional static productivity model when the intrinsic productivity (
   <span class="italic">r</span>) is assumed to be stationary (for example, ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">7</a>). In this case, the mean recovery time is ∼3 years and recovery time probability is deterministic—either a stock recovers or it does not. The number of stocks recovering in the deterministic case is 78% (
