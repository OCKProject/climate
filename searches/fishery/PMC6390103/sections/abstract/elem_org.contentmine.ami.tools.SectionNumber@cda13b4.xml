 <p id="Par1">The phylogeography of 
  <span class="italic">Schizothorax waltoni</span>, an endemic and endangered tetraploid schizothoracine fish in the Yarlung Tsangpo River (YLTR) on southern margin of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), was investigated using two mitochondrial DNA regions and eleven microsatellite loci. Analyses of concatenated sequences of cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> (1141 bp) and the control region (712 bp) revealed high haplotype diversity and moderate nucleotide diversity. High genetic diversity was observed based on microsatellite variation. Both mtDNA and microsatellite analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between the eastern population (Mainling) and the other four populations to the west, and non-significant genetic differentiation amongst the three central populations in the west. Significant genetic differentiation was observed between the western population (Shigatse) and the three central populations based on microsatellite analyses alone. Bayesian skyline plot analyses showed that 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> experienced a pronounced population expansion 0.05 to 0.10 Ma. Hierarchical structure analyses of microsatellite data indicated that 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> could be split into three groups (western, central and eastern YLTR). The results indicate that three management units should be considered for 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span>. Our findings highlight the need for the conservation and effective management of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span>, which is a key member of the endemic and highly threatened fishes of the QTP.
