 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishes are the most abundant group of vertebrates, and nearly half of their number are found in freshwater systems that constitute &lt; 0.01% of the earth’s water
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Most freshwater systems now face multiple threats, all linked to anthropogenic activity, such that freshwater fish populations in many regions are endangered
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Indeed, anthropogenic effects are well documented in terms of localised and global extinctions of freshwater fishes on all human-inhabited continents
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>, leading to the suggestion that the world has already entered a sixth mass extinction event

  </span>.

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Schizothoracine fishes (snow trout or snow minnows) consist of 15 genera and &gt;100 species that are mainly distributed in Asia
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Of these, ~76 species and subspecies belonging to 11 genera occur on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and its adjacent area
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>. Karyotype and DNA content analyses indicate that these fishes may be tetraploid, hexaploid or octoploid
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>. The genus 
  <span class="italic">Schizothorax</span> includes 63 valid species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, of which ~40 species and subspecies are found in China

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Lhasa schizothoracin, 
  <span class="italic">Schizothorax waltoni</span> Regan 1905 (Cyprinidae: Schizothoracinae), is an endemic tetraploid fish in the Yarlung Tsangpo River (YLTR) on the southern margin of the QTP
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Because limited information is available concerning population trends for this species, 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> is assessed as being of Least Concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. However, in the new Red List of China’s Vertebrates
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>, 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> is assessed as Vulnerable. It is one of the most important commercial fishes of this region and is fished mainly by set gill nets and electrofishing. It is long-lived, cold-adapted, has a slow growth rate, late sexual maturity and low fecundity
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>, and is therefore especially vulnerable to human activities such as overfishing, biological invasion by exotic fishes and construction of hydroelectric dams
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>–

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before the 1950s, schizothoracine fishes in Tibet were indirectly protected due to Tibetan religious belief, with restrictions on fishing and fish eating being imposed by the supreme Tibetan religious authority
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. However, with the increase of immigrants and tourists from inland areas and the rising demand for fish and fisheries products, overexploitation and illegal fishing are now serious threats to the long-term survival of schizothoracine fishes in Tibet
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Concurrently, many non-native species (e.g. goldfish (
  <span class="italic">Carassius auratus</span>) and topmouth gudgeon (
  <span class="italic">Pseudorasbora parva</span>)) have been introduced into the YLTR and are now out-competing and displacing the endemic schizothoracine fishes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. In addition, ongoing construction of hydroelectric dams has contributed substantially to habitat degradation for endemic fishes. As a consequence, 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> is now threatened by sharp declines in population sizes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. Conservation of the natural populations of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> is now of primary concern, in particular given the limited geographic distribution of this species.
 </p>
 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the ecological and fisheries importance of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span>, little is known about the genetic diversity and genetic structure of its populations, and the information that does exist is derived indirectly from phylogenetic analyses rather than from population genetic analyses. Understanding the level of genetic diversity and population genetic structure of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> is important for the effective conservation (e.g. hatchery production of juveniles from appropriate stocks) and management (e.g. restrictions on fishing activities) of the species.
 </p>
 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present study, we used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome 
  <span class="italic">b</span> gene (Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span>) and control region (CR) sequencing and an assessment of eleven polymorphic microsatellite loci to evaluate genetic diversity and genetic differentiation within and amongst populations, and to explore conservation management strategies for this species. The challenge faced by a study such as this when working on a threatened species with limited geographic distribution is to sample individuals from sufficient populations and across as broad a geographic range as possible. The results of this study provide new insights into the population genetic structure of this threatened fish that may contribute to conservation, management and sustainable utilisation of this important species, and which may also help to provide context for other threatened endemic fish species in the same or similar river systems.
