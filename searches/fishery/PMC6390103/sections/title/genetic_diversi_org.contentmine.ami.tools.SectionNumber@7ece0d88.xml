 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Genetic diversity has been identified by the IUCN as an important form of biodiversity, deserving conservation within each population
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Our study, using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers, revealed that genetic variation is relatively high in 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span>, despite the threats this species presently faces. The mtDNA results (both genetic variation indices 
  <span class="italic">Hd</span> and π) reveal that 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> has high levels of genetic diversity comparable to other schizothoracine fishes found on or around the QTP

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. However, when combined, the mtDNA results indicate that 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> falls into a group with a high level of haplotype diversity (
  <span class="italic">Hd</span> &gt; 0.5) and a moderate level of nucleotide diversity (
  <span class="italic">π</span> &gt; 0.005)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>, which is different from the genetic di
  <span class="bold">v</span>ersity pattern (high haplotype diversity but low nucleotide diversity) observed in other schizothoracine fishes

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the tetraploid inheritance pattern of schizothoracine fishes, few population genetic studies based on microsatellite markers for these fishes have been reported, meaning that judging absolute levels of nuclear DNA diversity is difficult. The mean number of bands per microsatellite locus (24.18) of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> falls between the two previous estimates with which comparison can be made
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A high level of mtDNA haplotype diversity and a moderate level of nucleotide diversity in 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> are indicative of either secondary contact between differentiated lineages or a large stable population with a long evolutionary history
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Differentiating between these two explanations is difficult. The QTP has undergone several periods of pronounced uplift since the Quaternary, creating substantial changes in the climate and the natural environment
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span> and significantly influencing the distributional ranges of schizothoracine fishes. Secondary contact of formerly isolated 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> populations may therefore have occurred due to the uplift and climate change of the QTP. In support of the second explanation, we note that neutrality tests and mismatch distribution analyses confirmed the likely existence of a stable population with no recent expansion events for 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span>.
