  <span class="italic">K</span>-selected life-history characteristics, 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> is susceptible to growth overfishing and stock depletion

  </span>. Because of the inherent difficulties in studying 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span>, the biology of the species continues to be poorly understood, a fact that has hampered its effective conservation and allowed for conservation planning only on a local scale (i.e. the Lhasa Wild Fish Protection Regulation).

 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fishes of the YLTR face a range of anthropogenic threats, including heavy fishing pressure, habitat loss/modification, climate change and introduced species. Of particular concern, however, is dam construction that is both an immediate and long-term threat to connectivity. The environmental impact of greatest concern is that the dam changes the flow of the river from an upstream river valley to a reservoir
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Additionally, there may be changes in the downstream water quality including river temperature, nutrient load, dissolved gases, heavy metals, and sediments
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Dams may cause habitat loss, change fish reproductive environments, and hinder breeding fish migration, resulting in a substantial decline of fish genetic resources

  </span>. In 2014, construction of the Zangmu Dam (with a fish ladder), the first dam on the main stream of the YLTR, was completed. Another seven (at least) dams will be built in the main stream of the YLTR in the future and all seven dams are to be located in the region between SN and ML. These dams will add to the existing natural barrier to fish movement that already exists in this region caused by the Nierikar Waterfall. Existing genetic differences between the lineages may be enhanced by the construction of dams that may further reduce or prevent downstream (i.e., SN to ML) movement of fishes even more than the existing Nierikar Waterfall. Although the dam plan includes fish ladders, the success of a fish ladder is unknown and will need to be evaluated over a long time to determine its success, given that even the most efficient protective measures cannot prevent some level of deterioration of ecosystem function

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) and management units (MUs) are two important concepts in conservation genetics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. An ESU is defined as a population that exchanges few migrants with others and that has been geographically isolated for long enough to be genetically distinct and independent
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. High genetic differentiation (between ML and the four other populations) but no obvious population structure was observed in 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> based on mtDNA analysis. However, moderate genetic differentiation and pronounced population structure are found based on microsatellite analysis. Because no reciprocal monophyly was found in this study, we propose a single ESU for the five populations of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span>. Given the results of the microsatellite analyses, three groups ([SG], [MG + QX + SN], and [ML]) should be defined as different MUs worthy of protection as distinct stocks. However, 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> collected from the western region (SG or MG) have been used as broodstock in the artificial reproduction programme at ML. The question arises whether these western parental fish are genetically similar to the local fish in ML and whether the juveniles (used for reintroduction downstream) hatched from the western parents are able to adapt to the area of their release (e.g. ML). Our results clearly show that western 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> (fish from SG, MG, QX, SN) are genetically different from the fish at ML, in the east. As such, we suggest that it is appropriate to cancel, or at least postpone, the further collection of sexually mature 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> from the western region to be used as broodstock for release of juveniles at ML until tools enabling the fitness of individuals to be determined in specific environments become available.
