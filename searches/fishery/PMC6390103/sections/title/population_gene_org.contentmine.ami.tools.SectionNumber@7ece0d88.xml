 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given their different evolutionary histories, mutation rates, modes of inheritance, and effective population sizes, mtDNA markers are expected to reflect more accurately the historical (ancestral) situation, whereas nuclear DNA markers are expected to better reflect the contemporary situation. Taken together, the results may be informative in terms of understanding how landscape changes (e.g., major and rapid uplift on the QTP resulting in isolation in a high altitude environment) have influenced the distributions over time of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> and its population genetic structure

 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of concatenated mtDNA sequence data indicated that there was moderate-high and significant genetic differentiation between ML (most easterly population) and the other four upstream populations (SG, MG, QX, SN) which formed an undifferentiated group. However, all five populations had private haplotypes which suggests that there must be some minor barrier to gene flow amongst populations to maintain this low level of differentiation over many generations. In the phylogenetic analyses, two clusters (evolutionary lineages) were identified. However, the haplotypes clustered in one subgroup were not from a specific population, but were from all five populations (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>; Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The shared mtDNA haplotypes and overlapping spatial distributions of the fishes in the two evolutionary lineages most probably reflect a scenario of secondary contact after a period of isolation. Historically, geological events and climate change have significantly influenced the diversity and population genetic structure of endemic organisms on the QTP

  </span>. Towards the eastern end of the YLTR, between Shannan and Mainling, there is the 30 m high Nierikar Waterfall (NW, meaning “fishes are blocked in here” in Tibetan). This waterfall, which is located at the Jiacha Gorge (3,300 m above sea level (asl)), impedes contemporary upstream migration of fishes. However, due to the several glacial lakes impounded by the moraine
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>, the Nierikar Waterfall might not have impeded past (historical) upstream dispersal of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span>. In the late Pleistocene to early Holocene, these ancient glacial lakes were located at the main stream lying immediately upstream of the Tsangpo Great Gorge
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. According to He and Chen
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>, the surface elevation of these ancient glacial lakes (3,800 to 3,530 m asl) exceeded the elevation of the Nierikar Waterfall (3,300 m asl). Therefore, the ancient lakes could have extended to the upper stream of the Jiacha Gorge and the Nierikar Waterfall observed today and would not have prevented the upstream dispersal of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> in the Pleistocene
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>. No major cascades or waterfalls are found along the YLTR between Shigatse (SG) and Shannan (SN), and thus there is no impediment to gene flow (connectivity) amongst the populations of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> within this ~300 km of the river. As a consequence of the river’s morphology and geological history, pronounced mtDNA genetic differentiation was observed between ML (downstream of the Nierikar Waterfall) and the four other populations. The divergence times amongst the main clades are correlated with later Kunlun-Huanghe Movement (about 0.6 Ma–1.1 Ma) and the Gonghe Movement (~0.15 Ma)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
  </span>, results are consistent with the main divergence time reported for 
  <span class="italic">S. o’connori</span> in the same region (0.30 Ma–0.43 Ma)

 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pronounced population genetic structure of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> was identified by analysis of microsatellite variation which reflects contemporary (last few generations) gene flow. Consistent with the mtDNA results, the nuclear DNA results revealed significant genetic divergence between ML in the east and the four upstream (west) populations, and they also revealed small but significant genetic divergence between SG (most western population) and the three central populations (MG, QX, SN). Such discordance between nuclear and mtDNA markers is an oft reported phenomenon
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. However, no obvious population genetic structure was found based on the analyses of 257 putatively neutral microsatellite bands. Thus, the genetic signal of differentiation is largely or solely contained within the nine bands that are under putative selection, highlighting the importance of retaining signal-bearing bands (alleles) under certain circumstances for quantification of spatial genetic differentiation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. We do, however, note that retention of bands that are putatively under selection will violate some assumptions of neutrality associated with many analyses. In addition, we note that the treatment of codominant microsatellite loci as dominant loci (allelic phenotypes were transformed into a presence/absence data set) is unusual but is warranted in the present case given the tetraploid nature of the focal species. Regardless, from a management perspective, the data set is informative because it provides evidence of spatial genetic structure that might otherwise have been overlooked.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The existence of two evolutionary lineages received strong support from the STRUCTURE and BAPS analyses of microsatellite variation, which showed that the SG (most westerly) and ML (most easterly) populations represent two different clusters of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span>, whereas a mixed cluster was found in the three central populations (MG, QX, SN). These results were confirmed by the PCoA and by a significant pattern of IBD. This pronounced microsatellite population genetic structure reflects the contemporary erosion of genetic differences that accumulated when the original population of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> was split into two, and is, in effect, a secondary zone of contact between the two contemporary lineages. In terms of directional gene flow between the two lineages there are no substantial waterfalls along the YLTR in the region of the three central populations (MG, QX, SN) today, although several small waterfalls are found between SG and QX which may act to reduce or prevent gene flow and/or dispersal up the river (from QX and further upstream to SG in the west) but not in the other direction. These results indicate that waterfalls in the far eastern (near ML) and far western (near SG) regions, specifically between the populations SN and ML and between SG and QX, may block contemporary gene flow of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span>, whereas contemporary gene flow is likely to be frequent amongst the three central populations where there are no waterfalls. Clearly, these findings and our interpretation of them, will benefit from further sampling of 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> populations, both in the west, above the Nierikar Waterfall to test clade diversity, and in particular to the east, below the Nierikar Waterfall, from where we presently only have one population. Further sampling in the east will help to quantify just how widely distributed and abundant this fish is in a region that appears to be outside its main range of distribution.
