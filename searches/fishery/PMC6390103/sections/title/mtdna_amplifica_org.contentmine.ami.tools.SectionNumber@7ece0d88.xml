  <span class="italic">b</span> (Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span>, 1141 bp) and partial control region (CR, 712 bp) were sequenced according to Guo 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span> sequences were amplified using primers L14724 and H15915
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>, and CR sequences were amplified using DL-F and DL-R
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span> sequences were sequenced in forward and reverse directions, CR sequences were sequenced in the forward direction.

 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Multiple sequence alignment, haplotype diversity (
  <span class="italic">Hd</span>), nucleotide diversity (

  <span class="italic">K</span>), median-joining network and Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) genetic distances between populations were performed/estimated following Guo 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. We focussed primarily on the concatenated sequence (Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span> + CR) results because Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span> + CR provided most information. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was carried out using Arlequin 3.5
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span> to test for genetic differentiation amongst populations/regions. 10,000 permutations were performed to examine statistical significance of fixation indices (
  <span class="italic">Φ</span>). Correction for multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini-Yekutieli method false discovery rate (BY-FDR)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>, and comparisons were considered significant at

 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine relationships amongst populations and to test for evidence of historical dispersal, phylogenetic analysis was employed based on Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span>, CR and the concatenated data set (Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span> + CR) independently using neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) in MEGA 5.0
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. Except for the HKY + G (Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span>), T92 + G (CR) and HKY + G (Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span> + CR) models used for ML analyses, the other procedures of phylogenetic analysis were carried out following Guo 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>

  <span class="italic">S. o’connori</span> (GenBank accession no. KC513575), 
  <span class="italic">S. macropogon</span> (KC020113) and 
  <span class="italic">Schizopygopsis younghusbandi</span> (KC351895) were used as outgroups.

 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed to build Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) trees with Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span> and the concatenated mtDNA data (Cyt

  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>, and divergence time amongst the main clades were added on the MCMC trees. Coalescent-based Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) and mismatch distributions were used to estimate historical population dynamics. BSPs were carried out following Guo 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> to estimate the time variation of effective population size to determine demographic history. Mismatch distributions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> were implemented in Arlequin 3.5 and DnaSP 5.1
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. Tajima’s 
  <span class="italic">D</span> and Fu’s

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. The sum of squared deviations (
  <span class="italic">SSD</span>) and the raggedness index (

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. All 
  <span class="italic">P</span>-values were corrected using the BY-FDR. The population expansion time in years (T) was estimated as described by Guo 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. The generation time for 
  <span class="italic">S. waltoni</span> was estimated to be 10 years based on age of female maturation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
  </span>. We only considered female age due to the maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. Mutation rates of Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span>, CR and Cyt 
  <span class="italic">b</span> + CR were assumed to be 1.0%, 3.6% and 1.69% per site per million years, respectively
