 <div class="title">Results of Ecosim simulations.</div>
 <p>Biomass time series are plotted as black points. The relative biomass results from the model are plotted as lines. Simulations without sea-ice forcing are shown in grey; simulations with sea-ice forcing are shown in black. The group-specific sum of squares (SS) difference between simulation results and observed data are shown for each species.</p>
