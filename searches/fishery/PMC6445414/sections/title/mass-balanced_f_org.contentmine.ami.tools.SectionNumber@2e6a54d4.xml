 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this study, the food web of the WAP was simplified into 35 single- and multi-species groups, and these groups were selected to represent all levels of the food web, from detritus to apex predators. (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214814.s001" href="#pone.0214814.s001">S1 File</a> for group definitions). Due to the importance of krill in the region [

  <a rid="pone.0214814.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0214814.ref031">31</a>] were represented as single-species groups. It was our intention that this model eventually be developed into a spatial model (Ecospace) that can be used to inform the development of marine protected areas in the region. All currently monitored species seem likely to feature in a research and monitoring plan associated with a new MPA and were modeled as single species. Other species, such as non-krill zooplankton, phytoplankton, and fishes for which relatively little data exist, were combined into multi-species functional groups.
