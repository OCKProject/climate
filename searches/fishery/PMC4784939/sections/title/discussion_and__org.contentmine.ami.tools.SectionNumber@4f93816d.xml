 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our empirical investigation advances the conceptual understanding of social limits to human adaptation. Social factors can act as either barriers or limits to adaptation depending on when and how they influence action and outcomes. Our study highlights many examples of where key, interacting psycho-social and structural factors might render adaptation 
  <span class="italic">ineffective</span> rather than simply 
  <span class="italic">inefficient</span> as a response to climate change. It also highlights how social limits can apply to specific adaptation strategies, be reached before ecological and technological limits, and how a single factor or set of factors may be experienced as a limit in some contexts but not others.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our data highlights both psycho-social and structural dimensions to limits, which are closely linked in many cases. A large body of research, as synthesised in the IPCC fifth assessment report [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref008">8</a>], has recognised the potential of psycho-social and structural factors to block or divert adaptation. Psycho-social and structural constraints (barriers) on adaptation include perceptions of risk, identity, lifestyle choices, competing values, property rights and rigid tenure arrangements, and a lack of co-ordinating institutions and appropriate regulatory structures [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref008">8</a>]. Our research argues that under certain conditions these factors already do or are anticipated to limit adaptation in practice. Emerging research on limits supports our claim.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In their conceptual review Adger et al. ([
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref016">16</a>]: 338) ague that “the existence of diverse, and sometimes incommensurable, values held by the actors involved in decision-making around adaptation can act as limits if these values are not deliberated”. Many of the limits identified by respondents in our study relate to the conflicting interests and values of different actors playing out at multiple levels, including commercial and recreational fisheries, reef and non-reef industries, and local and global enterprises. In emerging empirical work, identities, sense of place, and conflicting values and interests are recurrent limits to adaptation. Identities and sense of place tend to arise at the micro-level as ‘self-imposed’ limits to adaptation, which are nevertheless extremely difficult if not impossible to shift [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref042">42</a>]. For instance, Warner et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref042">42</a>] found that farmers in Costa Rica identified so strongly with being rice farmers that few adaptation strategies were available to effectively reduce their vulnerability to water stress and climate change. Conflicting values and interests emerge at multiple organisational levels: among single actor groups and, often, between different actors, industries and communities. Conflicting demands for water, for instance, were found to impose widespread limits to adaptation across Alpine, Riverine and Catchment ecosystems, industries and communities in Australia [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref018">18</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other limits emerged from institutional inertia or mis-matches. This is illustrated in different ways by limits to stewardship in the Coral Reef Finfish Fishery (no control over recreational fisher access to the fishery) and limits to effort reduction in the East Coast Trawl Fishery (no control over market price). Institutional mismatches also played a role in perpetuating negative externalities from the adjacent coastline and catchment. Examples of structural limits to adaptation in the literature include the rigid tenure arrangements of ‘terroir’ which prevent relocation of wine producers in line with ecological adaptations of grape varieties [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref043">43</a>], institutional inertia in planning policy and legislation [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref044">44</a>] and, the failure of institutions or market mechanisms (e.g., water trading) to mediate conflicting water demands, which for downstream users can be experienced as significant limits to adaptation [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref018">18</a>]. Relatively few studies appear to have examined limits to adaptation that emerge from macro-level interactions. One exception is the research by Laube et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref045">45</a>] who found that international trade regimes and associated market competition imposed social limits on farmers adapting to water scarcity by taking up new agricultural technologies in Ghana.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our study has several broad implications for adaptation policy and planning. First, by identifying important social limits with real consequences for adaptation outcomes, it highlights the need to consider ‘limits to adaptation’ in vulnerability assessments prior to implementation of particular strategies. Second, it shows that limits can emerge in social, economic and political domains that are different from the level at which people experience climate change and undergo adaptation (see also [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref046">46</a>]). Hence, to overcome such limits requires engagement with a wide range of sectors and stakeholders. For instance, in the Great Barrier Reef case addressing relationships between reef and non-reef industries is important. Third, contrary to the literature’s relatively narrow focus on ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change our study indicates a general need to consider a broader suite of factors, which may include issues such as market processes, marketing, and improving representation and collective action.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Co-ordinated policy between stakeholders is also required to simultaneously address psycho-social and structural limits at multiple organisational levels. We hypothesised that at larger scales as values and institutions become more diverse, complex and contradictory limits would become more intractable [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref018">18</a>]. Our analysis suggests, however, that the mutability of social limits from the perspective of stakeholders is more varied and depends on where stakeholders see opportunities for change. Reef stakeholders view limits arising from externalities emergent from land-use practices and underlying beliefs as particularly intractable. Whereas some existing market-based limits are expected to shift in response to effective local to global marketing campaigns.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contextual nature of social limits to adaptation is important and highly challenging for management and policy. As articulated by Felgenhauer ([
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref017">17</a>]: 214) there are several options available to actors and policy makers upon reaching the social limits to adaptation including “investment in more of the same technology [approach], implementation of new and more effective adaptation, or transformational adaptation”. However, this implication that other options may be available to some if not all actors before transformation is required, creates a dilemma for assessing claims of residual, unavoidable loss and potential compensation (e.g., UNFCCC Warsaw International Mechanism). The IPCC fifth assessment report states that: “a limit is a point when an intolerable risk must be accepted; the objective itself must be relinquished; or some adaptive transformation must take place to avoid intolerable risk” ([
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref008">8</a>]: 906). Yet, the report also recognizes the significant ethical complexity of assessing what is an ‘intolerable risk’ across cultures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is, we argue, unresolved ambiguity in the science and policy of limits about what constitutes a ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ social limit and, by extension, what comprises unavoidable and unacceptable losses that necessitate transformation. What Klein et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref008">8</a>] may regard as ‘soft’ limits are currently experienced as effectively absolute limits in the Great Barrier Reef region given existing path dependencies and institutional inertia [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref018">18</a>]. Yet, these limits apply to some but not all of the adaptation strategies available to particular industries. Reflecting our approach, Felgenhauer [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref017">17</a>] puts forward the idea of an adaptation response ladder to depict how alternative strategies are employed as others reach their limit until no further options are available. He further suggests that once limits are passed failure may be linear or non-linear, and losses may be more or less recoverable. This interpretation of social limits contrasts the non-linear, threshold models advocated by, for example, Dow et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref015">15</a>]. We argue that understanding how limits differentially apply to sectors, strategies and particular climate impacts can help to prioritize adaptation investments and avoid strategies that are more prone to failure. Our approach also highlights, as above, that diverse interventions are required to overcome limits.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As well as revealing the specific nature of how limits to adaptation for reef-based industries unfold in the Great Barrier Reef region, our study uncovers different, more generalisable, mechanisms by which limits emerge. In our study, adaptation strategies failed to deliver desirable outcomes in three ways. First, reminiscent of economic limits, the effort (social costs) of pursuing a particular strategy exceeded the benefits received in terms of desirable outcomes. In the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery operators migrated north in the aftermath of an extreme weather event but for some businesses the benefits accrued did not mitigate the costs of catch declines. Second, the particular strategy did not actually address the real source of vulnerability. In the East Coast Trawl Fishery there is an assumption that vulnerability emerges from stock availability when it actually derives from market competition, hence effort buy-out strategies may fail. Third, the benefits derived from a particular strategy are undermined by external factors. Stewardship by reef industries can be significantly undermined by externalities from catchment land-use, which beyond a particular point are experienced as limits. These latter two pathways are not yet well recognised limits to adaptation and highlight the need to interrogate the diversity of social limits to adaptation.</p>
