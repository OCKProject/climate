 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Research is beginning to challenge the assumption that adaptation can avert all impacts from climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref004">4</a>]. Under certain conditions adaptation fails [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref006">6</a>]. It is, therefore, necessary to understand what adaptation can and cannot do, and to identify limits to adaptation–the points at which it fails to alleviate impacts or creates more vulnerabilities than it addresses [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref008">8</a>]. Recognising limits helps to prioritise adaptation responses, avoid strategies that may fail, and identify places and sectors that require compensation to offset probable losses.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies of limits to climate change adaptation have focused on ecological, technical and economic limits. Limits to adaptation include for example: the temperature at which a species fails to acclimatise physiologically to warmer temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref010">10</a>]; the amount of sea level rise that technologies like a seawall can no longer hold back, or; the point at which adaptation measures cost more than the impacts they avert [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref011">11</a>]. Different adaptation strategies such as adapting to warmer ocean temperatures through acclimatisation, evolutionary adaptation or distributional range shifts are subject to distinct limits [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref010">10</a>]. Limits thereby remain highly uncertain [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref012">12</a>] but are typically viewed as being insurmountable or absolute [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref013">13</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emerging evidence in the social sciences suggests that social factors, related to how people understand and experience climate change, can also manifest as limits to adaptation [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref008">8</a>]. Importantly, these social limits can become apparent before other limits are reached, for instance, specific species adaptations or engineering solutions may be viewed as invasive or undesirable and so prevented from occurring. Nevertheless, there has been relatively little empirical research investigating the nature and mutability of social limits to adaptation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigate social limits to human adaptation, focusing on climate-sensitive industries in the Great Barrier Reef region, Australia, where climate change impacts are already experienced and projected to be significant in future [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref009">9</a>]. The region refers to two broad administrative units: the Great Barrier Reef Marine Protected Area (345,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) and an area encompassing the adjacent coastline and river catchments (425,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). We identify social limits to specific adaptation strategies in the fishing and reef-based tourism sectors, distinguishing factors operating within and between reef-industries (micro-level), at the regional level between reef industries and other land-based sectors (meso-level), and at the national-international level between reef industries and the global economy (macro-level). We argue that social limits are significant but not necessarily absolute. We hypothesise that they are more mutable at lower levels of organisation where it is potentially feasible, through concerted action by those impacted by and adapting to climate change, to manage influencing factors to some degree to move, delay or overcome social limits.
