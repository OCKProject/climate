 <p>Our data are available as transcripts in word or QSR Nvivo on request from the lead author. At the time of data collection repositories for qualitative data were not readily available and the research ethics did not include permission by respondents to archive data for open access use. Data can be provided on request in an anonymised form which would not include organisational affiliation.</p>
