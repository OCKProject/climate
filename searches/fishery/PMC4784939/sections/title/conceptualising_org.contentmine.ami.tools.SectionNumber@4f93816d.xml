 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Barriers and limits to adaptation are conceptually distinct though definitions vary. Where barriers block or divert the adaptation process, limits often represent more absolute thresholds [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref013">13</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref014">14</a>]. Dow et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref014">14</a>] suggest, for example, that social limits to adaptation are reached when people experience an unacceptable loss of yield above the temperature threshold at which ecological adaptation in rice pollination can occur. In the example, social limits arise from experiences of ecological limits, and once a limit is reached people must transform their behaviour to avoid risk [

  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref015">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this paper we argue that social limits can apply to 
  <span class="italic">specific</span> adaptation strategies, can arise prior to thresholds for ecological or technical limits, that they are more or less mutable for different sets of actors across scales and that once reached other adaptation options, if available, may be considered before transformation is needed [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref016">16</a>]. We define limits as the point at which adaptation is not just 
  <span class="italic">inefficient</span> (as influenced by barriers) but 
  <span class="italic">ineffective at reducing the vulnerability of those undertaking adaptation</span>. In line with Felgenhauer [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref017">17</a>], once limits are reached the existing adaptation strategy may still reduce impacts but not sufficiently to prevent unacceptable losses. We suggest that any particular factor can act as a barrier or manifest as a limit depending on when and how it influences adaptation action and outcomes [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref018">18</a>]. For example, uncertainty can both prevent adaptation and reduce the benefits received by dampening adaptive action. Barriers reduce 
  <span class="italic">added benefit</span>. However, where people adapt in a context of uncertainty and make more risky decisions that mean adaptation losses are greater than benefits, uncertainty is a limit to adaptation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is increasing recognition that social barriers and limits exist along a continuum [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref013">13</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref018">18</a>]. The IPCC fifth assessment report on adaptation opportunities, constraints and limits states that: “Various constraints [barriers] … can, if sufficiently severe, pose limits to the ability of actors to adapt to climate change … Because adaptation limits relate to adaptation resources and attitudes to risk that may change over time, some limits may be viewed as “soft” or time sensitive” ([
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref008">8</a>]: 919). Here we seek to understand when particular factors effectively become limits to adaptation as an important empirical and policy question.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Social limits, broadly defined to distinguish from biological and technical limits, arise through psycho-social processes related to what we perceive, know and value [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref019">19</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref023">23</a>]. They can also stem from organisational and institutional structures such as policy-making and markets [
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref024">24</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0150575.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150575.ref026">26</a>]. To what extent social actors have control over and can significantly influence these psycho-social and structural factors determines how mutable or effectively absolute limits are for different people and industries. We explore the perceived mutability of limits as they emerge across scales.
