 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the 15-year assessment period, 141 fish species belonging to 12 orders, 36 families and 93 genera were recorded. The four main orders, representing 90% of the total species counts were: Cypriniformes (59 species), Siluriformes (36), Perciformes (23) and Clupeiformes (7). The rest contained one to three species in each order. Five families forming 95% of the total catch by weight were Cyprinidae (84%), Pangasiidae (4%), Cobitidae (4%), Siluridae (3%) and Cynoglossidae (1%). Three genera forming 66% of the total catch were Henicorhynchus (42%), Paralaubuca (12%), Labiobarbus (12%). Henicorhynchus contained three species namely 
  <span class="italic">Henicorhynchus lobatus</span> (17%), 
  <span class="italic">Henicorhynchus</span> sp. (15%) (synonym of 
  <span class="italic">Lobocheilos cryptopogon</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H</span>. 
  <span class="italic">cryptopogon)</span> and 
  <span class="italic">H</span>. 
  <span class="italic">siamensis</span> (10%); whereas, Paralaubuca encompassed only one species 
  <span class="italic">Paralaubuca barroni</span> (synonym of 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">typus</span>), and finally, Labiobarbus consisted of two species: 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">lineatus</span> (10%) and 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">siamensis</span> (2%). By size category, 75% of catch was from species with maximum total length (maxTL) &lt; = 30 cm, 9% with maxTL 31–60 cm, 9% with maxTL 61–90 cm and 6% with maxTL &gt;90 cm. By trophic level, 70% of catch was from species with trophic level &lt; = 2.75, 27% with trophic level = 2.76–3.75 and 3% with trophic level &gt;3.75. Ecologically, 82% of catch was longitudinal (riverine) migratory species, 17% was lateral-migration species, and about 1% is from a combination of estuarine, marine and floodplain resident species. For relative catch weight of 116 species captured by the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery, see Supplemental Information Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>. We also found an overall declining trend in species diversity (evenness index) (see Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>), signifying that fish community was highly unevenly distributed particularly between 2008 and 2015.
