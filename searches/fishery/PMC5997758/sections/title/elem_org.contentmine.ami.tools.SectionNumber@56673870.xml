  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study used time series catch weight data of a standardized assessment on an industrial-scale ‘
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery’ between 2000 and 2015 (see also 
   <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">S1</a>). The fishery seasonally operates between October and March in a specific location along the lower section of the Tonle Sap River, stretching about 4–30 km north of Phnom Penh. All 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> (64 units) are organized into 14 rows (referred to as row 2 to 15, with the most upstream row 15 situated closest to the Tonle Sap Lake; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>) and operated singly or jointly of up to 7 units in a single row (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). A 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> unit can be uniquely identified through a combined alpha-numeric code of row number and the letter ‘A’ to ‘H’ of each individual 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> in that row. For example, 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> 2 A indicates 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> A in row number 2. The transversal position of 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> rows within the river channel changes along up- and downstream axis (Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). In Row 2–4 and 7, 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> is positioned towards the right bank (facing upstream) while row 13 and 14 are anchored more to the left bank, and the other units are positioned around the center of the river. Such positions of 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> row remain relatively unchanged for more than a century, with the aim to maximize catches dependent on local river morphology and hydrology

   <span class="italic">Dai</span> row is never broad enough to block the river, because by law, they have to leave space for navigation

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dai is a relatively indiscriminate fishing gear. The mesh sizes of the gear taper down from ~15 cm at the mouth to 1 cm at the codend. The 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> mouth is about ~25 m wide and its opening is determined by the water depth with the lower footrope (with chain) anchored at the river bottom and the upper rope on the water surface. The opening of the 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> mouth is maintained by the force of water current. The fishing gear is installed in the Tonle Sap River to filter fish that migrate out of the Tonle Sap floodplains back to the Mekong River during the dry season each year. Overall, the fishing effort of the 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery (number of 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> units, gear dimensions, season of fishing and geographical location of the fishery) remains relatively constant over the study period, although some increases in hauling time have been reported during the peak migration periods
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>

   <span class="italic">Dai</span> gear are described in
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
   </span>. Assuming that (1) the migration of fish from nearby floodplains to the between-
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> rows and (2) removals of fish by other small-scale fishing gears operating between 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> rows could be ignored, the mean catch rate of the fishery has a general declining slope from row 15 down through row 2 (from closest to furthest away from the Tonle Sap Lake; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>), indicating depletion response of fish population which is gradually removed from the system through cumulative 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> rows (fishing effort). Each 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> unit was predicted to remove 2.8% of migrating fish, and up to 83% of the fish arriving at row 15 were estimated to have captured by the 64 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> units

  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catch data from the 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery were made available by the Fisheries Programme of the Mekong River Commission that technically and financially support the catch assessment programme. The catch of the fishery has been routinely assessed by the former Department of Fisheries (currently is the Fisheries Administration - FiA) and later by the Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute (IFReDI) of the FiA in cooperation with its sub-national counterparts. General concepts and formula for assessing catches and catch composition are outlined in
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
   </span>, and these concepts were used to frame the sampling protocols and assessing catches of the fishery. The sampling unit was based on 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> unit and a randomly stratified sampling method was used for this paper. More specifically, 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> units were stratified based on (Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>): (i) administrative space divided into two strata: Kandal Province (row 15–7 containing 42 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> units) and Phnom Penh Municipality (row 6-2, containing 22 units), (ii) time based on the lunar period: Peak Period occurring in a time-window between 7–1 days before full moon and Low Period, covering the rest of each month for the entire fishing season (iii) 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> types: High Catch 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> units (11 in Kandal and 6 in Phnom Penh) and Low Catch 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> units (31 in Kandal and 16 in Phnom Penh). Relative locations of all 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> units within the Tonle Sap River is given in (Table. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Sampling on catches per haul or CPUE; including CPUE for species in catch composition and the daily number of hauls of a 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> unit were conducted in each stratum, lunar period and 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> type within each month of the fishing season for monthly catch estimate. Likewise, fishing effort (number of active 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> units and active days) were recorded according to the stratification framework throughout each fishing month over the whole fishing season across the study period. Sampling takes place around 17 days/month with intensive sampling (every day) during the Peak Period and every second or third day in the Low Period.

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apart from sampling data on total catch for each species in each season, data were also obtained for the number, weight and length of some common and commercial individual fish caught per day of each fishing season.

   <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery database contains information on a total of 141 species. However, only 116 fish species were included in the analysis for this paper because data on the seasonal catches of the other species were sporadic throughout the time series. Furthermore, the species dropped from the analysis were quite marginal in terms of overall catch, and the total catch of the 25-fish species not included in this analysis only represented 0.38% of the total fishery’s catch recorded between 2000 and 2015. Of 116 species, the analysis includes 5 endangered and critically endangered species namely

   </span>. Linear regression was used to predict the rate of change in the total catch weight of 116 fish species recorded at the 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery between 2000 and 2015. The temporal trend for each of the 116 species was expressed as a standardized regression coefficient to allow comparison among species. Standardized regression coefficients measure the change in the dependent variable resulting from a one-standard-deviation change in the independent variable
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
   </span>. In univariate linear regression, standardized regression coefficient equals the correlation coefficient (with its values varying between −1 and +1), the intercept equals zero, and the positive and negative signs of standardized coefficients or regression weights (slope) indicates the kind of correlation between the variables

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Histograms were used to visualize the distribution of standardized regression coefficient values of all species. Simple linear regressions were used to explore the global trend of the relationships between standardized regressions coefficients and species’ maxTL and trophic levels (obtained through FishBase). For all regression analyses, normality was ensured by Shapiro tests (p-value &gt; 0.05). Log +1 transformation was applied to normalize the skewness of standardized regression coefficients prior to the linear regression analyses. In addition, weighted means of maxTL and trophic level in 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> catches by season were computed to examine trends of mean maxTL and tropical level across the 15-year study period. To explore temporal trends in the individual weights of the fish constituting the catch, the mean weight of all individuals captured per species per day was calculated and regressed against time. To deal with the data skewness, mean body weight was log-transformed before the analysis, and standard deviation for each species was also computed for each fishing season for the whole study period. This analysis was performed for six common species that spanned a range in standardized regression coefficient values (positive, zero, negative), body sizes and trophic levels, and included large- and medium-sized carps (
   <span class="italic">Cyclocheilichthys enoplos</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Osteochilus melanopleurus</span>, and 
   <span class="italic">Cirrhinus microlepis)</span>, a large-sized river catfish (
   <span class="italic">Pangasianodon hypophthalmus)</span>, as well as small-sized and highly productive mud carps (
   <span class="italic">Henicorhynchus lobatus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Labiobarbus lineatus)</span>. Being ecological, sociocultural and economic important species, the six species belong to the first two largest families (Cyprinidae and Pangasiidae) forming the largest proportion of the total catches (84% and 4% respectively) from the 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery. In addition, 
   <span class="italic">H</span>. 
   <span class="italic">lobatus</span> is an ecological keystone species, the most abundant species with its critical role in food security throughout the Lower Mekong Basin (including the Tonle Sap) and an important prey species for many predatory fishes and Irrawaddy dolphins

   <span class="italic">Labiobarbus lineatus</span> shares similar ecological characteristics with 
   <span class="italic">H</span>. 
   <span class="italic">lobatus</span>. From the

   <span class="italic">H</span>. 
   <span class="italic">lobatus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">L</span>. 
   <span class="italic">lineatus</span> are among the most dominant species contributing ~17% and 10% to the 
   <span class="italic">Dai’s</span> total catch weight respectively. Finally, an attempt was also made to analyze the temporal changes in fish body length of the same six species (as we did with mean body weight). Given that, two of the six species (
   <span class="italic">P</span>. 
   <span class="italic">hypophthalmus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">O</span>. 
   <span class="italic">melanopleurus)</span> contained relatively small sample sizes on length, only the other four species were included in the length frequency analysis. Nevertheless, the trends of the four species (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a–d</a>) still provide a good example of the status and trends of riverine fishes in the Tonle Sap and Lower Mekong Basin. Length frequency distributions of the four species were then examined across the study period using the ‘violins’ function from ‘caroline’ package in R
