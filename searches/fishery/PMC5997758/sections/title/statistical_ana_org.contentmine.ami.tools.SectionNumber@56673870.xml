  </span>. Linear regression was used to predict the rate of change in the total catch weight of 116 fish species recorded at the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery between 2000 and 2015. The temporal trend for each of the 116 species was expressed as a standardized regression coefficient to allow comparison among species. Standardized regression coefficients measure the change in the dependent variable resulting from a one-standard-deviation change in the independent variable

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>
  </span>. In univariate linear regression, standardized regression coefficient equals the correlation coefficient (with its values varying between −1 and +1), the intercept equals zero, and the positive and negative signs of standardized coefficients or regression weights (slope) indicates the kind of correlation between the variables

  </span>. Linear regressions, and the generation of standardized regression coefficients, were performed using the ‘lm’ function of ‘stats’ package and ‘lm.beta’ function of ‘QuantPsyc’ package

 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Histograms were used to visualize the distribution of standardized regression coefficient values of all species. Simple linear regressions were used to explore the global trend of the relationships between standardized regressions coefficients and species’ maxTL and trophic levels (obtained through FishBase). For all regression analyses, normality was ensured by Shapiro tests (p-value &gt; 0.05). Log +1 transformation was applied to normalize the skewness of standardized regression coefficients prior to the linear regression analyses. In addition, weighted means of maxTL and trophic level in 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> catches by season were computed to examine trends of mean maxTL and tropical level across the 15-year study period. To explore temporal trends in the individual weights of the fish constituting the catch, the mean weight of all individuals captured per species per day was calculated and regressed against time. To deal with the data skewness, mean body weight was log-transformed before the analysis, and standard deviation for each species was also computed for each fishing season for the whole study period. This analysis was performed for six common species that spanned a range in standardized regression coefficient values (positive, zero, negative), body sizes and trophic levels, and included large- and medium-sized carps (
  <span class="italic">Cyclocheilichthys enoplos</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Osteochilus melanopleurus</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">Cirrhinus microlepis)</span>, a large-sized river catfish (
  <span class="italic">Pangasianodon hypophthalmus)</span>, as well as small-sized and highly productive mud carps (
  <span class="italic">Henicorhynchus lobatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Labiobarbus lineatus)</span>. Being ecological, sociocultural and economic important species, the six species belong to the first two largest families (Cyprinidae and Pangasiidae) forming the largest proportion of the total catches (84% and 4% respectively) from the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery. In addition, 
  <span class="italic">H</span>. 
  <span class="italic">lobatus</span> is an ecological keystone species, the most abundant species with its critical role in food security throughout the Lower Mekong Basin (including the Tonle Sap) and an important prey species for many predatory fishes and Irrawaddy dolphins

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" href="#CR65">65</a>
  </span>. 
  <span class="italic">Labiobarbus lineatus</span> shares similar ecological characteristics with 
  <span class="italic">H</span>. 
  <span class="italic">lobatus</span>. From the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery, 
  <span class="italic">H</span>. 
  <span class="italic">lobatus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">L</span>. 
  <span class="italic">lineatus</span> are among the most dominant species contributing ~17% and 10% to the 
  <span class="italic">Dai’s</span> total catch weight respectively. Finally, an attempt was also made to analyze the temporal changes in fish body length of the same six species (as we did with mean body weight). Given that, two of the six species (
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">hypophthalmus</span> and 
  <span class="italic">O</span>. 
  <span class="italic">melanopleurus)</span> contained relatively small sample sizes on length, only the other four species were included in the length frequency analysis. Nevertheless, the trends of the four species (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a–d</a>) still provide a good example of the status and trends of riverine fishes in the Tonle Sap and Lower Mekong Basin. Length frequency distributions of the four species were then examined across the study period using the ‘violins’ function from ‘caroline’ package in R
