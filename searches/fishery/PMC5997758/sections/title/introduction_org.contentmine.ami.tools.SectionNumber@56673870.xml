   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span>. Overall, inland fisheries employ approximately 61 million people
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span> and represent 11.3% of the world total capture fish production
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. These fisheries, however, are facing numerous challenges from human activities, namely, population growth, habitat degradation, hydrological changes, pollution, invasive species and climate change

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>, along with the concern that higher trophic levels of marine food webs are being unsustainably exploited, have grown during the last decade. In particular, fisheries ecologists have recently argued that increased indiscriminate fishing pressure is reducing large-sized, slower-growing species with late maturity, and replacing them with smaller-sized, faster-growing species that mature earlier
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. This leads to an overall reduction in the body size and, consequently, a reduction in the overall trophic level of the fish assemblage remaining in an ecosystem. Ultimately, these changes are expected to be reflected in catch composition

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Shifts through time in the slope of the catch-size spectra and decreases in the size of individual fish are also among the key structural and functional ‘signatures’ of indiscriminate fishing on the fish community
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. Currently, however, much of the fisheries impact research has focused on marine systems and very little is known about freshwater fisheries in the sub-tropical and tropical environments such as the Mekong River Basin
  <span class="sup">

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. What limited evidence exists from inland tropical fisheries suggests declining catches, particularly in Asia and Africa where fish protein is of paramount importance in terms of food security. Hence, there are increasing calls in the literature that inland tropical fisheries should receive more research attention

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper contributes to the literature on inland tropical fisheries, demonstrating that larger higher trophic level fish are being depleted in one of the world’s largest freshwater fisheries, while smaller, lower trophic levels organisms are increasing in a manner that sustains overall fish catches. Towards this, we study temporal dynamics of 116 fish species in the Tonle Sap over 15 years. The Tonle Sap, at the whole fishery scale, has been shown to employ an amazing amount of fishing gears applied broadly across habitats and seasons in a manner that uniformly catches a high diversity of fishes (see

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). This approach is highly suggestive of a relatively indiscriminate fishery. The dataset for the study was obtained from a standardized biological catch assessment of an industrial-scale ‘
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery’ that operates during the dry season in the Tonle Sap River. We explore how temporal trends of fish catch captured by this fishery relate to each species’ maximum body size and trophic level. We also examine changes in the body weight and length of individual fish for select species over the assessment period.
