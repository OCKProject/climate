 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Violin plots further elucidated the temporal changes of the total length for four common species (Fig.

  <span class="italic">Cyclocheilichthys enoplos</span> (maxTL: 90.3 cm) and 
  <span class="italic">Cirrhinus microlepis</span> (maxTL: 79.3 cm), both of which were mainly captured at juvenile sizes with the average total length &lt;20 cm and 25 cm, respectively; body lengths have declined since the early 2000s when some comparatively large individuals (&gt;30 cm) were present in the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery’s catches (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a,b</a>). Noticeably, the medians for these large and medium-sized species were significantly lower than 49 and 44 cm (Fig.

  <span class="italic">lineatus</span>, which are common and highly productive, total length in the
