 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study used time series catch weight data of a standardized assessment on an industrial-scale ‘
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery’ between 2000 and 2015 (see also 
  <a rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM2">S1</a>). The fishery seasonally operates between October and March in a specific location along the lower section of the Tonle Sap River, stretching about 4–30 km north of Phnom Penh. All 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> (64 units) are organized into 14 rows (referred to as row 2 to 15, with the most upstream row 15 situated closest to the Tonle Sap Lake; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>) and operated singly or jointly of up to 7 units in a single row (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). A 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> unit can be uniquely identified through a combined alpha-numeric code of row number and the letter ‘A’ to ‘H’ of each individual 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> in that row. For example, 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> 2 A indicates 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> A in row number 2. The transversal position of 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> rows within the river channel changes along up- and downstream axis (Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). In Row 2–4 and 7, 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> is positioned towards the right bank (facing upstream) while row 13 and 14 are anchored more to the left bank, and the other units are positioned around the center of the river. Such positions of 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> row remain relatively unchanged for more than a century, with the aim to maximize catches dependent on local river morphology and hydrology

  </span>. Every 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> row is never broad enough to block the river, because by law, they have to leave space for navigation

 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dai is a relatively indiscriminate fishing gear. The mesh sizes of the gear taper down from ~15 cm at the mouth to 1 cm at the codend. The 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> mouth is about ~25 m wide and its opening is determined by the water depth with the lower footrope (with chain) anchored at the river bottom and the upper rope on the water surface. The opening of the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> mouth is maintained by the force of water current. The fishing gear is installed in the Tonle Sap River to filter fish that migrate out of the Tonle Sap floodplains back to the Mekong River during the dry season each year. Overall, the fishing effort of the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery (number of 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> units, gear dimensions, season of fishing and geographical location of the fishery) remains relatively constant over the study period, although some increases in hauling time have been reported during the peak migration periods
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>. Technical details of the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> gear are described in
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>. Assuming that (1) the migration of fish from nearby floodplains to the between-
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> rows and (2) removals of fish by other small-scale fishing gears operating between 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> rows could be ignored, the mean catch rate of the fishery has a general declining slope from row 15 down through row 2 (from closest to furthest away from the Tonle Sap Lake; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>), indicating depletion response of fish population which is gradually removed from the system through cumulative 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> rows (fishing effort). Each 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> unit was predicted to remove 2.8% of migrating fish, and up to 83% of the fish arriving at row 15 were estimated to have captured by the 64 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> units
