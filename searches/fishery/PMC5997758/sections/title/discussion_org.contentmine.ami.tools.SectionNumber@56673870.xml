 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trends in the seasonal catches of harvested species revealed that 78% of the 116-species are in decline. While we do not have fishery independent data to confirm the large 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> dataset, our results are consistent with the prediction of an intensively exploited indiscriminate fishery. Consistent with indiscriminate fishing theory, a closer examination of the data indicated that the catch declines are disproportionally represented by the larger, slower growing, higher trophic level organisms of the Tonle Sap. By contrast, the 22% of species caught by the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery that have tended to show increases are disproportionally represented by small-bodied, faster growing lower trophic level organisms. In addition, significant declines of the mean fish size and trophic level were evidenced in the seasonal catches of the fishery over the study period (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b</a>). Finally, the data consistently showed for common species spanning a range in adult body sizes that individual weights and lengths of all these species, even in many of the small-bodied species, have been significantly reduced over the last 15 years, a result that resonates with much research that has found that heavy fishing pressure is known to drive shifts in life history towards smaller sizes and earlier ages at maturation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
  </span>. Our results also pointed out for select species that the number of immature fish captured has increased throughout the study period. Moreover, a significant decreasing trend in species evenness was observed over the study period (Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>). Thus, although this fishery has been amazingly resilient to changes in total fish harvest levels, these results collectively are in agreement with predicted effects of indiscriminate fishing theory. Because this theory ultimately predicts declines in fish catches and diversity with sustained, heavy indiscriminate fishing pressure
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>, our findings may be seen as an ‘early warning signal’ of looming negative impacts of indiscriminate fishing in the Tonle Sap.
 </p>
 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intriguingly, recent work has argued that such indiscriminately fished systems may generally occur in tropical systems where fish is the major source of animal protein
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
  </span>. Consistent with this conjecture, recent empirical fisheries data in the East China Sea
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>, where fish is also a major source of protein, has argued that this fishery is relatively indiscriminate and has also showed a compensatory positive growth response by small fish to heavy fishing. Further, and consistent with our results, they argued that this compensatory response helped maintain fishery production
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
  </span>. This compensatory response is expected in indiscriminate fisheries as fishing effectively replaces slow growing larger, often higher trophic level fish, with faster growing smaller fish that tend to be from lower trophic levels
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. This reduction of upper trophic level fish drives a cascading effect whereby released predation pressure allows lower trophic level species to flourish
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. As shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S8</a>, CPUE (catch per 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> unit per day) in this large fishery fluctuated with no significant trend over the study period suggesting that the smaller fish growth rates are indeed compensating for reduction in upper trophic level catches. Given the reduction in mean body size and trophic level over time (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b</a>) as well as the average positive growth rates of small species (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>) our results suggest that small faster growing species are compensating for the heavy fishing pressure.
 </p>
 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings of declining catches of medium and large-sized species as well as falling mean body size of fish catches support general perceptions by fishers throughout the Lower Mekong Basin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. Our results, therefore, are consistent with existing knowledge that some giant- and large-sized fish populations in the Mekong region have declined since the 1900s. For example, the Mekong giant catfish (
  <span class="italic">Pangasianodon gigas</span>) (maxTL: 300 cm, max. weight: 350 kg), which was common and abundant in the 1900s, has almost disappeared from the Mekong River System
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. Tonle Sap River is one of the last few places where a small number of individuals of this species are still occasionally captured
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
  </span>. In particular, the standardized regression coefficient for this species was almost zero (0.03), indicating little change in its contribution to the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> catch since 2000. This perhaps reflects either effectiveness of conservation measures or that its population status is close to extinction. Likewise, the Mekong giant carp (
  <span class="italic">Catlocarpio siamensis)</span> (maxTL: 300 cm, max. weight: 300 kg) was seen regularly in the catch of 1938–39 and 1962–63
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span>. Nowadays, however, the Mekong giant carp has become critically endangered. Similarly, the Mekong shad (
  <span class="italic">Tenualosa thibaudeaui</span>) (maxTL: 60 cm) was still relatively abundant in the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> catch in 1938–39 and 1962–63 and used to be one of the most important species. Nonetheless, it too has been experiencing drastic decline during the last two decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span>. The list of large-bodied species in decline goes on. Jullien’s golden carp 
  <span class="italic">(Probarbus jullieni)</span> (maxTL: 183 cm, max. weight: 70 kg) was noticed as ‘comparatively scarce’ for at least 65 years in Thailand
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
  </span>, and together with Thicklipped barb 
  <span class="italic">(Probarbus labeamajor)</span> were later observed to be very abundant in 1970s in the southern Laos and northern Cambodia (when the region was at war). Both have declined, particularly since 1990s when the region’s border trade was re-opened up
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span> and now these two species are considered to be endangered by the IUCN Red List. Similarly, other formerly-common and high value species, including 
  <span class="italic">Cirrhinus microlepis</span> (maxTL: 79.3 cm), have been assessed as a vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List. Based on our analysis, these giant- and large-sized species have all declined during 2000–2015.
 </p>
 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The decline in the giant and larger-bodied species is likely associated with their slower growth and late age at maturation. For instance, both 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">gigas</span> and C. 
  <span class="italic">siamensis</span> do not reach maturity until ~7 years of age
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. These larger species often require large geographical ranges to complete their life cycles and undertake long migrations between critical habitats
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, making them more susceptible to capture before their first reproductive event. Given the increasing fishing pressure in the region, overfishing seems a likely cause of the decline observed in giant, large and medium sized fishes in the Tonle Sap, which is consistent with previously observed declines in long-lived, late spawning freshwater fish stocks such as the Murray River cod in Australia and ~21 sturgeon stocks across Asia, Europe and America and Pirarucu (
  <span class="italic">Arapaima gigas</span>) in Amazon
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to large-bodied fish, the catch of some small-sized species such as 
  <span class="italic">Labiobarbus</span> spp. (synonym of 
  <span class="italic">Dangila</span> spp.) increased significantly over the study period. For instance, members of this genus accounted for ~5% of the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery catches between 1995 and 2000
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> but increased to 19% in 2013/14 fishing season
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Additionally, 
  <span class="italic">Henicorhynchus</span> spp., which are ecologically important in the LMB
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>, made up 25.4% of the total 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> catch weight in 1962/63
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
  </span> but increased to 40% between 1995 and 2000
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> and increased again to 43% in 2013/14 fishing season
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. Comparable increasing trends are also manifested for other small-sized cyprinids that are likely more robust to fishing pressure and also reproduce quickly on the vast area of seasonal flooded land every year
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
  </span> once predatory pressures of higher trophic level fish
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span> are reduced.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While our results from the Tonle Sap revealed that overall declining catches were associated with large-bodied species, some small-sized species were also declining. These species feed in higher trophic levels (3.4–3.7) than some giant- and large-sized species such as the Mekong giant catfish (2.3) and Mekong giant carp (2.92) which are detritus and algae feeders. It is also likely that threat status of freshwater fishes was not as clear-cut as that of the marine fishes as evidenced in a study of extinction risk of European freshwater fishes where small-bodied species were most at-risk due to their small geographical ranges
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. Likewise, when comparing fish body-size distribution under different global extinction risk levels, threats were found to disproportionately occur to both large- and small-sized species
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. It is likely that further research on individual life history traits may help shed light on reasons of the decline, which is warranted because overfishing is not be the only threat to the Tonle Sap’s fishes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, both increased efficiency of fishing gears and increased human population size have likely contributed to declining large-sized species in the Tonle Sap. In Cambodia, the use of monofilament nylon gillnets was to blame for the decline of 
  <span class="italic">C</span>. 
  <span class="italic">microlepis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">B</span>. 
  <span class="italic">microlepis</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Probarbus</span> spp., 
  <span class="italic">T</span>. 
  <span class="italic">thibaudeaui</span>, 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">hypophthalmus</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Wallago leeri</span> (maxTL: 150 cm) and Irrawaddy dolphins
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span> and were considered as a ‘wall-of-death’ for many migrating fishes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>. The problems caused by these fishing techniques have likely been exacerbated by population growth and the population of countries sharing the Lower Mekong Basin has increased about threefold between 1960 and 2015. Similarly, the Cambodia population has also grown almost threefold with ~85% rural dwellers
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>. Since entry into fishing is free, and fishing gears are very affordable,
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span> a combination of forces including rising population along with the lack of other livelihood options, has resulted in millions of people moving into the fishing sector thereby increasing fishing effort and pressure on fish stocks.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further, hydropower development in the region also poses an increasingly large additional threat to the Mekong fisheries. Numerous hydropower developments loom over the Mekong Basin threatening to alter flows, fragment habitats, block fish migration routes from completing life cycles, degrade water quality and reduce the overall productivity of rivers resulting from nutrients and sediment losses. This is particularly troubling because the migratory species present in the Tonle Sap represent a third
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span> of the total number of fish species in the Mekong Basin from which some 877 fish species have been recorded
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>. In Cambodia, migratory species form 63% of catch by weight from Tonle Sap floodplains
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span> and up to 82% from Tonle Sap River (Result section).
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The findings in this paper, for the first time, demonstrate evidence that the catches of the large- and medium-sized species in the Tonle Sap are declining while some small-sized, fast-growing species are increasing and contributing to the maintenance of the 
  <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery’s overall catches in the past decades. This is akin to other notable indiscriminate fisheries such as that recently noted in the East China Sea where catches consisted of 1-year-old fish and the high exploitation level has been sustained for at least 10 fish generations
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. This paper further demonstrates that even small-bodied species, so far capable of increasing their production on average, are showing significant reductions in body size with the consequence of an overall reduction in the percentage of mature individuals. This latter result is a warning signal to fisheries managers and conservationists that the species-rich Tonle Sap, so far able to maintain total harvest levels, may be close to its limit. The findings suggest that enhanced protection and conservation efforts are urgently needed to maintain food security in this region.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fortunately, formal institutions for fisheries protection and conservation in Cambodia are now in place
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> with restrictions imposed on fishing seasons, gears and geographical areas (fish sanctuaries). Sufficient resource allocation to the sector are therefore necessary to effectively enforce and monitor these fisheries regulations in order to protect and converse the fish biodiversity in the Tonle Sap, with the main aim to (1) let fish spawn at least for the first time before capture, (2) let fish grow and (3) let the mega-spawners live
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
  </span>. Tonle Sap River is specifically a natural passageway for many seasonal migratory fishes in the region. Setting appropriate regulations on the basis of known peak seasonal migrations during the inflow and outflow periods that allows some fishes (including endangered species) to pass through the river, would enable some juveniles and broodfishes to complete their life cycles, i.e. accessing the Tonle Sap floodplains and area south of Phnom Penh to feed, and the upstream of the Mekong mainstream and tributaries to seek dry-season refuge and breed
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>
  </span>. Together with maintaining natural flow and hydraulic conditions for the longitudinal and lateral connectivity among these critical habitats that guarantee free migration routes for fishes are highly likely to be key drivers for the sustainability of the Tonle Sap fisheries. Further, the current formal fisheries management regime favors community-based fisheries co-management, where 516 community fisheries (CFis) including 228 in the Tonle Sap floodplains have been established countrywide
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>. Conservation priority should be given to the CFis situated in these key critical fish habitats. By effectively protecting and conserving these areas combined with appropriate hydraulic conditions, some juveniles and broodfishes may be maintained to sustain the seasonal reproduction, recruitment and growth. For future work, it is worth exploring a modelling approach which is able to suggest a management strategy that maximizes the present benefits from the Tonle Sap fishery while maintaining its long-term sustainability e.g.
