  <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the 15-year assessment period, 141 fish species belonging to 12 orders, 36 families and 93 genera were recorded. The four main orders, representing 90% of the total species counts were: Cypriniformes (59 species), Siluriformes (36), Perciformes (23) and Clupeiformes (7). The rest contained one to three species in each order. Five families forming 95% of the total catch by weight were Cyprinidae (84%), Pangasiidae (4%), Cobitidae (4%), Siluridae (3%) and Cynoglossidae (1%). Three genera forming 66% of the total catch were Henicorhynchus (42%), Paralaubuca (12%), Labiobarbus (12%). Henicorhynchus contained three species namely 
   <span class="italic">Henicorhynchus lobatus</span> (17%), 
   <span class="italic">Henicorhynchus</span> sp. (15%) (synonym of 
   <span class="italic">Lobocheilos cryptopogon</span> and 
   <span class="italic">H</span>. 
   <span class="italic">cryptopogon)</span> and 
   <span class="italic">H</span>. 
   <span class="italic">siamensis</span> (10%); whereas, Paralaubuca encompassed only one species 
   <span class="italic">Paralaubuca barroni</span> (synonym of 
   <span class="italic">P</span>. 
   <span class="italic">typus</span>), and finally, Labiobarbus consisted of two species: 
   <span class="italic">L</span>. 
   <span class="italic">lineatus</span> (10%) and 
   <span class="italic">L</span>. 
   <span class="italic">siamensis</span> (2%). By size category, 75% of catch was from species with maximum total length (maxTL) &lt; = 30 cm, 9% with maxTL 31–60 cm, 9% with maxTL 61–90 cm and 6% with maxTL &gt;90 cm. By trophic level, 70% of catch was from species with trophic level &lt; = 2.75, 27% with trophic level = 2.76–3.75 and 3% with trophic level &gt;3.75. Ecologically, 82% of catch was longitudinal (riverine) migratory species, 17% was lateral-migration species, and about 1% is from a combination of estuarine, marine and floodplain resident species. For relative catch weight of 116 species captured by the 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery, see Supplemental Information Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S4</a>. We also found an overall declining trend in species diversity (evenness index) (see Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S5</a>), signifying that fish community was highly unevenly distributed particularly between 2008 and 2015.

  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of the standardized regression coefficients for all 116 species, which reflected the nature of the relationship between seasonal fish catch and time for each species, was skewed to the right, centered around −0.4, and spread between −0.78 and 0.66 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Out of the 116-total species, 90 (78%) had negative standardized regression coefficients. These results indicate that the seasonal catches of these species harvested by the 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery declined over the 15 years studied. On the contrary, there were also species (26 out of 116 or 22%) with positive standardized regression coefficients, indicating an increase in the catch of these species by the 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> fishery. Interestingly, 
   <span class="italic">Oreochromis mossambicus</span> is an exotic species that was among the largest positive coefficients observed. In addition, 
   <span class="italic">Labiobarbus lineatus</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Henicorhynchus lobatus</span> and 
   <span class="italic">H</span>. 
   <span class="italic">cryptopogon</span> (synonym of 
   <span class="italic">Lobocheilos cryptopogon</span>) are all known to be highly prolific and form the largest proportion of the catch from the fishery. These species also had positive standardized coefficients (see Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S6</a> for standardized regression coefficients, maxTL and trophic level for each species). In fact, the increase in these species stabilized the seasonal 
   <span class="italic">Dai</span> catches as it was evidenced in the total catch of the fishery which was stationary over the study period (p-value = 0.982, Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S8</a>).

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a,b</a>) were included. However, it was also likely that these species were very rare and, as such, their catches obtained in the catch assessment could be misleading. Therefore, when they were dropped from the analysis, the significant relationships were indicated with both maxTL (slope = −0.13, p-value = 0.006, r

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When grouped by positive and negative standardized regression coefficient values (for all 116 species), maxTL was significantly greater for the species with negative standardized regression coefficients than the positive ones (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>; Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p-value = 0.02). Negative values of standardized coefficients were noted for species with maximum length corresponding to &gt;45 cm (3
   <span class="sup">rd</span> quartile), whereas positive standardized regression coefficients were noted for species with maxTL &lt;25 cm (2
   <span class="sup">nd</span> quartile). Species with both negative and positive coefficient values fell within maxTL of ~25 cm and ~45 cm. Trophic level did not significantly differ between negative and positive standardized regression coefficients (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d</a>; Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p-value = 0.08). Nevertheless, species with negative standardized coefficients had higher trophic levels &gt;3.3 (3
   <span class="sup">rd</span> quartile), and species with positive standardized regression coefficients had lower trophic levels (&lt;2.75). Species with both negative and positive coefficient values fell within trophic levels of ~2.75 and ~3.3. Furthermore, weighted mean maxTL and trophic level of seasonal total catch (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a,b</a>) oscillated with a mean range of ~25–55 cm and ~2.4–2.8, respectively, and significantly declined across the 15-year period (mean maxTL: slope = −1.26, p-value = 0.007, r
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.44; mean trophic level: slope = −0.013, p-value = 0.025, r
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.33). Although some small-bodied species including 
   <span class="italic">Parachela siamensis</span> (maxTL: 18.3 cm; trophic level: 3.4), 
   <span class="italic">Parambassis wolffii</span> (maxTL: 24.4 cm, trophic level: 3.72) and 
   <span class="italic">Acantopsis</span> sp. cf. 
   <span class="italic">dialuzona</span> (maxTL: 30.5, trophic level: 3.5) also exhibited significant declines in seasonal catches (standardized coefficients &lt; −0.66), our combined findings indicate that smaller, lower trophic position species increased and compensated for declines in larger bodied, higher trophic position species in the Tonle Sap fishery over the study period.
