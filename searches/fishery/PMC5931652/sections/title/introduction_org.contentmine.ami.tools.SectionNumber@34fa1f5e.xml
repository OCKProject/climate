 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marine biodiversity, ecosystem health and fisheries are currently threatened by overfishing, but also by pollution and other anthropogenic impacts [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref001">1</a>]. Climate change further challenges our ability to devise sustainable management and conservation plans to maintain ecosystem services, as it has begun to alter ocean conditions, particularly water temperature and various aspects of ocean biogeochemistry [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref002">2</a>]. Marine biodiversity responds to shifting temperatures and other ocean conditions through changes in organismal physiology and phenology, as well as population dynamics and distributions [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref003">3</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref005">5</a>]. These responses to ocean–atmospheric changes have been projected to lead to altered patterns of species richness [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref007">7</a>], changes in community structure [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref008">8</a>] and ecosystem functions [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref009">9</a>], and consequential changes in marine goods and services [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the unique characteristics of the Arabian Gulf (also known as the Persian Gulf, and referred to hereafter simply as the Gulf)—particularly its extreme environmental conditions, the array of human disturbances it is exposed to, and the high sensitivity of its biota to environmental fluctuations as species are close to their environmental limits [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref013">13</a>]—climate change should have substantial implications for the Gulf’s marine ecosystems and fisheries. Extreme seasonal temperatures and salinity fluctuations select for species with high tolerance or adaptability to such short-term changes (e.g., as exhibited by some corals, see [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref014">14</a>]). Consequently, the Gulf is a region that is relatively species poor [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref015">15</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref018">18</a>], at least in comparison with adjacent systems such as the open Indian Ocean [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref017">17</a>]. However, as part of the Western Indian Ocean province of the Indo-West Pacific ecoregion [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref019">19</a>], the Gulf is considered a biologically valuable region [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref020">20</a>]. The region’s biodiversity and its associated goods and services are expected to be impacted by the synergistic effects of climate change (e.g., increases in temperature; declines in oxygen content; sea level rise) and those of human activities such as oil extraction, desalination of sea water, coastal development, and overfishing [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref021">21</a>–

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although many marine organisms in the Gulf appear to have a high heat-tolerance relative to populations in other parts of the world [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref026">26</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref029">29</a>], warming, with changes of +0.57°C recorded between 1950 and 2010 [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref030">30</a>], has already impacted some of the more vulnerable marine species in the region [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref021">21</a>]. For example, corals have been exposed to major disturbances [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref031">31</a>], including water temperatures between 35° and 37°C at least five times since the late 1990s, causing extensive coral bleaching [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref032">32</a>] associated with considerable loss of coral cover [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref033">33</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref034">34</a>]. Overall, about 70% of the Gulf’s reefs have essentially disappeared in a few decades [
  <a rid="pone.0194537.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0194537.ref035">35</a>] and this has been associated with a significant decline in fish species richness. While substantial declines in stress-sensitive species are expected with increasing temperatures, results from a number of long-term studies investigating benthic community structure across the region suggest that coral communities may persist within an increasingly disturbed future environment, albeit in a much more structurally simple configuration [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So far, a comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts on the Gulf’s marine biodiversity and fisheries has not been undertaken. By means of simulation modelling approaches, this study aims to assess the impacts and understand the vulnerability of some of the Gulf’s key marine species, its fisheries and national economies to climate change. We then discuss the implications of these impacts for conservation and fisheries management policies in the region.</p>
