 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We tested for co-linearity within benthic variables and identified variables that were correlated at 
  <span class="italic">r</span> â‰¥ 0.7. Three variables (calcareous substrate, sand/rubble, and other benthic) were removed from further analysis and no remaining pairwise correlations between variables greater than 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = 0.53 were found. The remaining 8 variables were further tested by a variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis which found that each of the retained environmental variables resulted in a VIF of &lt;10.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Adonis function within the Vegan package [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref049">49</a>] was used to examine for significant relationships between categorical variables (atoll, reef type and exposure) and the fish assemblages surveyed, also using permutation testing set at 9999 permutations. We used the envfit function within the Vegan package to estimate the direction and strengths of the correlation between the nMDS of fish species and the reef benthic variables surveyed.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we used a variation of the BIO-ENV [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref050">50</a>] routine, termed BIO-BIO, to identify the subset of fish species which best correlated to the overall biological pattern of the dissimilarity matrix, using both numerical density and biomass data. They produced similar results, thus density alone was presented.
