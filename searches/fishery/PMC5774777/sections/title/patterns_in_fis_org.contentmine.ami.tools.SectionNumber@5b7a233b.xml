 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences in fish assemblages were significantly correlated with geographic distance between sites; the relative density of the 110 species across the archipelago differed most significantly between atolls. These atoll-scale differences were also apparent in total density and biomass values (12 families), with the highest fish densities recorded on the reefs of the western edge of the GCB, the highest fish biomass recorded at Peros Banhos Atoll and the lowest fish biomass at Diego Garcia Atoll. Reef benthic composition also varied between atolls, most notably in the relative cover of live hard coral, recently dead standing coral and rugosity, and permutation testing showed that these differences were significantly related to fish density (hard and dead standing coral) and fish biomass (hard coral, dead standing coral, rugosity). These results are not surprising since strong positive correlations between fish density or biomass and live hard coral and rugosity, benthic variables that co-vary and reflect reef habitat structural complexity, are widely reported [

  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref054">54</a>]. Therefore, patterns in the fish assemblages reported here likely reflect bottom-up control.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A major alteration in the benthic composition of coral reefs across the Indian Ocean occurred following the severe coral bleaching event of 1998 [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref055">55</a>]. This thermal anomaly resulted in a reduction of living coral cover in the Chagos Archipelago from 50–75% cover prior to the event to ~10% live coral remaining on all six atolls in 1999 [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref022">22</a>]. However, a majority of reef sites across the archipelago recovered rapidly and reached pre-bleaching condition by 2010 [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref026">26</a>]. The strong benthic differences between atolls observed in our surveys in 2014 possibly reflect different levels of bleaching and differing recovery patterns following the 1998 event, though with little historic data this remains unknown. However, early reports of highly homogenous fish assemblages across reefs in the northern atolls prior to 1998 [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref033">33</a>] suggest that the differences in the structure of the fish assemblages found in 2014 may be recent and could therefore be due to differing recovery patterns.
