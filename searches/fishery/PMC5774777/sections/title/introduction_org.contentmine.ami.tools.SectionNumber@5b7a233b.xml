 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coral reefs are complex and highly biodiverse systems that are subject to a broad range of natural and anthropogenic factors, operating from local to global scales, which drive or impact reef fish population abundance and assemblage structure [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref004">4</a>]. Reef degradation from fishing pressure and climate-change induced coral bleaching and mortality have been invoked to explain patterns in the structure of coral reef fish assemblages across multiple scales in the Indo-Pacific [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref005">5</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref007">7</a>]. Other studies point to scale dependence in drivers of fish assemblages with geomorphology and biogeography, for example, playing a significant role at larger regional scales, and fishing and reef benthic structure operating at local scales [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref008">8</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref010">10</a>]. Understanding the mechanisms by which these drivers interact and their relative contributions to controlling reef fish assemblages is critical in underpinning conservation planning and effective reef fisheries management.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the dominant paradigms used to explain impacts from the external stressors of climate change and fishing on coral reefs and their fish assemblages revolves around potential shifts from coral to algal-dominated reef states [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref012">12</a>]. Herbivorous fishes have been shown to play a leading role in preventing this shift by controlling algal abundance [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref013">13</a>]. The regulatory pathways involve both resource (bottom-up) and predation (top-down) control of the reef ecosystem. Changes in coral cover represent bottom-up control while top-down control is seen when herbivores are depleted through fishing activities, which can lead to their functional role becoming compromised [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref014">14</a>]. Coral reef fish assemblages are known to vary in relation to several environmental characteristics such as exposure to oceanic conditions, rugosity, depth, benthic composition and recent coral mortality [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref008">8</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref015">15</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref018">18</a>]. Bottom-up control of reef fish populations by reef benthic composition has been well established [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref010">10</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref015">15</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref018">18</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref020">20</a>], and long-term studies in the Philippines, for example, have shown that this pathway is the primary driver of the herbivorous parrotfishes [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref021">21</a>]. Thus, top-down and bottom-up pathways can either dominate or co-occur, depending on the characteristics within the coral reef ecosystem.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a management perspective, it is important to be able to attribute the relative contribution of casual factors driving the structure of reef fish assemblages. The objective of this study was to determine which of a range of largely biotic factors may be driving the structure of reef fish assemblages in the absence of fishing. Our hypothesis was that without the top-down influence of fishing in the Chagos Archipelago the fish assemblages should reflect the relative contribution of natural drivers, both bottom up (e.g. food availability) and top-down (e.g. predation), of fish populations, and one anthropogenic stressor—coral mortality related to bleaching events. We also sought to describe the characteristic reef fish assemblages of the atolls of the Chagos Archipelago to build on earlier work that examined fish responses to declines in coral cover caused by the coral bleaching event of 1998 [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref022">22</a>] and found little change in reef fish species richness except in corallivores [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref023">23</a>]. We also examined the abundance and biomass of reef fishes from the full range of trophic groups to test for relationships between trophic group and reef benthic composition and so examine the functional roles of fish species in reef resilience.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Chagos Archipelago (British Indian Ocean Territory) is an isolated archipelago of atolls spanning ~60,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and 2 degrees of latitude on the north-eastern border of the western Indian Ocean Province [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref024">24</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref026">26</a>], with an area of ~9,400 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> of shallow coral reefs (&lt;40m depth) [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref027">27</a>]. The islands are uninhabited except for the southern-most atoll, Diego Garcia, which is classified as a Permanent Joint Operating Base of the UK and US governments and hosts a US naval support facility. The archipelago, with the exception of Diego Garcia where a recreational fishery is permitted, was declared a no-take marine protected area (MPA) in 2010 by the UK Government [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref026">26</a>]. Indeed, reef fish biomass in the Chagos Archipelago is demonstrably one of the highest of any coral reef ecosystem in the Indo-Pacific [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref023">23</a>]. The Chagos Archipelago therefore provides an ideal location for investigating the relationship between fish assemblages and variability in reef benthic habitat and typology, in the absence of impacts from fishing and human populations. Our study assumed that reef fish species distributions did not differ biogeographically across the Chagos Archipelago due to the direction of major current systems in the western Indian Ocean (WIO), and the connectivity of the pelagic larvae of most reef fish [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref028">28</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref030">30</a>]. We do, however, recognise that self-recruitment [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref031">31</a>] and local oceanographic dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref032">32</a>] within and among atolls of the archipelago may affect larval recruitment patterns. An earlier study reported that reef fish assemblages were highly homogeneous across the northern atolls [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref033">33</a>]. Here we use datasets from a range of atolls in the archipelago, from the northernmost atolls to Diego Garcia in the south, to examine variation in the abundance and species structure of fish assemblages, and to identify drivers of this variability.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By confining this study to an isolated archipelago of reefs that are relatively unfished and free of pollution and development, this study contributes to a better understanding of intact Indian Ocean reef fish assemblages. As such, it provides a regional context for interpreting coral reef fish assemblages in the wider Indian Ocean where anthropogenic impacts are more prevalent.</p>
