 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The isolated Chagos Archipelago provides a valuable ecological benchmark for understanding the structure of reef fish assemblages when fishing impacts are minimal. Differences in fish assemblages across the archipelago were associated with variation in reef benthic condition, which suggested a bottom-up response of fish populations to changes in coral cover. Our results support the concept that herbivory and detrivory are significant functions provided by reef fishes [

  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref060">60</a>], but we propose that separating diet from the structural impact of these feeding modes will improve our understanding of their functional role in reef resilience. The large variation in parrotfish abundance found in the Chagos Archipelago supports studies (e.g. Russ et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref021">21</a>]) that caution against assumptions elsewhere that parrotfish population abundances are largely driven by fishing. We found surgeonfish species that graze epilithic algae and parrotfish species that exploit bare substrate to access nutrients within the calcareous matrix [

  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref071">71</a>] are two key taxa responsible for differences in fish assemblages among the atolls. Both may function to keep macroalgal levels down, but the drivers of their populations are different. Parrotfishes have evolved highly successful traits to exploit food sources on reefs and contribute significant biomass on coral reefs [

  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref060">60</a>], including during declines in coral cover [

  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref063">63</a>] and some species are impacted negatively by fishing [
  <a rid="pone.0191448.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0191448.ref063">63</a>]. Clarifying these trophic dynamics is vital to refine functional trait approaches for understanding the impacts of climate change and fishing on coral reef biodiversity.
