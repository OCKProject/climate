 <div class="title">Taxa surveyed for abundance and biomass and their trophic group and functional characteristics.</div>
 <p>All taxa were recorded to species level (not all species are listed here). Those split by body size are species that change diet with size. Trophic categories adapted from Green and Bellwood 2009, Sandin and Williams 2010, and feeding information based on Choat and Clements 1998, 2010; Clements et al. 2016. Species listed in {parentheses} are WIO species but were not observed in this study.</p>
