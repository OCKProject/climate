 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Underwater video transects were recorded using a Sony HDRCX550 camera in a Light and Motion Bluefin housing with Fathom 90 wide angle port and red filter, onto which red lasers with a spacing of 10 cm were mounted to provide scale. Surveys were conducted at each site which ranged in depth from 5–25m. The video aimed for a constant speed (~0.1 m s
