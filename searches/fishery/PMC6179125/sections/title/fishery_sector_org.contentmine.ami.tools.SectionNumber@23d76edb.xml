 <p id="par0550" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bangladesh is heavily reliant on its inland and marine fisheries for trade, as well as subsistence. They contribute over four per cent to the national GDP and are second only to the garment industry in foreign exchange earnings, which are derived largely from shrimp and prawn exports (
  <a rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0215">FRSS, 2013</a>). There has been a general upward trend in total fish production since 1983 (
  <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig. 2</a>), and according to production statistics (
  <a rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0185">DoF, 2014</a>), the total fishery sector growth rate more than doubled between 2005 and 2012. A steady increase in aquaculture production contrasts with a decline in capture fishery production since 2008 (
  <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig. 2</a>). By 2012, aquaculture had become the dominant source of fish production (contributing over 50%), while small-scale inland capture fisheries contributed about 30% and marine capture fisheries 18%. An estimated 88% of marine catches were attributed to artisanal fisheries, and the remainder to the industrial (trawl) sector (
  <a rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0215">FRSS, 2013</a>). The reliability of these statistics is, however, questionable; a reconstruction of marine fisheries catches for Bangladesh from 1950 to 2010 found reconstructed catches to be 157% higher than those reported by Bangladesh to the FAO, largely due to unreported subsistence catches (
