 <p id="par0610" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2004 the DoF introduced the 
  <span class="italic">jatka</span> fisher rehabilitation programme, which aims to improve the socioeconomic condition of affected fishers living inside and around sanctuary areas and thereby to incentivise compliance with the fishing bans (
  <a rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0300">Islam et al., 2016</a>). This is largely based on the distribution of compensation in the form of rice during ban periods (centered on the sanctuary fishing bans), with some alternative livelihood support and awareness raising activities.
