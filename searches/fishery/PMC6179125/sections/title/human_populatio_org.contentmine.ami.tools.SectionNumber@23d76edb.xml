 <p id="par0670" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The human population of Bangladesh is projected to continue growing until around 2060 and the current majority rural population is expected to shift to majority urban (

  <a rid="bib0505" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0505">2018</a>). The Government’s target for an annual economic growth rate of 10%, based on accelerated growth in exports and remittances, would take Bangladesh across the middle-income country threshold by 2021 and lead to a national decline in poverty (

  <a rid="bib0500" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0500">UN, 2015</a>). Yet, it should be noted that continued political unrest and projected climate change (through increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters) could hinder economic growth (
  <a rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0190">EIU, 2015</a>). Without the introduction and enforcement of more effective pollution prevention practices in Bangladesh, water pollution is expected to worsen with continued industrialisation and population growth (

  <a rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0270">Hoque and Clarke, 2013</a>). Rivers will be subject to increased waste generation, effluents from the garment industry – which is projected to continue growing (
  <a rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0155">CIA, 2014</a>) – and eutrophication caused by the intensification of agriculture and aquaculture (
  <a rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0110">BOBLME, 2011</a>). Petrochemical pollution is expected to negatively impact hilsa populations in the Bay of Bengal through increased numbers and continued mechanisation of vessels, growth of the shipbuilding and shipbreaking industries, and potential expansion of the oil and gas sector.

  <a rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0060">BBS, 2009</a>). But climate change also increases poverty and vulnerability (

  <a rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0170">Dasgupta, 2014</a>) and, since rural coastal communities in the west of Bangladesh are expected to be the slowest to rise above poverty, dependence on fishing may remain high and 
  <span class="italic">jatka</span> fishing may continue or even increase. These impacts will depend partly on local adaptation responses (
