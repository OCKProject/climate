 <p id="par0510" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The People’s Republic of Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan at the end of the Liberation War in 1971 and has since experienced rapid political, socioeconomic, and environmental change (
  <a rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0005">Fig. 1</a>). Following independence, Bangladesh suffered from famine, natural disaster, and military rule, before the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1991. Since then, power has passed from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to the Awami League. Due to widespread corruption, institutional politicisation, and misallocation of resources, governance is poor (
  <a rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0120">BTI, 2012</a>). This has allowed developmental NGOs – through their partnership with western aid agencies – to dominate the rural economy and act as a powerful ‘shadow state’ (
  <a rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0315">Karim, 2008</a>). Political tensions remain and, following the creation of the International Crimes Tribunal in 2009, tensions and violence led to the disruption of transport and movement of goods (
  <a rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0120">BTI, 2012</a>). Nevertheless, Bangladesh overperforms on social development indicators, such as health, sanitation, and education, when compared to countries with a similar level of per capita income, and has consequently become a model for other developing countries (

 <p id="par0515" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous environmental acts and supporting policies have been introduced during the process of rapid industrialisation and urbanisation triggered by independence – many of which are directly or indirectly relevant to the hilsa fishery (see Section 
  <a rid="sec0120" ref-type="sec" href="#sec0120">3.5.1</a> for fisheries policies). For example, the National Environmental Conservation Rules, introduced following the 1995 Act, emphasised the mitigation of industrial water pollution; and the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, developed in 2009, has largely succeeded in mainstreaming climate change into national and sectoral development planning (
  <a rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0285">Huq, 2010</a>). However, in general, legislation has not kept pace with environmental change and it is often poorly implemented (
