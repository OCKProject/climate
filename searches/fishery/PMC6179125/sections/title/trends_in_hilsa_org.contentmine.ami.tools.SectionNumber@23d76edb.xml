 <p id="par0630" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Details of the key rates that partially determine hilsa abundance and distribution (movement, reproduction, growth, and mortality), as well as their trends, can be found in mmc3 (in Supplementary material). Here we summarise trends in those rates, as well as overall trends in hilsa abundance and distribution, including stock status. Hilsa range from the Bay of Bengal to the rivers of Bangladesh, India and Myanmar, and this range may have been reduced (

  <a rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0485">Sharma, 2012</a>). However, no data have been published beyond 2009, and much of this information is conflicting or limited in reliability, so trends in abundance are still unclear. While some stock assessments have concluded that hilsa are overfished, exploitation rates are highly uncertain and other risk assessments suggest that populations – although vulnerable to overfishing – may not yet be in decline (
