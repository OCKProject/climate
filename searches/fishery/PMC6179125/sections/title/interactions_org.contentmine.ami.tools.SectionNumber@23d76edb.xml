 <p id="par0640" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current understanding of hilsa ecology indicates that any fluctuation in hilsa populations could result from a combination of institutional, economic, social and physical factors, which may compound each other and interact in myriad ways (
  <a rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0020">Fig. 4</a>). Aside from fishing, key potential drivers of change in hilsa are the physical factors which interact to determine juvenile and adult habitat quality and availability, both of which appear to be declining (
  <a rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0105">BOBLME, 2010</a>). For example, climate change, water diversion activities, and related siltation may interact to block migratory routes, and pollution may interact with deforestation, climate, and water diversion activities to reduce primary production and water quality. Most of these factors have multiple routes of potential impact. For example, in addition to direct mortality or reduction in habitat quality, pollution could also undermine current management interventions; if sanctuary areas are polluted, then the efficacy of temporal closures will be severely reduced. Another example is the reduced freshwater discharge and increased siltation resulting from water diversion activities; at the same time as reducing spawning grounds and reducing the suitability of habitat in terms of depth, salinity and turbidity, it may be concentrating migrations, making hilsa more vulnerable to being caught (

  <a rid="bib0450" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0450">Rahman et al., 2012a</a>). While these diversion activities may reduce downstream siltation in some areas, sediment loading is closely coupled with monsoon inundation, so it is possible that intensification of this monsoon could be contributing to increased sediment loads elsewhere, reducing habitat suitability for hilsa (

  <a rid="bib0490" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0490">SRDI, 1998</a>). On the other hand, dredging activities could be reopening some river channels for migration.

 <p id="par0645" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several positive and negative feedback loops at work involving socioeconomic change. In addition to direct impacts of climate change on hilsa feeding, spawning, and migratory behaviours, changes in chemical and physical parameters of habitat could negatively impact hilsa populations via an increase in human vulnerability and poverty and therefore dependence on 
  <span class="italic">jatka</span> in coastal areas (
  <a rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0005">Adger et al., 2003</a>; 
  <a rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0170">Dasgupta, 2014</a>), or through increased demand for water diversion activities. However, positive impacts may also arise through urbanisation and human migration away from coastal areas, which could reduce artisanal fishing pressure (
  <a rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0060">BBS, 2009</a>; 
  <a rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0225">GED, 2012</a>). Although industrialisation has led to a reduction in poverty, this does not seem to have led to a reduction in numbers of artisanal hilsa fishers. In fact, increased mechanisation of vessels may have increased pressure on the fishery, and with urbanisation and industrialisation comes pollution: a rise in the numbers of vessels and oil spills in the Bay of Bengal is causing petrochemical pollution, and as the recent oil spill on the south west coast of Bangladesh demonstrated, the country has little contingency for such disasters (

 <p id="par0650" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The complex interactions between hilsa fishing, institutional context, and ecological trends are beyond the scope of this paper. If the rationale underpinning current hilsa management and its implementation is sound, it should in theory protect against the overfishing of 
  <span class="italic">jatka</span> and adults and thereby influence trends in hilsa abundance and distribution. However, the scientific basis for current management is often weak and there is evidence to suggest that implementation suffers from enforcement and compliance issues (
