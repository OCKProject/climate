 <p id="par0495" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We identified the primary economic activities in Bangladesh, and those which are fast-growing or being explored, and assessed trends in these activities. All of these activities are relevant to the hilsa fishery through the impacts of livelihood availability and wealth on fishing pressure (

  <a rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0275">Hossain et al., 2016</a>). Because of the direct impact of exploitation on hilsa abundance, we focused largely on bioeconomic trends in the fishing industry, looking for trends in commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE) and economic value in the hilsa fishery.
