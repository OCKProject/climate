We explored trends in abundance and distribution of hilsa by compiling all available information on the key rates that partially determine this abundance and distribution (movement, reproduction, growth, and mortality). We also explored trends in stock status; due to data limitations, no reliable stock assessments have been conducted in Bangladesh waters, but we reviewed the available information. We included official national catch statistics (and CPUE, where available), which can be useful indicators of abundance when other data are sparse (
