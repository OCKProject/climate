 <p id="par0660" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bangladesh is likely to continue to experience climate change, with an overall reduction in precipitation and an increase in monsoon precipitation (

  <a rid="bib0460" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0460">Rahman et al., 2012c</a>). Assessments of the potential impact of climate change on cyclone frequency and intensity in Bangladesh are tentative (
  <a rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0320">Karim and Mimura, 2008</a>), but the IPCC has estimated a 5–10% increase in peak intensity and a 20–30% increase in associated precipitation rates (
  <a rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0290">IPCC, 2013</a>), the effects of which would be compounded by projected global sea-level rise (

  <a rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0320">Karim and Mimura, 2008</a>). Model projections show a steady rise in sea surface temperatures in Bangladesh over the next century, with a potential increase in net primary production (

 <p id="par0665" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is expected to cause a decline in fish production potential in South Asian countries that are highly dependent on fisheries, and specifically in Bangladesh (
  <a rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0055">Barange et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0250">Habib et al., 2014</a>). Modelling indicates that these changes will cause a decline in marine hilsa production potential in Bangladesh over the course of the century (
  <a rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0200">Fernandes et al., 2015</a>), although, within Bangladesh there may be some habitats that become more suitable for hilsa and others that become less suitable. Changes in water temperature, turbidity, nutrient levels and salinity are likely to impact migratory behaviour and therefore restrict hilsa distribution – especially when considered in combination with the possible effects of water diversion activities, associated siltation, land reclamation, and pollution. Without habitat restoration, and depending on future rates of deforestation, submerged islands in downstream areas are likely to continue blocking migratory paths (
  <a rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0180">DoF, 2002</a>) and spawning behaviour might also be affected by warming and changes in freshwater flow. Although marine and inland populations are inextricably linked, inland populations are assumed to be more vulnerable to the impacts of physical drivers and this is where depletion will likely occur first.
