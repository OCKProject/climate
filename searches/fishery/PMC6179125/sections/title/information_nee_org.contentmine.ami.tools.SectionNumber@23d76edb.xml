 <p id="par0720" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We now highlight key information requirements, in order to improve the robustness of the frame of reference as a tool for action and intervention evaluation (
  <a rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table" href="#tbl0020">Table 4</a>). There is a clear need to improve hilsa stock assessment by conducting fishery-independent surveys of biomass on an international regional scale, in order to help managers understand the proportion of hilsa that should be protected for sufficient spawning biomass and which life stages to target. If the current catch assessment survey continues to be used, more data on age structure and size composition are required, and the survey should be extended from major rivers and estuarine areas to cover the whole country, including marine areas. Any assessments should employ a standardised modelling framework so that they can support a regional management plan. Collection of commercial catch and effort data should be extended to the inland fishery, if possible, where pressure on hilsa populations and the distribution of fishing activities are unclear. A spatial analysis of fishing activities across all marine, riverine and estuarine areas would facilitate optimisation of fishery closures. More ecosystem research and modelling are needed to establish the effects of potential physical drivers of change, particularly climate change, pollution and water diversion activities. Finally, a rigorous assessment of the probable effectiveness of current management is required, in order to develop a dynamic baseline and counterfactual for future interventions. The hilsa literature is full of claims of positive impacts of fishery management interventions since 2007 (e.g. 
  <a rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0455">Rahman et al., 2012b</a>), but none can attribute changes to specific interventions, due to the absence of baselines and counterfactuals.

Currently commercial CPUE data is available only for the marine sector, but the inland sector provides about one third of estimated catch and so monitoring of these vessel numbers would shed light on the status of inland hilsa populations. Spatial analysis of actual fishing activities, as opposed to landings, would give a clearer picture of the fishery and could be used to optimise placement of fishery closures.</td>
