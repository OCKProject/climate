 <p id="par0735" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By implementing the frame of reference approach developed by 
  <a rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0135">Bull et al. (2015)</a> in an entirely different social-ecological system, this study demonstrates the wider utility of the approach, beyond biodiversity offset policy-making. It is novel in its application of the frame of reference approach to fisheries, but it is also in line with new thinking that affords uncertainty greater importance in fisheries management planning, even where model-based predictions are unreliable or impossible (
  <a rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0175">Davies et al., 2015</a>). All fisheries are managed in the face of uncertainty, but management decisions should not be deferred by calls for further data collection or modelling when a reasonable frame of reference can be developed. Analysis of this kind is relatively rapid and inexpensive, and could thus be used on a regular basis to help guide an adaptive management approach to evaluation against a projected counterfactual (
  <a rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0125">Bull, 2014</a>). Finally, following this framework is one way to ensure that uncertainty is considered from the very beginning of an intervention design process (
