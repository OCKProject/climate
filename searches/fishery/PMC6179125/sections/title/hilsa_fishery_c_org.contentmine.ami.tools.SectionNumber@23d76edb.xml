 <p id="par0555" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hilsa are distributed throughout coastal regions of the Indian Ocean, from Kuwait eastwards towards Myanmar (
  <a rid="bib0515" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0515">Whitehead, 1985</a>), but stocks in the Persian Gulf are genetically distinct from those in the Bay of Bengal (

  <a rid="bib0480" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0480">Salini et al., 2004</a>). Bangladesh lands 50–60% of reported global hilsa catches (
  <a rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0105">BOBLME, 2010</a>). The hilsa fishery is a commercial one comprised of inland (artisanal) and marine (artisanal and industrial) sectors; hilsa are rarely caught purely for subsistence because they are high value fish (
  <a rid="bib0495" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0495">Ullah et al., 2014</a>). Fishing occurs throughout the year, peaking from mid-August to October, when the majority of hilsa are reportedly caught (60–70%), and to a lesser extent in January and February, inland (
  <a rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0455">Rahman et al., 2012b</a>). Fishing activity is reduced in most areas from November to July, particularly during the monsoon months from June to mid-August.

 <p id="par0560" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most hilsa catch is marketed and consumed domestically as fresh fish (
  <a rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0025">Alam, 2010</a>), but post-harvest management of fish in Bangladesh is generally poor. Only Bangladesh Fisheries Development Corporation (BFDC) landings centres at Cox’s Bazar and Chittagong (established specifically for the marketing of BFDC trawler catch) have adequate facilities (
  <a rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0015">Ahmed, 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0295">Islam, 2003</a>), but there are about 6500 private fish markets in the country, more than half of which are small village markets (
  <a rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0300">Islam et al., 2016</a>). Post-harvest loss rises during peak fishing season, when supply exceeds the availability of block ice for preservation (see mmc2 in Supplementary material). Until the late 2000s less than two per cent of total catch was legally exported to India and countries in the Middle East, Far East, Europe, USA and Australia where there are Bangladeshi diaspora, bringing in some foreign exchange earnings (Table B.2 in Supplementary material mmc2;

  <a rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0385">Mome and Arnason, 2007</a>). However, the DoF has since implemented an export restriction (2007) and ban (2012 onwards) – a reported attempt to reduce the domestic price of hilsa and increase availability of the fish in national markets, with probable political motivations (
  <a rid="bib0405" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0405">Padiyar et al., 2012</a>; M. Mome, Department of Fisheries, personal communication, 29th May 2014). In fact, a great deal is still being illegally exported to Kolkata (C. Meisner, WorldFish, personal communication, 26th May 2014).
