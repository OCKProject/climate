 <p id="par0725" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The task of developing successful fishery management interventions, and evaluating their contribution to sustainability, is always constrained by uncertainties arising from, for example, stochastic environmental variation or limited understanding of system dynamics – particularly resource user behaviour (

  <a rid="bib0395" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0395">Nicholson and Possingham, 2007</a>). Environmental modelling approaches to dealing with this uncertainty are available (
  <a rid="bib0465" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0465">Refsgaard et al., 2007</a>), but they have received limited attention in the fisheries or conservation literature and are still rarely used in conservation decision-making (

  <a rid="bib0395" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0395">Nicholson and Possingham, 2007</a>). In fisheries, as in other fields of applied ecology, there is a widespread unwillingness among decision-makers to embrace uncertainty (

  <a rid="bib0510" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0510">Walters, 2007</a>). Managers have long expected scientists to provide single, clear predictions and management prescriptions from models parameterised with historical data, but the depth and complexity of understanding required for useful modelled predictions that reduce uncertainty to an acceptable level is often lacking, particularly in small-scale developing-world fisheries. Learning from the failures and successes of weather and climate science – particularly the dangers of failing to effectively communicate uncertainties to decision-makers and other stakeholders – alternative approaches to incorporating uncertainty into fisheries management decisions are surely required (

 <p id="par0730" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study demonstrates how a useful frame of reference, comprising a baseline and counterfactual, can be developed to guide decision-making in complex, data-poor systems, even in the absence of reliable, predictable models. Similar in approach to scenario planning, this process can help to anticipate change, even when the projections themselves are qualitative and based on incomplete information (
  <a rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0160">Clark, 2001</a>). Although no quantitative counterfactual could be established for the hilsa fishery, the qualitative framework used here provides a way to break down and assess the drivers of potential change in a system – institutional, social, economic and physical – and their complex interactions, reducing the potential for unexpected outcomes (
  <a rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0330">Larossa et al., 2016</a>). The outer-bound feasible counterfactuals we developed may not be an accurate prediction of the future, but the process enabled critical evaluation of contradictions between studies and of the reliability of understanding and assumptions about trends in the hilsa fishery, and their likely causes. This allowed the identification of key areas of uncertainty, information needs and their implications for management. Thus, in addition to providing a frame of reference that can be used to evaluate potential future interventions, the study also provides a basis to consider the needs and opportunities for fishery improvements (
  <a rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0085">Bladon, 2016</a>). Moreover, the identification of outcomes that were likely in both counterfactual scenarios (e.g. climate change) highlighted areas that should be the focus of future research, if robust management interventions are to be designed and evaluated.
