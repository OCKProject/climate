 <p id="par0565" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1983, the DoF initiated an annual catch assessment survey system for inland and marine fisheries in Bangladesh, with an emphasis on hilsa. There are, however, problems with sample sizes and sampling procedure: The assessment focuses on sample villages (many of which no longer exist) in major rivers and some marine areas, and it cannot therefore provide an accurate picture of catches. A reconstruction of marine catches from 1950 to 2010 bears out this lack of reliability, indicating that hilsa makes up 18% of total marine catches and 41% of artisanal marine catches, and that reported landings have been underestimated by 19% (

 </p>
 <p id="par0570" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contribution of hilsa to total reported capture fishery production, estimated from the catch survey, increased from 18% in 1983 to 30% in 2012 (Table B.1 in Supplementary material mmc2). Historically, fishing was concentrated upstream in major rivers, but the proportion of hilsa landings coming from the inland fishery has apparently declined, and over the last two decades the marine sector has become the dominant reported source of hilsa (
  <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig. 2</a>). This shift has been attributed both to 
  <span class="italic">jatka</span> overfishing inland and to the mechanisation and expansion of the marine sector (

 </p>
 <p id="par0575" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of reliable estimates of annual fishing effort makes actual CPUE difficult to calculate, particularly for the inland fishery. Numbers of mechanised and non-mechanised boats in the artisanal marine sector have been estimated by the DoF and appear to have increased since 1983, which indicates that numbers of fishers (although not specifically hilsa fishers) are also increasing (
  <a rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0255">Haldar, 2004</a>; Table B.3 in Supplementary material mmc2). Analysis of official marine landings and effort data shows a decline in CPUE between 1984 and 2006, although the trend was less clear for the non-mechanised sector (
  <a rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0385">Mome and Arnason, 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0485">Sharma, 2012</a>). 
  <a rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0485">Sharma (2012)</a> found catchability (the relationship between CPUE and standing biomass) of hilsa in the non-mechanised marine sector to be almost twice that of the mechanised marine sector – probably because the mechanised sector is targeting other species as well (rather than just targeting vulnerable concentrations of migrating hilsa) and it has a shorter history of fishing.
 </p>
 <p id="par0580" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catch values are also difficult to estimate because of the complexity of the market chain and the relationships between fishers and intermediaries (
  <a rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0435">Porras et al., 2017</a>; mmc2 in Supplementary material). Estimated annual landings revenues range from USD 380 million (or one per cent of GDP) in 2006 to USD 640–850 million in 2009 (
  <a rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0385">Mome and Arnason, 2007</a>; 
  <a rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0485">Sharma, 2012</a>). By multiplying an average value of 430 BDT per kg (based on a one-year survey of four fish markets; 
  <a rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0200">Fernandes et al., 2015</a>) by the latest reported annual hilsa catch volume, we arrived at a much higher estimate of two billion USD. Through a very simple bio-economic assessment of the marine artisanal fishery (restricted by data limitations), 
  <a rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0385">Mome and Arnason (2007)</a> found annual net profit to be only seven per cent of total revenues, due to high costs of fishing. Concluding that stocks were overexploited, they made recommendations for a 60% reduction in effort, through restrictions on numbers of mechanised vessels in the artisanal marine sector. In turn this was expected to more than double hilsa stocks and increase individual vessel catch rates, which they calculated could raise annual net profits by 10–15%. Yet, the industrial sector, in contrast to the artisanal sector, has been described as under-developed and under-utilised, and Bangladesh is now aiming for a ‘blue economy’ under which the trawler industry could expand (C. Meisner, WorldFish, personal communication, 26th May 2014).
