 <p id="par0485" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The life history of hilsa is known to be influenced by environmental conditions including water salinity, turbidity, flow, temperature, pH, dissolved O

  <a rid="bib0450" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0450">Rahman et al., 2012a</a>). We therefore identified key physical drivers that have been linked to general fish abundance and distribution, to changes in those environmental conditions, or directly to the abundance and distribution of hilsa. These drivers were: climate change, water diversion activities, forest cover, and pollution (see mmc1 in Supplementary material).
