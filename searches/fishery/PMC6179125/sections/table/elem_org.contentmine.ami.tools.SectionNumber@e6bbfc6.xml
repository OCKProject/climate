    <td align="left">Catch assessment survey should be extended from the major rivers to cover the country more comprehensively. Currently commercial CPUE data is available only for the marine sector, but the inland sector provides about one third of estimated catch and so monitoring of these vessel numbers would shed light on the status of inland hilsa populations. Spatial analysis of actual fishing activities, as opposed to landings, would give a clearer picture of the fishery and could be used to optimise placement of fishery closures.</td>
