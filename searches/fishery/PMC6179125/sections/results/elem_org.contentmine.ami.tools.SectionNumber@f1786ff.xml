  <p id="par0510" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The People’s Republic of Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan at the end of the Liberation War in 1971 and has since experienced rapid political, socioeconomic, and environmental change (
   <a rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0005">Fig. 1</a>). Following independence, Bangladesh suffered from famine, natural disaster, and military rule, before the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1991. Since then, power has passed from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to the Awami League. Due to widespread corruption, institutional politicisation, and misallocation of resources, governance is poor (
   <a rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0120">BTI, 2012</a>). This has allowed developmental NGOs – through their partnership with western aid agencies – to dominate the rural economy and act as a powerful ‘shadow state’ (
   <a rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0315">Karim, 2008</a>). Political tensions remain and, following the creation of the International Crimes Tribunal in 2009, tensions and violence led to the disruption of transport and movement of goods (
   <a rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0120">BTI, 2012</a>). Nevertheless, Bangladesh overperforms on social development indicators, such as health, sanitation, and education, when compared to countries with a similar level of per capita income, and has consequently become a model for other developing countries (

  </p>
  <p id="par0515" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Numerous environmental acts and supporting policies have been introduced during the process of rapid industrialisation and urbanisation triggered by independence – many of which are directly or indirectly relevant to the hilsa fishery (see Section 
   <a rid="sec0120" ref-type="sec" href="#sec0120">3.5.1</a> for fisheries policies). For example, the National Environmental Conservation Rules, introduced following the 1995 Act, emphasised the mitigation of industrial water pollution; and the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, developed in 2009, has largely succeeded in mainstreaming climate change into national and sectoral development planning (
   <a rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0285">Huq, 2010</a>). However, in general, legislation has not kept pace with environmental change and it is often poorly implemented (

They contribute over four per cent to the national GDP and are second only to the garment industry in foreign exchange earnings, which are derived largely from shrimp and prawn exports (
    <a rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0215">FRSS, 2013</a>). There has been a general upward trend in total fish production since 1983 (

    <a rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0185">DoF, 2014</a>), the total fishery sector growth rate more than doubled between 2005 and 2012. A steady increase in aquaculture production contrasts with a decline in capture fishery production since 2008 (
    <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig. 2</a>). By 2012, aquaculture had become the dominant source of fish production (contributing over 50%), while small-scale inland capture fisheries contributed about 30% and marine capture fisheries 18%.

The reliability of these statistics is, however, questionable; a reconstruction of marine fisheries catches for Bangladesh from 1950 to 2010 found reconstructed catches to be 157% higher than those reported by Bangladesh to the FAO, largely due to unreported subsistence catches (

    <a rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0105">BOBLME, 2010</a>). The hilsa fishery is a commercial one comprised of inland (artisanal) and marine (artisanal and industrial) sectors; hilsa are rarely caught purely for subsistence because they are high value fish (
    <a rid="bib0495" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0495">Ullah et al., 2014</a>). Fishing occurs throughout the year, peaking from mid-August to October, when the majority of hilsa are reportedly caught (60–70%), and to a lesser extent in January and February, inland (
    <a rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0455">Rahman et al., 2012b</a>). Fishing activity is reduced in most areas from November to July, particularly during the monsoon months from June to mid-August.
   </p>
   <p id="par0560" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most hilsa catch is marketed and consumed domestically as fresh fish (
    <a rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0025">Alam, 2010</a>), but post-harvest management of fish in Bangladesh is generally poor. Only Bangladesh Fisheries Development Corporation (BFDC) landings centres at Cox’s Bazar and Chittagong (established specifically for the marketing of BFDC trawler catch) have adequate facilities (
    <a rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0015">Ahmed, 2007</a>; 
    <a rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0295">Islam, 2003</a>), but there are about 6500 private fish markets in the country, more than half of which are small village markets (
    <a rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0300">Islam et al., 2016</a>). Post-harvest loss rises during peak fishing season, when supply exceeds the availability of block ice for preservation (see mmc2 in Supplementary material). Until the late 2000s less than two per cent of total catch was legally exported to India and countries in the Middle East, Far East, Europe, USA and Australia where there are Bangladeshi diaspora, bringing in some foreign exchange earnings (Table B.2 in Supplementary material mmc2;

    <a rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0385">Mome and Arnason, 2007</a>). However, the DoF has since implemented an export restriction (2007) and ban (2012 onwards) – a reported attempt to reduce the domestic price of hilsa and increase availability of the fish in national markets, with probable political motivations (

   <p id="par0565" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1983, the DoF initiated an annual catch assessment survey system for inland and marine fisheries in Bangladesh, with an emphasis on hilsa. There are, however, problems with sample sizes and sampling procedure: The assessment focuses on sample villages (many of which no longer exist) in major rivers and some marine areas, and it cannot therefore provide an accurate picture of catches. A reconstruction of marine catches from 1950 to 2010 bears out this lack of reliability, indicating that hilsa makes up 18% of total marine catches and 41% of artisanal marine catches, and that reported landings have been underestimated by 19% (
    <a rid="bib0495" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0495">Ullah et al., 2014</a>).
   </p>
   <p id="par0570" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contribution of hilsa to total reported capture fishery production, estimated from the catch survey, increased from 18% in 1983 to 30% in 2012 (Table B.1 in Supplementary material mmc2). Historically, fishing was concentrated upstream in major rivers, but the proportion of hilsa landings coming from the inland fishery has apparently declined, and over the last two decades the marine sector has become the dominant reported source of hilsa (
    <a rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0010">Fig. 2</a>). This shift has been attributed both to 
    <span class="italic">jatka</span> overfishing inland and to the mechanisation and expansion of the marine sector (

   </p>
   <p id="par0575" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The lack of reliable estimates of annual fishing effort makes actual CPUE difficult to calculate, particularly for the inland fishery. Numbers of mechanised and non-mechanised boats in the artisanal marine sector have been estimated by the DoF and appear to have increased since 1983, which indicates that numbers of fishers (although not specifically hilsa fishers) are also increasing (
    <a rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0255">Haldar, 2004</a>; Table B.3 in Supplementary material mmc2). Analysis of official marine landings and effort data shows a decline in CPUE between 1984 and 2006, although the trend was less clear for the non-mechanised sector (
    <a rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0385">Mome and Arnason, 2007</a>; 
    <a rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0485">Sharma, 2012</a>). 
    <a rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0485">Sharma (2012)</a> found catchability (the relationship between CPUE and standing biomass) of hilsa in the non-mechanised marine sector to be almost twice that of the mechanised marine sector – probably because the mechanised sector is targeting other species as well (rather than just targeting vulnerable concentrations of migrating hilsa) and it has a shorter history of fishing.
   </p>
   <p id="par0580" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Catch values are also difficult to estimate because of the complexity of the market chain and the relationships between fishers and intermediaries (
    <a rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0435">Porras et al., 2017</a>; mmc2 in Supplementary material). Estimated annual landings revenues range from USD 380 million (or one per cent of GDP) in 2006 to USD 640–850 million in 2009 (
    <a rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0385">Mome and Arnason, 2007</a>; 
    <a rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0485">Sharma, 2012</a>). By multiplying an average value of 430 BDT per kg (based on a one-year survey of four fish markets; 
    <a rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0200">Fernandes et al., 2015</a>) by the latest reported annual hilsa catch volume, we arrived at a much higher estimate of two billion USD. Through a very simple bio-economic assessment of the marine artisanal fishery (restricted by data limitations), 
    <a rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0385">Mome and Arnason (2007)</a> found annual net profit to be only seven per cent of total revenues, due to high costs of fishing. Concluding that stocks were overexploited, they made recommendations for a 60% reduction in effort, through restrictions on numbers of mechanised vessels in the artisanal marine sector. In turn this was expected to more than double hilsa stocks and increase individual vessel catch rates, which they calculated could raise annual net profits by 10–15%. Yet, the industrial sector, in contrast to the artisanal sector, has been described as under-developed and under-utilised, and Bangladesh is now aiming for a ‘blue economy’ under which the trawler industry could expand (C. Meisner, WorldFish, personal communication, 26th May 2014).

The DoF responded to concerns about declining hilsa catches in 1991 by initiating research on the fishery, which led to international collaborations with the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and the World Bank-DFID Fourth Fisheries Project (FFP). Policy directives and recommendations from these projects have largely been implemented through the Hilsa Fisheries Management Action Plan (HFMAP). More recently, research has been conducted on hilsa through a Darwin Initiative project led by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and the WorldFish Enhanced Coastal Fisheries (ECOFISH) project, which is supporting the DoF to develop an updated HFMAP. Based on the assumption that recruitment is compromised, and that this is a result of overfishing

   <p id="par0640" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current understanding of hilsa ecology indicates that any fluctuation in hilsa populations could result from a combination of institutional, economic, social and physical factors, which may compound each other and interact in myriad ways (
    <a rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig" href="#fig0020">Fig. 4</a>). Aside from fishing, key potential drivers of change in hilsa are the physical factors which interact to determine juvenile and adult habitat quality and availability, both of which appear to be declining (
    <a rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0105">BOBLME, 2010</a>). For example, climate change, water diversion activities, and related siltation may interact to block migratory routes, and pollution may interact with deforestation, climate, and water diversion activities to reduce primary production and water quality. Most of these factors have multiple routes of potential impact. For example, in addition to direct mortality or reduction in habitat quality, pollution could also undermine current management interventions; if sanctuary areas are polluted, then the efficacy of temporal closures will be severely reduced. Another example is the reduced freshwater discharge and increased siltation resulting from water diversion activities; at the same time as reducing spawning grounds and reducing the suitability of habitat in terms of depth, salinity and turbidity, it may be concentrating migrations, making hilsa more vulnerable to being caught (
    <a rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0355">Miao et al., 2010</a>; 
    <a rid="bib0450" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0450">Rahman et al., 2012a</a>). While these diversion activities may reduce downstream siltation in some areas, sediment loading is closely coupled with monsoon inundation, so it is possible that intensification of this monsoon could be contributing to increased sediment loads elsewhere, reducing habitat suitability for hilsa (

In addition to direct impacts of climate change on hilsa feeding, spawning, and migratory behaviours, changes in chemical and physical parameters of habitat could negatively impact hilsa populations via an increase in human vulnerability and poverty and therefore dependence on 
    <span class="italic">jatka</span> in coastal areas (

    <a rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0170">Dasgupta, 2014</a>), or through increased demand for water diversion activities. However, positive impacts may also arise through urbanisation and human migration away from coastal areas, which could reduce artisanal fishing pressure (

    <a rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0225">GED, 2012</a>). Although industrialisation has led to a reduction in poverty, this does not seem to have led to a reduction in numbers of artisanal hilsa fishers. In fact, increased mechanisation of vessels may have increased pressure on the fishery, and with urbanisation and industrialisation comes pollution: a rise in the numbers of vessels and oil spills in the Bay of Bengal is causing petrochemical pollution, and as the recent oil spill on the south west coast of Bangladesh demonstrated, the country has little contingency for such disasters (

     <span class="italic">jatka</span> populations could lead to a collapse of hilsa stocks in Bangladesh within one to two decades (
     <a rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0050">Bala et al., 2014</a>; 
     <a rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0200">Fernandes et al., 2015</a>; 
     <a rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0385">Mome and Arnason, 2007</a>; 
     <a rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0485">Sharma, 2012</a>). Given the Government’s aim to increase hilsa production, and given industry trends, the marine fishery – both artisanal and industrial sectors – looks set to continue expanding (
     <a rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0180">DoF, 2002</a>). This expansion would require improvements in post-harvest technology and infrastructure, which could lead to overexploitation in the Bay of Bengal (
     <a rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0250">Habib et al., 2014</a>). Even with these improvements, it is unlikely that the export ban will be lifted, and so expansion of the export market is unlikely.
    </p>
    <p id="par0685" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total aquaculture production will almost certainly continue its upward trend, although the Government is mindful of maintaining its capture fisheries (
     <a rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0200">Fernandes et al., 2015</a>). Currently hilsa is not suitable for aquaculture. Even if substantial progress is made with economically viable hilsa cage culture, it would be unlikely to take much pressure off the wild capture hilsa fishery, given the social and cultural importance of and demand for hilsa. Recommendations have been made for effort restrictions on the artisanal fishery, but given the weak enforcement capacity these are probably much less realistic than the current spatial and temporal fishing bans (
     <a rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0385">Mome and Arnason, 2007</a>). If a major threat to 
     <span class="italic">jatka</span> and spawning adults is indeed overfishing, then improved monitoring and enforcement of current management rules could prevent collapse and potentially lead to increased hilsa abundance (
     <a rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0085">Bladon, 2016</a>). 
     <a rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0485">Sharma (2012)</a> pointed out that since intrinsic growth rates are high, hilsa should respond quickly to conservation interventions. Projections indicate that with more sustainable management, some climate change impacts on marine hilsa production could be mitigated, although it would not halt a long-term decline (
     <a rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0200">Fernandes et al., 2015</a>). However, in light of the projected development of the marine fishery, the efficacy of these rules, which are enforced largely inland, is uncertain. The proposed development of a regional hilsa fishery management programme should reduce the impacts of physical drivers or fishing pressure from adjacent countries, but it is ‘only an idea’ (M. Khan, Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute, personal communication, 19th May 2014).

    <p id="par0690" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the time of writing, a Conservation Trust Fund (CTF) was going through the ratification process, with the aim of generating financial resources for hilsa conservation (
     <a rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0340">Majumder et al., 2015b</a>). Although the proposed CTF does not conform to best practice standards in terms of governance structure, it could be used to finance increased coverage of the 
     <span class="italic">jatka</span> fisher rehabilitation programme and other management interventions, and pave the way for a more effective public-private partnership in the future (

An alternative counterfactual, which is a feasible outer-bound desirable state, is where political will for institutional change, based on improved understanding of hilsa biology, effectively limits or reduces fishing pressure on hilsa populations, and mitigates some of the impacts of other anthropogenic activities, so that populations stabilise (

   <a rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0180">DoF, 2002</a>), and although over a decade later most of these recommendations have not yet been implemented, areas in which progress has been made are financing and regional management. The creation of a CTF could be pivotal in terms of institutional change and sustainability of conservation interventions, but this will depend on the extent to which best practice is followed (

There is a clear need to improve hilsa stock assessment by conducting fishery-independent surveys of biomass on an international regional scale, in order to help managers understand the proportion of hilsa that should be protected for sufficient spawning biomass and which life stages to target. If the current catch assessment survey continues to be used, more data on age structure and size composition are required, and the survey should be extended from major rivers and estuarine areas to cover the whole country, including marine areas. Any assessments should employ a standardised modelling framework so that they can support a regional management plan. Collection of commercial catch and effort data should be extended to the inland fishery, if possible, where pressure on hilsa populations and the distribution of fishing activities are unclear. A spatial analysis of fishing activities across all marine, riverine and estuarine areas would facilitate optimisation of fishery closures. More ecosystem research and modelling are needed to establish the effects of potential physical drivers of change, particularly climate change, pollution and water diversion activities. Finally, a rigorous assessment of the probable effectiveness of current management is required, in order to develop a dynamic baseline and counterfactual for future interventions. The hilsa literature is full of claims of positive impacts of fishery management interventions since 2007 (e.g. 
   <a rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib0455">Rahman et al., 2012b</a>), but none can attribute changes to specific interventions, due to the absence of baselines and counterfactuals.

Currently commercial CPUE data is available only for the marine sector, but the inland sector provides about one third of estimated catch and so monitoring of these vessel numbers would shed light on the status of inland hilsa populations. Spatial analysis of actual fishing activities, as opposed to landings, would give a clearer picture of the fishery and could be used to optimise placement of fishery closures.</td>
