 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Atlantis is a modelling framework which includes the main components of the ecosystem and was developed specifically for use within management strategy evaluations [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref040">40</a>]. Therefore, it includes: i) a representation of each of the major biophysical and human components of the ecosystem [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref043">43</a>]; ii) adaptive management processes (monitoring, assessment and management decision) [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref044">44</a>]; and iii) socioeconomic processes and drivers for the human use and behavior [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref043">43</a>]. Moreover, Atlantis presents a range of alternative model formulations, which can be tailored to the user’s preferences. Hence, Atlantis can be implemented with different levels of complexity, from a simple model with few interactions to a complicated model with multiple biological connections and a complex structure of fishing fleets [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref043">43</a>]. A detailed description of the Atlantis model and all its options and equations can be found in the model’s manual [
