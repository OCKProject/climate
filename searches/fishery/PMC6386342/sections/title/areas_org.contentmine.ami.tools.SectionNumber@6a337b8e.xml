 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Atlantis is a three-dimensional spatially explicit framework which is based on irregular polygons that account for the spatial structuring of the dominant processes (e.g. physical, biological and human impact) [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref043">43</a>]. Furthermore, the model has a horizontal stratification which can incorporate vertical migration or depth-based variation in physical and biological components. The JFRE model covers an area of approximately 97,166 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>. This area includes a wide range of habitats, ranging from soft sediments and shallow rocky reefs in the coastal zone to pelagic habitats in the open ocean, pelagic and deep water habitats in the offshore area and seamounts (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g001" href="#pone.0212485.g001">Fig 1</a>). The division into polygons for the JFRE model was based on the main hydrodynamic, biological and fishery management components of the area (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g001" href="#pone.0212485.g001">Fig 1</a>). Parsing followed four main criteria: i) vertical and horizontal spatial distribution of the species and functional groups; ii) spatial distribution of nutrients, chlorophyll, or phytoplankton, based on model and bibliographic information; iii) spatial distribution of fishing fleets that currently or previously operated in the JFRE (artisanal and industrial); and iv) management areas, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), marine parks and exclusive artisanal fishery areas. Each of these polygons can have up to eight depth strata, with divisions at 20, 50, 150, 250, 400, 650, 1000 and 4300 m. This stratification is based on the vertical distribution of the functional groups [
