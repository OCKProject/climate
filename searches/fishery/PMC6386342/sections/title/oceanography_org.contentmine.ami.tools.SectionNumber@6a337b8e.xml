 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Atlantis the biophysical sub-model was coupled with outputs from a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to provide the main flows (e.g. water, salt, nutrients and heat) for the ecosystem. The eddy-resolving Ocean General Circulation Model for the Earth Simulator (OFES) [

  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref055">55</a>] was used to provide the oceanographic driving for the Atlantis-JFRE and configured over the period 1950-2011. OFES is a quasi-global high-resolution ocean model configured on a horizontal grid of 0.1Â° with 54 vertical levels (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Adaptation of OFES output to Atlantis requires: i) integrating OFES flows to the respective depth layers for each face in the available polygons; ii) correction for hyper-diffusion within polygons (which involves dividing the orthogonal flows between two polygons by the length of the interaction face between those polygons); and iii) statistical representation of relative seasonal eddy strength, so that the effect of eddies on productivity and connectivity can be represented. This last step is particularly important because these oceanographic structures are known to be abundant and important for productivity and connectivity in JFRE [
