 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The JFRE model included five different fisheries:</p>
 <div list-type="order" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Three artisanal fisheries, which operate in RC-SC and AS. These fisheries include the Juan Fernández rock lobster, golden crab and J.F. morwong fisheries. Traps were used as fishing gear for the two crustacean fisheries, and longlines for the finfish.</p>
   <p>In addition, a two stage bait fishery is associated with the crustacean fisheries. The first stage involves catching small pelagic fish, which serve as bait for the second stage. In the second stage, the fishery catches moray eels, J.F. morwong and small and large benthic fishes which are then used as bait in the crustacean fishery [

 <p specific-use="continuation" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the purposes of this study a fishing mortality rate approach was used. The same rate was applied in all spatial cells occupied by the fished species and zoned open to fishing, but size specific selectivity was included via the use of a logistic length-based selectivity curve [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref047">47</a>]. These fishing mortality and selectivity parameters were obtained from a number of technical reports available for fisheries in the region [

Bycatch included coral, other crustaceans, molluscs, sea urchins, deposit filter feeders and octopus for the artisanal fleet; and sharks, coral, other crustaceans and deposit filter feeders for the industrial fleet [
