 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The functioning of JFRE, like other seamount ecosystems, is highly dependent on local primary production [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref080">80</a>]. The major component of the food web is centered on phytoplankton, zooplankton and mesopelagic fishes, similar in structure to other deep-sea ecosystems [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref081">81</a>]. In addition, there is a difference in the trophic structure between species that inhabit different depths. This apparent change in diet is mainly determined by the type of prey accessed by functional groups living at different depths in seamounts [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref009">9</a>]. For example, deep water species such as orange roughy have a diet different from those associated to shallower waters such as Juan Fern√°ndez morwong (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g004" href="#pone.0212485.g004">Fig 4</a>). Moreover, it is likely that the same functional group will have differences in their diets depending on the depth of the seamount they inhabit [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref009">9</a>], this is something that was not analyzed in detail in this model due to a lack of sufficient observational data. Such an analysis would however be useful as part of future work so as to increase understanding of how the potential existence of alternative trophic pathways may (or may not) influence the outcome of development and management scenarios in the modelled area.
