 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two functional groups (i.e. orange roughy and alfonsino) captured by the industrial fleet have different population responses to the effect of fishing. Alfonsino showed a decrease in biomass and total abundance, whereas for orange roughy the total catch was just a small part of the total biomass of the population. In 2006, the orange roughy fishery was closed, arguing a population depletion based on the sharp fall in catches [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref094">94</a>]. The model results suggest, that this reduction in catches is likely to be related to other factors affecting resource availability and not directly due to low biomass levels. What is observed in the model has been reported previously [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref065">65</a>] and several hypotheses (apart from overfishing) have been proposed to explain low availability of orange roughy:
 </p>
 <div list-type="bullet" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Alteration of the reproductive behavior which leads to transitory problems in resources availability. The fishing effort on orange roughy was concentrated between May and August, but centered at spawning period (June-July) [
    <a rid="pone.0212485.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref095">95</a>]. This direct and continuous impact of fishing (during consecutive fishing seasons) on the reproductive stock may have generated a change in the reproductive behavior of the species, which is reflected in an apparent decrease in abundance.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Strong inter-annual availability. It has been reported that orange roughy presents strong interannual variations in its recruitment (or spawning success) [
    <a rid="pone.0212485.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref096">96</a>]. This would generate strong interannual changes in the vulnerable biomass which would be reflected in a strong variation in catches. This hypothesis is not supported by the model, although interannual variation is observed in the recruitment, there are no strong variation in the biomass of older groups. However, caution needs to be shown since the reduced complexity of the larval processes and may underestimate true inter-annual variability.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Changes and reduction of the suitable habitat for orange roughy as a result of the impact of fishing gear used by the industrial fleet. This alteration of the orange roughy habitat could then induce changes in the spatial distribution of the species. The seamounts impacted by fishing became less productive and therefore are avoided by orange roughy [
    <a rid="pone.0212485.ref097" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref097">97</a>]. This process would leads to a localized stock depletion at scales below that being resolved in the model.
   </p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the model reports that the orange roughy resource is healthy and that the losses in the catches may have originated from other processes, without new information and the analysis of observations that are informative around the real world veracity of the alternative explanations, the hypothesis of overfishing must be maintained under the precautionary approach [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref065">65</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of stock recovery, even though both fisheries were closed for several years (2006 for orange roughy and 2012 for alfonsino) their estimated biomass and abundance has not fully recovered. The recovery of alfonsino has been faster than orange roughy, reaching almost 85% of the unfished biomass by the end of 2016. The model projections, indicate that a full recovery of the alfonsino biomass will be achieved after 12 years of fishery closure. These values are similar to those proposed by other modeling exercises in which the estimated recovery period was found to be 13 years post the fishery being closed [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref066">66</a>]. In orange roughy, the recovery of biomass has been at a much slower rate compared to alfonsino. The model suggests that the fishery is not likely to recover before 44 years of closure reaching about 92% recovery. This estimate is similar to the result by other modeling approaches [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref065">65</a>] where stability is observed around 90% of the spawning biomass with respect to the virgin biomass. This slow rate of recovery of orange roughy is due to its life history characteristics (slow growing and late maturing).
