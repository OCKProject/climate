 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simulations show that the lobster stock has undergone a total biomass depletion of approximately 81% compared to the unfished system (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g003" href="#pone.0212485.g003">3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g005" href="#pone.0212485.g005">5A</a>); although in terms of abundance the drop is 53% (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g005" href="#pone.0212485.g005">Fig 5B</a>). Golden crab presents a similar pattern between abundance and biomass, where the proportional difference in simulated biomass is 4% and observed abundance is less than 1% (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g005" href="#pone.0212485.g005">Fig 5</a>). Juan Fern√°ndez morwong shows a reduction in almost 11% of its biomass compared to an unfished ecosystem. The overall effect of artisanal fishing, with the exception of golden crab and spiny lobster, is reflected discreetly in a few functional groups: a decrease of 4% in the abundance of octopus; less than 3% drop for yellowtail amberjack; less than 1% decrease for other crustaceans (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g005" href="#pone.0212485.g005">Fig 5A</a>); and an increase around 3% in mollusc and sea urchin biomass; Moray eels have a small increase of 2% in biomass, which is not reflected in the abundance (which has a reduction of less than 1%).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the artisanal fleet, bait catches are focused on a few functional groups divided in two categories according to the level of fishing impact. First a high impact category composed of the catches of the functional groups: large pelagic fishes, J.F. morwong, moray eels and yellowtail amberjack with average annual catches of 84.5 (+/-5.5), 83.8 (+/-3.9), 63.4 (+/-3.2) and 51.3 (+/-2.9) tonnes respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g006" href="#pone.0212485.g006">Fig 6A</a>). A second category less impacted is composed of small pelagic fishes, small benthic fishes and large benthic fishes that present annual historical catches close to 3 tonnes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spiny lobster fishery shows the highest levels of bycatch, mainly composed of octopus with an annual average of 5.18 (+/-2.7) tonnes and other crustaceans with 1.91 (+/-0.99) tonnes (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g006" href="#pone.0212485.g006">Fig 6B</a>). In addition, there is incidental catch of corals, sea urchins and deposit feeders with average catches of 0.46 (+/-0.24), 0.3 (+/-0.15) and 0.01 (+/-0.003) tonnes annually respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g006" href="#pone.0212485.g006">Fig 6B</a>). For the golden crab fishery, other crustaceans are the main bycatch with an average of 1.08 (+/-0.03) tonnes annually (
