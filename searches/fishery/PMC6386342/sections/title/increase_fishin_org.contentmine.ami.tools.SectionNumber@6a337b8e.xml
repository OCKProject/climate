 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of this scenario of increased fishing mortality in finfish fisheries are only reflected in a few functional groups. Octopus biomass declined by 7% and J.F. morwong declined by 18% (representing an 14% reduction in abundance). In addition, there was a small observed increase in the abundance and biomass of moray eels (around 2%). Catches increased around 20% for finfish and 95% for Octopus compared to the BAU projection. For the moray eels there is a reduction of 3% and there are almost no changes for spiny lobster and golden crab catches when compared to a BAU projection.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite a complete closure of the industrial fisheries in these projections, there was an 8% change in biomass (6% in abundance) for orange roughy and an increase of 2% for squid (
