 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The industrial fleet has an overall low impact on the ecosystem and it is highly localized and concentrated on a few species (functional groups). Beyond the direct impact on the target species, the reduction of the abundance of alfonsino and orange roughy saw an increase in the biomass of mesopelagic fish. This functional group is an important component of the diet of orange roughy, constituting almost 50% of their diet [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref098" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref098">98</a>], and alfonsino—where mesopelagic are the second most important prey item [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref099" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref099">99</a>]. Therefore, a decrease in the abundance and biomass of these two species is rapidly reflected in mesopelagic fish biomass. In addition, this increase in biomass in the mesopelagic fishes has a direct effect on the biomass of fur seals which are the group’s main predator [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref100" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref100">100</a>]. The model suggest that the exploitation of orange roughy and alfonsino has a positive effect on the recovery of the fur seal population. This means that there is the potential that as these fish stocks recover, there may be a negative impact on the fur seal populations. This outcome may result in either: 1) prey switching by the fur seals and potentially increased interactions with other fisheries; or 2) a decline in the population which may lead to conservation concerns or tourism impacts.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main negative effect of the industrial fisheries on the ecosystem is on corals and shark (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g006" href="#pone.0212485.g006">Fig 6</a>). Even though the reduction of biomass due to bycatch is very small compared with their total biomass, the impact is highly localized. These bycatch species are sessile or with low mobility (benthic sharks) so the real effect of bycatch is below the scale of the model cells. Therefore, it would be difficult to capture in full detail the effects given the current geographical structure of the model. Due to the small spatial extent of the trawling footprint of these fisheries, the level of depletion and loss of species richness is highly localized and represents a small amount compared to the total biomass of these species [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref068">68</a>]. To more thoroughly evaluate this localized effect of industrial bycatch, it is necessary to reconfigure the spatial structure of the model. For example, the current polygons could be subdivided using the areas where the fishing effort was more intense [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref068">68</a>] or use a telescoping spatial approach [
  <a rid="pone.0212485.ref101" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref101">101</a>]. A change like this in the spatial resolution of the model would have two important effects:
 </p>
 <div list-type="order" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>It would help determine the extent of any habitat depletion and loss of species richness at the local level, especially in the areas highly impacted by fishing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>It would facilitate an analysis of the magnitude of heterogeneity in ecosystem outcomes and the tracking of any localized shifts in bycatch levels and potential declines in affected species. For example, a local depletion of bycatch species, as the fishery develops and the richness and abundance of species decreases, could lead to a drop in the levels of bycatch [
    <a rid="pone.0212485.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref068">68</a>, 
    <a rid="pone.0212485.ref102" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0212485.ref102">102</a>]. Such a mechanism would be important to understand as lowering bycatch levels are often interpreted as the positive outcome of fishery management actions (which in some cases they are, but it is important to distinguish the true underlying cause before using the index as a performance measure).
