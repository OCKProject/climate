 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the fishing period, the population of alfonsino reached its highest catch after the biomass had been reduced by 50% with respect to its initial unfished biomass (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g003" href="#pone.0212485.g003">Fig 3</a>). After this depletion, a rapid recovery of its biomass is observed, reaching 85% of its biomass by the end of the hindcast simulation compared to an unfished scenario (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g003" href="#pone.0212485.g003">Fig 3</a>). In contrast orange roughy drove down the total biomass by almost 30% and the rate of recovery is slower, seeing it reach 83% of its total biomass by the end of the hindcast simulation(
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g003" href="#pone.0212485.g003">Fig 3</a>). Compared with the unfished scenario, on average, the alfonsino biomass and abundance was reduced by 32% and 20% respectively. For orange roughy this reduction was around 15% for the total biomass and 4% for the abundance. The general effect of the industrial fishery is reflected in a few functional groups (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g005" href="#pone.0212485.g005">Fig 5</a>) with a positive effect on the biomass of mesopelagic fishes (almost 5%), squids (2%) and Fur seals (1%).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bycatch in the industrial fleet is mainly composed of sharks, corals and other crustaceans (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g006" href="#pone.0212485.g006">Fig 6C</a>). This contributes to the predicted reduction of the biomass of sharks (of around 9%) and coral (around 2%; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g005" href="#pone.0212485.g005">Fig 5a</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the alfonsino fishery, shark catches reached an average 79.8 (+/-61) tonnes per year, which corresponds on average to 3.6% of the annual volume of alfonsino catches, corals make up 0.6% with an average of 14 (+/-10.7) tonnes and other crustaceans reached 0.74 (0.8) tonnes on average which make up 0.03% of the volume of catches of alfonsino (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g006" href="#pone.0212485.g006">Fig 6C</a>). For the orange roughy fishery, the coral bycatch reaches 193 (+/-85) tonnes per year, equivalent to 12.73% of the annual catches of this fishery. In the case of sharks these are equivalent to 3.95% of the orange roughy catches, with an annual average of 60.28 (+/-26.6) tonnes, and other crustaceans make up the equivalent of 0.46% of the annual orange roughy catches with an annual average of 8.43 (+/-8.9) tonnes of bycatch(
