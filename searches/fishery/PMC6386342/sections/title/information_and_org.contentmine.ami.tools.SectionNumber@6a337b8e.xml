 <div class="title">Information and model components that are needed for a future update or to use the model with data assimilation.</div>
 <p>These components are divided by: 
  <span class="bold">Priority</span>, that means how urgent they are; 
  <span class="bold">Type</span>, which include new model components to configure in the Atlantis framework (socio-economic components) and data which can be composed of single data or time series; 
  <span class="bold">Periodicity</span>, correspond the ideal maximum time lag needed for the information; and 
  <span class="bold">Spatial</span> if the information that is needed should be at the spatial level. Note that information at the level of the species should primary include key species from the ecosystem such as Spiny lobster, J.F. morwong, sea urchins.
