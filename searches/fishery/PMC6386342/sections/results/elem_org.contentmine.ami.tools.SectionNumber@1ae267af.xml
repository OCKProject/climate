  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The JFRE Atlantis model had a spin-up period of 31 years, where all the functional groups reached a dynamic stability. This spin-up duration was based on the time that the orange roughy population required to reach a stable size structure and a stable dynamic state. On average, the other functional groups required 10 years (+/-3) to reach this state. The JFRE Atlantis model (hindcast mode) covered the period from 1950 to 2011 to match the time span of the oceanographic model. During this period, most of the functional groups remained within the limits of established dynamic variation (+/-50% of the initial biomass). The model reproduced a marked intra-annual biomass variability coupled with inter-annual variations (more details in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212485.s020" href="#pone.0212485.s020">S12 Fig</a>). The model skill assessment for all the functional groups, using all available information shows a strong and significant similarity between the simulated and observed time series of catches and abundances (

   <a rid="pone.0212485.t004" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0212485.t004">Table 4</a>). In addition, all the analyzed time series had model efficiency coefficient values close to 1, which implies a high symmetry and match between predictions and observations (

The overall effect of artisanal fishing, with the exception of golden crab and spiny lobster, is reflected discreetly in a few functional groups: a decrease of 4% in the abundance of octopus; less than 3% drop for yellowtail amberjack; less than 1% decrease for other crustaceans (

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of this scenario of increased fishing mortality in finfish fisheries are only reflected in a few functional groups. Octopus biomass declined by 7% and J.F. morwong declined by 18% (representing an 14% reduction in abundance). In addition, there was a small observed increase in the abundance and biomass of moray eels (around 2%). Catches increased around 20% for finfish and 95% for Octopus compared to the BAU projection. For the moray eels there is a reduction of 3% and there are almost no changes for spiny lobster and golden crab catches when compared to a BAU projection.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite a complete closure of the industrial fisheries in these projections, there was an 8% change in biomass (6% in abundance) for orange roughy and an increase of 2% for squid (
