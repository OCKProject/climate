  <div class="title">Relative change in catch for the last 20 years of projection for 50% increase in fishing effort of crustaceans (ICRUS50%), a 50% increase in fishing effort for crustaceans and finfish (IBoth50%) and 100% increase in fishing effort for finfish (IFish100%).</div>
  <p>The catches from a business as usual scenario is the base case for comparisons. Note that the y-axes is the ratio of change against the starting conditionsâ€”so a -0.5 result indicates a 50% decrease and a 0.5 result indicates a 50% increase -.</p>
