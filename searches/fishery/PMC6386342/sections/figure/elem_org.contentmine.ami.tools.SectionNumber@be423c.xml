  <p>Relative change in biomass (A) and abundance (B) for the business as usual (BAU), a 50% increase in fishing effort of crustaceans (ICRUS50%), 50% increase in fishing effort for crustaceans and finfish (IBoth50%) and 100% increase in fishing effort for finfish (IFish100%). An unfished ecosystem is the base case for comparisons. Note that the y-axes is the ratio of change against the starting conditionsâ€”so a -0.5 result indicates a 50% decrease and a 0.5 result indicates a 50% increase -.</p>
