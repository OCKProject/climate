This ecosystem has unique biological and oceanographic features, characterized by: small geographical units, high degree of endemism with a high degree of connectivity within the system. Two fleets have historically operated in this system: a long term coastal artisanal fishery associated with the Islands, focused mainly on lobster, and a mainland based industrial demersal finfish fishery operating on the seamounts which is currently considered overexploited. The management of these fisheries has been based on a classical single-species approach to determine output controls (industrial fleet) and a mixed management system with formal and informal components (artisanal fleet). There has been growing interest in increasing the exploitation of fisheries, and modernization of the fishing fleet already operating in the JFRE. Under this scenario of increased levels of fishing exploitation and the high level of interrelation of species it might be necessary to understand the impact of these fisheries from a holistic perspective based on a ecosystem-based modeling approach. To address these challenges we developed an Atlantis end-to-end model was configured for this ecosystem. The implemented model has a high degree of skill in representing the observed trends and fluctuations of the JFRE. The model shows that the industrial fishing has a localized impact and the artisanal fisheries have a relatively low impact on the ecosystem, mainly via the lobster fishery. The model indicates that the depletion of large sized lobster has leads to an increase in the population of sea urchins. Although this increase is not sufficient, as yet, to cause substantial flow-on effects to other groups, caution is advised in case extra pressure leads the ecosystem towards a regime shift.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania.

One of the oldest known use of the oceans, fishing, can generate major disruptions in ecosystems such as decline of fish population abundance [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], changes in the physical structure of the environment [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], reduction of megafauna and top predators by bycatch [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and changes in the nutrient flow by discarding [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The likelihood and rate of recovery of an ecosystem to these disturbances (short-term or chronic) define its vulnerability [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which can be related to both structural (physical structure such as coral on submerged edges and seamounts) and/or biological (e.g. maturation of fish at old ages) aspects of ecosystems. A vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) is one that is easily disturbed but with a slow propensity to recover [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Seamounts are typical examples of VME, due to features such as small spatial extent, ecological complexity, hosting of vulnerable and endemic species (i.e. deep-sea coral; [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). However, the topographical and biophysical characteristics of these ecosystems suggest they can be more productive compared with the oceans that surround them [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Also, these seamounts have a great biodiversity of organisms: such as deep-sea corals, invertebrates, and fishes, many of them endemic [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, some of these species have great economic value, which has led to the development of lucrative fisheries surpassing more than 2 million tonnes of catch globally from these ecosystems since the 1960s [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, many of these fisheries have not been sustainable and are currently classified as either over-exploited or depleted [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Seamounts can be classified as deep or shallow based on whether they approach surface waters. The type of fishing gear needed to fish a seamount is also typically influenced by its depth and distance from shore:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Deep sea seamounts: Do not extend above 100 m sub-surface and are normally remote. Require more sophisticated ocean-going vessels to reach these seamounts and gears such as deep sea long lines or trawls are needed to fish them.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Shallow seamounts: These are seamounts that reach to waters less than 100m sub-surface or break the surface to form islands (some of these are of sufficient size to support human settlements). These seamounts tend to have coastal fringes (typically with steep shelf profiles) and can support less sophisticated fishing activities with simpler vessels and fishing gears, such as shallow trawling.</p></list-item></list><p specific-use="continuation">The impact of fishing on VMEs has widely studied in the past [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and has emphasized the negative impact generated by industrial trawl fisheries on such ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which can be in stark contrast to the low impact of some artisanal fisheries on these ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The impact of any fishery on VMEs can be divided into direct and indirect effects [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The direct effects of fishing include mortality on target and non-target species (bycatch) and the physical impacts caused by the gear on benthic organisms and on the seabed [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In its most negative aspects, these direct effects can lead to over-fishing, loss of biodiversity, degradation of suitable habitat [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and fisheries-induced evolution [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The indirect effects of fisheries on ecosystems occur in several ways, which depend on the type of fishery and its operation [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This type of effect includes: i) impacts mediated by biological interactions between species in the ecosystem (e.g. competition and predation); ii) effect of discarding and offal on the contribution of nutrients to the ecosystem; and iii) the effect of ghost fishing (discarded, lost, or abandoned, fishing gear in the marine environment that continues to fish and trap animals) [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These 3 pathways fully influence the complex interaction networks of the ecosystems. Indeed, these modifications may have a cascade of second or third order effects and can reshape ecosystem structure, function and biodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, fishing can generate a change in the local species composition, which modifies the available habitat that in turn affects the species that use that habitat and consequently their predators [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The assessment of ecosystem effects of fishing (direct and indirect) is a difficult task, especially when there are multiple fisheries -artisanal and industrial- active around the one ecosystem. Determining the best management strategies in such a situation is quite challenging. Consequently, improved understanding of the relative effects from different forms of fishing is necessary for effective fisheries management and biodiversity conservation. Such knowledge is crucial for VMEs, given the uncertainties about their resilience [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The Juan Fern&#x000e1;ndez Ridge Ecosystem (JFRE) meets all the criteria to be classified as a VME [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. JFRE is an aseismic chain of seamounts and islands located off the coast of central Chile between 32.81&#x000b0; and 33.81&#x000b0;S, with a total length of approximately 800 km [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

However, due to the vulnerability of the JFRE, the high level of interrelation of species and the potential for increased exploitation with modernization or new sectors, the following question arises: What is the effect of the existing fisheries on the functioning and structure of the JFRE?; and What would be the effect of increased fishing on the ecosystem?</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Evaluating ecosystem effects of fishing</title><sec id="sec004"><title>End-to-end models</title><p>To address this question, a holistic and integrated perspective is needed. One approach is to integrate the management and assessment of fisheries under an ecosystem&#x02019;s framework. In the last decade, mainly due to technological advances, new approaches and tools have been developed to explicitly consider the entire exploited marine ecosystem [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

However, in this case it was judged insufficient given the spatial and temporal processes that structure the functioning of the ecosystem surrounding the JFRE (e.g. the effect of the eddies on the productivity, larval connectivity). End-to-end models attempt to incorporate all the physical and ecological components of the ecosystem (including the human components), integrating them at different spatial and temporal scales [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

All these attributes make Atlantis well suited to explore and understand the impact of fishing activity on the vulnerable JFRE.

Furthermore, the model has a horizontal stratification which can incorporate vertical migration or depth-based variation in physical and biological components.

The division into polygons for the JFRE model was based on the main hydrodynamic, biological and fishery management components of the area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Parsing followed four main criteria: i) vertical and horizontal spatial distribution of the species and functional groups; ii) spatial distribution of nutrients, chlorophyll, or phytoplankton, based on model and bibliographic information; iii) spatial distribution of fishing fleets that currently or previously operated in the JFRE (artisanal and industrial); and iv) management areas, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), marine parks and exclusive artisanal fishery areas. Each of these polygons can have up to eight depth strata, with divisions at 20, 50, 150, 250, 400, 650, 1000 and 4300 m.

Assessing the degree of impact of these fisheries on the ecosystem is vital as a source of information for fisheries management. It provides an indication of the need for management measures aimed at ensuring the sustainability of resources and the ecosystem [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. To face this challenge, an ecosystem model for JFRE was implemented using the Atlantis ecosystem framework. The implemented model can efficiently represent the responses and fluctuations of the ecosystem. It shows a high degree of synchronization between the observed and estimated catch and abundance, reproducing the main temporal trends and variations. Thus, under the current configuration and calibration, this model efficiently represents the JFRE biological and harvesting dynamics, which makes it a good tool to address questions about the ecosystem status, and dynamics.</p><sec id="sec028"><title>Trophic interactions</title><p>The functioning of JFRE, like other seamount ecosystems, is highly dependent on local primary production [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The major component of the food web is centered on phytoplankton, zooplankton and mesopelagic fishes, similar in structure to other deep-sea ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In addition, there is a difference in the trophic structure between species that inhabit different depths. This apparent change in diet is mainly determined by the type of prey accessed by functional groups living at different depths in seamounts [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, deep water species such as orange roughy have a diet different from those associated to shallower waters such as Juan Fern&#x000e1;ndez morwong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Moreover, it is likely that the same functional group will have differences in their diets depending on the depth of the seamount they inhabit [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], this is something that was not analyzed in detail in this model due to a lack of sufficient observational data. Such an analysis would however be useful as part of future work so as to increase understanding of how the potential existence of alternative trophic pathways may (or may not) influence the outcome of development and management scenarios in the modelled area.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Artisanal fisheries</title><p>In the model, the lobster fishery has a strong impact on the spiny lobster population, reducing the biomass by 80%. Even with this large removal, only 50% of the abundance is extracted from the ecosystem. Two mechanisms can explain or contribute to this outcome:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The fishery is removing only the largest lobsters, leaving the smallest and most numerous ages in the ecosystem which can be observed in the age class size distribution [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is an increase in survival of smaller lobster due to the reduction of intraspecific competition for shelter [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] or more available food due to the removal of large-sized lobsters.</p></list-item></list><p>Even though there is a strong total biomass reduction in the spiny lobster stock, this fishery does not show any sign of collapsing in the future. An important factor in explaining the sustainability of the fishery is the minimum legal size of lobster extraction [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], which is supported by this analysis. The minimum landing size of the fishery is 115 mm which is much higher than the average size of first maturity of 81.1 mm [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In this species, the average growth increment per year can vary between 3 to 6 mm [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] which allows the population to have between 5 to 11 reproductive events between first maturity and recruitment to the harvestable component of the population [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].</p><sec id="sec030"><title>Ecosystem</title><p>Aside from the sharp decline in lobster biomass, the artisanal fishery has an small overall impact on the ecosystem. One reason for this is because, beyond the direct removal of the lobsters, the amount of biomass removed as bycatch or bait by the fishery is very small compared to the total estimated available biomass for the potentially affected functional groups.</p><p>In terms of predation, the decrease in lobster biomass did not have a strong impact on the ecosystem. The spiny lobster is an opportunist and generalist group with a wide spectrum of prey [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], this means that the impact on the prey was not centered only on one item type, which means that the effect of a reduction in lobster biomass is dampened by dispersion over many groups. Species such as sea urchins and molluscs are the most influenced by the abundance and biomass decrease of lobsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In terms of how a decline in spiny lobster biomass influences its predators, the model again suggests it does not have a major impact. According to the simulations this is because the lobster does not represent the main item of any species, and most of its predators are species that can feed on other functional groups. The species that feed on lobster (e.g., large benthic fish, moray eels, octopus and sharks) can focus their effort on capturing other functional groups that are more available when the abundance of lobster is low.</p><p>Given the strong depletion of the large sized spiny lobster due to fishing, a more marked growth of the populations of urchin was expected. The adult lobster has been reported as a key species controlling the abundance of sea urchin populations elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Empirical observations in other systems indicates that top-down control of sea urchins by spiny lobster stops the overgrazing effect of the urchins on macroalgae. This mechanism decreases the probability of the creation of barrens of sea urchins avoiding extreme changes in the structure of the ecosystem [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Within the modelled system, although there is an increase in the biomass of sea urchins (3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g006">Fig 6</xref>), it is more moderate than expected, based on observations from other ecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In JFRE, unlike other ecosystems, moray eels are also one of the main predators of sea urchin, controlling its abundance. Therefore, in the absence of spiny lobster that trophic role is being carried out by the moray eels and may be an ecosystem stabilizer (more details <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212485.s021">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212485.s022">S14</xref> Figs). The strength of this relationship remains to be verified in the real system, but if it is the case, then a greater decrease in eel abundance and biomass could result in major ecosystem change due to increased sea urchin populations and overgrazing of the macro-algal habitat as seen elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].</p><p>Another direct means in which fisheries can influence the JFRE is via the bait fishery. There is a two stage bait fishery associated with the capture of crustacean (lobster and golden crab) [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In the first stage capturing pelagic species that are used to catch larger species, which are later used as baits in the crab and lobster fisheries. In the model, this bait fishery is mainly associated with 4 functional groups: i) Large pelagic fishes, and which make up the first-order baits; ii) J.F. morwong; iii) the moray eels; and vi) yellowtail amberjack. These last three make up the baits used in the traps.</p><p>Despite the non-trivial levels of catches in the bait-fishery, the model does not report a depletion of the biomass in these functional groups due to the high total biomass levels for these groups. This means that the total bait catch levels are a small proportion of the total biomass for each of these abundant functional groups. The J.F. morwong is the only functional group that shows a biomass reduction, which is mainly explained by: 1) lower overall biomass in comparison to the other functional groups (partly because it is a single species whereas the other groups are composites of several species); 2) the depletion effect corresponds to the cumulative effect of both the bait fishery and the small direct fishery for J.F morwong.</p><p>In the case of the moray eel, the stability in the biomass masks a change in abundance. The model indicates that there are fewer but larger eels (i.e. less abundance but a slight increase in biomass). This increase in the biomass of moray eels likely results from the combined effect of:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>An increase in prey biomass, due to the reduction of the predation effect of lobster there is an increase in the availability of several prey that are also part of the diet of moray eels (i.e. sea urchin, other crustaceans and mollusc). This increase in prey results in a larger food supply and therefore an increase in individual body mass, generating larger moray eels.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduction in intraspecific competition. The slight reduction in the moray eels abundance due to the bait fishery, reduces the intraspecific competition for food, increasing the effective availability of prey for moray eels.</p></list-item></list><p>The baits used for the spiny lobster and golden crab fisheries are composed of species of high trophic level (e.g. large pelagic fishes and yellowtail amberjack) that generally would not be part of the diet of these species or at least not in those quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g005">Fig 5</xref>; [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]). This change in diet may have a seasonal impact increasing the trophic level of these functional groups, but under the current configuration of the model this is not being analyzed. This change in diet (i.e. amount and type of nutrients) would influence the survival and growth of lobster, most likely via a food subsidy [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] but also with higher energy content prey becoming more available.</p><p>The small overall footprint of the bait fishery also masks spatio-temporal heterogeneity. The high level of spatial aggregation of fishing effort in a small area means there is still significant potential for a larger effect in that area [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. This is not implicitly represented in the model given its current configuration (uniform fishing mortality) and is something that should be added in future updates.</p><p>Other ways in which fisheries may potentially affect the JFRE is via bycatch. The levels of bycatch reported by the model are similar to those previously estimated for the artisanal fisheries of the archipelago [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. While both the modelled crustacean fisheries have similar fishing gear (traps), there is a marked difference in the total amount of bycatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This difference is mainly due to the bathymetric distribution of the species. The lobster fishery operates from 3 to 200 meters [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] and the golden crab fishery from approximately 300 to 600 meters [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This marked bathymetric division is reflected in the bycatch composition of each fishery, which is characterized by species associated with the respective bathymetric ranges [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly in both cases the amount of bycatch is not sufficient to cause significant or widespread effects; the bycatch of the artisanal fleet in the JFRE appears to affect very few functional groups and does not have an important overall impact on the ecosystem at its current levels.</p><p>We should, however, be cautious about this model-based bycatch finding. This is especially relevant for coral bycatch, which is composed of coral species that can live for hundreds of years and whose growth is extremely slow [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The representation of these groups in the model was fairly rudimentary and is unlikely to have captured the true delays involved in this slow growth and maturity. In addition, the model does not differentiate between the two types of coral (deep and shallow), which could further mask the ecological effect of this removal. A more detailed analysis of this effect needs to model both corals separately. Therefore, the removal of corals could have a larger and longer term impact than what is reported by the model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Industrial fisheries</title><sec id="sec032"><title>The fisheries</title><p>The two functional groups (i.e. orange roughy and alfonsino) captured by the industrial fleet have different population responses to the effect of fishing. Alfonsino showed a decrease in biomass and total abundance, whereas for orange roughy the total catch was just a small part of the total biomass of the population. In 2006, the orange roughy fishery was closed, arguing a population depletion based on the sharp fall in catches [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The model results suggest, that this reduction in catches is likely to be related to other factors affecting resource availability and not directly due to low biomass levels. What is observed in the model has been reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and several hypotheses (apart from overfishing) have been proposed to explain low availability of orange roughy:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Alteration of the reproductive behavior which leads to transitory problems in resources availability. The fishing effort on orange roughy was concentrated between May and August, but centered at spawning period (June-July) [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. This direct and continuous impact of fishing (during consecutive fishing seasons) on the reproductive stock may have generated a change in the reproductive behavior of the species, which is reflected in an apparent decrease in abundance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Strong inter-annual availability. It has been reported that orange roughy presents strong interannual variations in its recruitment (or spawning success) [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. This would generate strong interannual changes in the vulnerable biomass which would be reflected in a strong variation in catches. This hypothesis is not supported by the model, although interannual variation is observed in the recruitment, there are no strong variation in the biomass of older groups. However, caution needs to be shown since the reduced complexity of the larval processes and may underestimate true inter-annual variability.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Changes and reduction of the suitable habitat for orange roughy as a result of the impact of fishing gear used by the industrial fleet. This alteration of the orange roughy habitat could then induce changes in the spatial distribution of the species. The seamounts impacted by fishing became less productive and therefore are avoided by orange roughy [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. This process would leads to a localized stock depletion at scales below that being resolved in the model.</p></list-item></list><p>Although the model reports that the orange roughy resource is healthy and that the losses in the catches may have originated from other processes, without new information and the analysis of observations that are informative around the real world veracity of the alternative explanations, the hypothesis of overfishing must be maintained under the precautionary approach [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>In terms of stock recovery, even though both fisheries were closed for several years (2006 for orange roughy and 2012 for alfonsino) their estimated biomass and abundance has not fully recovered. The recovery of alfonsino has been faster than orange roughy, reaching almost 85% of the unfished biomass by the end of 2016. The model projections, indicate that a full recovery of the alfonsino biomass will be achieved after 12 years of fishery closure. These values are similar to those proposed by other modeling exercises in which the estimated recovery period was found to be 13 years post the fishery being closed [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In orange roughy, the recovery of biomass has been at a much slower rate compared to alfonsino. The model suggests that the fishery is not likely to recover before 44 years of closure reaching about 92% recovery. This estimate is similar to the result by other modeling approaches [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] where stability is observed around 90% of the spawning biomass with respect to the virgin biomass. This slow rate of recovery of orange roughy is due to its life history characteristics (slow growing and late maturing).</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>The ecosystem</title><p>The industrial fleet has an overall low impact on the ecosystem and it is highly localized and concentrated on a few species (functional groups). Beyond the direct impact on the target species, the reduction of the abundance of alfonsino and orange roughy saw an increase in the biomass of mesopelagic fish. This functional group is an important component of the diet of orange roughy, constituting almost 50% of their diet [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], and alfonsino&#x02014;where mesopelagic are the second most important prey item [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Therefore, a decrease in the abundance and biomass of these two species is rapidly reflected in mesopelagic fish biomass. In addition, this increase in biomass in the mesopelagic fishes has a direct effect on the biomass of fur seals which are the group&#x02019;s main predator [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. The model suggest that the exploitation of orange roughy and alfonsino has a positive effect on the recovery of the fur seal population. This means that there is the potential that as these fish stocks recover, there may be a negative impact on the fur seal populations. This outcome may result in either: 1) prey switching by the fur seals and potentially increased interactions with other fisheries; or 2) a decline in the population which may lead to conservation concerns or tourism impacts.</p><p>The main negative effect of the industrial fisheries on the ecosystem is on corals and shark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Even though the reduction of biomass due to bycatch is very small compared with their total biomass, the impact is highly localized. These bycatch species are sessile or with low mobility (benthic sharks) so the real effect of bycatch is below the scale of the model cells. Therefore, it would be difficult to capture in full detail the effects given the current geographical structure of the model. Due to the small spatial extent of the trawling footprint of these fisheries, the level of depletion and loss of species richness is highly localized and represents a small amount compared to the total biomass of these species [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. To more thoroughly evaluate this localized effect of industrial bycatch, it is necessary to reconfigure the spatial structure of the model. For example, the current polygons could be subdivided using the areas where the fishing effort was more intense [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] or use a telescoping spatial approach [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. A change like this in the spatial resolution of the model would have two important effects:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>It would help determine the extent of any habitat depletion and loss of species richness at the local level, especially in the areas highly impacted by fishing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It would facilitate an analysis of the magnitude of heterogeneity in ecosystem outcomes and the tracking of any localized shifts in bycatch levels and potential declines in affected species. For example, a local depletion of bycatch species, as the fishery develops and the richness and abundance of species decreases, could lead to a drop in the levels of bycatch [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Such a mechanism would be important to understand as lowering bycatch levels are often interpreted as the positive outcome of fishery management actions (which in some cases they are, but it is important to distinguish the true underlying cause before using the index as a performance measure).</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>Projections</title><p>The future (controlled) increase in fishing appears to be a viable option for all artisanal fisheries in this system, except for the lobster fishery where an increase is detrimental to the lobster population and its catches. For example, a 50% increase in fishing mortality for crustaceans over the current value sees the total removal of lobster dropping below the BAU scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g008">Fig 8</xref>). This reduction can be linked to:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The current depletion of the oldest age classes of the population. The current size structure of the population in based on ages below the minimum landing size. This means, that even when there is an increase in fishing mortality, the overall increase in catch will not be significant. This finding is not in conflict with real world observations, where the size structure of the catches are centered on the minimum landing size with few individuals in the larger sizes [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Actually, it has been proposed that this is a &#x0201c;recruitment fishery&#x0201d;, where the catches are based on what recruits to the minimum legal size of the fishery each year [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>The extra reduction in larger sizes results from the increase in fishing mortality which further diminishes the reproductive potential of the lobster. This reduction of reproductive potential will have a direct impact on the total population recruitment and therefore the future number of lobsters that will enter the fishery. This relationship between reproduction, biological recruitment and fisheries production has been previously demonstrated for other lobster species [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>].</p></list-item></list><p specific-use="continuation">While scenarios explicitly exploring spatial dynamics in the system were not considered here, based on the spatial dynamics of the JFRE artisanal fisheries [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], it is likely that an increase in fishing effort and decrease in catch will have negative effects on fisheries management. The historical tenure of discrete fishing spots for each boat (owned by a fisher or family) has been part of the traditional management system and has been identified as the main controller of fishing effort [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Therefore, if the fishing effort is increased (more boats or more fishing capacity), the need for increased fishing grounds will increase the probability of spatial overlap of the territorial footprint of different fisher&#x02019;s fishing areas. This increase in the probability of overlapping fishing sites increases the risk of conflict, which could endanger the traditional cooperative management of this fishery. Considering all of the above, increasing the fishing effort in spiny lobster, does not seem the most appropriate approach, especially as it leads to:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>a reduction in overall catch compared to the BAU scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g008">Fig 8</xref>) and, given the increased effort assumed by the scenario, the reduced catch results in lower CPUE resulting in lower financial returns to the fisher and impacts on the local economy and community;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a potential increase in the risk of conflict between fishers, due to the spatial structure of the fishing fleet and the traditional spatial ownership of fishing areas;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a significant increase in the amount of bait used which is ultimately lost as waste or as food for other organisms (e.g., smaller lobsters, fish, other crustaceans)&#x02014;as there is fewer crustaceans to catch even with the higher bait use&#x02014;and therefore it would be better to use the fish in a more appropriate way (e.g. sell them at the market).</p></list-item></list><p>In the case of the golden crab fishery, this increase in fishing mortality enhances the catches and does not have a very strong impact on the biomass of this group. This means that the stock and the ecosystem could potentially support an increase in fishing mortality of golden crab with minimal apparent risk of having a major impact. Other assessments of this resource estimate that it is an underdeveloped fishery and there have been suggestions of further development of the fishery, as an alternative to the lobster fishery [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>In the modelled artisanal finfish fishery, despite a 100% increase in the current fishing mortality rate the total reduction of biomass and the catches are lower than the increase of 50% fishing mortality for the crustacean fishery (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212485.g008">8</xref>). This is because the main source of fishing mortality for finfish is associated with the crustacean fishery&#x02019;s bait fishery [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Beyond the bait fishery other fishing pressure is minimal for finfish and therefore the total increase in fishing mortality imposed on finfish by the crustacean&#x02019;s bait fishery is higher than the increment in the artisanal finfish fishery alone.</p><p>In terms of the impact of industrial fisheries, even though the fishery has been closed for several years, the biomass of orange roughy and coral are still below the unfished scenario at the end of the model run. This is because both functional groups continue to recover from the impact of fishing. This slow recovery was expected especially due to the slow growth of these functional groups, which makes it difficult to quickly return to levels of virgin biomass. Coral are species of very low resilience and ability to recover from this type of disturbance [<xref rid="pone.0212485.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0212485.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title>Future needs</title><p>JFRE is a remote vulnerable marine ecosystem far from the Chilean coast.

time series of different ecosystem components and other relevant indicators is also an important need. Having time series allows for an understanding of the temporal variations and trends of different aspects of the ecosystem (e.g., recruitment, abundance, temperature, nutrients, pH). The availability of time series in JFRE are scarce and only consist of some specific efforts related to specific fished resource species (i.e. Spiny lobster, golden crab) or several endanger species (e.g. Pink-footed shearwaters, fur seals). Although these time series are essential, it is necessary to reinforce them with others that describe other aspects of the ecosystem. Due to the human and institutional effort and the associated costs, these would likely need to be carried out on different time scales (months to years; <xref rid="pone.0212485.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The exact form of such an effort would depend on the dynamics of each variable, the source of the data and the costs of obtaining the data. For example, algal biomass can be obtained at fine spatial and temporal scales from satellite imagery but requires a cost of obtaining the imagery and processing the data. Similarly, water temperate data can be obtain from sensors. In contrast, ecological components such as urchin numbers or macroalgal cover require trained personnel (e.g. divers) to undertake transects on an annual basis (<xref rid="pone.0212485.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec036"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The JFRE Atlantis model has proven to be beneficial for describing the status of the JFRE commercial and artisanal fisheries. Also, providing insights into the impact on the ecosystem that would be expected to result from changes in fishing pressure (i.e. Artisanal fishery). Industrial fishing is located on the deep seamounts and restricted to larger trawler vessels based out of mainland Chile. Due to concerns about the level of depletion and the rate of recovery, these fisheries have been closed since 2006 for orange roughy and 2012 for alfonsino. This industrial fishing has a fairly localized impact on both target species and bycatch. In the case of alfonsino, it has an important direct effect with a high depletion of the biomass of this species. For the orange roughy stock, no significant depletion of the total biomass was observed. An explanation of this is that the observed drop in catches is due to other factors associated with availability such as alteration of reproductive behavior, reduction of available habitat or strong inter-annual variation of recruitment. Despite this low estimated reduction in total biomass, the recovery towards historical population sizes has been slow due to their life characteristics such as extremely slow growth. As for bycatch, both industrial fisheries present a high level of bycatch and this is associated with sessile or low mobility species such as coral and benthic sharks. Seamount fisheries are characterized by fine resolution intensive fishing activities. While the JFRE model provides valuable general insights, improvements in the spatial resolution of the model to focus on this particular feature would improve the precision of the estimates. Greater temporal detail would also be beneficial but this is difficult when the fishery is only operating for a short time. However, if it does reopen in some of the seamounts that are not protected, then the collection of monitoring data that can be used by the model to provide timely information on ecosystem effects should be considered.</p><p>Within the JFRE there is a long-term traditional coastal artisanal tightly-knit fishing community that mainly targets spiny lobsters, J.F. Morwong and recently golden crab. This artisanal fishing has a low impact on the ecosystem and is mainly concentrated in the crustaceans fishery. The lobster fishery represents the greatest artisanal fishing effort and has the greatest impact on the ecosystem. This fishery has generated a significant depletion of the large sized lobster stock with a substantial reduction in the total population biomass. Given the current state of the population, it is not advisable to increase fishing effort. An increase would have a negative effect on catches and financial returns from the fishery. In addition, this increase in fishing effort (irrespective of what it does to catches) may pose a significant problem for the traditional fisheries management of this fishery, breaking down socially enforced management structures. In terms of the ecosystem, the model indicates that a decrease in the abundance of large lobsters has generated an increase in the population of sea urchins. Although this increase does not yet seem to be sizeable, it is still advisable to be careful not to lead the ecosystem towards a regime shift. In addition, it was found that a moderate increase in the fishing effort focused on other species of finfish and crustaceans will not have a significant impact on the ecosystem. Moreover, this change could have a positive socio-economic impact as a result of productive diversification.</p><p>This ecosystem model can be used strategically for the management of the JFRE fisheries. Since this is the first ecosystem modeling approach for JFRE, it is advisable to perform some updates especially aimed at reducing uncertainty associated with the input information. Updating information on the trophic relationships among the key species that make up the ecosystem is most urgent. In addition, it is necessary to have time series (monitoring) of the abundance of these key species. While there are some aspects that can be improved, added or updated, this model provides a new and more comprehensive approach for analyzing the current and future status of the JFRE. The JFRE Atlantis model is a comprehensive tool that can provide insights, for example, about the sustainability of the ecosystem under different levels of fishing pressure under a climate change scenario, or to establish which are the main drivers of the ecosystem productivity. In other words, this model is a tool that can help the fisheries managers responsible of this vulnerable marine ecosystem understand its dynamics and its core interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec037"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212485.s001"><label>S1 Supplementary Information Text</label><caption><title>This file contains the text associated with the supplementary information.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0212485.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0212485.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Functional groups for the JFRE Atlantis model.</title><p>Each functional group has its identifier (<bold>Code</bold>).
