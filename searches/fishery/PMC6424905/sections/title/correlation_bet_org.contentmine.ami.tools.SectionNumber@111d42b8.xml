  <sub>3</sub>, PO
  <sub>4</sub>, and SiO
  <sub>3</sub>). Between 2011 and 2017 there was an association between HAB events and NO

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For simplification, we used nutrients as the target in the redundancy analysis, and found that there was temporal variation in the dominant phytoplankton species (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F8" href="#F8">Figure 8B</a>). Succession of algae tended to be driven by N and P content, and the two dominant species in earlier years, 
  <span class="italic">M. aeruginosa</span> and 
  <span class="italic">M. flos-aquae</span>, showed a preference for high levels of NH
  <sub>4</sub>. Two species prominent from 2001 to 2010, 
  <span class="italic">S. costatum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">G. flaccida</span>, were closely associated with SiO
  <sub>3</sub> and COD. Other dominant species, 
  <span class="italic">Trichodesmium</span> spp. and 
  <span class="italic">N. scintillans</span> showed association with high levels of NO
  <sub>3</sub> and PO
  <sub>4</sub>, and we found that DIN and PO
  <sub>4</sub> influenced 
  <span class="italic">P. globosa</span> abundance.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">VPA showed that when combined, ID, EF, and HA explained 65.7% of the variation in HAB outbreaks (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F9" href="#F9">Figure 9</a>), whereas independently, ID, EF, and HA explained 14.7% (

  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05), and 13.2% (
