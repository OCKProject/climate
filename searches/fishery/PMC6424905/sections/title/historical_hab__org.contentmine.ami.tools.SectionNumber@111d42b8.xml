 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were 39 algal bloom events from 1985 to 2017, 15.4% occurred during the period 1985–2000, 33.3% during 2001–2010, and 51.3% during 2011–2017 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figures 2A,B</a>). The maximum area of algal blooms increased from &gt;50 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in the 1990s to 250 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in the 2000s, and then HABs covered almost the entire coast between 2011 and 2017 (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Unfortunately, the area values between 2012 and 2017, when HABs became widespread, are not available. HAB duration was relatively short, occurring over days during the period 1985–2000; however, they typically occurred for weeks in the latter periods (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to 2000, HABs tended to occur at Beihai Port, Lianzhou Bay, and Weizhou Island; during the period 2001–2010, 70% of HABs occurred at Weizhou Island; and after 2011, HABs occurred at a greater number of sites, including along the coasts of Tieshan, Beihai, Qinzhou, Fangchenggang, and Weizhou Island (
