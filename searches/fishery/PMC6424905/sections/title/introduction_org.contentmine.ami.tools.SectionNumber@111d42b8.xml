 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phytoplankton are a fundamental component of the marine ecosystem, playing multiple roles in nutrient cycling, and supporting global biological and geochemical processes (Lindh et al., 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">2013</a>). However, excessive propagation of phytoplankton may cause an ecological phenomenon called harmful algal blooms (HABs). Some algal species that cause HABs produce toxins which lead to the human poisoning syndromes called paralytic shellfish poisoning, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, and ciguatera fish poisoning. In other cases, non-toxic, high-biomass HABs can kill fish and marine organisms through both physical and chemical mechanisms, and can also induce hypoxia or anoxia, killing marine life at multiple trophic levels (Heisler et al., 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">HABs have significantly increased throughout the world's coastal oceans over the last century mostly due to seawater eutrophication and climate change (Anderson et al., 
  <a rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1">2012</a>; Glibert et al., 
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">2018</a>). China is also challenged by eutrophication and recurrent, large, and diversified algal blooms including red tides, green tides, and brown tides in coastal waters (Yu and Liu, 
  <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">2016</a>; Yi et al., 
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">2018</a>). The most persistent and damaging HABs occur in the Bohai Sea, Changjiang River estuary, and the coastal waters of the South China Sea (Tang et al., 
  <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">2006</a>; Yu and Liu, 
  <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">2016</a>; Zhou et al., 
  <a rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88">2017</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The semi-enclosed body of water of the northern Beibu Gulf is in southwest China, northwest of the South China Sea. Algal blooms in the region are fairly new to scientists and the public, as it is often thought of as the last “clean ocean” and one of the most abundant fishing grounds in Chinese coastal waters (Chen et al., 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">2011</a>; Zhong, 
  <a rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87">2015</a>). It was thus a shock to the local government and even to HAB scientists when 
  <span class="italic">Phaeocystis globosa</span> blooms almost blocked the cooling waters used for a nuclear power station in Fangchenggang (Cao et al., 
  <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">2017</a>; Gong et al., 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">2018</a>), covered waters near the nuclear station, and broke out simultaneously across the whole coast of the northern Beibu Gulf (Kaiser et al., 
  <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">2013</a>; Lai et al., 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">2014</a>; Luo et al., 
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">2016</a>). Against this background, our study reviewed algal blooms from 1980s to 2017, and analyzed their frequency, duration, geographical distribution, and associated physicochemical parameters in the Beibu Gulf, and aimed to speculate on future trends in HABs occurrence to improve mitigation and management of future HABs in the region.
