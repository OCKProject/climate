 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Algal blooms in the northern Beibu Gulf have intensified over the past three decades, likely as a result of anthropogenic influences. Continuing economic and industrial development, as well as a rising human population in the region, will lead to further increases in HAB events in the future. Thus, HAB mitigation strategies should include: (1) an increase in the number of buoys and automatic monitoring stations along the northern Beibu Gulf coast; (2) the development of satellite remote sensing, 
  <span class="italic">in situ</span> cell observations, and computer modeling to predict bloom events; (3) reductions in nutrient discharge and/or improved management for N/P removal; and, (4) the creation of a science-based ecological management plan to perform the ecophysiological and toxicological characterization of regional algal bloom species. There should be government-level efforts to enrich database records of HAB events and analyze the key environmental drivers of HABs to improve the sustainable development of this region.
