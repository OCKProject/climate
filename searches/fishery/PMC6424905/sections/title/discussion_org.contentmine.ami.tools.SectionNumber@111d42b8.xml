 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to many coastal regions globally, HABs in the northern Beibu Gulf have significantly increased in frequency, duration, geographical distribution, and degree of harm in recent decades (Anderson et al., 
  <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2002</a>; Heisler et al., 
  <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">2008</a>). However, compared with already developed Chinese coastal areas such as the Bohai estuary and Changjiang River Estuary, there was an ~ 10–15 year lag for the remarkable breakout of HABs in the northern Beibu Gulf (Luo et al., 
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">2016</a>; Yu and Liu, 
  <a rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83">2016</a>; Song et al., 
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">2018</a>). Most anthropogenic activities surveyed in this study increased substantially by the late 1990s, when HAB frequency started to increase exponentially. It is thus likely anthropogenic activities play crucial roles in the occurrence of HABs in the region. Similar increases in HAB frequencies linked to anthropogenic activities, population, and industrial development were reported as early as 1976–1986 in Tolo Harbor, Hong Kong and 1965–1976 in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan (Lam and Ho, 
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">1989</a>; Okaichi, 
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">1989</a>). We thus speculate that the trend in HAB events in the northern Beibu Gulf is extremely likely to follow HAB patterns in already polluted coastal waters and will therefore further intensify if HAB mitigation and management strategies are not carried out in the near future.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the locations, Weizhou Island was the algal blooms hot spot prior to 2010, but blooms occurrences near the island subsequently declined while blooms increased in nearshore waters along the entire Beibu Gulf coast. The volcanic Weizhou Island is a natural source of trace metals such as iron and manganese, and nutrients N and P (Li and Lai, 
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">2007</a>), and the southwest monsoon in the Indian Ocean, which brings high temperatures and strong rainfall to the region, washes terrestrial nutrients into the nearshore waters, which fuels algal blooms. Nutrient-rich seawater passes through the Qiongzhou Strait in the northern Beibu Gulf all year round and elicited a stronger effect on HABs at Weizhou Island than in the bays of Beihai, Qinzhou, and Fangcheng, because summer seawater upwelling delivers abundant nutrients to the sea surface near the island (Yang et al., 
  <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">2006</a>; Shi, 
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">2014</a>). Most HABs occur at the southern part of Weizhou Island which is the main location for industrial and mariculture activities, and has a dense population that has polluted the coastline (Qiu et al., 
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">2005</a>; He et al., 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">2013</a>; Li et al., 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">2014a</a>; Dou et al., 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">2015</a>). Finally, the nutrient structure in Weizhou Island has changed from N limitation (N:P = 4.1) in the beginning of the 1990s (Wei et al., 
  <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">2005</a>) to P limitation (N:P = 38.1) in the late 2000s (Sun et al., 
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">2010</a>; He et al., 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">2013</a>), which may partly explain the decline in HABs after the 2000s.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were also changes in the ratios of Si:N:P in the northern Beibu Gulf over the study period, the N:P ratio increased from 2.9 to 6.5 in the 1980s to 24.8 to 202.6 in the 1990s in Qinzhou Bay (Wei et al., 
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">2002a</a>), similar trends have been recorded in Tieshan Bay and Lianzhou Bay (Wei et al., 
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">2002b</a>; Lan et al., 
  <a rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28">2014</a>; Yang et al., 
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">2015</a>). These shifts from N limitation to N abundance, with relative sufficiency of Si, and P limitation (Wu, 
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">2014</a>; Wang F. et al., 
  <a rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66">2015</a>; Yang et al., 
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">2015</a>) are likely to have changed algal species composition in marine ecosystems (Glibert, 
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">2017</a>). This may explain the recent dominance of 
  <span class="italic">Phaeocystis</span> blooms in the region, in accordance with the substantial N requirements of 
  <span class="italic">P. globosa</span> to support its proliferation and sustained blooms (Xu et al., 
  <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">2003</a>; Zheng, 
  <a rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86">2014</a>; Gong et al., 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">2018</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temporal shifts in dominant HAB species driven by nutrient conditions have been widely seen in Chinese waters. Changjiang River estuary, the most notable HAB area in China, has experienced an obvious change of dominant blooming microalgae from diatoms to noxious or toxic dinoflagellates in the last 30 years (Yang et al., 
  <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">2015</a>; Yu et al., 
  <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">2017</a>). This shift was thought to be largely driven by the increasing ratio of DIN:P and high DIN, which increased 4-fold from 20.5 μM in the 1960s to 80.0 μM in the 2000s (Ye et al., 
  <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">2004</a>; Wang and Cao, 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">2012</a>; Yu et al., 
  <a rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84">2017</a>). During 2009–2016, the proportion of dinoflagellate blooms has also risen to as high as 79% on the south China coast, induced by changes in seawater temperature, DIN, and P concentration (Yi et al., 
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">2018</a>). Changes in phytoplankton communities may also relate to climate change (Hallegraeff, 
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">2010</a>; Wells and Karlson, 
  <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">2018</a>), which needs to be investigated in the future for the northern Beibu Gulf.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The haptophyte 
  <span class="italic">Phaeocystis</span> forms massive HABs in many parts of the world, from tropical and subtropical to Arctic and Antarctic oceans (Long et al., 
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">2007</a>; Smith et al., 
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">2017</a>). This bloom is recognized both as a nuisance and as an ecologically important phytoplankton, with production of haemolytic substances in relation to the risk of marine life and human health, as well as dimethylsulfide (DMS) involved in the biological regulation of the climate (Medlin and Zingone, 
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">2007</a>; Wang S. et al., 
  <a rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68">2015</a>). So far, six 
  <span class="italic">Phaeocystis</span> species have been clearly defined, and only three of them, 
  <span class="italic">P. globosa, P. pouchetii</span>, and 
  <span class="italic">P. antarctica</span>, were described to date as bloom forming species (Schoemann et al., 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">2005</a>; Medlin and Zingone, 
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">2007</a>). However, in Chinese seawaters 
  <span class="italic">P. globosa</span> is the only bloom causing organism within this genus to date, with its blooms first documented from Oct 1997-Feb 1998 in southeast China, covering thousands of km
  <span class="sup">2</span> in the coastal waters of Fujian and Guangdong (Chen et al., 
  <a rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9">1999</a>; Qi et al., 
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">2002</a>). It then frequently appeared in southern coastal areas (Hainan, Hong Kong, and Guangdong), and Bohai and Yellow River estuaries from 2000 to 2009 (Qi et al., 
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">2002</a>; Li et al., 
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">2012</a>). Blooms of 
  <span class="italic">P. globosa</span> started to occur from 2011 in the northern Beibu Gulf and have continued breaking out in recent years (
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Phaeocystis</span> has a complex polymorphic life cycle alternating between flagellated cells and colonies enclosed in an exopolysaccharide matrix (Rousseau et al., 
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">2013</a>), protecting it from predators, enhanced UVB, and viral and bacterial infections (Brussaard et al., 
  <a rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7">2005</a>; Kennedy et al., 
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">2012</a>). Interestingly, 
  <span class="italic">Phaeocystis</span> develops blooms in the colonial form, particularly in waters with abundant nitrates, phosphate, and urea (Schoemann et al., 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">2005</a>; Wang et al., 
  <a rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69">2007</a>; Liang et al., 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">2018</a>). In addition to the advantages of colony morphology, another competitive advantage of 
  <span class="italic">P. globosa</span> in the northern Beibu Gulf may be its environmental adaptations, such as high tolerance of varied environmental light, preference for high temperatures and flexible nutrient uptake strategy (Schoemann et al., 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">2005</a>; Xu et al., 
  <a rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77">2017</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both abiotic and biotic factors affect the formation and duration of HAB events (Smith et al., 
  <a rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55">1999</a>; Lewitus et al., 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">2012</a>; Smetacek, 
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">2012</a>; Smida et al., 
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">2012</a>). In this study, about 65.7% of HAB variation was explained by human activity factors, environmental factors, and industrial development, indicating that these parameters are dominant determinants of HAB formation. Our findings support the previous viewpoint that abiotic factors are the main drivers affecting algal bloom formation and community structure (Worden et al., 
  <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">2015</a>). On the other hand, we note that 34.3% of HAB variation was not explained by the data measured, which indicates that other abiotic (water chemistry and hydrodynamics) and/or biotic (algal species interactions, viral lysis, reactive oxygen species abundance, and fungal and zooplankton predation) factors that were not included in this analysis may be important drivers of HAB events (Sun et al., 
  <a rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61">2017</a>; Karasiewicz et al., 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">2018</a>; Zhang et al., 
  <a rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85">2018</a>). Further investigation of the interactions among algae, bacteria, viruses, and ciliates, particularly their network relationship over longer time scales, is needed to better characterize the underlying mechanisms driving the increases in HAB events and phytoplankton community variation in the northern Beibu Gulf.
