 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nanning, Qinzhou, Beihai, and Fangchenggang are the main districts in the Beibu Gulf Economic Zone. During the period 1980s−2015, across the districts there were 3.2–68.0, 98.1–22,703.3, 113.4–868.0, and 15.2-20,733.3-fold increases in population, gross industrial output value, gross domestic product, and fertilizer, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figures 3A–D</a>). Nevertheless, these parameters were quite stable until the 1990s, when the substantial increases started. Although Nanning and Qinzhou generally reached much higher values than Beihai and Fangchenggang since the 2000s, all maximum fold increases were found in Fangchenggang due to its small initiating values in the 1980s.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seawater cultured area increased 33.6-fold from 1978 to 2006; artificially cultured products and seawater aquatic products increased by 2,607.9- and 21.7-fold, respectively, from 1978 to 2015 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figures 4A–C</a>), with these parameters exhibiting a significant increase after the 1990s. There was an associated 3.9-fold increase in marine related GDP from 2007 to 2016 across the region (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Figure 4D</a>). Shipping transport in the northern Beibu Gulf intensified, with increases in the number of fishing boats (from 500 in 2001 to 3,850 in 2010) and effluent (3.74-fold increase from 2001 to 2010) (
