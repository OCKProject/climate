 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used one-way ANOVA in SPSS (v. 13.0) (Chicago, Illinois, USA) to evaluate differences in environmental parameters during three time periods (1985–2000; 2001–2010; and 2011–2017) at the 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05 or 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.01 level. Correlations between HAB outbreaks and physicochemical factors based on euclidean distance were calculated using principal component analysis and visualized using R software (v2.15.1,

The relationship between the environmental factors, human activities, and HAB events from 1985 to 2017 was measured using multivariate correlation analysis (redundancy analysis), which was performed using the Canoco software package for Windows (v4.5) (Ithaca, New York, USA) with Monte Carlo permutation tests (499 permutations) (Terbraak and Smilauer,

  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">2011</a>). HAB-causing species and environmental parameters used in the redundancy analysis were normalized through a logarithmic transformation (log
  <sub>10</sub> (n+1)). We used variation partitioning analysis (VPA) to analyze the relative contribution of multiple parameters (industrial development, ID; environmental factors, EF; and human activities, HA) to HAB variation. The data came from

  <sub>2</sub> (x+1)) transformed for standardization. VPA was performed using the VEGAN package in R.
