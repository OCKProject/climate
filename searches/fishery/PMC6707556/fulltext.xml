Since anthropogenic causes are frequently reported, gastrointestinal obstruction is well documented for cases of ingestion of plastic bags or fishing nets [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Other causes, dietary in origin, are less frequently observed, and often are associated with diminished nutritional condition and underlying motility or ileus [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Gastrointestinal foreign bodies are commonly diagnosed in wild and captive marine turtles [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Wild turtles often swallow rocks, stones, coral and shells while foraging, and the presence of these objects alone, commonly seen upon radiographic evaluation, is not necessarily associated with disease [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It has been suggested that under certain poorly defined conditions, such as immunosuppression or altered motility of the gastrointestinal tract, these objects may contribute to complete or partial obstruction of the intestine [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It can also be difficult to determine if the presence of foreign material in sick turtles is a primary cause of illness or if other factors such as infection-related gastrointestinal stasis are present [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Health status of free-living sea turtle species are usually evaluated using the epidemiological data of turtles admitted to wildlife rehabilitation hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In a recent study on causes of stranding and mortality of loggerheads in Gran Canaria (1998&#x02013;2014), the most frequent causes of admission for 392 sub-adult specimens were ingestion of hooks and monofilament lines (36%), entanglement in fishing gear and/or plastics (33.4%), and unknown/undetermined (14.8%). The other primary causes (trauma, infectious disease, crude oil, other causes) had frequencies below 9% [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our results indicate that the incidence of mortality of sub-adult loggerheads due to ingestion of sea urchins is less than 1.6%. In addition, we detected 7 more cases of stranding possibly attributed to the ingestion of smaller amounts of sea urchins, although after the elimination of these remains of sea urchin tests and spines in the feces during the hospitalization period, the turtles were released.</p><p>Several authors suggested sea urchins as an increasing component in the loggerhead turtles diet, due to the lack of usual preys, which is a direct cause of overfishing [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since loggerheads are not high-speed predators, they usually have an opportunistic behavior [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The increase of sea urchins in some areas can also be explained by the reduction of their natural predators due to the overfishing and the rise of the average temperature of the coastal waters [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, overfishing can have a double consequence: it can cause an increase in the populations of sea urchins due to the reduction of their natural predators, and, on the other hand, it reduces the availability of usual sea turtle preys, inducing them to consumption of unusual preys such as sea urchins.</p><p>Regarding the pathogenesis, in cases where the large intestine is affected by impaction, death is primarily associated with absorption of bacterial toxins through the intestinal wall and subsequent toxemia, and water and electrolyte balance are not severely affected [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our study, fibrinonecrotic enteritis was only diagnosed in two turtles, and bacteremia caused by <italic>Vibrio</italic> sp. was detected only in one of them; however, no histological lesions were detected in the spleen from which <italic>Vibrio</italic> sp. was isolated. The latter together with the mild lesions observed in the remaining turtles and the general good body condition of all the turtles suggest that the disorder was acute.</p><p>Unfortunately, early diagnosis was not possible in the turtles stranded alive due to the death of the animals within the first hours. Diagnostic procedures, including contrast radiography, ultrasound, and celioscopy, can provide early diagnosis for intestinal impactions [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are less frequently used because are less available and more expensive techniques [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Medical therapy using white petrolatum and light mineral oil has been reported to manage an intestinal partial obstruction caused by rubber items in a loggerhead turtle [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Some sea urchin species are venomous, but no fatal interaction with sea turtles has been reported. The hollow primary spines of some diadematid sea urchins are suggested to contain bioactive substances, and the toxopneustid sea urchins have globiferous pedicellaria with pharmacologically-active substances [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. No studies about possible bioactive substances from <italic>Diadema africanum</italic> have been reported. However, the venom apparatus of the globiferous pedicellaria of the toxopneustid <italic>Sphaerechinus granularis</italic> has been described [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the case of the turtle with a mixture of sea urchin species, a possible toxic effect added to the effects of intestinal impaction can&#x02019;t be ruled out.</p><p><italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> has been associated with mass mortality of <italic>Diadema africanum</italic> in the Canary Islands [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our case, health status of the ingested sea urchins was not investigated. Bacteremia caused by <italic>Vibrio</italic> sp. was detected only in a turtle, in which focal fibrinonecrotic enteritis had been diagnosed. Although we can&#x02019;t rule out that the origin of the infection were the ingested sea urchins, <italic>Vibrio</italic> sp. is very frequent in the marine water and cloaca of apparently healthy sea turtles, being also able to enter to the blood vessels from the intestinal lesions [<xref rid="pone.0221730.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, although the prevalence of this cause of stranding was low compared to other mortality causes, continued overfishing and anthropogenic climate change could increase its incidence. In addition, intestinal impaction with large amounts of sea urchins should be included in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases in sea turtles, particularly in sub-adult specimens. Finally, the possible toxic effect of some species of sea urchins on sea turtles should be investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0221730.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Data of loggerhead sea turtles included in the survey.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0221730.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the staff of the Tafira Wildlife Rehabilitation Center (Cabildo Insular de Gran Canaria).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0221730.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Aguirre</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>G&#x000f3;mez</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Essential veterinary education in conservation medicine and ecosystem health: a global perspective</article-title>. <source>Rev Sci Tech</source>. <year>2009</year>;<volume>28</volume>: <fpage>597</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>603</lpage>. <?supplied-pmid 20128469?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20128469</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0221730.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Casale</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Marco</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title><italic>Caretta caretta</italic> North East Atlantic subpopulation</article-title>. <source>The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</source>
