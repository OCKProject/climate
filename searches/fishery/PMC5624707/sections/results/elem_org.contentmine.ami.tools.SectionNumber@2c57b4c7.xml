  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the period of April-June, skipjack CPUEs tended to be high and reached the peak in May (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g002" href="#pone.0185601.g002">Fig 2A</a>). Catch level in this month was about 170 fish/fishing set. The highest CPUEs occurred in areas of relatively high Chl-a and warmer SST ranging from 0.16 to 0.3 mg m
   <span class="sup">-3</span> (0.22±0.068 mg m
   <span class="sup">-3</span>) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g002" href="#pone.0185601.g002">Fig 2B</a>) and from 29.76 to 30.86°C (30.31±0.55°C) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g002" href="#pone.0185601.g002">Fig 2C</a>), respectively. At the same time, the greatest skipjack catches were obtained in waters of positive SSHA ranging from 3.04 cm to 7.96 cm (5.50 ± 2.46 cm) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g002" href="#pone.0185601.g002">Fig 2D</a>). During January-March, the catch rates (CPUEs) appeared to be lower than those of subsequent months. During that period, the fishing sets occupied the locations where surface temperature was relative high and Chl-a as well as SSHA fluctuated highly.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite based oceanographic data in relation to skipjack tuna fishing performance indicated the specific ranges where the fish were most abundant (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g003" href="#pone.0185601.g003">Fig 3</a>). Total CPUEs in relation to SST showed that most of the catches were concentrated in areas where SST ranged from 29.75 to 31.25°C using histogram graph (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g003" href="#pone.0185601.g003">Fig 3A</a>). The similar trend was found in the relationship between the frequency of fishing set and SST (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g003" href="#pone.0185601.g003">Fig 3D</a>). Both histograms revealed that the preferred SST tended to center at 30.5°C, which reflected the highest probability of finding fish in term of SST. Total skipjack CPUEs in relation to Chl-a indicated that skipjack CPUEs were mainly found in areas where the environmental variable occurred mainly from 0.15 to 0.35 mg m

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g003" href="#pone.0185601.g003">Fig 3B</a>). The relationship between skipjack fishing frequency and the surface Chl-a also showed a similar pattern (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g003" href="#pone.0185601.g003">Fig 3E</a>). The Chl-a preference for skipjack tuna mostly concentrated at 0.2 mg m

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is worth noting that Chl-a was the most important oceanographic variable to explain skipjack fishing performance. Specifically, we found that chlorophyll concentrations of about 0.2 mg m
   <span class="sup">-3</span> was a good proxy for describing the highest total skipjack CPUEs (~54%) and fishing frequency (~60%) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g003" href="#pone.0185601.g003">Fig 3</a>). Whilst, the value of SST 30.5°C was capable of exposing the catch rates of approximately 29% and frequency of the fishing set of about 35%. The optimum SSHA value of near 6 cm accounted for the skipjack CPUE and frequency of the fish occurrence were about 28% and 40%, respectively.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The associated highest catches with the Chl-a front formed every year during 2007–2011 (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g004" href="#pone.0185601.g004">Fig 4</a>). The chlorophyll front consistently occurred in a specific location within the study area. Thus, the potential habitat was constantly available for the fishery every year (2007–2011) based on the environmental indicator. For the SST variable, the dynamics and position of the optimum range varied widely both in longitude and latitude and sometimes disappeared over the Flores Sea for instance in May 2008 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185601.s001" href="#pone.0185601.s001">S1 Fig</a>). Likewise, from the SSHA images, the spatial position of the most suitable range was widely distributed (

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g006" href="#pone.0185601.g006">Fig 6</a>). However, it is important to note that a Chl-a of 0.2 mg m
   <span class="sup">-3</span> isopleth was a good indicator for detecting spatial distribution patterns of the pelagic hotspots for all years (Figs 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g004" href="#pone.0185601.g004">4</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g006" href="#pone.0185601.g006">6</a>). In 2007, the most suitable habitat strongly formed within the Gulf of Bone and was associated with the skipjack fishery distribution. The pelagic habitats were predicted to be in the eastern Bone Gulf and western Flores Sea in the subsequent year. We found that skipjack catches mainly concentrated in the hotspot area. In 2009, the predicted hotspots were mostly found in the western Flores Sea, whilst the skipjack tuna seemed to be captured in the hotspot areas of the northern Bone Gulf. Then, in the following year 2010, the pelagic habitat hotspots developed with the chlorophyll front and were associated closely with the fishery locations in the northern Bone Gulf. For the year of 2011, the habitat hotspots were well formed again in the northern area but with narrower both latitudinal and longitudinal bands and they matched generally with fishing data. In all years, it seems that the potential habitat also had a good association with the shelf-break formation (at the depth of about 350 m).

The important skipjack habitats located the areas of 120.5–121.5°E longitude and 3.25–4.5°S latitude. It is interesting to see that the mean geographical position of the habitat hotspot was highly consistent with the Chl-a front position along the study area. Using pelagic habitat hotspot index as a predictor for skipjack CPUE response, we found that the correlation of predicted skipjack CPUEs against the observed was highly significant (P &lt; 0.0001, R
