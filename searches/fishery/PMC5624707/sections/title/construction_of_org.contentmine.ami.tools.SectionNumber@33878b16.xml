 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To detect the spatial pattern of the skipjack pelagic hotspots throughout study area, we constructed a model of fishery performance, which took into account both CPUE (index of fish abundance) and frequency of fishing effort (index of fish occurrence) in relation to the three oceanographic variables. This model was improved and developed from the albacore hotspot model [
  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref007">7</a>] by adding a weighting factor, allowing the contribution of each variable on the pelagic hotspot index (PHI) was taken into account. In addition, we added SSHA variable into the model to address the relationship between skipjack tuna and mesoscale variability.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The habitat hotspot was determined using environmental probability indices, reflecting the high probability areas of finding skipjack tuna. Specifically, the PHI was computed based on total CPUE at a given interval of histogram divided by the maximum total CPUE from all class intervals of the three variables (SST, SSHA and Chl-a) (
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0185601.e001" href="#pone.0185601.e001">Eq 1</a>), and fishing frequencies were also calculated with the same method (
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0185601.e002" href="#pone.0185601.e002">Eq 2</a>). The variable which has the highest CPUE or fishing frequency (maximum value) was used a standard. Then, we calculated the average of probability indices from the interval ranges of all variables (
  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0185601.e003" href="#pone.0185601.e003">Eq 3</a>). The highest probability value in which the probability index is more than 0.75 (PHI &gt; Quartile 3) indicated the pelagic habitat hotspots, showing the greatest probability areas of finding the fish. In contrast, the lowest probability denoted the least suitable locations for detecting skipjack tuna. Lastly, we combined the three satellite images to create a pelagic hotspot map for all interval ranges of the environmental conditions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CPUE data were then overlain on the map and the probability index of the joint environmental factors was extracted from each pixel corresponding to the fishing ground positions. The probability area was visualized using ArcGIS 10.3 Spatial Analyst software package. Then, based on the distribution of data points, we employed the piecewise regression technique to examine the relationship between total CPUE and the hotspot index around fishing locations. To evaluate the strength of the relationship, we used the correlation coefficient (r). Here this attempt focused on an analysis of the pelagic hotspots in the seasons of highest skipjack abundance from 2007–2011. For validation, we analyzed catch and the environmental data during the same period in 2012 using both spatial distributions of fishing data on the hotspot map and the correlation analysis. All the habitat hotspot images were mapped using spatial analyst toolbox in ArcGIS software package. The model used to calculate pelagic habitat hotspot index (PHI) as follows:
