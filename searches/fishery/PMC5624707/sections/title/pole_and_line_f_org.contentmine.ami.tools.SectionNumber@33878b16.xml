 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pole and line fishery in the study area, which extends from 118.5°E to 122.5°E longitude and 2°S-8°S latitude, captures the skipjack tuna mostly between the northwest and southeast monsoon (January-June). The fishery catch data were collected from pole and line fishing logbooks provided by the Fish Landing Bases in Luwu and Sinjai, South Sulawesi, and the and Kolaka Districts and Incorporated Company of Indonesian Government, PT. Perikanan Samudra at Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi in the period between northwest and southeast monsoon 2007–2011. The fishery data comprised daily geo-referenced fishing positions (latitude and longitude), catch in number of skipjack and effort (fishing set), from which catch per unit effort (CPUE) was determined in number of fish per fishing set, further compiled into monthly resolution datasets. To validate our model, the catch data were also collected from as many as 140 sampling fishing positions from scientific pole and line fishing surveys in the study area during the same period in 2012.</p>
