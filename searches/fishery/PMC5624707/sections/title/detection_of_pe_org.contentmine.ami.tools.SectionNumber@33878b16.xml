 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Detection of persistent pelagic habitat hotspot</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A persistent pelagic hotspot map was constructed based on the presence or absence of the strong environmental probability index (probability of more than 75%) in the study area. We built the persistent hotspot map by computing monthly mean composite hotspot images at the peak season between the northwest and southeast monsoon 2007â€“2011. The map consisted of value ranging from zero (0) to five (5). The highest value (5) indicated that the persistent hotspot at a certain spatial location took place during the period of five years. While, the lowest value (0) denoted that there was no persistent hotspot available at a given area during at least one year. Then, we overlaid the conspicuous environmental characteristics on the map to find a reliable proxy indicator for locating the persistent skipjack habitat hotspots.</p>
