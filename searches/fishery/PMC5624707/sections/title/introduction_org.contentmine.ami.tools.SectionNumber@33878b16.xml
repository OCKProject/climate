 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pelagic habitat hotspots, which are defined as areas of high biological activity where linkages occur between physical processes, primary production, secondary consumers and higher tropic level predators, play an important role in controlling distribution, migration and abundance for commercial and wide-roaming pelagic species in many different oceans [

The distinct oceanographic signatures in turn signify enhanced trophic interactions, physiological and foraging advantages, and thus provide high ecological and economic importance. Large pelagic fish as well as commercial fishing vessels recognize that prey organisms aggregate at ocean hotspots, which are mostly represented by ocean fronts, eddies and upwelling zones [

  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref008">8</a>]. Albacore forage habitat and migration routes are driven by the dynamic features of a pelagic hotspot namely a. Chl-a front known as the TZCF in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean [
  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref009">9</a>]. Recent findings suggest that the frontal area, eddy field, and topographic features (seamount) are important habitat hotspots for pelagic species such as flying squid and tuna [

  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref012">12</a>]. Therefore, detection of the ecologically significant pelagic habitats and their spatial persistence is critical for marine management strategies and identifying potential targets for conservation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Skipjack tuna (
  <span class="italic">Katsuwonus pelamis</span>) is one of the most valuable species in the world in terms of catch weight [
  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref013">13</a>]. It is a main target of a high-value commercial fishery in the tropical region, accounting for more than one half (approximately 58%) of the global tuna catch [
  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref013">13</a>]. Between 2005–2014, the fish contributed 47% of Indonesia total tuna catch [
  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref014">14</a>]. Hence, understanding of the species optimal habitats is central to evaluating fishing strategies and sustainable pelagic fisheries resources within Coral Triangle area.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential habitat for this species is within the warm surface layers of tropical and subtropical oceans [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many studies that assess skipjack tuna habitat around the world using various methods. Skipjack forage habitats in the Pacific Ocean have been predicted based on Spatial Ecosystem and Populations Dynamics Model [

  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref026">26</a>]. In the eastern central Atlantic and western Indian Oceans, favorable feeding habitats for skipjack have been investigated using a single ecological niche model [
  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref027">27</a>]. The recent findings show that skipjack tuna habitats in different El Nino events can be identified based on the optimal model of Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) [
  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref028">28</a>]. Most of the previous analyses of the preferred skipjack tuna habitat use statistical, ecological and spatial population dynamics models. The spatial persistence of the fish’s habitat has rarely been presented. In the present paper, we develop a model to explore not only habitat hotspots for skipjack tuna but also their persistence using multi-spectrum satellite images and high resolution of fishing performance data. This paper also highlights the important association between chlorophyll front and the skipjack habitats in the western Equatorial Pacific (southwestern Coral Triangle tuna).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Coral Triangle, which primarily encompasses the seas of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines is a known tuna (skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye) nursery and migratory path, producing about 46% of all tuna catches in Western and Central Pacific Ocean [
  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref029">29</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref030">30</a>]. The Gulf of Bone—Flores Sea is an important coral reef area located in the southwestern Coral Triangle where many commercial tuna fisheries conduct fishing operations. Our preliminary study estimated the MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield) for this study area is 49,709 tonnes per year, indicating the great potential skipjack fishing ground. Statistical data (2007–2013) from Agency For Marine and Fisheries Affairs, South Sulawesi Province indicate that trend of skipjack catch tends to increase during the period between northwest and southeast monsoon. During this period, surface temperature gradually decrease while Chl-a tends to be high, providing high biological productivity [
  <a rid="pone.0185601.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0185601.ref031">31</a>] which are in turn correlates with high catches of skipjack [

However, there is a critical gap of information about skipjack tuna distribution in the opposite area (southwestern Coral Triangle tuna, particularly in the Gulf of Bone- Flores Sea). This area is one of the most potentially great tuna fishing grounds in Indonesia waters [
