 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the period of April-June, skipjack CPUEs tended to be high and reached the peak in May (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g002" href="#pone.0185601.g002">Fig 2A</a>). Catch level in this month was about 170 fish/fishing set. The highest CPUEs occurred in areas of relatively high Chl-a and warmer SST ranging from 0.16 to 0.3 mg m
  <span class="sup">-3</span> (0.22±0.068 mg m
  <span class="sup">-3</span>) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g002" href="#pone.0185601.g002">Fig 2B</a>) and from 29.76 to 30.86°C (30.31±0.55°C) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g002" href="#pone.0185601.g002">Fig 2C</a>), respectively. At the same time, the greatest skipjack catches were obtained in waters of positive SSHA ranging from 3.04 cm to 7.96 cm (5.50 ± 2.46 cm) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185601.g002" href="#pone.0185601.g002">Fig 2D</a>). During January-March, the catch rates (CPUEs) appeared to be lower than those of subsequent months. During that period, the fishing sets occupied the locations where surface temperature was relative high and Chl-a as well as SSHA fluctuated highly.
