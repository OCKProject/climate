 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pelagic habitat hotspots for skipjack tuna in the southwestern Coral Triangle tuna are influenced by the optimum combination of environmental factors (SST, Chl-a and SSHA) detectable from satellite images. Skipjack CPUEs increased significantly in the areas of highest pelagic hotspot index (PHI). We found the key pelagic habitat corresponded mainly with the Chl-a front, which could stimulate enhanced forage abundance for skipjack within a physiologically optimum temperature range above the thermocline depth. The habitat hotspot and its persistence are clearly identified by 0.2 mg m
  <span class="sup">-3</span> Chl-a isopleth, suggesting that the Chl-a front provides an important step on detection of habitat hotspots, distribution patterns and abundance of skipjack tuna in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, especially within Coral Triangle
