  <p>Ensemble-average harvest in years 1950 (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) and 2000 (
   <span class="bold">b</span>). Colour shading shows the harvest in t km
   <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
   <span class="sup">−1</span>. For these plots, the ensemble was forced with satellite-based observational estimates of primary productivity and temperature, subjected to globally homogeneous historical price variations and steady 5% per year technological progress. Although idealized, the simulations reproduce key aspects of late 20th century changes, including a shift to lower latitudes and deeper waters.
