  <div class="title">Global historical hindcast simulation.</div>
  <p>Lines and shaded areas show the model ensemble mean and 1 s.d., respectively, assuming open access (OA, that is, no regulation), 5% per year technological progress, the observed history of ex-vessel price, and historical climate variability as simulated by the IPSL climate model. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Simulated fish catch per year. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Nominal effort (orange) and effective effort (red). (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Simulated biomass as a fraction of pristine biomass. All model forcings and parameters other than technology, price and climate are held constant throughout the 56-year simulation.
