 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We consider an extreme range of possible futures for the global wild-capture fishery by projecting the model forward under idealized economic scenarios, with and without climate change. First, the historical OA hindcast is projected forward to represent an extreme end-member in which management is absent, under two alternative technological progress scenarios, and with either constant or linearly increasing price (Methods). Second, the model is used to estimate the global Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), representing the theoretical upper limit that could be approached with perfectly effective and well-informed management aimed at maximizing food production (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Methods</a>). We emphasize that the future of the global fishery will follow neither the purely OA nor the MSY pathway; rather, these end-members outline the boundaries of what is possible for the global wild fishery in terms of food production. For example, effective regulations aimed at maximizing economic yield would produce less than the MSY harvest, but would generate more profit for fishermen
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>. We simultaneously consider the impacts of climate change by using water temperatures and primary production from the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) Earth System model with the RCP8.5 scenario (high emissions), and compare with a stable pre-industrial climate (Methods, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Methods</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MSY is determined exclusively by the ability of the ecosystem to produce harvestable biomass, so that this modelled upper limit of potential harvest depends only on climate. As shown by 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5a</a>, the model ensemble estimates a MSY of ∼180±60 Mt yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> under stable preindustrial climate, while the inclusion of historical climate change leads to a decrease of MSY to 160±50 Mt yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> by 2015. The present-day global MSY estimate of 123 Mt yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> provided by ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a> lies within the 1 s.d. range of the model ensemble. Under the rapid continuing climate change of the RCP8.5 scenario, MSY decreases by 20% relative to 2015 by the end of the 21st century, falling below the simulated peak harvest obtained under OA, consistent with the view that climate change will cause a significant drop in potential fish production without reduction of carbon emissions

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, a much more dramatic decline in global harvest occurs over the 21st century in the hypothetical cases for which effective management is absent, as illustrated by the OA scenarios. Given continued 5% per year technological progress and constant price, the peak in global harvest is followed by a long-term decline (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5a</a>, grey). This reversal in the role of technological progress—from enhancing to reducing harvest—arises because the ability of most ecosystems to produce biomass becomes limited by the spawning stock size under intense rates of harvest, as shown in many scientific surveys of fisheries

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>, and constrained here through our calibration against observed harvests (Methods, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Methods</a>). If technological progress is halted, the harvest stabilizes, with only a small downward drift that is due to climate change (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5a</a>, green). In the OA simulations where future price increases, shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5b</a>, the same general trajectories are maintained, but the decline of harvest is more severe because over-fishing is intensified.
