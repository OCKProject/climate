 <p>All simulations assume OA, and each varies only the forcing specified; all other ecosystem and economic dynamics are solved prognostically. The average ex-vessel price of fish (
  <span class="bold">a</span>) and cost of fishing per unit effort (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) are derived from observations, while technological progress is imposed as a constant rate of catchability increase of (
  <span class="bold">c</span>) 2, (
  <span class="bold">d</span>) 5 and (
  <span class="bold">e</span>) 8% per year.
