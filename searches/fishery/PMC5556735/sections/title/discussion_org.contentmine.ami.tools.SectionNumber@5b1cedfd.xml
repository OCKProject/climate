 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our hindcast simulations, forced with relatively simple historical scenarios, suggest that a long-term average technological progress rate of roughly 5% per year dominated the 20th century trend in global fish harvests. In reality, technological improvements did not proceed by a steady march synchronized throughout the world, but proceeded at heterogeneous rates among different fisheries according to the development and diffusion of new ideas, and access to the capital required to implement them. Nonetheless, given the large number of technological innovations that took place over the 20th century, from monofilament lines, power blocks and new hook designs
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a>, to sonar, radar and satellite communications, it is plausible that the overall aggregate progress—integrated among industrial fisheries of the world—may have been relatively smooth.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of technological progress is achieved in the model by two interdependent pathways: fish become easier to catch for a given nominal effort and fish biomass, increasing effective effort, which in turn makes fishing more profitable, thereby increasing the nominal effort as long as the ecosystem is capable of sustaining the harvest. The fact that, over a 50-year period, a 5% per year rate of technological progress would have increased catchability by an order of magnitude explains its dominance over the relatively small historical fluctuations in the ex-vessel price and the cost of fishing.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our idealized future simulations suggest that, over the 21st century, continuing technological improvements would cause global harvest to decrease under OA. This reversal of the 20th century trend would be exacerbated by any market dynamics that raise prices. These simulated future decreases, which lead to a growing divergence between OA and MSY over time (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a>), suggest that the global impact of effective regulation will become more important in future as technology improves: whereas in 2015, the simulated MSY harvest is only ∼15% greater and ∼$20 billion per year more profitable than the global OA harvest, in 2100 (given 5% per year progress and increasing prices) the MSY harvest is more than ten-fold greater and hundreds of billions per year more profitable than the OA harvest. Although this may be of only theoretical interest for fisheries where effective regulatory regimes are well-established, it could have serious food security implications for the numerous fisheries in which regulations remain ineffective. The model suggests that, if perfectly managed, the global MSY would be on the order of 25% greater than the OA historical peak under preindustrial climate, and that even with the rapid climate change of the RCP8.5 scenario, the MSY would remain greater than the OA historical peak throughout most of the 21st century. Thus, our model suggests that the global wild capture fishery could continue to provide food, throughout the 21st century, at the same rate (or better) as at the end of the 20th century, but only if effective management can be extended to the fisheries in which it remains weak or absent.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We note that if new fisheries develop for previously unexploited species (such as mesopelagic fish), not included in our model, this could potentially slow the reduction of harvest under OA and raise global MSY. At the same time, our model is generally optimistic, in that it does not resolve habitat destruction by intensive trawling

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a>, ocean acidification and deoxygenation, or the development of overcapacity due to subsidies
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a>, all of which would benefit from further study. The urgent need for improved fisheries management at the global scale is widely recognized, given the existing level of fishing effort
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a> and growing pressure from climate change
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>. Our results amplify these concerns by showing that, whereas progress in fishing technology contributed to massive gains in fish harvest during the 20th century at the global scale, its influence on catchability would be expected to only reduce harvest in the 21st century unless met with a global expansion of effective fisheries management.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model presented here takes a highly simplified approach to the wild capture fishery, as required to remain tractable at the global scale and over long timescales. But despite its simplicity, the comprehensive treatment of critical elements, including spatially and temporally resolved interactions of humans with the ecosystem, allow it to identify the relative importance of general mechanisms that are difficult to discern among the multiplicity of factors typically considered on shorter timescales. Similar approaches may help to better understand the long-term dynamics of other coupled human-Earth systems.</p>
