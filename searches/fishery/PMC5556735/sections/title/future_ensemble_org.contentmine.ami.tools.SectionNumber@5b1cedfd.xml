 <div class="title">Future ensemble projections of global harvest under idealized scenarios.</div>
 <p>In each panel, four different idealized scenarios illustrate a range of possible long-term outcomes, reflecting different roles of technological progress, fisheries management, climate change and market conditions. Black lines show OA simulations, representing an absence of management, with steady 5% per year technological progress. Green ‘technology stabilization’ OA simulations undergo a gradual decrease in technological progress from 5% per year in 2006 to zero by 2036, after which the technology is held constant. The global MSY that could be achieved given perfect management aimed at maximizing harvest is shown in blue. For the OA and MSY RCP8.5 scenarios, the 1 s.d. range of the five ensemble members is shown by shaded envelope. (

  <span class="bold">b</span>) simulations with linearly increasing price from ∼1$ kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in 2006 to ∼3$ kg
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in 2100. All OA simulations, as well as the MSY RCP8.5 simulation, use the IPSL Earth System model climate change projection, while the preindustrial MSY is plotted as a constant value, calculated from the mean of the period 1850–1900 in the IPSL historical simulation.
