<p class="p">In conclusion, the simulation of circulation needs to be improved in order to simulate midcontinental Eurasian surface climates better, both in the mid‐Holocene and under modern conditions. It is generally assumed that increasing model resolution, through improving the representation of topography and land‐sea geography, will improve the simulation of circulation and atmospheric dynamics [
