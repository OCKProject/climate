<p class="p">In our analyses, we have compared reconstructions of surface climates to model outputs. We have not attempted to diagnose atmospheric circulation directly. Although there have been some attempts to reconstruct paleocirculation [e.g.,

 <xref rid="grl56345-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>], direct evidence for wind pathways, direction, and strength is limited. In general, the aeolian landforms that provide direct evidence are difficult to date because of their sedimentary composition. Furthermore, it is rarely possible to determine whether the formation of these landforms reflects long‚Äêterm mean wind conditions or sporadic and atypical winds. Oxygen isotope records may ultimately hold more promise for the diagnosis of circulation changes [e.g.,
