<p class="p">The long‐term average differences in both circulation‐related and surface energy balance variables, both seasonally and in their spatial patterning, are remarkably similar across the suite of CMIP5/PMIP3 
 <italic class="italic">midHolocene</italic> simulations. Such robustness in the simulated climate is often taken as a sign that the signal is correct, for example, in the interpretation of future regional climate changes [e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Ciscar et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="grl56345-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>]. Indeed, the use of the multimodel median as a basis for model ranking [e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Flato et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="grl56345-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>] is predicated on the idea that similarity to other models is a criterion of value. There are multiple instances where the paleorecord shows that a robust signal is nevertheless unrealistic [
 <italic class="italic">Harrison et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="grl56345-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>]. However, the example of midcontinental Eurasia is an extreme case, because the simulations and the observations differ not only in magnitude but also in sign.
