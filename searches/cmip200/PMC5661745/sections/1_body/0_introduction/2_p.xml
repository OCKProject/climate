<p class="p">The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5/Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP5/PMIP3) mid‐Holocene simulations show drier conditions in the Eurasian midcontinent and a significant increase in summer temperature; in contrast, paleoenvironmental data (including lake level, vegetation and isotope records, and aeolian deposits) and quantitative climate reconstructions show that the midcontinental extratropics were wetter than today and summers were cooler [

 <xref rid="grl56345-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>]. The consistency among multiple lines of paleoenvironmental evidence makes it unlikely that the mismatch reflects misinterpretation of the data. Regional temperature biases in the CMIP5 twentieth century simulations have been linked to biases in surface energy and water balances, with overprediction or underprediction of moisture fluxes and evapotranspiration leading to cold and warm temperature biases, respectively [

 <xref rid="grl56345-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>]. This suggests that discrepancies in the simulation of mid‐Holocene climates might have a similar cause. In this paper, we investigate the processes involved in midcontinental climate changes in the CMIP5/PMIP3 simulations in order to identify the underlying cause of the mismatch with observations.
