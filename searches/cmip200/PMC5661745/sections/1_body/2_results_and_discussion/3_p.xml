<p class="p">Although generally dry, the region of interest has a distinct summer wet season, when soil moisture is replenished by higher precipitation provided by increased moisture flux from westerly sources (see the 
 <xref rid="grl56345-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">supporting information</xref>), and therefore, changes in the strength of the westerlies and the moisture flux are key for understanding changes in moisture. Moisture changes in turn contribute to temperature changes through the partitioning of net radiation into latent as opposed to sensible and substrate heating.
