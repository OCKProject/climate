<p class="p">As a result of the MH changes in the seasonal and latitudinal patterns of insolation consequent on the change in orbital forcing (and in particular the substantial increase in summer), the latitudinal temperature gradient in the Northern Hemisphere was less steep than today during the winter (November through April) but steeper than today during summer (July to September; Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56345-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The 500 hPa zonal index (a measure of the strength of westerly flow, calculated as the horizontal geopotential height gradient or difference between 40° and 60°N, over the longitudinal span 30° to 120°E), shows considerable month‐to‐month and model‐to‐model variability, but moisture flux into the midcontinent is clearly reduced relative to 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> over the first half of the year. Precipitation is lower than 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> through May and little different afterward (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56345-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). As a result of the reduction in spring precipitation, soil moisture is not replenished and is lower than 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> throughout the summer (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56345-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Although this reduction in soil moisture would ordinarily be expected to limit evapotranspiration, evapotranspiration (latent heat flux) is higher in the 
 <italic class="italic">midHolocene</italic> simulation compared to 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> because of the higher summer insolation. The excess energy is preferentially used for sensible heating, resulting in much larger increases in sensible than latent heat: in July, 7.1 versus 3.2 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> respectively. The increase in sensible heat flux results in increased surface and atmospheric temperature. Comparison of the changes in air temperature at different elevations (surface, 2 m, 850 hPa) confirms that summer warming is a surface‐driven phenomenon (see the 
 <xref rid="grl56345-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">supporting information</xref>). The effect of the positive energy balance feedback on temperature is strong enough to overwhelm the discernable, though small, intermodel variability in circulation and moisture.
