<p class="p">The latitudinal temperature gradient in the 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> simulations (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56345-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) is weaker than shown by NCEP during most of the year, though slightly stronger than the reanalysis in June and July. The 500 hPa zonal index mirrors this, being similar to NCEP in summer and stronger than NCEP in winter. The simulated strength of the westerly flow is weaker than in the reanalysis, and thus, moisture flux is reduced. The 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic>‐simulated precipitation is higher than observed in winter, although the amount is very small (e.g., simulated rate 0.96 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> compared to 0.68 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in January), and much lower than observed in summer (e.g., simulated rate 1.79 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> compared to 2.74 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in July). As in the 
 <italic class="italic">midHolocene</italic> case, the dry bias is exacerbated by the energy balance feedback: soil moisture is generally lower than in the reanalysis throughout the year, latent heat is lower and sensible heating higher than in the reanalysis. The mechanisms that give rise to biases in surface climates in the 
 <italic class="italic">midHolocene</italic> simulations are thus operating in the 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic>, and the circulation‐related variables are indeed weaker than in the reanalysis. This discrepancy is particularly noteworthy because the 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> climate is globally colder than the twentieth/21st centuries and the latitudinal temperature gradient steeper, and so a priori [
 <italic class="italic">Rind</italic>, 
 <xref rid="grl56345-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>], the simulated circulation should be stronger than the NCEP reanalysis. These analyses suggest that removing the circulation bias under modern‐day conditions would lead to a better simulation of MH climates in midcontinental Eurasia.
