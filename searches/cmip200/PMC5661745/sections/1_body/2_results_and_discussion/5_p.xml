<p class="p">Reconciliation of the simulated and reconstructed MH temperatures in Eurasia would require increased delivery of precipitation into the midcontinent to offset the impact of the strong positive energy balance feedback. This would require the simulated westerly flow and moisture flux to be stronger. However, the simulated circulation in the 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> would also need to be stronger to be consistent with the impact of orbital changes on the change in latitudinal temperature gradients between the 
 <italic class="italic">midHolocene</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> simulations. Evaluation of the 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> simulations against observations can show whether this is feasible, i.e., whether there is evidence to suggest that the simulated circulation is weaker than observed and this contributes to obvious biases in surface climates in the midcontinent.
