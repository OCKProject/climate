<p class="p">There is substantial agreement in the spatial and seasonal expression of the sign of change in the simulated climate variables across individual models (see the 
 <xref rid="grl56345-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">supporting information</xref>), which allows us to focus here on the multimodel average responses. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) is reduced very little (the multimodel area‐weighted average is −0.02 mm d
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the belt between 40° and 60°N) over the Eurasian midcontinent in the CMIP5/PMIP3 
 <italic class="italic">midHolocene</italic> simulations compared to the 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56345-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), and this translates into a similarly small reduction in both runoff (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>) and soil moisture (as measured by 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>). Drier (than 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic>) conditions are most marked in the belt between 40° and 60°N. Summer temperature is significantly higher than in the 
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56345-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>): the multimodel area‐weighted average increase in MTWA in the belt between 40° and 60°N is +2.1°C. In contrast, many lakes across the region were higher than today and vegetation data indicate the persistence or even expansion of forests (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56345-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), both implying that the midcontinental region was wetter than today. Paleoclimate reconstructions indicate that both MAP and 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> were higher than today (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56345-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>); the area‐weighted average regional increase in precipitation is 120 ± 21 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and the area‐weighted increase in 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> is 0.024 ± 0.010 (where the uncertainties are the reconstruction standard errors) [see 
 <italic class="italic">Bartlein et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="grl56345-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>]. The reconstructions of MTWA are more heterogeneous (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56345-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), with some differences between simulated and reconstructed summer temperatures of up to 4°C at individual sites; however, reconstructed summer temperatures averaged across the whole region are similar to those of today (−0.06 ± 0.48°C). The 
 <italic class="italic">midHolocene</italic> simulations therefore appear to be too dry and too warm relative to the paleoclimatic observations.
