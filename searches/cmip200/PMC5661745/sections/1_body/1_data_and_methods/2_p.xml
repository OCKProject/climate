<p class="p">We have examined climate responses in the CMIP5/PMIP3 mid‐Holocene (
 <italic class="italic">midHolocene</italic>) experiments, expressed as anomalies relative to a preindustrial control (
 <italic class="italic">piControl</italic>) simulation. The 
 <italic class="italic">midHolocene</italic> experiment shows the response to changes in the seasonal and latitudinal distribution in insolation 6000 years ago, with greenhouse gas concentrations at preindustrial levels (for details of the experimental design, see 
 <italic class="italic">Braconnot et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="grl56345-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>]). We use outputs from 14 models (see the 
 <xref rid="grl56345-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">supporting information</xref> for details) and use the data reduction steps followed by

 <xref rid="grl56345-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>]. Long‐term monthly averages of temperature, energy balance, and circulation variables at each model grid cell were calculated based on the last 100 years of each model simulation and bilinearly interpolated onto a common 2° × 2° grid for analysis. The “multimodel mean” maps were produced by simple averaging of model outputs. Area‐weighted averages of the key variables for each model were calculated for the Eurasian midcontinent land area between 40° to 60°N and 30° to 120°E. We exclude one model (FGOALS‐S2) from the multimodel average because it shows aberrant behavior compared to the other members of the ensemble (see the
