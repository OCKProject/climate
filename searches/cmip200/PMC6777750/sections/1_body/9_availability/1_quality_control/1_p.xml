<p class="p">Strict requirements for input files are documented. An example workflow for training an emulator and generating new residuals (using the commands outlined above) is included in the package. Using the R packages 
 <monospace class="monospace">devtools</monospace> and 
 <monospace class="monospace">roxygen2</monospace>, extensive documentation for every function created in 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> is included. More detail of each step in 
 <xref rid="pone.0223542.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> may be found in the tutorial vignettes included with the package (
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen/vignettes/</monospace>). Integrated testing (via the 
 <monospace class="monospace">testthat</monospace> R package and example NetCDF data included in 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen/inst/extdata</monospace>) is included and may be run with 
 <monospace class="monospace">devtools::test()</monospace>. The full suite of integrated tests is invoked in addition to a battery of standardized R checks with 
 <monospace class="monospace">devtools::check()</monospace>.
