 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> uses multiple enormous global gridded datasets for emulator training. Therefore, a minimum memory size of 8GB is necessary, and 16GB is recommended. Memory capacity determines how fast the code is able to run, how many variables 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> is able to analyze the joint properties for, how many scenarios 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> may train on, and how many generated fields may be held in memory.
