<p class="p">The extension of 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> from version 1.0 t0 version 2.0 has broadened the functionality from training using temperature data to joint training on temperature and precipitation by introducing a new algorithm for dealing with non-normality in the training data. Through this algorithm, any variable that scales with global mean temperature and whose residuals in each grid cell have a continuous, invertible, increasing empirical CDF could be jointly explored with temperature. Certainly this includes precipitation, but could easily be applied, as is, to variables such as relative humidity. Further, the version 1.0 requirement that input training data have approximately normally distributed residuals for the method to generate new residual fields with the correct spatiotemporal and cross-variable statistics has been removed. A user no longer has to judge whether their input training data is sufficiently close to normal to use 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace>.
