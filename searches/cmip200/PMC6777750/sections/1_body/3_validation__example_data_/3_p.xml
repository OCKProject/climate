<p class="p">While it mathematically follows from the construction of this method that the rank-correlation coefficient is the same in generated data as it was in the training ESM data for every pairwise possibility of grid cell to grid cell comparison of temperature with temperature, precipitation with precipitation, and temperature with precipitation, we also performed an explicit check of of this using 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen v2.0</monospace> emulator training and realization generating capabilities. This explicit test is not included in the automated testing suite as it takes many hours of computer time. An example trained emulator with raw ESM data, R scripts performing this test and the results are archived on zenodo (DOI
