<p class="p">Extensive integrated, automatic testing is provided in the 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen v2.0</monospace> R package to both check that the software performs as intended and to explicitly validate that the statistical properties of interest for included example ESM data (
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen/inst/extdata</monospace>) are indeed preserved in generated realizations. This explicit validation supplements mathematical proofs that the method being implemented in 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen v2.0</monospace> has the described statistical preservation properties (further described and verified in Paper LS1).
