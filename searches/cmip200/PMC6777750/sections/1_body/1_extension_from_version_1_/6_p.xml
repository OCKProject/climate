<p class="p">Producing joint temperature and log(precipitation) residual realizations therefore requires the development of an algorithm to handle non-normality in transformed ESM training data. This algorithm extension for 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen v2.0</monospace> involves additional transformations on the input to and output from the version 1.0 process (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) in order to return generated realizations of joint temperature and log(precipitation) residuals to the native temperature and log(precipitation) distribution in each grid cell. One additional benefit is that this extension removes an assumption necessary to use version 1.0: we previously were restricted to assuming temperature residuals followed a normal distribution in each grid cell. With version 2.0, it no longer matters if this is the case for ESM variables under consideration.
