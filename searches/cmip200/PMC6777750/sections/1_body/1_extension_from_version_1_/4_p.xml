<p class="p">For many ESMs, the temperature residuals in each grid cell are indeed approximately normally distributed. However, residuals for other variables, such as precipitation, in many grid cells may have a non-normal distribution (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Thus, in addition to the joint emulation of variables such as temperature and precipitation, one major goal of 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen v2.0</monospace> is to make the field generation process more robust to non-normally distributed ESM variables. Even in cases where distributions are reasonably well approximated by normal distributions, this change removes the need for a user’s expert judgement as to whether an ESM variable’s residuals in each grid cell follow a distribution sufficiently close to normal to use the field generating method.
