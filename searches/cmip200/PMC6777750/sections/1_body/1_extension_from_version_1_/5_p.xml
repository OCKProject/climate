<p class="p">For the core field generating method, each ESM variable must effectively be able to accept residuals of between −∞ and ∞ for addition to its mean field. This is already the case for temperature and no transformation is needed. However, because precipitation values in an ESM cannot be negative, either the generated residuals have to be constrained to avoid negative precipitation while preserving the ESM spatiotemporal and intervariable statistics, or the method must operate on a transformation of precipitation that can accept residuals between −∞ and ∞. The latter is more straightforward, and so residuals are generated for log(precipitation) rather than precipitation. The transformation of generated full fields from log(precipitation) space back to precipitation space is trivial for log transformations. Indeed, any function that is continuous, invertible, strictly increasing, and results in a transformed ESM variable whose residuals are supported on (−∞, ∞) will preserve the ESM spatiotemporal statistical properties as desired.</p>
