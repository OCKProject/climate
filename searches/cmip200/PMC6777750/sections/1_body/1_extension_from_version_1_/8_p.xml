<p class="p">We have developed a continuous, invertible, and strictly increasing transformation method that allows us to map between the native distributions of residuals for each grid cell and a normal distribution of residuals for each grid cell. This transformation removes the need for user expertise as to whether residuals in every grid cell follow a distribution sufficiently close to a normal distribution for the field generating method outlined in Paper LS1 to work.</p>
