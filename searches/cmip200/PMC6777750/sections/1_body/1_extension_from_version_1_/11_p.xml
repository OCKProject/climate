<p class="p">This mapping is applied to input, native residuals to create normally distributed residuals for emulator training (arrow 2 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The inverse of this mapping is applied to transform the generated, and therefore normally distributed, residuals for a grid cell back to the native, non-normal distribution initially sampled in 
 <bold class="bold">R</bold> (arrow 4 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Further, because the mapping is continuous, invertible, and increasing, the rank-order correlation coefficient between residuals in two arbitrary grid cells is the same in the native distribution space as it is in the normal distribution. Combining this with the fact that the 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> process generates new, normally distributed field of residuals (arrow 2 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), we conclude that the rank-order correlation between input native values in different grid cells is the same as the rank-order correlation between between generated native values.
