<p class="p">The 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> process, for both version 1.0 and 2.0, operates on a state vector, 
 <bold class="bold">x</bold>(
 <bold class="bold">t</bold>). At any given time 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>, the state of the system is defined as the temperature residuals in every grid cell (flattened to one dimensional indices from the traditional latitude-longitude two dimensions), concatenated with the precipitation residuals in every grid cell if applicable (flattened to the same one dimensional spatial indices). Therefore, once the issues of non-normality are accounted for in the extension to version 1.0, cross-variable relationships are automatically captured and joint emulation is achieved.
