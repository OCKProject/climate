<p class="p">The scientific details of generating new realizations of residuals from a training matrix of ESM residuals are detailed in the 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen v1.0</monospace> model description Paper LS1. One key feature of the version 1.0 process is that the generated time series of temperature residuals in any given grid cell is approximately normally distributed. This is true irrespective of the distributions of input residuals, due to the way the algorithm sums up contributions from a large number of random components. As a result, the method will preserve the distribution of input residuals only if they are normally distributed.
