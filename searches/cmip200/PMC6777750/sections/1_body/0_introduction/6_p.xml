 <monospace class="monospace">Fldgen v2.0</monospace> provides a tool for modelers to rigorously analyze the impacts of extreme events that previously could not be fully evaluated due to limited ESM realizations and region-to-region teleconnections that are not explicitly known globally, such as multi-year droughts across different regions. The objective of this paper is to describe the open-source and publicly available 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen v2.0</monospace> R package work-flow, capabilities, and accessibility for community use (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jgcri/fldgen" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://github.com/jgcri/fldgen</ext-link>) in the context of joint generation of temperature and precipitation fields. This includes an overview of the updates to the 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> algorithm from version 1.0 to version 2.0. The theory that supports this extension should be applicable to arbitrary pairs of ESM variables, though this has not been tested and is not a central claim of this work.
