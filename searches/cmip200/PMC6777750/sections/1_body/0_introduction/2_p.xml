<p class="p">Process-rich Earth System Models (ESMs) are capable of providing the high-resolution future climate scenarios for impacts studies, but are too computationally expensive to directly produce hundreds or thousands of realizations needed to understand the impacts of extreme events. Climate model emulators attempt to solve this problem by approximating the output a climate model would have produced had it been run repeatedly for a specified scenario [
 <xref rid="pone.0223542.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. These emulators are computationally cheap to run, but typically capture only the mean response of the climate and little to none of the variability that would be present in a real ESM output. Attempts to add variability to such emulations often lose important spatial and temporal correlations that fundamentally define ESM patterns (such as the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation), or else cannot produce the number of realizations necessary for extreme event or uncertainty studies.
