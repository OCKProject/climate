<p class="p">Recent research has shown that modeling temperature and precipitation extremes independently mischaracterizes drought hazards as the covariance between climate variables is missed [
 <xref rid="pone.0223542.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Therefore, an effective emulator of temperature and precipitation must jointly produce temperature and precipitation realizations that capture such covariance. 
 <monospace class="monospace">Fldgen v2.0</monospace> is designed to add this capability, allowing researchers to jointly generate two-variable (e.g. joint temperature and precipitation) fields that not only retain the individual variablesâ€™ spatial and temporal variance and covariance structures, but also inter-variable covariance. This method is meant to be used on annual, global gridded temperature and precipitation data. While many interesting climatological and biological processes occur at daily or monthly scales, this annual timescale is often used by researchers in the impacts community focused on long-term effects. Many of these researchers also require global gridded realizations of ESM variables [

 <xref rid="pone.0223542.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. It is true that past modeling approaches such as the UKCP09 framework have provided a methodology for stochastically generating daily weather data for specific regions that does to some degree account for correlations between multiple variables and has accurate statistical structure to high order [
 <xref rid="pone.0223542.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. However, because the focus of that method is on weather in specific regions, it does not necessarily incorporate dynamics that govern larger spatiotemporal scales to be usable in a global gridded manner.
