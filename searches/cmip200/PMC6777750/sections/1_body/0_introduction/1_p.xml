Understanding the uncertainty around extreme events also has direct relevance for decision makers, the U.S. energy grid, and other stakeholders. Generally, high-resolution future climate scenarios can be used as input for different process-based or economic models to assess impacts of future climate on economic, land, energy, and other systems; however, thousands of such high-resolution future scenarios may be needed for a full and robust analysis of the impacts of low-frequency high-importance extreme events and associated uncertainties [
