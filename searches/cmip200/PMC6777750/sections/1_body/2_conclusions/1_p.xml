 <monospace class="monospace">Fldgen v2.0</monospace> provides a tool for climate change impacts modelers to rigorously analyze the impacts of extreme events that previously could not be fully evaluated due to limited ESM realizations and region-to-region teleconnections that are not explicitly known globally, such as multi-year droughts across different regions. With the mathematical construction described in the previous section and summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> (right), when the full workflow depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> is completed, the algorithm can be run on any input ESM residuals, provided their distribution in each grid cell is continuous and invertible. An emulator trained on these residuals can be used to generate new ESM residual time series that preserve all the same statistical properties preserved by version 1, with one small exception, viz. that in Property 2 the type of correlation preserved is the rank-order correlation, not necessarily the linear correlation coefficient. This change is a consequence of allowing arbitrary native distributions in the data. Additionally, the residual fields generated this way also preserve the inter-variable correlations present in the input data, a new property with no analog in version 1.
