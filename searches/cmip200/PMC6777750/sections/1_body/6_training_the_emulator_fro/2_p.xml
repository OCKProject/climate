<p class="p">The user must select an ESM to emulate and provide annual, spatially disaggregated temperature and precipitation NetCDF files to be used for training. The 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> package was designed with globally gridded data sets in mind, but would technically work with any spatial disaggregation. Currently, however, it is necessary that the training data be at an annual time scale. The training NetCDF files are most conveniently stored in some user-specified directory that can be passed directly to the 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> training functions. Finally, all NetCDF files must follow CMIP5 naming conventions [
