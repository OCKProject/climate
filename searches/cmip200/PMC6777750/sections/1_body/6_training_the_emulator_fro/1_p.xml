<p class="p">As an open source R package, 
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen</monospace> was implemented with a modular design so that different steps of the algorithm described in 
 <xref rid="pone.0223542.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> can easily have different implementations. Using the R packages 
 <monospace class="monospace">devtools</monospace> and 
 <monospace class="monospace">roxygen2</monospace>, extensive documentation for every function created in the package is included. More detail of each step in 
 <xref rid="pone.0223542.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> may be found in the tutorial vignettes included with the package (
 <monospace class="monospace">fldgen/vignettes/</monospace>) and as described in Paper LS1. This subsection briefly demonstrates the function calls required for training an emulator and generating new realizations.
