<p class="p">Estimates of the start dates of the vegetation active period on the basis of webcam images were similar to those simulated by the JSBACH model (see section “Webcam Network” in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Material</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The vegetation active period ended slightly later according to the JSBACH results than based on the webcam images. VAPstart in Finland occurred in median on 28 April in all simulations for the present period (1980–2010) (

 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">SYKE, 2018</xref>). The satellite-derived median VAPstart occurred on 13 April in evergreen coniferous forest. JSBACH simulations included all PFTs whereas PREBAS simulations included forested areas only. Thus, the simulated present day VAPstart seems to be slightly ahead of satellite observations with a median VAPstart on 5 May for all forest types (

In comparison to reference conditions, the vegetation active period started (VAPstart) about 2 weeks earlier in the mid-century, and 3 weeks earlier toward the end of the century. This means spring would start earlier in April than at present. The vegetation active period ended (VAPend) by the end of the century in early October, compared to late September in the reference conditions (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In the climate change simulations, the length of the vegetation active period (VAPlength) increased from 162 days with about 20 days in the mid-century and with 30 days by the end of the century (
