 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>) altered the water availability in the JSBACH simulations. The risk for drought was slightly increasing for all scenarios. Much of the change is due to earlier snow melt and thus possibility for earlier drought events. Decreasing precipitation was projected for some climate models in winter for all time periods, and also in summer for the end of the century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The mean number of dry summer days was approximated to around 4 days for the reference period. By the end of the century (2071–2100), the mean simulated number of dry summer days increased to about 15 days in the south and to 10 days in the north (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In southern Finland, simulations for the mid-century gave even higher number of dry days (23). In the JSBACH simulations, the number of soil frost days was decreasing in all simulations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The changes were largest in southern Finland under the high forcing scenario (RCP8.5), from 134 days in 1981–2010 to 25 days in 2071–2100. This means the opportunities for winter harvest on drained peatlands are decreasing with all scenarios, more in the south than in the north.
