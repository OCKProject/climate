<p class="p">GPP was projected to increase with climate change, more so with higher radiative forcing (RCP8.5), and more toward the end of the century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). For the low emission scenario (RCP2.6) hardly any difference between the time periods can be seen in the simulated GPP values. Differences between the medium and the high emission scenario simulations (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are evident only from the mid-century onward (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The estimated median increase in GPP was 34% for the mid-century time period (2041–2070), and 46% for the end of the century (2071–2100), over all radiative forcing levels (
