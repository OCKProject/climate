<p class="p">JSBACH is a land surface model of an earth system model of Max Planck institute for meteorology (MPI-MET) and describes the biogeophysical processes that regulate the balances of water and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The storage of water and C into the ecosystem as well as their release to the atmosphere is regulated by the climatic variables. Land vegetation is divided into plant functional types (PFT), and for our domain (the Finnish mainland) we based the PFT distribution on Finnish CORINE land cover data (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CLC, 2012</xref>), which contains information about soil type, thus providing soil characteristics consistent with the vegetation cover data. Seasonal development of leaf area index is regulated by air temperature and soil moisture with PFT specific maximum leaf area index as a limiting value. For the generation of the seasonal cycle, PFTs are divided in summergreen, evergreen, grass and crop phenology types (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Böttcher et al. (2016)</xref> the start date of the photosynthetically active season of coniferous evergreens in the model is ahead of the observed. We decreased the threshold of the temperature sum regulating the bud-break from 4 to 2°C in accordance to findings by
