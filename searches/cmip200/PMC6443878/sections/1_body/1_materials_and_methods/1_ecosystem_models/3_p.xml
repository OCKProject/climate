 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Minunno et al., 2019</xref>). In PREBAS, photosynthesis (GPP) and evapotranspiration are calculated using a light-use-efficiency approach linked to soil moisture and driven by daily environmental inputs of radiation, temperature, vapor pressure deficit, precipitation and ambient CO

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kalliokoski et al., 2018</xref>). GPP is allocated to mean-tree growth and respiration at an annual time step, and allocation of growth to different tree components is based on conservation of structural constraints, e.g., the pipe model (
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Valentine and Mäkelä, 2005</xref>). Tree mortality due to crowding is included in the model. The growth module updates canopy leaf area index which is used as input to the gas exchange module in the following year. To calculate NEE, PREBAS has been linked with the soil C model YASSO07 through annual litter inputs (

 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tuomi et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to weather data, PREBAS requires information on the initial state of the simulated forest, and forest management actions, including thinning, clearcut and regeneration, to obtain a realistic dynamic pattern of forest development. The relatively simple structure of the model allows us to apply it at a large regional scale and make simulations of C and water fluxes that are both climate and management sensitive. Here, we defined forest management on the basis of current management recommendations in Finland (

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Minunno et al., 2019</xref>). The simulations were carried out by linking PREBAS to information on soil fertility, stand basal area, mean height and mean diameter, derived from 16 m resolution multisource forest inventory data maps (

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">b</xref>). The forest resource maps were divided into 16 km grid cells. Within each grid cell, simulations were carried out for 50 forest classes with the highest proportional areas, accounting also for the remaining classes by distributing their area to these dominant classes. The forest classes represented different combinations of dominant tree species, age, basal area and mean height. Categories of soil fertility were herb-rich heath, mesic heath, sub-xeric heath, xeric heath, and poorer types (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cajander, 1949</xref>). To account for mineral and peat soil types, we used two sets of soil parameters, one describing typical mineral soil, and one for a soil layer with high soil water retention capacity (depth = 430 and 1000 mm, respectively), as PREBAS does not simulate organic soils as such. The simulated annual values for each class were aggregated to grid cell level based on 16 m resolution forest maps. Climate data from the nearest climate grid point were used for each 16 km forest simulation grid cell.
