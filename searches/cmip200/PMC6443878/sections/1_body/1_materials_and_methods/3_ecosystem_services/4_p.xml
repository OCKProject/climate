<p class="p">Current potential ES provision was estimated as the median values of the simulated biophysical variables for the reference period (1981â€“2010). The impact of climate change on ES provision was interpreted as future changes in simulated biophysical variables compared to reference period median values. Positive changes in GPP, stemwood growth and number of soil frost days are in our analysis associated with benefits for human society. Positive values of NEE represent a flux from the ecosystem to the atmosphere (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions), while negative values of NEE (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> removals) represent avoided CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing. Thus, in our analysis, positive changes in the simulated values of NEE are considered losses, and negative changes benefits to human society. Increasing frequencies of dry summer days are similarly considered losses. An increase in the length of the vegetation active period, however, may lead to both benefits and losses.
