<p class="p">For the regulation and maintenance section of the CICES classification, the key service studied was related to regulating climate through C sequestered by growing vegetation. The corresponding benefit to society was avoided CO

When the flux is from the atmosphere to the ecosystem, NEE is negative, and when the flux is from the ecosystem to the atmosphere, NEE is positive. In 2017, the Finnish total greenhouse gas emissions were 55.5 million metric tons CO

Altogether, the net sink of the land use, land use change, and forestry sector (LULUCF) was 20.4 million metric tons CO
