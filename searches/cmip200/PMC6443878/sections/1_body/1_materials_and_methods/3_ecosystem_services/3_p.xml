<p class="p">Risk of productivity losses related to summer drought, and decreasing opportunities for winter harvest on drained peatlands were considered as examples of regulating services. JSBACH simulations of the number of dry summer days, and soil frost days, were used for the climate impact projections. We used the length and the timing of the vegetation active period as proxies for both a regulating service (the maintenance of habitats), and a cultural service (recreational opportunities). The impact of climate change on the length (VAPlength, number of days) and timing of the vegetation active period (VAPstart, VAPend, day of year) was simulated with JSBACH and PREBAS.</p>
