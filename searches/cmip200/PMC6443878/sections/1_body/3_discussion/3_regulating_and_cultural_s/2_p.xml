<p class="p">In terms of regulating ES, this means that there is a positive impact on the reproduction and survival of birds, insects and other species that are dependent on forest vegetation activity. There might be negative impacts due to mismatch of animal production and food supply, or better match between insects and host plants and resulting damages that could alter ecosystem composition (
