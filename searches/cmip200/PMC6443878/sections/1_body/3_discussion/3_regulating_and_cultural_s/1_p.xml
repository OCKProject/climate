<p class="p">For regulating ES, earlier start of vegetation active period means earlier opportunities for birds, insects and other species, but is also linked to the risk for coincident occurrences of cold spells that may be detrimental. For cultural ES, climate warming is expected to lead to earlier opportunities for nature tourism linked to the coming of spring, such as bird watching and observing shoot growth, bud bursting and flowering. However, potential detrimental long-term impacts of climate change on species diversity and conservation are also well recognized (e.g.,

For provisioning and cultural ES, later end of vegetation may be associated with improved opportunities for the growth and picking of mushrooms and berries, although the success of these species is mostly regulated by local weather conditions.
