<p class="p">For the near decades, even in mid-century, the three emission levels (RCP) gave broadly similar projected temperature increase and change in precipitation on the annual and country-wide level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Different climate models, however, gave varying responses especially for seasonal changes. Extreme warming (&gt;5°C) was projected by some climate models by the end of the century for the high emission scenario.

We realize that important detailed information is lost in such an aggregation, especially concerning tradeoffs between ES, and the spatial distribution and balance of ES supply and demand (
