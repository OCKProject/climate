<p class="p">Regarding NEE, JSBACH and PREBAS models produced fairly different patterns especially under climate change â€“ PREBAS predicted more negative NEE values than JSBACH (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">MONIMET, 2017</xref>; Peltoniemi et al., unpublished results). We assume that the differences are caused by different approaches to describing tree growth and management in these models, JSBACH assuming steady-state conditions and PREBAS accounting for forest growth and management explicitly. The harvests lead to a drain of stemwood from the forest which reduces the amount of C entering the soil as coarse woody debris, and therefore reduces the rate of heterotroph respiration from the soil. In our presentation, the NEE projections aggregate results from these models with different assumptions concerning vegetation and forest management, and the variance of the results reflect uncertainties in process descriptions and parameterizations. Forests remain a C sink in our simulation results.
