<p class="p">Ecosystem services (ES) are defined as the contributions that ecosystems make to human wellbeing (e.g.,

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Daily and Matson, 2008</xref>). The ES concept has become widely used and serves to emphasize the dependency of human society’s welfare on natural ecosystems (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Costanza et al., 2017</xref>). A wide variety of ES are found in forests, which cover about 30% of global terrestrial area (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">FAO, 2018</xref>). Forests provide timber, and food, they conserve biodiversity, regulate water resources, and provide recreational opportunities (

 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saastamoinen et al., 2014</xref>). Forests are essential factors of the global carbon (C) cycle, with an important role in regulating atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO

 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shvidenko et al., 2005</xref>), comprising the circumpolar vegetation zone of high northern latitudes that covers one of the world’s largest biogeoclimatic areas (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brandt et al., 2013</xref>). The ES provided by boreal forests thus benefit human society both locally and on the global scale (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gauthier et al., 2015</xref>). Boreal forests account for about 20% of the global C sinks (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). Thereby boreal forests provide a climate regulating ES with bearing on climate change mitigation on the global level, although trade-offs are also recognized (
