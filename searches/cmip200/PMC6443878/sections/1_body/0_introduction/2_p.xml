<p class="p">Estimates of recent trends in above-ground biomass C indicate an increase for boreal forests (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). The stand and landscape level characteristics of the boreal forests of North America, Fennoscandia and Russia vary between the regions because of historical and current regional differences in natural disturbances and management practices (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuuluvainen and Gauthier, 2018</xref>). Statistics from two neighboring boreal countries show increasing trends in roundwood increment in Finland (

 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Skogsdata, 2018</xref>). The future rate of C uptake by forests depends on how ambient temperature, land use and resource management practices evolve (

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schaphoff et al., 2016</xref>), which may have significant consequences for future boreal forest ES. Management practices may interact with climate change with consequences for forest biodiversity (

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schaphoff et al. (2016)</xref> found that the impacts of climate change on Russia’s boreal forests are often superimposed by other environmental and societal changes, while 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kalliokoski et al. (2018)</xref> estimated likely increases in future forest productivity in Finland, although with a high uncertainty. Climate change may affect the occurrence and extent of natural disturbances, such as insect outbreaks and fire (

Earlier thermal growing season has been found to be associated with earlier onset of biospheric C uptake, whereas earlier termination of biospheric activity was associated to later termination of thermal growing season (

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pöyry et al., 2011</xref>). Less severe winter colds may promote the expansion of forest pests (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fält-Nardmann et al., 2018</xref>). Warmer winters may also have impacts on the possibilities for winter harvest on drained peatlands (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hökkä et al., 2016</xref>) and for winter recreation (
