<p id="Par11" class="p">Comparing runs with a climatologically deep thermocline against simulations with a shallow thermocline can provide insight into influence of the mean state on IOD properties and this also highlights their differing response to increasing greenhouse gases. Two smaller ensembles are created to contrast these differences and the simulations in these ensembles are selected based on their deviation from the mean. Runs in the deep ensemble exhibit a present-day climatological thermocline depth greater than one standard deviation from the multi-member ensemble mean (i.e., the right-most blue circles outside of the x-axis error bars in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Similarly, the shallow ensemble is comprised of runs with a present-day mean depth which is less than the ensemble mean minus one standard deviation (i.e., the left-most blue circles outside of the x-axis error bars in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Analysing these two smaller ensembles shows how the positive Bjerknes feedback assists in the present-day mean state. That is, the deep thermocline ensemble exhibits warmer (colder) SSTs in the eastern (western) equatorial IO and the mean zonal wind in the CEIO is more westerly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,e</xref>). The depth of the climatological thermocline along the equator extends further eastward in this ensemble, reaching the coast of Sumatra (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,f</xref>). Due to the warmer mean SSTs in the east, precipitation is larger over the EEIO, consistent with the wind and thermocline behaviour.
