<p id="Par10" class="p">A deeper present-day thermocline is associated with a larger change in IOD skewness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>), with future skewness generally becoming negative whilst present-day skewness is positive (i.e., compare red and blue circles in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). This shows that changes in IOD skewness may arise due to variations in mean thermocline depth and that the deeper the mean present-day thermocline, the larger the change from positive to negative IOD skewness. Simulations with a deep present-day mean thermocline tend to project a larger change in climatological thermocline depth as a deeper thermocline has more ‘room’ to shoal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). This highlights the importance of the present-day mean state in influencing the response of the tropical IO to a warmer climate. As the climatological thermocline becomes shallower, it becomes more sensitive to anomalous deepening which occurs during a negative IOD event. In contrast the sensitivity to a shoaling thermocline (i.e., a positive IOD) is reduced and therefore IOD skewness becomes more negative in a warmer climate. The change in the IO mean gradient displays a positive correlation with present-day thermocline depth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>), meaning simulations where the mean depth is deeper tend to have a larger change in the zonal west-minus-east SST gradient. Given that runs with a deeper present-day mean thermocline tend to shoal more in the mean state, this in turn reduces the rate of warming in the EEIO and therefore, the climatological zonal temperature gradient in the future becomes larger (more positive) with the WEIO warming faster than the EEIO.
