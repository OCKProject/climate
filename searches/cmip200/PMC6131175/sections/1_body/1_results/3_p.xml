<p id="Par8" class="p">It is clear from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> that the mean thermocline shoals in response to a warmer climate (e.g., compare blue and red circle values on the x-axis). This is due to the projected weakening of the Walker circulation which reduces the climatological westerlies over the CEIO and allows the mean EEIO thermocline to shoal

 </sup>. As such, there is a significant difference between the present-day and future IOD skewness and gradient (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b,c</xref>; compare values on y-axis). In the future period, the shallower climatological thermocline reduces the response of cold SSTAs to an anomalously shoaling thermocline during a positive event. This weakens the amplitude of positive IODs and thus positive IOD skewness is reduced. Similarly, the shoaling of the climatological thermocline in the east leads to a strengthened (more positive) IO mean gradient as there is little change in mean thermocline depth in the west. In CESM-LE, the response of the EEIO thermocline to increasing greenhouse gases is approximately ten times greater than that over the western IO (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) and faster (slower) warming over the western (eastern) IO occurs. Previous studies have used the slope (or gradient) of the thermocline across the tropical IO

 </sup>, however in this analysis, we have used EEIO thermocline depth as the IOD is dominated by its eastern pole. Using the climatological thermocline slope does not affect the results considerably (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Given that the EEIO dominates the IOD, and that the response to increasing greenhouse gases is also largely over the east, we focus on this region. It is clear from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> that despite the runs being identical in physics and parameterisation, internal climate variability is able to influence the mean state and through this, properties of the IOD.
