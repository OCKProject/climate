 </sup>. As mentioned previously, this feedback involves the SSTA response to thermocline depth anomalies, the anomalous wind response to SSTAs, and the thermocline response to wind anomalies. The present-day SSTA response to thermocline depth anomalies (i.e., the thermocline feedback) shows a weak negative correlation with the EEIO mean thermocline depth that is significant at the 90% confidence level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>). This suggests that simulations with a deeper present-day mean thermocline tend to have a weaker thermocline feedback. In the future period, this relationship strengthens due to the shoaling of the mean thermocline in response to a warmer climate, which increases the sensitivity of SSTs to thermocline depth anomalies

 </sup>. The anomalous wind response to SSTAs shows no relationship with mean thermocline depth in both the present-day and future periods, suggesting that this component of the Bjerknes feedback is not influenced by the mean thermocline depth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>). However there is a significant positive relationship (99% confidence level) between the thermocline response to zonal wind anomalies and the mean thermocline depth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c</xref>). These positive correlations imply that when the mean thermocline depth is deeper, the anomalous thermocline response to wind anomalies tends to be stronger. For the anomalous wind response to SSTAs, and the anomalous thermocline response to wind anomalies, the multi-member ensemble means show a weakening in the future. In a warmer climate, the stratification of the lower atmosphere increases
