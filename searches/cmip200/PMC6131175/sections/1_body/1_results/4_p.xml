<p id="Par9" class="p">The spread of IOD properties in the future simulations (e.g., Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, red circles) indicates that internal climate variability is able to generate variations in the IOD’s response to increasing greenhouse gases. This is important for understanding climate projections as future changes may be influenced by internal variability. To highlight the influence of the present-day mean state on projections of IOD properties, we show the relationship between the present-day climatological thermocline depth and the future-minus-present-day change in IOD properties (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). When the present-day climatological thermocline depth is deeper, the change in IOD amplitude tends to be smaller or even negative but overall, the ensemble mean change in amplitude is close to zero (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). This may be caused by the different response of the WEIO and EEIO to a warmer climate with the CESM-LE simulated EEIO (WEIO) SST exhibiting an increase (decrease) in amplitude change
