<p id="Par7" class="p">The Bjerknes feedback also causes positive IOD events to be relatively larger in amplitude than negative IODs (i.e., positive IOD skewness). SSTs respond more strongly to an anomalously shoaling thermocline when the climatological thermocline is deep and hence simulations with a deeper mean thermocline tend to exhibit more positive IOD skewness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). The IO mean gradient (i.e., the zonal mean SST gradient) displays a significant negative correlation with climatological thermocline depth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). A climatologically deeper EEIO thermocline is associated with warmer mean SSTs in the east and therefore the west-minus-east zonal SST gradient tends to be weaker. This behaviour is associated with a stronger (i.e., more westerly) climatological zonal wind along the equator as these winds act to deepen the thermocline in the east, reducing the thermocline slope and thereby weakening the IO mean gradient.
