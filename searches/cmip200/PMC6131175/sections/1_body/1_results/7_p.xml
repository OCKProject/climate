<p id="Par12" class="p">This mean state with a deeper EEIO thermocline is more favourable for the growth of positive IOD events. When a positive (negative) IOD event occurs, it weakens (strengthens) the mean westerly winds which allows the climatologically warm SSTs in the east to be advected westward (eastward) whilst also shoaling (deepening) the EEIO thermocline. Therefore, a mean state similar to that of the deep ensemble allows positive IODs to grow larger in amplitude as the EEIO thermocline can shoal more when the climatological westerlies are weakened. For the shallow thermocline ensemble, the response during a positive IOD is weaker. Relatively colder mean SSTs in the EEIO and more easterly (or less westerly) mean winds over the CEIO can be observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref>), making it more difficult to generate a strong response during a positive IOD event. The differences between the two ensembles are clearly shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e,f</xref>. Using these same runs from the present-day ensembles to compare the future climatology highlights the increased response of models with a deep present-day mean thermocline. In a warmer climate, the deep and shallow ensembles show similar mean SSTs, winds, thermocline, and rainfall (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) as the climatological thermocline in the deep ensemble tends to shoal more in response to increasing greenhouse gases. Given this stronger response and increased similarity between the two ensembles, the deep-minus-shallow ensemble difference is insignificant over most of the tropical IO at the 90% confidence interval (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4e,f</xref>, and
