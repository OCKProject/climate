<p id="Par6" class="p">In CESM-LE, the mean EEIO thermocline depth shows a strong and significant relationship with IOD properties such as amplitude (i.e., standard deviation), skewness, and the mean zonal SST gradient (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This significant correlation occurs for both the present-day (blue circles) and future simulations (red circles). When the climatological thermocline is deeper, IOD amplitude tends to be stronger (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) and its skewness is more positive (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>), resulting in a strong positive correlation. The mean depth of the thermocline influences IOD amplitude and skewness through the positive Bjerknes feedback which involves the SST response to the thermocline anomalies, the wind response to SSTAs, and the thermocline response to wind anomalies

 </sup>. During a positive IOD, the thermocline in the EEIO shoals, bringing cold deep water closer to the surface which reinforces the cold SSTA and the basin-wide zonal temperature gradient. The stronger zonal temperature gradient in turn strengthens the easterly wind anomalies over the central equatorial IO (CEIO; 5°S-5°N, 70°E-90°E), deepening the thermocline in the WEIO whilst shoaling it in the EEIO. Therefore, in simulations where the mean EEIO thermocline is deep, anomalous shoaling of the thermocline is larger and reinforced through the Bjerknes feedback, resulting in a greater IOD amplitude.
