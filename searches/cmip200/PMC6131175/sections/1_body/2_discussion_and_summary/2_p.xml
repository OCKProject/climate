<p id="Par15" class="p">As each ensemble member differs only in its initial condition, where a small round-off error is applied, any difference between ensemble members arises from internal climate variability. Over the EEIO, this emerges as small differences in climatological thermocline depth and in the present-day period the difference in depth between the shallowest and deepest simulations is approximately four metres (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Although the spread amongst the thirty-five simulations is relatively small, the variations in mean thermocline depth are enough to generate significant correlations with IOD amplitude, skewness, and the mean zonal SST gradient. This highlights the importance of the mean state and the Bjerknes feedback for the IOD.
