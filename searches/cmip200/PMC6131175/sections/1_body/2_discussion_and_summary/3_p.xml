<p id="Par16" class="p">These relationships are important for projections of IOD properties and in CESM-LE the present-day climatological thermocline depth is significantly correlated with changes in IOD amplitude and skewness. It has been suggested that there is no relationship between the change in IOD amplitude and the change in the mean state of the tropical IO and this is true when examining the whole tropical basin

 </sup>. However, in observations the IOD is dominated by the EEIO region where SST variance is largest

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup> and CESM-LE also exhibits this behaviour. Over the EEIO, the climatological thermocline shoals considerably more than the WEIO with the multi-member ensemble median change of −8.3 metres in the east compared to a median deepening of 0.8 metres in the west (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Therefore, by focusing on the EEIO, we are able to show that internal variability of the mean EEIO state and its response to a warmer climate can influence IOD properties.
