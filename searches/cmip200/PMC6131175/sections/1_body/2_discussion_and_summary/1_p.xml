<p id="Par14" class="p">The influence of the mean thermocline state on IOD properties is clearly evident in the strong correlations exhibited in CESM-LE but it is important to remember that there may be biases in the model. Compared to observations, the climatological thermocline slope in CESM-LE is opposite, with the EEIO thermocline depth being considerably shallower than the WEIO region (TableÂ

 </sup>. This bias is not unique to CESM-LE and is common amongst CMIP3 and CMIP5 models

 </sup>. As a result, the mean easterly winds and the zonal SST gradient are overly strong in CESM-LE and thus the Bjerknes feedback is also too strong. This causes the simulated IOD amplitude to be considerably larger than observations. Nevertheless, this bias is consistent amongst all thirty-five runs examined as the parameterisations and physics in each simulation are identical.
