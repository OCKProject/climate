 </sup>. During the positive phase of the IOD, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are anomalously warm in the western equatorial IO (WEIO) and cold in the eastern equatorial IO (EEIO). Opposite anomalies occur during the negative phase, with cooler than normal SSTs in the WEIO and warm SSTs in the EEIO region. These SST anomalies (SSTAs) alter the atmospheric circulation over the tropical IO, impacting several countries surrounding the basin. The consequences of an IOD event were most widely felt in 1997 when an extreme positive IOD occurred

 </sup> typically occur during positive phases of the IOD. Negative IODs impact these countries in an opposite manner (i.e., East Africa experiences drier than normal conditions whilst Australia and Indonesia are wetter), but the impacts from these events tend to be relatively weaker compared to positive IODs. This is caused by the positive skewness of the IOD where positive events tend to be stronger in amplitude than negative events
