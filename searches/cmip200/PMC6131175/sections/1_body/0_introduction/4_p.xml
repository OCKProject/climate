<p id="Par5" class="p">The influence of internal climate variability on the IOD and its properties has not been widely studied although a recent paper has examined the role of internal climate variability in the IOD’s response to a warmer climate

 </sup>. It is suggested that the uncertainty in IOD amplitude change due to internal variability may account for up to 50% of the inter-model uncertainty in CMIP5. However, there appears to be no correlation between IOD amplitude variability and mean state change in the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE)

 </sup>. Here, we examine the influence of internal climate variability on properties of the IOD through variations in the mean state of the tropical IO. We show instead that small differences in the mean thermocline depth, which arise due to internal climate variability, can influence projected changes in IOD properties.
