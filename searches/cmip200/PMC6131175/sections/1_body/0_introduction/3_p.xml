<p id="Par4" class="p">Analysis of individual CGCMs or multi-model ensembles does not account for internal climate variability as each model has its own internal variability and biases. To understand and capture internal climate variability, a single CGCM with an ensemble of simulations with the same external forcings must be used. This differs from perturbed physics ensembles where parameters are varied in a model which in turn generates different responses to the climate system. Projects involving large ensembles have been performed previously and this has allowed studies in climate extremes, trends, and uncertainty in projections
