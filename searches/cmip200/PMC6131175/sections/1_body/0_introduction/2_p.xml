<p id="Par3" class="p">The severe and widespread impacts of the IOD highlights the importance of understanding its response to a warmer climate and there have been several studies examining this response using either a single coupled general circulation model (CGCM) or a multi-model ensemble

 </sup>. Models partaking in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) tend to exhibit a positive IOD-like warming pattern over the tropical IO, with weaker (stronger) warming in the EEIO (WEIO) and an easterly wind trend
