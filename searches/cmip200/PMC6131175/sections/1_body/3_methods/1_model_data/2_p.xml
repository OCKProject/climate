<p id="Par18" class="p">For this analysis, ocean and atmosphere variables from thirty-five simulations are utilised. These variables include; SST, thermocline depth (defined as the depth of the maximum vertical gradient), zonal wind stress, precipitation, and mean sea level pressure. Present-day (Future) data are restricted to the 1920 to 1999 (2020 to 2099) period and all variables have been regridded to a 1° by 1° grid. Using a different window size (e.g., 1920 to 1969 and 2050 to 2099) or shifting the window location (e.g., using periods 1930 to 1979 and 2030 to 2079) does not significantly alter the results of this analysis. The IOD is defined by the Dipole Mode Index
