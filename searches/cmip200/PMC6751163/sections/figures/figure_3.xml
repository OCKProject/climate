  <p class="p">The accumulated terrestrial carbon sink from 1981 to 2016, after subtracting the baseline sink of 62.1 Pg C due to long-term changes (legacy effects). Through numerical experiments, the variations of the accumulated sink with time due to the various drivers are calculated, showing that CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization (without LAI changes), LAI, nitrogen deposition, and climate are responsible for the sinks of 44.6, 11.7, 1.1, and −27.1 Pg C over this period, respectively. These sinks contribute 47.0%, 12.4%, 1.1%, and −28.6% to the total accumulated residual land sink (95 ± 5 Pg C) over this period, respectively. For example, the accumulated CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> enhancement is calculated by holding other drivers at the baseline, while changing CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> according to the global mean CO
