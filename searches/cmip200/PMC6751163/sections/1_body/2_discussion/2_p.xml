<p id="Par16" class="p">In conclusion, the results of this study show the value of assimilating observed LAI over the last three decades to quantify the land carbon sink and separate the effect of increasing LAI alone vs. the effects of changes in environmental drivers alone. It should be kept in mind, however, that the observed increase of LAI also results from environmental drivers as well as of land use and land management.</p>
