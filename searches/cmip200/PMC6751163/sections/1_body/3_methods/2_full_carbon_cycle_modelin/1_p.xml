 </sup>, it stratifies the biomass carbon stock into four pools (leaf, stem, coarse root, and fine root pools) and the soil carbon stock into nine pools (surface structural litter, surface metabolic litter, soil structural litter, soil metabolic litter, coarse woody litter, surface microbe, soil microbe, slow, and passive carbon pools). These carbon pools are initialized in the following way. The model first calculates NPP in 1901 using N deposition and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in 1901, a random year of climate data selected in the period from 1901 to 1910, seasonally variable LAI averaged over the 1982–1986 period, and default C:N ratios for all carbon pools. The nine soil and four biomass carbon pools are then estimated under the assumption that the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems was in dynamic equilibrium in 1901. With this assumption, all carbon pools are determined by solving a set of equations describing the dynamics of carbon pools

 </sup>. For the period from 1901 to 1980, the model is run using historical data of N deposition, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and climate, and the average LAI during 1982 to 1986. Due to lack of data, we assume that LAI in 1982–1986 represents that in 1901–1981. If LAI increased in this period, NPP in 1901–1910 would be overestimated, leading to larger soil carbon pools in 1901 and smaller NEP in 1981–2016. To address this issue, we conducted a set of simulations by extending the LAI time series to 1901 according to atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration with the rate of LAI change with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> determined using 1981–2016 data. We find that the enhancement of the land sink due to LAI change in 1981–2016 decreases from 12.4% to 10.5% relative to the accumulated sink in the same period when the possible LAI increase from 1901 to 1981 is considered. This decrease is due to higher accumulated NEP by 6.8 Pg C during 1981–2016, resulting from lower initial soil carbon pools at 1901 when LAI is smaller than our simulations without considering LAI change over 1901–1981. This set of simulations suggests that the impact of possible LAI changes prior to 1981 on the role of LAI after 1981 is within a few percent and does not affect our conclusion on the significance of LAI increase after 1981 in enhancing the land sink. Although extrapolating LAI according to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration is overly simplistic, it may be considered as setting the upper bound of the possible error due to LAI changes prior to 1981, because climate change could have been negative on plant growth and LAI.
