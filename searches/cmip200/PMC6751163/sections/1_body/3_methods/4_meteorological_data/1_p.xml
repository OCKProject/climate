<p id="Par24" class="p">Meteorological data required to force the BEPS model include daily maximum and minimum temperatures, downward solar radiation, relative humidity, and precipitation. These data are interpolated from the 0.5° × 0.5° CRUNCEP V8.0 dataset, which is a combination of CRU monthly climatology and 6 hourly NCEP reanalysis meteorological data

 </sup>. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures, downward solar radiation, and precipitation are directly retrieved from the CRUNCEP V8.0 dataset. Relative humidity is calculated from temperatures, specific humidity, and pressure from the CRUNCEP V8.0 dataset. The 0.5° × 0.5° meteorological data are interpolated into 0.072727° × 0.072727° resolution using a bilinear interpolation method. These data are the same as those used by the TRENDY models.
