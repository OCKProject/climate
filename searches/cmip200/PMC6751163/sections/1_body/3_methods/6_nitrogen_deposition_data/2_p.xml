<p id="Par27" class="p">The N deposition dataset used in this study is compared with that used by TRENDY models (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). These two datasets are similar before 1990, as both are based on measurements, but the increasing trends after 1990 are different, because the data used by the models are based on linear extrapolation from 1990 to 2050, at which the nitrogen deposition is estimated based on projected anthropogenic sources and other assumptions

Over the 1981–2016 period, the total N deposition is 301 Tg N in our study, whereas it is 403 Tg N in TRENDY. The difference could be due to the overall decrease in N deposition in North America and other regions in this period.
