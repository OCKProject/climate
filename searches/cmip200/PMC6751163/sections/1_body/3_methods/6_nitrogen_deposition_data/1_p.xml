 </sup>. For the years from 2010 to 2016, nitrogen data are extrapolated using the estimated nitrogen data over the period from 2000 to 2009. For the period from 1901 to 1959, nitrogen data are extrapolated based on the change rates of nitrogen deposition over the period from 1960 to 1969. The 0.5° × 0.5° nitrogen deposition data are interpolated into the 0.072727° × 0.072727° resolution using a bilinear interpolation method.
