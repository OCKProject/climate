The modeled accumulated sink by BEPS is also very close to the accumulated RLS, whereas estimates from the 15 prognostic models differ by a wide range. The results of these comparisons show that BEPS as a diagnostic model driven by remote-sensing data can do a similar or better job than fully prognostic models in simulating the past land sink, because vegetation structural changes observed by satellites provide a critical constraint to the sink estimation. We do not include other diagnostic models in these comparisons

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup>, because BEPS so far may be the only process-based diagnostic model that calculates the full carbon cycle at the global scale for multiple decades. With the computation of the land sink close to the RLS, BEPS can then be used to attribute the sink to the various drivers including vegetation structural change.
