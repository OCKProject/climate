<p id="Par11" class="p">The time-varying maps of satellite LAI constrain the effect of vegetation structural change on the land sink since 1981. However, the land sink in recent decades results from the accumulated changes in climate, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, nitrogen deposition, and land use since the preindustrial period that occurred before 1981. From 1981 to 2016, global land ecosystems absorbed 95 ± 5 Pg C from the atmosphere (i.e., accumulated NEP), which is 32.8 Pg C larger than the baseline (62.1 Pg C) defined by NEP simulated assuming without changes of these drivers after 1981 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Several conditions were set for simulating the baseline. First, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and nitrogen deposition were kept at the 1981 levels; second, LAI was taken as the mean value in 1982–1986; and third, meteorology in a year between 1981 and 2016 is randomly taken from meteorology in a year within the 1971–1979 period (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>), so that no climate trend exists over the 1981–2016 period. Under the baseline conditions, the land sink over the period from 1981 to 2016 is thus caused only by the legacy of changes in the drivers prior to 1981, given the residence time of carbon in ecosystems. The mean legacy effect over 1981–2016 was larger in forests, especially in evergreen broadleaf forests over tropical regions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). We therefore refer to the sink increase from the mean legacy effect as the sink enhancement due to changes of the drivers after 1981.
