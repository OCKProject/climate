<p id="Par8" class="p">A global LAI time series from 1981 to 2016 at 8 km resolution and 16-day (1981–2000) and 8-day (2001–2016) intervals was produced using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data with the GLOBMAP algorithm

 </sup>. The global distribution of the temporal trend of LAI over this period is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. About 74.2% of the land surface shows an increasing trend, among which 52.7% is significant at 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.05 level (two-tailed). Globally, the increase in the maximum LAI in the peak growing season is about twice as large as that in the annual mean, suggesting that growing season lengthening is not the main factor explaining the greening trend. This general increase in LAI resulted from the combined effects of various drivers including CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, climate, and nitrogen deposition over the same period, and therefore provides a new base for separating the effects of these drivers on vegetation structure and growth. The focus of this study is on the increase of LAI on plant growth and the land carbon sink. Considering the uncertainty in the temporal trend of this LAI time series, we used two other LAI products: GLASS LAI
