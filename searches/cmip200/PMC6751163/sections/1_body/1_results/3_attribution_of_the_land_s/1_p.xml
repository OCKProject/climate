<p id="Par12" class="p">The increase in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration is modeled to be the dominant diver for the land sink enhancement during the 1981–2016 period. The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration increase after 1981 alone enhanced the global land sink by 44.6 Pg C accounting for 47.0% of the total accumulated sink enhancement after 1981 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The simulated global total net primary productivity (NPP) increased by 11.6% with the increase of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration from 340.13 p.p.m. in 1981 to 404.20 p.p.m. in 2016, whereas climate, LAI, and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> deposition remain at baseline values. The sensitivity of simulated total NPP in the northern hemisphere to atmospheric CO

 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-factor is about 6.1% smaller than the average value of prognostic models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5)

 </sup>. Our 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-factor excludes the effects of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization on LAI, whereas CMIP5 models lump vegetation LAI responses to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase into the 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-factor. If the influence of LAI change is included in our 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-factor calculation, it would be 31.8%/100 p.p.m. for the northern hemisphere, whereas the global average value is 27.0%, because LAI increased much less in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere. Both BEPS and CMIP5 models include the influences of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase on stomatal conductance affecting photosynthesis, transpiration, and soil moisture. Our 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-factor is considerably larger than the values inferred from remote-sensing NPP models
