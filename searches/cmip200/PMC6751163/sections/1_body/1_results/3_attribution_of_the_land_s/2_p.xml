<p id="Par13" class="p">The impacts of other drivers on the accumulated sink shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> are also calculated by changing one driver at a time, while holding other drivers at the baseline level. The accumulated global sink enhancement due to vegetation structure (LAI) change over the 1981–2016 period is 11.7 Pg C, which is 12.4% of the total sink or 35.7% of the enhanced sink in the same period. Over this period, global average LAI increased from 1.6 to 1.7, enhancing GPP by 1.2% and NEP by 0.3% relative to GPP. The spatial distribution of NEP enhancement (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>) is similar to that of the LAI trend shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, where positive trends of LAI induced sinks, whereas negative trends caused sources, suggesting that LAI might have acted as a surrogate for the impacts of changes in other factors such as soil moisture and temperature. As most areas show positive trends, the overall effect of the vegetation structural change is a large sink enhancement. Changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition made global land ecosystems sequester 1.1 Pg C more carbon during the 1981–2016 period than the baseline (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Nitrogen deposition contributed to 1.1% of the total accumulated sink since 1981. Based on global nitrogen deposition data, global total nitrogen deposition increased from 42.3 Tg N per year in 1981 to 58.9 Tg N per year in 2016 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>), with a total additional cumulative input of 0.30 Pg N into land ecosystems above the 1981 baseline. Our simulated carbon sink enhancement per unit of deposited nitrogen is 3.7 g C/g N, which is slightly lower than the range of 4.3–4.8 g C/g N by previous global simulations

 </sup>. The NEP enhancement during the 1981–2016 period by nitrogen deposition mainly occurred in Asia and in part of Europe, where nitrogen deposition continuously increased (Supplementary Fig.
