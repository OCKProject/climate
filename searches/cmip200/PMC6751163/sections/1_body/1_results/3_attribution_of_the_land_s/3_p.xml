<p id="Par14" class="p">Globally, climate change weakened the land sink during the 1981–2016 period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), when it’s effect on LAI, such as longer growing season, is excluded. Climate change induced an accumulated GPP reduction of 37.6 Pg C, whereas the accumulated decrease of ecosystem respiration was 10.5 Pg C during the 1981–2016 period. Consequently, the climate change caused a net reduction of 27.1 Pg C (−28.6%) in the accumulated sink enhancement since 1981. The decrease of the land sink due to climate change occurred almost in all regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). The sum of the effects of changes in LAI, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, nitrogen deposition, and climate mainly enhanced carbon sink in Eurasia, southeastern China, eastern North America, central Africa, and southeast Asia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>). The dominant driver affecting the land sink varies spatially (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11</xref>). Climate had the most dominant-negative impact on the accumulated carbon sink in 14.2% of the total vegetated area of the globe. LAI is the dominant-positive driver for 43.6% of the area, whereas it is negative for 4.6% of the area. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and nitrogen deposition are both positive, dominant factors over 36.4% and 0.2% of the area, respectively.
