<p id="Par4" class="p">With human’s perturbation to the climate system through greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and land-use change, the terrestrial carbon cycle has been greatly altered since preindustrial time

 </sup>. In addition to direct effects of these drivers on the carbon cycle, they have also induced changes in vegetation structure, i.e., leaf area index (LAI), defined as one half the total leaf area per unit ground surface area

 </sup>, which in turn also changes the carbon cycle. This feedback of vegetation LAI to the carbon cycle has not yet been systematically studied, although the increase in LAI over the last several decades has been found to be significant and dubbed global greening.
