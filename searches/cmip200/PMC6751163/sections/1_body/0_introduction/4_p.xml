<p id="Par6" class="p">Reliable satellite measurements of LAI are available to assess vegetation changes at the global scale since 1981. This source of information is underutilized in constraining the estimation of the terrestrial carbon sink and closing the global carbon budget, although many studies showed the usefulness of LAI products in optimizing several ecosystem parameters

 </sup>, diagnostic models that assimilate remotely sensed vegetation structural information to simulate physical, biological, and ecological processes in vegetation are effective tools to estimate the impact of LAI changes on the carbon cycle. In this study, we use a model of this type, which is named Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS)

 </sup>. BEPS mechanistically includes the impacts of various drivers on gross primary productivity (GPP) (climate, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and nitrogen deposition) and assimilates vegetation structure (LAI) satellite data. It differs from light-use efficiency (LUE) models, which estimate GPP based on radiation absorbed by the canopy and prescribed LUE functions that may or may not include CO

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup>. BEPS also simulates the dynamics of carbon pools beyond GPP and uses a spin-up procedure to prescribe soil carbon pools for estimating autotrophic respiration (AR) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) (see Methods). It is therefore a diagnostic process model for estimating the full carbon cycle using remote-sensing data and suitable for ascribing land carbon sinks to the various drivers.
