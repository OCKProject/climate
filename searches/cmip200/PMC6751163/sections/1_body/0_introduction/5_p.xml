<p id="Par7" class="p">Based on three LAI time series derived from satellite data, we find that vegetation structural change reflected by the trend of LAI contributed 12.4% to the accumulated total terrestrial carbon sink (95 ± 5 Pg C) from 1981 to 2016. This is small, but significant, compared with the contributions of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization (+47.0%) and climate change (−28.6%) in the same period. This finding suggests the importance in tracking this vegetation structural parameter using satellite data in global carbon cycle research. Quantifying this separate effect of vegetation structural change on the land sink helps attribute the sink to the various drivers including CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, climate change, and nitrogen deposition, and may also help rectify some differences among prognostic models.
