<p id="Par20" class="p">The TCRE framework is a robust and highly useful concept, especially when applied to events that are considered as main contributors to the perception of climate change and to mitigation and adaptation responses [e.g.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>
 </sup>]. It remains a powerful tool in communicating with the general public about how the climate system will respond to further anthropogenic carbon emissions. Our results have extended the generalized TCRE framework from annual and seasonal trends to the increase in heat exposure and its potential socioeconomic impacts. This is the first study to show that the characteristics of heat periods can be robustly linked to cumulative CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions as well as to international climate policy targets. We provide new information that can attribute country-scale climate impacts directly to global cumulative CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. Using both 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and RCP scenarios, we have also highlighted that adding non-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing modifies the amplitude of the transient response of heat exposure, but does not alter its linear relationship with CCE. Furthermore, we have related the loss of labour productivity from increasing heat exposure directly to anthropogenic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. We have shown that quantifying the link between CCE and economic and health impacts related to heat exposure is not only possible, but can be an important way to pinpoint impacts at regional scale and incentivize policy-makers to implement appropriate mitigation measures. This work could also be extended to numerous other indicators of extreme weather conditions and related impacts on societies and the economy.
