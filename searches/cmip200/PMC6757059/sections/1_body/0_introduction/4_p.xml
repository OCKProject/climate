 </sup> to estimate how labour productivity loss due to heat exposure can be linked to CCE. We express productivity loss as a relative extra annual loss of total GDP in addition to the annual loss that could already have been experienced during the pre-industrial period. This indicator is assessed for economic sectors that are considered as vulnerable to heat exposure: agriculture, mining and quarrying, manufacturing and construction sectors

 </sup>. For future scenarios, we assume that socioeconomic conditions do not vary from current conditions (i.e. 2017) over the entire study period. This approach therefore allows us to quantify an upper bound of the increase in labour productivity loss that would occur in the absence of socioeconomic adaptation to changing climate conditions.
