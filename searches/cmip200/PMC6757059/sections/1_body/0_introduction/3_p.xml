<p id="Par4" class="p">We use here a simplified version of the WBGT, which is calculated using average solar irradiation and wind speeds. This version is easy to reproduce from climate model outputs

 </sup>. From this indicator, we then define the annual total heat exposure as the integral of daily WBGT values in a year above six pre-defined thresholds, labelled as light, medium, strong, very strong, extreme and deadly (see Methods). Finally, we quantify the response of heat exposure to CCE in eight CMIP5 Earth system models (ESMs, i.e. models which include a dynamic carbon cycle
