<p id="Par2" class="p">Excessive heat exposure has many potential socioeconomic impacts, including health effects, loss of labour productivity, higher death rates and higher energy demand [e.g.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>]. Previous analyses have developed relationships between heat exposure thresholds and health recommendations with respect to recommended rest time during labour

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. In these studies, it was found that above a given level of heat exposure, workers need to increase the amount of rest during working hours by amounts ranging from 10 to 40 minutes per hour of active work

 </sup>. Though workers from different economic sectors and countries are impacted differently, these health guidelines nevertheless indicate the potential for labour productivity loss with increasing exposure to extreme heat conditions. In 2017, observations show that 153 billion hours of labour were lost worldwide as a result of heat exposure, which represents an increase of 62 billion hours lost relative to the year 2000

 </sup>. Given the importance of heat exposure as a driver of socioeconomic impacts, some recent analyses have suggested that maximum temperature values could scale linearly with cumulative CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (CCE) [e.g.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>]. Here, we assess to what extent cumulative CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions are linked to increased extreme heat exposure and resulting labour productivity loss across future climate change scenarios.
