<p id="Par13" class="p">In this study, we have estimated a quantitative link between cumulative CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions and potential socioeconomic impacts resulting from changing extreme weather conditions. As such, we are able to quantify the causal relationship between units of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> that we emit and the effect of increasing heat exposure on labour productivity loss in vulnerable economic sectors based on health recommendations.
