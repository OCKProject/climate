<p id="Par14" class="p">In our analysis, we used a simplified version of the WBGT indicator, though our projections of WBGT are similar to those of other studies who have used a more complex version of the indicator [e.g.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>]. Given that temperature and humidity are the main components of the WBGT that change over time with climate change, the assumption of unchanging (average) solar radiation and wind speed does not have a large influence on our results. Furthermore, as the findings of our study are based on the difference over time relative to pre-industrial conditions (rather than on absolute values at particular points in time), the use of a simplified indicator is a reasonable approximation that nevertheless allows us to produce relevant results.
