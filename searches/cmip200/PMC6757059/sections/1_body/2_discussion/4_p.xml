<p id="Par16" class="p">Another important assumption of our study is that socioeconomic conditions remain static at present-day values. Of course in the real world, socioeconomic conditions continuously evolve over time, and such changes have the potential to either amplify or moderate the economic impacts of climate change. In this sense, our analysis should be interpreted as a “no-adaptation” case, that excludes proactive socioeconomic changes that might decrease the overall impact of increased heat exposure. For example, societies could find ways to adapt to increasing heat exposure by redistributing the workforce within different economic sectors or shifting working hours to seasons or times of day when heat exposure is lower. In a similar manner, we have assumed that the labour output elasticity of all vulnerable sectors is equal to 1, meaning that we assume working hours are lost in direct proportion to elevated heat exposure, and again are not counterbalanced by any short-term adaptation measures [similar to Kjellstrom

 </sup>. These studies estimated an annual loss of 2 to 3% of total GDP at global scale under the RCP8.5 scenario in 2100, which is smaller than our estimates, indicating that there is some potential for adaptation in labour practices to decrease the economic impacts that would be expected without such measures.
