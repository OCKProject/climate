<p id="Par19" class="p">Similarly to the labour productivity loss that we assessed, the number of productive days lost per year (i.e. the days for which it is supposed to be physically impossible to work) exhibit a clear link to income classes: the lower the income class, the higher the number of days lost (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>). However, the number of days lost computed for low-income countries is (only) 3 to 4 times higher than for high-income countries (compared to a factor of 9 higher for the labour productivity loss), meaning that the fraction of output generated by vulnerable sectors within a country has an influence on our indicator of productivity loss. Indeed, low-income countries generate 73% of their output in vulnerable sectors, unlike higher-income countries (54, 41 and 30%, respectively of the income class)
