<p id="Par15" class="p">It is worth noting that we have not applied any bias correction to the climate model data that we have used to calculate the WBGT indicators. Though this approach is consistent with other studies that have quantified the response of different climate variables to cumulative emissions [e.g.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>], we acknowledge that bias correction is a standard approach for impact studies, and that our study is therefore limited as an assessment of the absolute impacts on labour productivity. However, our primary intent is to calculate a socioeconomic impact per additional emission of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and we suggest that this calculation has less sensitivity to bias correction as compared to an estimate of the total impact at a given level of climate change. Furthermore, there are several practical reasons why we consider this to be a reasonable approach. First, corrections to both temperature and humidity data can produce results that are physically inconsistent, and can alter the variability of the modelled time series; as a result, we prefer to use the uncorrected data so as to maintain a clean estimate of modelled change per unit of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. In addition, a full bias correction would also require considering model-specific carbon cycle biases that would need to be corrected to account for differences between simulated and observed historical CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. This is a non-trivial task that has not yet been tackled in the literature.
