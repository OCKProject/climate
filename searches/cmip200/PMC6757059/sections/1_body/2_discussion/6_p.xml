<p id="Par18" class="p">Another point worth noting is that in our analysis of labour productivity loss, spatial differences of climate conditions and distribution of population are not considered within a country, but are rather averaged for each country. Indeed, statistics of workforce, economic sectors and GDP are only available at a country level

 </sup>. In many cases, this assumption does not have a large bearing on our results: for example, some of the largest countries with uneven population distribution, such as Russia and Canada, are also only marginally affected by productivity loss given their colder climate conditions. Some other large countries such as Brazil and Australia are substantially affected by productivity loss due to the increase in heat exposure, but in these cases the evolution of climate conditions is quite similar over the entire country. The two instances where the effect of within-country population distributions may be important are: (i) countries such as the United States, which span a range of climate changes, have the potential to be sensitive to the distribution of population within the country, though, the changes we find in our study for the United States (Fig.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>, which gives us some confidence that our results are not overly biased by assuming a uniform population and therefore impact distribution within countries; and (ii) we have not considered the distribution of population among urban vs rural areas within a country. It is possible that impacts on productivity loss might be greater in urban areas than what we have estimated based on average national values. However, it is also the case that access to air conditioning is more common in urban workplaces, where the majority of workers do their job indoors.
