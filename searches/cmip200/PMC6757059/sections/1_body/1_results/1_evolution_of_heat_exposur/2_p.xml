<p id="Par7" class="p">Regional heat exposure increases are larger in equatorial regions compared to subtropical and temperate regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Despite the polar amplification of temperature increase, lower temperatures in high-latitude regions and higher humidity in the tropics lead to larger increases in heat exposure in tropical regions. Due to the combination of high temperature and high humidity, some areas experience more than 300 K-days of increase in total heat exposure (above the light threshold) at the time that global temperature reaches 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). This highlights the unequal distribution of climate change impacts across the globe, as well as the potential for substantial regional heat exposure impacts in the near future. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> also shows the response of regional annual total heat exposure to CCE over six individually aggregated regions defined in the IPCC Special Report on Extreme Events (SREX, see Supplementary Table

 </sup>. In those regions with a sufficiently robust signal such as South-East Asia, India or the Eastern Central part of North America, the regional changes in heat exposure are significantly linear with respect to increasing CCE.
