<p id="Par8" class="p">The spatial pattern of the increase in annual total heat exposure remains robust across all scenarios (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2a,b</xref>). However, the three scenarios differ in the amplitude of changes: both RCP scenarios show an amplification of regional heat exposure in low latitudes for the same global temperature increase, compared to the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). On one hand, this pattern amplification occurs as a result of the positive non-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> greenhouse gas forcing, which tends to amplify heat exposure increases everywhere [consistent with Baker 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2018)

 </sup>. On the other hand, emissions of short-lived aerosols (leading to negative non-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing) might act to locally mitigate this increase. This second effect is notable in areas of high local aerosol emissions, such as the Chinese East Coast (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> in the Supporting Information
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>). These high aerosol emissions likely explain the slightly lower regional increases in heat exposure for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 than for the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> scenario, though analysis of consistent simulations with and without aerosol forcing would of course be required to confirm the magnitude of this effect.
