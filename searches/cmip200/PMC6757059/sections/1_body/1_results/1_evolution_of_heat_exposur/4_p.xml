<p id="Par9" class="p">Other metrics of heat exposure such as mean and maximum intensity and duration of heat periods also increase linearly as a function of CCE (see Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). However, the increase in annual total number of days with heat exposure shows evidence of saturation at higher levels of CCE for the light to strong WBGT thresholds, reaching 50 to 100 additional days per year depending on the emission scenario (see Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>). In this case, regions that are strongly affected, such as Central Africa, South-East Asia and the Amazon region, begin to experience light to strong heat exposure during every day of the year. The first areas to be exposed to this phenomenon with the strong WBGT threshold appear from approximately 1.4 °C of global temperature increase compared to the pre-industrial period, depending on the ESM selected.
