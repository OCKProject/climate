<p id="Par10" class="p">Our analysis on labour productivity loss shows the evolution of the relative extra annual loss of total GDP due to the increase of heat exposure in vulnerable sectors, here represented by agriculture, mining and quarrying, manufacturing and construction. The relationship between this productivity loss and CCE is robustly linear at global scale. For each TtC emitted, the annual productivity loss will globally increase by 1.84% (±0.94, 1

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). This relationship remains approximately unchanged for every additional ton of carbon emitted. In units of constant 2011 international dollars in purchasing power parity (PPP), this represents an annual economic loss that increases with cumulative emissions, reaching a total annual loss of 4,358.73 G$ at cumulative emissions of 1 TtC under the business-as-usual RCP8.5 scenario. This represents an additional annual loss of 0.59 ± 0.26 $ for every ton of CO

 </sup>. Today, we may be already experiencing an annual productivity loss due to historical increase in heat exposure of around 1.96% (±0.84) of total GDP at global scale given the RCP8.5 scenario response to total historical emissions (i.e. 555 PgC).
