<p id="Par12" class="p">Individual countries experience a wide range of annual labour productivity losses due to the increase in heat exposure according to climate model outputs. They increase with cumulative emissions and range from less than 0.1 to more than 6% of total GDP per TtC emitted, considering only CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing in the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Again, high-income countries are considerably less affected, with countries such as Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom subject to less than 0.1% of productivity loss per unit emission (consistent with Roson

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>). Note that some individual high-middle income countries are subject to the highest impacts; for example, Gabon, India, Thailand and Malaysia all experience productivity losses from 3 to 5% of total GDP per year for every TtC emitted (consistent with Kjellstrom 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2013)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>). These countries may therefore be among the most vulnerable to increasing heat exposure of the labour force, despite their larger financial and institutional resources to adapt compared to the poorest countries. In addition, these countries are also located in regions where several substantial challenges related to climate change can arise simultaneously, such as destructive sea level rise, high rates of population growth and fragile food security

 </sup>. However, our analysis clearly demonstrates that lower-income countries will in general be more strongly impacted by the effects of increasing heat exposure compared to higher-income developed countries. When considering non-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, impacts on total GDP are greater and the individual ranking of country impacts changes somewhat. However, the overall conclusion remains unchanged (see Supplementary Figs
