<p id="Par11" class="p">When data is aggregated by income class according to the GDP per capita of each country, it becomes clear that lower-income countries (according to the World Bank definition
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>) will experience a stronger economic impact compared to higher-income countries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). For instance, the labour productivity loss computed for low- and low-middle-income countries is approximately 9 times higher than the one of high-income countries (red and dark-red curves versus green curves on Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). These trends deviate significantly from the global average. In contrast, trends for high-middle-income countries (orange lines) are relatively close to the global average. The relationship between changes in the productivity loss and CCE is robustly linear for each country group defined by the four income classes.
