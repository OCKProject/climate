 <p id="Par1" class="p">Cumulative CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions are a robust predictor of mean temperature increase. However, many societal impacts are driven by exposure to extreme weather conditions. Here, we show that cumulative emissions can be robustly linked to regional changes of a heat exposure indicator, as well as the resulting socioeconomic impacts associated with labour productivity loss in vulnerable economic sectors. We estimate historical and future increases in heat exposure using simulations from eight Earth System Models. Both the global intensity and spatial pattern of heat exposure evolve linearly with cumulative emissions across scenarios (1% CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The pattern of heat exposure at a given level of global temperature increase is strongly affected by non-CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing. Global non-CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> greenhouse gas emissions amplify heat exposure, while high local emissions of aerosols could moderate exposure. Considering CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing only, we commit ourselves to an additional annual loss of labour productivity of about 2% of total GDP per unit of trillion tonne of carbon emitted. This loss doubles when adding non-CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing of the RCP8.5 scenario. This represents an additional economic loss of about 4,400â€‰G$ every year (i.e. 0.59 $/tCO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>), varying across countries with generally higher impact in lower-income countries.
