  <p class="p">We depict observed cold range boundaries (CRB, black polygons: IUCN range maps) and those projected based on metabolic constraints for exemplar North American rodents in current (blue: 1950–2000) and predicted future (pink: 2061–2080 from HadGEM2‐AO model) climates (a–c). Purple shading indicates portions of the projected range occupancy that persists through climate warming. We note few areas of range contraction (blue) since we are only predicting CRBs (the depicted equatorward extent is not meaningful). We restrict our CRB projections to the observed longitudinal extent. The species differ in the extent of their current distribution and the projected CRB shift resulting from climate change (a,

   <italic class="italic">Microtus montanus</italic>, montane vole; and c, 
   <italic class="italic">Peromyscus eremicus</italic>, cactus mouse). Projections based on metabolic constraints indicate that the majority of mammals (purple) and birds (green) will shift their CRB modestly poleward through climate changes (d). However, numerous species are projected to shift their CRB poleward by 10° latitude and some species are projected to shift by as much as 22°
