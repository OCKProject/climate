<p class="p">The distributions of metabolic expansibility, ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>, are peaked and peaks occur at similar values for birds and mammals. The bird distribution has a slight dip at the peak of the density distribution, which we attribute to limited sample size in the absence of evidence for non‐unimodality (Hartigans’ dip test: 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> = 0.05, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.3). We thus estimate the peak value as the mean of the two subpeaks. The density distribution of ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> peaks at 2.72 for birds (median = 3.21, mean ±
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 3.28 ± 1.63) and at a somewhat higher value (3.17, median = 3.63, mean ±
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 4.64 ± 3.35) for mammals. ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB </sub>values fall outside the 95% confidence intervals of the null model estimated by randomization for both mammals (median: 3.53–3.54, mean: 4.55–4.56) and birds (median: 2.63–2.64, mean: 3.16–3.17). The previous value (ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> = 2.5) found for birds (Root, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>) was similar to our estimate of the peak of the distribution.
