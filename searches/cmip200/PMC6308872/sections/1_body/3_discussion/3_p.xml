<p class="p">The distribution of ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> is right skewed, more so for mammals than for birds. The greater skew in the mammal ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> distribution is consistent with the prominent use of hibernation and protected microclimates (e.g., burrows, dens, subnivean space) during winter in mammals, but lesser use of these options to avoid cold thermal environments in birds (Ruf &amp; Geiser, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Swanson, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). These adjustments have the effect of rendering the thermal conditions encountered at the ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> as less extreme than the actual ambient conditions, which results in an overestimation of the thermal isocline followed by the cold range boundary. In addition, differences in the mechanisms of thermoregulation between mammals and birds may contribute to the difference in ME. Cold‐adapted mammals have well developed capacities for non‐shivering thermogenesis through brown fat, but birds lack brown fat and although they may possess some muscular non‐shivering thermogenesis, muscular shivering appears to be the primary mechanism of heat production in birds (Mezentseva, Kumaratilake, &amp; Newman,
