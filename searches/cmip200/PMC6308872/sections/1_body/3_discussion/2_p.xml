<p class="p">Our data are consistent with the poleward range edges of both birds and mammals being constrained by the factor by which they can elevate their metabolism above basal rates (perhaps resulting from a constraint on maximum metabolic rates). The constraint may result from either direct physiological limitations on metabolism, such as the ability to sustain high rates of thermogenesis over prolonged periods, or limitations on energy acquisition. The rates of ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> that we find for birds (peak of distribution = 2.7) are similar to a previous value (2.5) for a more taxonomically and geographically restricted analysis (Root, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). We find a somewhat higher peak of the ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> distribution for mammals (3.2). Our analysis supports metabolic constraints as a mechanism underlying observations that endotherms track thermal isotherms through climate change (Chen, Hill, Ohlemüller, Roy, &amp; Thomas, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Tingley, Monahan, Beissinger, &amp; Moritz, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, many observed range shifts have been idiosyncratic in extent and direction (Gibson‐Reinemer &amp; Rahel, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Filtering the range shifts through the lens of metabolic constraints may resolve some discrepancies.
