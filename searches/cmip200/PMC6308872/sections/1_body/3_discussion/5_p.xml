<p class="p">We identify traits associated with high values for ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>, which may be adaptations to or consequences of inhabiting cold environments. Body mass is an important factor that influences ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>. Smaller mammals, which tend to exhibit greater ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>, may be able to evade cold temperatures through seeking shelters or selecting favorable microclimates. Alternatively, the ability to use torpor or hibernation enables mammals to inhabit colder environments. Mammals using torpor tend to be small, which may contribute to the relationship between mass and ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> (Ruf &amp; Geiser, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Small mammals may also be able to meet the resource requirements or store energy to maintain high metabolism through cold periods (due to the low per‚Äêorganism, or total, metabolic rate stemming from their small size) (Angilletta, Cooper, Schuler, &amp; Boyles, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Humphries et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Mammals at lower trophic levels (herbivores and invertebrate consumers) tend to exhibit higher ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>. These species tend to have lower BMR (McNab, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and their food sources may be more consistently available.
