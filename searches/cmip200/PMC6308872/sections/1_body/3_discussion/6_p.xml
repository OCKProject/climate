<p class="p">Lower mass‐specific rates of heat production and heat loss (conductance) and smaller surface area to volume ratios favor larger body sizes in colder environments (i.e., Bergmann's hypothesis, Ashton, Tracy, &amp; Queiroz, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Regardless, birds’ and mammals’ body sizes are diverse across climates (Fristoe et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). An analysis of regression residuals suggests that adaptations to cold environments in birds and mammals results in increased BMR and reduced conductance (Fristoe et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Our analysis suggests that greater values of ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> (perhaps associated with selection for higher M
 <sub class="sub">sum</sub>) enable small birds and mammals to inhabit cooler environments. Birds from cold climates tend to exhibit higher M
 <sub class="sub">sum</sub> (Stager et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). We identify traits (small body size, use of torpor or hibernation, diet) that may enable the elevated ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>.
