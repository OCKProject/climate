<p class="p">Assuming species follow thermal isoclines due to metabolic constraints, we project that species will shift their cold range boundaries poleward by an average of 3.9° latitude with numerous species shifting by 6° (75% quantile). Our analyses suggest that hibernation and torpor are important determinants of cold range boundaries. Climate change will also likely alter the energetics of hibernation, which may amplify poleward range shifts (Humphries, Thomas, &amp; Speakman,

Many bird and mammal species rely on seasonal migration to obtain resources to meet seasonal energetic demands; considering the costs and benefits of such movements will be important to forecasting responses to climate change among migratory birds and mammals (which we excluded from our analysis) (Robinson et al.,
