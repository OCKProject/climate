<p class="p">In our full dataset for bird ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>, the following proportions of species with data met our BMR quality criteria: 93.0% (86.9% including species without data) were measured during the resting phase, 88.9% (52.4% including species without data) were postabsorptive, and 68.9% were wild‐caught (50.8% including species without data) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34537-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Similar to mammals, of the quality criteria only whether the bird species was live‐trapped or captive was a significant predictor of ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> (resting phase: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">[1,32]</sub> = 0.00, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.94; postabsorptive: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">[1,32]</sub> = 0.68, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.42; wild caught: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">[1,32]</sub> = 6.90, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, restricting the dataset to wild‐caught species did not substantially alter the peak value of ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> (peak = 2.60, mean = 3.07, median = 3.11). The trait predictors of ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> remained similar, but some predictors lose significance, when considering only wild‐caught individuals (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34537-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>).
