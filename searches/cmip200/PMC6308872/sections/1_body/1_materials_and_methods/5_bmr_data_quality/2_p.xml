<p class="p">We revisited the source papers to assess whether the T
 <sub class="sub">lc</sub> data were calculated from valid BMR measurements. Quality criteria were selected in consultation with several physiologists as those most likely to be problematic in the initial data compilations. We used the following criteria to assess data quality for BMR: Measurements were made during the rest phase on inactive individuals in a postabsorptive state. We additionally recorded whether individuals measured were field‚Äêcollected (or the first generation reared in a laboratory or zoo in a small number of cases) and the location of field collection, as individuals collected far from the range boundary may lack adaptations and acclimation present near the range boundary.
