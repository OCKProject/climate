<p class="p">We then used regressions to assess whether speciesâ€™ traits indicating adaptation to or evasion of cold temperatures can explain variation in ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>. We used model selection based on AICc (dredge function) and model averaging (model.avg function in R package MuMIn) to conclude that the best models omitted interactions between the predictor variables (mass, diet, nocturnality, torpor). Accounting for phylogeny did not alter our results, so we report phylogenetic analyses in Appendix
