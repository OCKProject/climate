<p class="p">We used thermal isoclines (consistent with species maintaining a constant ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> in the absence of acclimation or adaptation) to project species’ cold range boundaries in both current and future environments. For graphical purposes, we used observed west and east longitudinal extents to depict distributions. We identified as thermally habitable all pixels with 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> warmer than the predicted physiological lower temperature limit (based on species‐specific observed ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>). We subsequently removed pixels that were geographically isolated from other thermally habitable pixels using the clump function in the R package raster. We omitted all clumps with areas less than 5% of the area of the largest clump, because the core of the predicted distribution is most representative of latitudinal extents. We further restricted our predicted distribution to clumps overlapping with the latitudinal extent of the observed species range. We then quantified the latitude of the cold range boundary as the median latitude of grid cells along the cold range edge.
