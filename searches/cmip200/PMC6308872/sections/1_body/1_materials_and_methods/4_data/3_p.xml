<p class="p">For species distribution data, we used the IUCN range maps for mammals (Patterson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) and the BirdLife range maps for birds (BirdLife International &amp; NatureServe, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). We calculated temperatures at the range boundaries (

 <sub class="sub">min</sub> and

 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) using BIO5 (max daily temperature of warmest month) and BIO6 (min daily temperature of coldest month) at five‐minute resolution from the WorldClim dataset (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Data are interpolated from air temperature at weather stations (generally 2 m high). Trait data are insufficient to account for microhabitat use (e.g., burrows or under snow), but our trait analysis does provide some indication of exposure to air temperatures. We extracted the grid cells at the northern and southern extremes of the species’ distribution for each 5‐minute longitudinal band. We quantified the degree to which range boundaries follow temperature isoclines as the standard deviation and median absolute deviation (mad, R function mad) of cells along the range boundaries. Subsequently, we estimated 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> as the median of the grid cells along the cold and warm range boundaries, respectively. We checked that minimum and maximum temperatures were sufficiently constant across the range boundaries for our results to be robust to our selection of the median (Figure

Current data are normals for 1950–2000, and future data are downscaled global climate model (GCM) projections from CMIP5 (IPCC Fifth Assessment) averaged over 2061–2080. We examined output from both the HadGEM2‐AO and CCSM4 models assuming a midrange greenhouse gas concentration scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway RCP6.0, indicates a 6 W/m
