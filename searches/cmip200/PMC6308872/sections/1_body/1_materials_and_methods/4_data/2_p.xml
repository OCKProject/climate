 <sub class="sub">lc</sub> (omitted 1% of species). Accounting for these constraints and limitations on available physiological data, we analyzed 210 and 61 cold range boundaries for mammal and bird species, respectively. The species are broadly distributed across latitudes: the mean and median of the absolute latitude of the poleward range limits are 39.7° and 35.2° degrees, respectively.
