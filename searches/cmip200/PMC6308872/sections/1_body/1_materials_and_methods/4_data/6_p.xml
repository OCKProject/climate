 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). A “torpor” trait was assigned a value of 1 if the species uses either torpor or hibernation and 0 otherwise. Data on relevant thermoregulatory traits such as body shape, insulation, and fur or feather properties were inadequate to include the traits in the analysis.
