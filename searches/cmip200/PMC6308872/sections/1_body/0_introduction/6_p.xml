<p class="p">We test whether physiological, behavioral, and ecological traits (body size, nocturnality, torpor use, diet) associated with adaptation or evasion correspond to higher ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> values. Evasion would result in high ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> values due to CRB temperatures being colder than those actually experienced by the animals, resulting in overestimation of heating requirements. Body size influences the ability to use potential microclimates as well as metabolic rates and thermal inertia (Mitchell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Trophic levels influence the seasonal availability of food and metabolic rate (McNab, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref> ). We also examine the conservatism of traits and metabolic expansibility at the cold range boundary (ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub>) across the phylogeny. Finally, evidence for metabolic constraints suggests that (in the absence of adaptation or acclimation) species will follow thermal isoclines through climate change. We thus use ME
 <sub class="sub">CRB</sub> as an initial approach to project ranges and range shifts in response to predicted climate change.
