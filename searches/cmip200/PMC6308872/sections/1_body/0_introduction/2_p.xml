<p class="p">Environmental temperatures govern the performance and energy use, and ultimately the abundance and distribution, of animals (Bozinovic, Calosi, &amp; Spicer, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Performance and energetic constraints provide a powerful basis for projecting responses to climate change because the constraints should extrapolate better into novel environments than statistical correlations (Radeloff et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Models using heat budgets to translate environmental conditions into the body temperatures of ectotherms and quantifying limitations on performance and activity durations can robustly predict patterns of abundance and distribution (Buckley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Kearney &amp; Porter, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The translation is more complex for endothermic animals because they can use endogenous heat production to maintain their body temperatures under a wide range of environmental thermal conditions if available resources and physiological capacities are sufficient (Boyles, Seebacher, Smit, &amp; McKechnie, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Buckley, Hurlbert, &amp; Jetz, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; McNab, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Thus, few mechanistic approaches predict endotherm distributions (but see examples reviewed in Boyles et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Many attempts to predict endotherm distributions are based on air temperature without considering capacity for endogenous heat production (Fuller, Mitchell, Maloney, &amp; Hetem, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Mitchell et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) review misconceptions of thermal physiology that plague predictive models of mammalian responses to climate change. Several recent examples employ biophysical models to estimate metabolic constraints, activity limitations, and water balance for focal endotherms (Kearney, Porter, &amp; Murphy, 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Mathewson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34537-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), but can these approaches be generalized?
