   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Cumulative (2017–2050) electricity trade under perfect foresight driest climate. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Cumulative (2017–2050) electricity trade under perfect foresight wettest climate. The outer circle highlights the different countries of the EAPP. There are three bars (percentage mix) corresponding to the outermost circle. In the order of outermost to the innermost bar, the first refers to the exported electricity; the second refers to the imported electricity and the third to the difference. The colour of the bar (arc), on the inner circle, is specific to the country where electricity is exported or imported from. The scale on the circumference of the inner circle shows the absolute values of electricity trade in TWh. Each flow band denotes the cumulatively traded electricity from country A to country B. Flow bands attached to a country’s inner circle represent exports from that country and vice-versa
