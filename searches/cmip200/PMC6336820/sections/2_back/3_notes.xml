 <p class="p">V.S. developed the energy models described in this article. V.S., O.B., A.S. and B.B. performed the climate scenario iterations and contributed to the overall methodology. M.H., H.-H.R. and C.T. provided valuable inputs to develop the energy model. R.C., J.E.N., K.M.S., M.H., B.B., R.L., D.G.G. developed the methodology of the study. B.B. performed the bias-correction and downscaling of climate scenarios. R.L. and D.G.G. developed the robust decision-making analysis (RDM) component of the study. B.J. and A.H.-L. developed the water models for this study and contributed to the overall methodology. V.S., O.B., A.S., M.H., C.T., H.-H.R., B.B. and D.G.G. were involved in paper writing and editing.</p>
