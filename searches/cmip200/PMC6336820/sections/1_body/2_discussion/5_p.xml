<p id="Par22" class="p">To conclude, it is interesting to note that both decision criteria used in this study converge to the same resilient strategy (Supplementary NoteÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). This study suggests that, for the analysed climate futures, the regret for energy planners of the EAPP resulting from planning for a drier climate future is higher than the one resulting from increasing investment in hydropower; that is, planning for a slightly wetter than realised climate. Of course, the results will need validation on a local scale from country-level analysis with higher spatial and temporal resolution. Nevertheless, from the climate futures analysed in this study, the need to climate-proof electricity infrastructure in the EAPP is clear. The region requires a rapidly expanding electricity supply infrastructure to enable access to electricity services for all and support the EAPP countries in their path towards industrialisation. Failure to consider alternative climate futures may result in vulnerable electricity expansion planning, leading to fluctuations in consumer electricity prices.
