 </sup> take the case of the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) to illustrate that applying an ambitious sustainable pathway similar to SSP1 (Shared Socio-Economic Pathways) would result in 8 out of the 12 Southern African nations shifting from coal and hydro-based generation to solar PV. A slightly less optimistic outlook could be expected for the EAPP after taking into consideration grid integration and storage costs. Also, fluctuations in fossil fuel prices have a significant impact in the region, especially with Egypt’s dependence on natural gas. With prospects of new gas finds (Zohr gas field)

 </sup>, EAPP dynamics could be altered to rely on Egyptian gas as security against a drop in hydropower generation in the event of climate change. The price of other fossil fuels is, however, not stationary either. Though we consider an increasing fossil fuel price derived from the EAPP master plan, a sudden change in oil and coal prices in countries like Tanzania and Kenya could, despite the cost assumptions in the model, change the generation mix significantly towards renewable-based power. In this study, for all generic power plants, we consider a capital cost that does not change over time in the modelling system. The values correspond to the initial technology-specific capital costs used in all four scenarios mentioned in IRENA’s analyses of the SAPP
