<p id="Par20" class="p">An analysis reveals that introducing a reduction in technology costs due to learning rates will replace electricity generation from fossil fuel power plants and not from hydropower. The analysis demonstrates that electricity trade based on inexpensive hydropower infrastructure will continue to play a significant role in the power pools generation mix (Supplementary Figures

Of course, the effects of a progressively dry climate could result in higher—non-hydro—renewable penetration, which needs to be explored in detail. Despite the relevance of uncertainties discussed above, it was a deliberate choice of this study to keep capital costs constant to help with tractability of climate change impacts on the electricity infrastructure, with a primary focus on hydropower plants.
