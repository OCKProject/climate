<p id="Par21" class="p">Though the study considered an advanced set of renewable technology options along with site-specific costs for hydropower plants, it did not explore new flexible options, such as grid-level storage. This could, however, be game changing in mitigating climate change by absorbing electricity from intermittent renewables on a large scale and dispatching it when necessary

 </sup>. Another fundamental issue that is beyond the scope of this study is the geopolitical debate in the East African region regarding the sharing of waters of the River Nile. Egypt had temporarily dropped out of the power pool due to regional conflicts related to water sharing

 </sup>. We would, also, like to highlight that this study does not take the variability in weather-induced solar and wind power generation into consideration to maintain the tractability of climatic impact on hydropower generation. Though not explored in this article, in addition to the electricity infrastructureâ€™s resilience, water stress that could potentially arise from any of the analysed climate futures could also be calculated with this framework. Those stresses could then be evaluated (using different allocation priorities) to determine the vulnerability of the users. Moreover, with defined user vulnerability, the efficacy of specific resilience measures could be evaluated.
