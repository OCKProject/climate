<p id="Par11" class="p">Our baseline results indicate that, if the future climate is expected to be similar to historical patterns, the investments in hydropower for the PIDA+ expansion plan (2015–2050) are expected to be in the range of USD
 <sub class="sub">2010</sub> 75 billion. Comparatively, the entire power sector investments for the same period are expected to reach USD
 <sub class="sub">2010</sub> 2.3 trillion. These numbers are interesting considering that, in the same period, the share of hydropower in the total electricity generation mix is significant, close to 21%. Despite the share of natural gas in total electricity generation dropping from 72% in 2015 to 52% in 2050, it is still expected to play an essential role in the power pool’s electricity mix. Egypt is expected to contribute up to 76% of total natural gas consumption in 2050, as it has access to potentially vast local natural gas resources. It is assumed that this gas can be extracted at competitive costs. Towards the second half of the modelling period (post-2030), higher electrification rates would also see countries like Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda taking advantage of local renewable-based electricity generation potential, including hydropower.
