 </sup> along with country-level energy, water, and irrigation master plans were combined to form a database, which served as reference data for the modelling framework; referred to as PIDA+. We developed a sequence of runs—of the energy and water models—for a range of climates to assess expansion plan performance. This sequence consisted of three types of model runs; first, a baseline run that simulates a case where the climate follows a historical pattern. Second, perfect foresight adaptation (PF) runs that identify the cost-optimal expansion plan for each climate. The PF runs simulate a case where the energy planners know which future climate will occur and have the ability to adapt: (a) either up- or down-size selected hydropower infrastructure while (b) investing in alternative technologies to ensure the security of supply and reduce the cost of electricity generation, and (c) exploring electricity trade options with neighbouring countries. Third, no-adaptation (NA) runs that fix the infrastructure rollout from each PF run and simulate the impact of different climates.
