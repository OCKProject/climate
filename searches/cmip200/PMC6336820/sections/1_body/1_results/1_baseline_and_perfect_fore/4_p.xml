<p id="Par13" class="p">However, infrastructure development faces deep uncertainty, as the future climate remains unknown. Our NA model runs address this uncertainty by maintaining the PIDA+ roll-out constant while varying future levels of water availability under different climates. Only a limited set of expensive diesel-based electricity generation options is allowed to contribute to the loss of hydro generation. Large build-out of new coal or gas is not permitted. In our labelling, we refer to dry or wet climate futures. Note that these are cumulatively drier or wetter in the period 2015–2050 for the entire Basin, rather than systematically dry or wet across all months and years (Supplementary Figures
