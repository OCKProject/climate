 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> highlights the importance of both non-hydro renewables and nuclear power in the EAPP’s generation mix. Note that the latter is restricted to Egypt where a high domestic baseload electricity demand can accommodate the bulk generation of current nuclear power plants. Finally, it is salient that the cost of electricity generation increases, both nationally and on a power pool scale, due to higher shares of fossil fuels in systems that were previously hydro-dependent, e.g., Tanzania. This highlights the potential for beneficial effects from increased renewables in resource-rich countries, particularly for hydropower, provided water availability remains reliable. Results for hydropower dependent countries, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, reflect the impact of variation in annual water availability on the cost of electricity generation. The total installed capacity and the electricity generation mix for all analysed climates, in each of the EAPP countries, highlight the importance of hydropower in this region of Africa (Supplementary Figures
