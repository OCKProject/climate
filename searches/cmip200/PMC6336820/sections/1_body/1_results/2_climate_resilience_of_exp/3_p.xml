 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> compares the cumulative consumer electricity expenditure for the most resilient strategy to the worst-case scenario (NA strategy for the driest climate) expressed as a percentage difference from the baseline for selected EAPP countries. Average change on a power-pool scale is small and reflects the fact that Egypt—the country with the highest electricity demand in the EAPP—tends to drive power-pool level performance indicators. Ethiopia and Uganda stand to benefit the most from choosing the most resilient strategy over their respective worst case options, with cumulative electricity expenditure, over 2017–2050, dropping from +27% to +1% and from +28% to −18.5% respectively relative to the baseline. These translate to savings of approximately USD
 <sub class="sub">2010</sub> 19 billion and USD
 <sub class="sub">2010</sub> 4 billion in consumer expenditure in Ethiopia and Uganda respectively. In the case of Tanzania, despite having sizable amounts of fossil fuel in the generation mix, a drier climate leads to increased electricity imports as large quantities of fossil investment in the short period is not allowed. These risk causing electricity price fluctuations if proper import power purchase agreements and sufficient transmission infrastructure are not in place.
