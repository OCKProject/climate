<p id="Par14" class="p">The non-adaptation of the electricity sector is expected to affect different EAPP countries to varying degrees. Countries like Egypt and Kenya, which are expected to rely on gas, geothermal, and coal for the security of their electricity supply, are barely affected. In the NA scenario for the driest climate, Egyptian consumers are expected to face a cumulative change in the expenditure of approximately +1% over the modelling period (2017–2050) when compared to the baseline. This is due to the low share of hydro-generation in Egypt. Conversely, Uganda and Tanzania could expect costs to vary across ranges of −18% to +28%, and −5% to +23% respectively between the wettest and driest climates when compared to the baseline (cumulatively between 2017–2050). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> compares the cost of electricity generation across three strategies: the baseline expansion strategy under historical climate trends, no–adaptation strategy under the driest climate and the most resilient adaptation strategy. The most resilient strategy has the lowest value among the calculated maximum financial regrets for all the analysed climate futures. It illustrates the yearly variation in the cost of electricity generation for Uganda, Tanzania, and Egypt. Also noticeable are the substantial fluctuations in electricity cost under the no adaptation scenarios. By emphasising the variability of climatic impacts in different countries, it inherently reflects the resilience or vulnerability of the current electricity infrastructure to climate change (Supplementary Figures
