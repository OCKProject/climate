<p id="Par17" class="p">Results across all scenarios place Ethiopia as a major electricity exporter by 2040, trading on average 30 TWh annually or 15% of its yearly electricity generation. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> illustrates the cumulative, power pool level, electricity trade (2017–2050) under PF driest and wettest climates, highlighting the significant impact that variations in regional climate have on net power flows. Under the driest climate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>), Ethiopia would export about 415 TWh to Sudan which, in turn, exports 245 TWh (59%) to Egypt. Under the wettest climate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>), though Ethiopia exports about 600 TWh of electricity to Sudan only 108 TWh (18%) are further directed to Egypt. This represents a drop both in absolute flow to Egypt, now relying on 228 TWh additional domestic hydropower, and in relative terms, increasing Sudan’s levels of net imports. It also shows that Sudan will absorb available and cheap power to displace its gas-based electricity generation and harmonise its domestic electricity cost. These results support the message that irrespective of climate, the availability of electricity trading infrastructure stands to play a significant role in balancing electricity prices within the EAPP.
