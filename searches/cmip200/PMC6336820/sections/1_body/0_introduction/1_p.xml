 </sup>. For the period 2010–2050, the average Climate Moisture Index (CMI), a measure of aridity that combines the effect of rainfall and temperature—across the different General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs from the two Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Projects (CMIP3 and CMIP5)—reflects a wide range of uncertainty for the African continent’s major River Basins

 </sup>. This potential range of future climates has long-term impacts on the electricity generation sector; with water levels for hydropower generation and cooling requirements in thermoelectric power plants being the most affected

 </sup>. The term climate, in this assessment, refers to a consistent set of temperature and precipitation projections. Amongst the CMI values for the illustrated African basins, the sub-basins of the Nile River display high levels of uncertainty (Nile Equatorial Lakes) and some of the driest projections (Eastern Nile)

 </sup>. Despite the Eastern Nile sub-basin contributing almost 80% of the river’s total annual flow, the White Nile (originating from the Nile Equatorial lakes) provides nearly all of the flow during approximately four months in a year—which make its contribution significant. Countries like Uganda depend 100% on the White Nile for its hydropower infrastructure.
