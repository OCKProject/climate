<p id="Par8" class="p">Aggressive urbanisation, irrigation expansion plans and variable release from upstream hydropower plants across the power pool could result in fluctuating water availability for downstream countries. This may result in geopolitical conflicts; which are not new to the Nile River Basin

 </sup>. Therefore, there is a need to examine energy and water use coherently to assess power pool infrastructure resilience to the effects of a changing climate. To address this issue, we develop a framework, soft-linking two models—first, a long-term electricity expansion model of the EAPP, formulated in an open-source platform

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>—second, a water systems management model of the Nile River Basin developed using a widely used water balance management framework

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. We then calibrate the water system model to historical stream flows using data from multiple locations along the Nile River. The calibrated model is then subjected to harmonised precipitation and temperature projections using downscaled, bias-corrected, GCM outputs from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 suite of models

 </sup>. Two decision criteria—a mini-max regret criterion and a variant of the domain criterion—are employed to identify the most resilient adaptation strategy for the EAPP.
