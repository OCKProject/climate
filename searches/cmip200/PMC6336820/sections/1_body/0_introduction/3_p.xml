 </sup> consists of Rwanda, Djibouti, Tanzania, Kenya, Burundi, Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Libya. South Sudan was part of the EAPP when united with Sudan and is expected to re-join the group soon; hence, Sudan—in this article—refers to both present-day Sudan and South Sudan. All except Libya lie either partially or entirely inside the Nile River Basin, hence Libya is not considered in this study. In addition to the growing residential water demand and irrigation water requirements, a significant share of the electricity generation infrastructure in the region relies on water from the River Nile.
