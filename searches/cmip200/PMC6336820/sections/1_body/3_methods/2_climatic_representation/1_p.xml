<p id="Par24" class="p">To simulate different climates, the water model is parameterised using bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated (BCSD) precipitation and temperature projections from an ensemble of climate projections. GCM outputs exhibit systematic errors (biases) due to the limited spatial resolution, simplified physics and thermodynamic processes to name a few. Bias-correction is one of the commonly used calibration techniques to minimise the bias in climate model outputs, which are inputs for models that assess the impact of climate change

 </sup>. The projections use the results from two classes of climate models: namely the CMIP3 and CMIP5 from the IPCC Assessment Report 4 (AR4) and 5 (AR5) respectively

 </sup>. The BCSD process results in 121 different climate futures spanning three emission scenarios from the AR4 namely: A1, A1B, A2; and two representative concentration pathways from AR5 namely: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The two RCPs are chosen to represent medium and high emission scenarios.
