<p id="Par25" class="p">Running the water and energy models over 121 different futures, with monthly time resolution for the former but longer time intervals for the latter is computationally intensive. Hence, a representative subset of six climate futures is therefore chosen to represent a good sample of the range of precipitation and temperature outcomes inferred from the 121 climates (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). The climate futures are ranked based on their CMI averaged over the modelling period, and a simple algorithm is developed to choose six cases which span over different percentile ranges (Supplementary Table
