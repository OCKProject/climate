<p id="Par23" class="p">This study is based on a framework involving two analytical modelling tools. The first is a detailed energy systems model of the Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP) covering the electricity generation mix in each of the constituent countries. The second is a water systems model of the Nile River basin. The two were soft linked to assess the resilience of water and energy infrastructure to a changing climate. WEAP, the Water Evaluation, And Planning system is used to develop the detailed water systems model (henceforth referred to as the water model) of the Nile River Basin

Other generation options are represented using an aggregate total for their category (e.g., onshore wind, grid-connected solar photovoltaics (PV), rooftop solar PV to name a few) and were afforded varying flexibility to install new capacity under different scenarios. The OSeMOSYS framework represents all generation and transmission infrastructure using separate technologies. The EAPP energy model includes over 150 site-specific hydropower plants as well as additional electricity generation options (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). In total, this represents approximately 500 technologies forming a ten-country power pool model. The energy model has a detailed temporal resolution of 48-time slices (steps) and captures monthly water availability, at the hydropower plant level, across the different precipitation patterns of the river basin

 </sup>. Each of the countries can trade electricity-using technologies that represent the transmission infrastructure. Any expansion of the existing transmission system is chosen from a list of identified or planned projects. Hydropower plants represented in the energy model are also included in the water model with or without reservoirs, as applicable. In addition, the water model contains a detailed representation of the other water and agriculture (irrigation) infrastructure. Flow regulation constraints from country-specific water management reports are also taken into account.
