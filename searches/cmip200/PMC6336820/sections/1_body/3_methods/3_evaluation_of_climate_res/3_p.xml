<p id="Par28" class="p">For each climate, the Net Present Value (NPV) of cumulative consumer expenditure from each of the NA runs is compared against the best expansion strategy for that climate (PF strategy) to estimate the so-called financial regret of ill-fitting infrastructure portfolios (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). It must be noted that these regret numbers are calculated across all climate futures using information from both the power sector expansion model (EAPP) and the water management (WEAP) model. Summarising the full regret-matrix, each climate is characterised by—first, the strategy that has the lowest worst-case regret (mini-max criterion
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>) across all the assessed climates. Second, the strategy that had the lowest 75
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile regret across all climate futures (Domain criterion
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>).
