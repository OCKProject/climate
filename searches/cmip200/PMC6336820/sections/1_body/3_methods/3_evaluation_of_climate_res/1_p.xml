<p id="Par26" class="p">The models are linked using the water availability for hydropower generation provided by the water model on a plant-specific basis; this availability is translated into capacity factors for the electricity expansion model under each climate. In turn, a separate Matlab based optimisation framework

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup> uses the cost of generating electricity from the energy model to produce a list of adaptation options for up- or down-sizing selected hydropower infrastructure. In this framework, water requirements for domestic use and agriculture take precedence over hydropower generation. As a result, adjusted power plant capacities in the water model cascade into updated values for hydropower capacity factors in the energy model (Supplementary NoteÂ
