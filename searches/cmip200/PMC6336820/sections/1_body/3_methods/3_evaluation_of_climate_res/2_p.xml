<p id="Par27" class="p">The framework for evaluating the impacts of climate on the energy sector involves three types of energy model optimisation runs, detailed as the followingâ€”first, the baseline run, where the water and energy models are run assuming that historical climate patterns repeat over the modelling period. All planned infrastructure investments that are either committed or under construction (according to PIDA+) are assumed available for electricity generation in their respective years. To compensate for shortfalls in the electricity supply, the model is free to choose from a limited list of country-specific electricity generation options. Moreover, countries are also able to import electricity from their neighbours through existing or planned transmission lines. No unplanned transmission lines are made available to provide conservative estimates of trade capacities. Second (in perfect foresight (PF) adaptation runs), the energy model is run for the six chosen climate scenarios. The runs have perfect foresight, and the energy system can adapt to changes in water availability in the respective climates. The water availability is communicated between the water and the energy model using capacity factors. Each of these runs has different monthly and plant-specific capacity factors for each year during the modelling period. Hence, in dry years, the models can choose electricity generation options that minimise the overall system cost based on resource availability in the respective countries. That is, the electricity expansion model can substitute reduced hydropower availability with other electricity generation options and trade in a dry climate future and vice-versa. This soft-linking routine is iterated twice for each climate to converge towards an optimal hydropower infrastructure within the realm of possible size configurations. Third (in no-adaptation (NA) Runs), the energy model is run to simulate the effects of not adapting. They consider the infrastructure roll-out resulting from a PF run (for each climate scenario) and assess its performance across the five chosen climate futures it is not designed for. The PF expansion plan for each climate future is thus an NA strategy for the remaining five climates. In each alternate future, shortfalls in generation due to lack of water for hydropower can be satisfied only with rapidly deployable, yet expensive, diesel-based generation options. These runs, therefore, are used to evaluate the performance of each PF infrastructure rollout across the ensemble of climates.</p>
