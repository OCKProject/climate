<p id="Par555" class="p"> Our results outline the primary drivers of inter-model spread in AA found in CMIP5 models using a surface energy budget perspective highlighting the important contribution of seasonal energy exchange in sea ice retreat regions facilitated by ocean heat storage to the inter-model spread in Arctic warming. We argue that the atmospheric and ocean processes that modulate the seasonal energy exchange in sea ice retreat regions drive model differences in projected Arctic warming. The models that more effectively disperse energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions warm more. Therefore, reconciling the differences in AA projections requires constraining the representation of atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interactions in sea ice retreat regions.</p>
