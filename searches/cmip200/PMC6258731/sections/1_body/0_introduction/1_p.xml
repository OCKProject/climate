 </sup>. Because of the significant implications for the physical climate and human systems, accurate projections of AA are needed. Unfortunately, climate models project a wide range of possible futures for the Arctic—a larger inter-model spread than any other region. The 2 °C globally-averaged warming specified in the Paris Climate Agreement equates to an Arctic warming between 3 and 7 °C, according to Coupled Model Intercomparison 5 (CMIP5

 </sup>) models. Narrowing the inter-model spread requires an understanding of how Arctic feedback processes and their interactions shape the temperature response.
