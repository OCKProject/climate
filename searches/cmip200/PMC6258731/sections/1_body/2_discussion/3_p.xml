<p id="Par36" class="p">This explanation contains familiar arguments for the processes that drive the AA inter-model spread; however, the regional picture presented should not be overlooked. The local mechanism does not occur throughout the Arctic but is focused in regions of sea ice retreat. Neglecting the regional variation in AA mechanisms paints an incomplete picture, as the inter-model spread in warming possesses a regional structure. Only after considering the regional perspective does the importance of the local atmospheric circulation to AA become clear. Our results suggest that an atmospheric circulation change local to the Arctic may be an important factor in the inter-model spread. While much of the scientific literature attempts to explain inter-model differences in AA using atmospheric-only mechanisms, we contend that a complete theory of AA and its inter-model spread must consider the atmosphere-ocean-sea ice system. Our results indicate that the principle mechanisms driving the inter-model spread in AA operate on regional not Arctic-wide scales and that reductions in the inter-model spread in projected Arctic warming require an improved process representation of atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interactions in sea ice retreat regions.</p>
