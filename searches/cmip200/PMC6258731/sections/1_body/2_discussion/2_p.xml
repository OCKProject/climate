<p id="Par35" class="p">We conclude that models that transfer more energy from summer to fall produce a larger AA. This seasonal energy transfer is primarily accomplished by increased absorption and storage of solar insolation in summer and increased surface turbulent fluxes in fall/winter in sea ice retreat regions. Models simulating greater reductions in summer/fall sea ice and larger fall/winter surface turbulent fluxes produce more AA. Our results suggest that the local Arctic circulation and its response contribute to the inter-model spread in AA by dispersing the energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and reinforcing the local airâ€“sea temperature gradients. Models that more widely disperse the energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions warm more. We found significant inter-model differences in ocean mixed layer depths and its relationships with sea ice concentration and surface turbulent fluxes that modulate seasonal energy transfer, yet do not correspond to the inter-model spread in AA. This lack of correlation suggests a bias in the model representation of the ocean mixed layer with the potential to significantly impact projected AA.</p>
