<p id="Par8" class="p">Arctic warming projections display stark regional contrasts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) where sea ice retreat regions exhibit the greatest warming and possess the largest model disagreement. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the annual and seasonal ensemble mean temperature and sea ice concentration (SIC) changes and the corresponding standard deviations across the ensemble. The Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas regions (see map, Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>) exhibit the largest projected warming and sea ice loss; wintertime temperature projections exceed +20 K in both regions. The central Arctic Ocean shows the largest seasonality of the temperature response, warming by 15–20 K in fall/winter and less than 5 K in spring/summer. During all seasons, the smallest temperature changes between 1–4 K occur in the sea ice-free ocean regions of the North Atlantic, Norwegian Sea, and Davis Strait due to small surface energy budget changes consistent with reductions in ocean heat transport
