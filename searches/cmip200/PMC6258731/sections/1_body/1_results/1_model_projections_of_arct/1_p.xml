 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> illustrates AA using the normalized temperature change—hereafter, amplification factor—defined as the ratio between the 1° zonally-averaged temperature change to global temperature change. All models simulate surface-based warming—at least 1.5 times global average warming—extending into the lower troposphere poleward of 75°N (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). The solid black line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref> represents the ensemble mean amplification factor, which exceeds 2.5 at the pole. CMIP5 models also simulate a similar seasonality of AA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>, inset) with minimum warming (amplification factor &lt; 1) in summer and maximum warming in fall and winter (amplification factor &gt;2). Despite unanimous agreement in the existence of AA, models disagree on the magnitude and spatial characteristics.
