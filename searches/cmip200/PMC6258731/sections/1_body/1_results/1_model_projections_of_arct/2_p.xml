<p id="Par7" class="p">Inter-model differences in projected Arctic warming exceed those for any other latitude. The Arctic domain (defined as 60°–90°N) shows increasing model differences at more northerly latitudes, approaching an amplification factor spread of 1.6–3.6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). The dashed black line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref> represents the ratio between the 1° zonally-averaged inter-model standard deviation in temperature change to the global inter-model standard deviation—a measure of inter-model spread. This ratio approaches four times the global average moving poleward. The seasonal cycle of AA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>, inset) shows the largest model spread in winter (amplification factor between 2 and 4) and smallest in summer (amplification factor between 0.5 and 1.25).
