<p id="Par17" class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the ensemble mean annually-averaged PTCs (
 <bold class="bold">a</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">f</bold>) and the corresponding spatial inter-model standard deviation for each PTC (
 <bold class="bold">g</bold>–
 <bold class="bold">l</bold>). The largest model differences occur in seasonal sea ice regions where small differences in sea ice extent correspond to large differences in HSTOR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4k</xref>) and HFLUX (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4l</xref>). The most striking feature is the contrast between the spatial variability of PTCs and their associated inter-model spread for radiative and non-radiative feedbacks, revealing in almost every case that the spatial variation of non-radiative feedbacks (HSTOR and HFLUX) is stronger than for radiative feedbacks (SAF, CRE, SWCS, and LWCS). The spatial contours in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> show that non-radiative feedbacks vary strongly across models, in sea ice-retreat regions the HSTOR standard deviation exceeds 10.0 in the annual mean, more than seven times the domain average, and also approaches 10.0 in the Barents/Kara Seas, more than five times the domain average. Thus, the inter-model spread in Arctic warming is strongly influenced by the non-radiative feedbacks (HSTOR and HFLUX) in sea ice-retreat regions.
