<p id="Par20" class="p">The SAF PTCs suggest a different relationship with regional warming. The summer SAF PTCs’ dependence on regional warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>) resembles a ‘U-shape’—large PTCs in regions of small and large warming. Since regions that warm most in summer also warm most in fall/winter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), this suggests that the regional warming pattern itself is partially independent of the SAF, also supported by Kim et al.
