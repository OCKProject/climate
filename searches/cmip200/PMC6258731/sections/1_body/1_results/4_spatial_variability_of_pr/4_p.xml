<p id="Par19" class="p">Individual SEB terms contribute differently to the regional warming pattern. LWCS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>) and CRE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5e</xref>) PTCs indicate a direct relationship with the regional warming pattern, where larger PTCs are found in regions of larger warming. Models overwhelmingly agree on the relationship between the regional warming and LWCS PTCs. The correspondence between regional characteristics of LWCS and warming indicates a direct local relationship exhibiting very little inter-model spread and supported by the small spatial variation in the LWCS PTC ensemble standard deviation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4i</xref>). The CRE PTCs exhibit a larger inter-model spread and smaller PTCs than LWCS. Regions that warm the most show a positive year-round CRE PTC.
