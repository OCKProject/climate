<p id="Par18" class="p">Sorting regional PTCs by the local warming amount (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) indicates the most important terms driving the inter-model spread. Evident from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, regions with the most warming exhibit the largest inter-model spread between the PTCs; the only exception being summer SAF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>). Finding the largest inter-model spread in regions that warm the most may not seem surprising; however, this result is not guaranteed. This result supports our conclusion that the mechanisms driving the inter-model spread in AA operate regionally.
