<p id="Par21" class="p">HSTOR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>) and HFLUX (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c</xref>) show monotonic relationships between PTCs and regional warming. HFLUX is negative (surface cooling) in regions that warm most and positive (surface warming) in regions that warm least, the opposite holds for HSTOR. Further, HFLUX and HSTOR PTCs are very close to zero in regions of modest warming, primarily land regions. This behavior indicates that changes in HFLUX control HSTOR and the regional surface heating/cooling rates. The largest inter-model spread in HSTOR and HFLUX PTCs are found in the regions of greatest warming (sea ice retreat regions) exhibiting an inter-model range exceeding 40 K. Overall, these results suggest that the regions that warm the most exhibit a strong summer SAF and fall/winter HFLUX and HSTOR PTCs.
