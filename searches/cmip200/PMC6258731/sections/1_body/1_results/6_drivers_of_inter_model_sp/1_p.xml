<p id="Par28" class="p">The largest inter-model differences in the warming response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and feedback contributions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) are found in sea ice retreat regions. These regions exhibit the largest summer SAF and fall/winter HFLUX/HSTOR PTCs, as well as the largest LWCS increases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The HFLUX and HSTOR PTCs also show the largest inter-model differences in sea ice retreat regions. These factors suggest that the local mechanism drives the inter-model spread.
