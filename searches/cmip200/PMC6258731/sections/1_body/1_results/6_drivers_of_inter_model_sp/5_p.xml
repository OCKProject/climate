<p id="Par32" class="p">Inter-model differences in sea ice retreat regions have non-local effects through the atmospheric circulation. Increased HFLUX warms, moistens, and produces clouds locally, increasing LWDN, deepening the OML, and contributing to a delayed fall sea ice freeze-up. The influence of local HFLUX changes on the Arctic-wide LWCS requires the atmospheric circulation to disperse this energy. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8c, d</xref> shows a statistically significant linear regression slope between model fall/winter HFLUX PTC in the Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas and the spatial pattern of ΔLWCS; models with a larger magnitude fall/winter HFLUX PTC in sea ice retreat regions generate a larger Arctic-wide LWCS PTC. Comparing Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8c, d</xref> indicates a larger Arctic-wide LWCS PTC due to ΔHFLUX in the Beaufort-Chukchi Seas, suggesting that the atmospheric circulation is more sensitive to a perturbation in this region. The anti-correlation between ΔOHF
 <sub class="sub">SEASONAL</sub> and ΔAPHT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>) suggests that the inter-model differences in how this energy is dispersed are not from the large-scale circulation, but due to the local circulation. We infer that local atmospheric circulation differences contribute to the inter-model spread in AA by influencing how energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions is dispersed.

 </sup> hypothesize a possible mechanism whereby reduced fall/winter sea ice induces a thermal contrast between the Arctic Ocean and the colder Arctic continents driving a circulation response, termed a shallow winter monsoon, promoting stronger HFLUX.
