 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref> illustrates the series of relationships that contribute to the inter-model spread due to the local mechanism in sea ice retreat regions. First, the SAF and increased summer heat storage cannot directly increase HFLUX, rather increased summer heat storage supports a delayed fall sea ice freeze-up and a positive fall/winter air–sea temperature gradient (

 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a</xref> illustrates that models with less fall/winter sea ice produce larger HFLUX. Increased HFLUX is supported by stronger air–sea temperature gradients (Fig.
