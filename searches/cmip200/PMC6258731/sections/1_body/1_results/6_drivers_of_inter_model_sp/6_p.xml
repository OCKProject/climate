<p id="Par33" class="p">OML depth modulates the seasonal energy transfer and can impact the inter-model spread in AA. Eight CMIP5 models that archived OML depth show very large inter-model differences in the relationships between OML depth, SIC, and HFLUX in Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas regions. A deeper OML contains a higher heat capacity supporting larger HFLUX and less sea ice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). Moreover, the average OML depth in the Barents/Kara Seas region ranges from 13 to 95 m in fall. Motivated by this inter-model spread and the relationship in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, we hypothesized that the OML depth influences the inter-model spread in AA by modulating the seasonal energy transfer. However, we found no correlation between the mean state OML depth or its change with AA. The lack of correlation may indicate a bias in the model representation of OML dynamics, such as the known bias in upper ocean vertical mixing

 </sup>. Despite the lack of correlation, this range of OML depth significantly influences the ability of the ocean to store energy and modulate surface turbulent fluxes, sea ice variability, and the atmospheric circulation. Therefore, an improved understanding of the causes and consequences of the inter-model spread in OML depth and its relationship with sea ice and surface turbulent fluxes is needed.
