<p id="Par29" class="p">The local mechanism links the SAF, HSTOR, and HFLUX terms through seasonal energy transfer. To test our hypothesis that differences in the local mechanism explain the AA inter-model spread, we identify a metric based upon the amplitude of seasonal energy exchanges—the seasonal ocean heat flux (OHF
 <sub class="sub">SEASONAL</sub>). OHF
 <sub class="sub">SEASONAL</sub> is defined as the difference between the month of minimum and maximum HSTOR and ΔOHF
 <sub class="sub">SEASONAL</sub> represents its change by 2100. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref> shows a statistically significant relationship between the ΔOHF
 <sub class="sub">SEASONAL</sub> and AA (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.89), supporting our hypothesis. Using ΔOHF
 <sub class="sub">SEASONAL</sub> as an observational constraint on projected AA may lack practical relevance if the signal emergence does not occur before warming. Conversely, the remote forcing mechanism, represented by ΔAPHT (see Methods), anticorrelates with AA suggesting that it dampens the inter-model spread (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>). Thus, the seasonal exchanges of energy related to the local feedback mechanism widen the inter-model spread in AA.
