 <sub class="sub">SEASONAL</sub> through a stronger summer SAF and a larger fall/winter HFLUX (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref>). This seasonal energy transfer is amplified in sea ice retreat regions, such as the Barents/Kara and Beaufort/Chukchi Seas regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d, e</xref>) and does not operate in ice-free ocean areas (not shown). Therefore, models accomplish a stronger seasonal transfer of energy through a larger summer SAF, storing heat in the ocean and enhancing fall/winter HFLUX in sea ice retreat regions.
