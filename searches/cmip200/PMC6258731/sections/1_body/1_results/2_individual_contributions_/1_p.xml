<p id="Par10" class="p">The presence of surface ice and the massive amounts of energy sequestered and released during water phase change indicates that the surface energy budget (SEB) is more relevant to the Arctic surface temperature than the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy budget. Previous work demonstrates that the surface and TOA perspectives can show opposite signs for the individual feedback contributions to warming, as Taylor et al.

 </sup> illustrated for clouds. Our SEB decomposition approach analyzes the energy flux changes and how they contribute to AA in each model (see Methods) by linearly decomposing the total surface temperature change into partial temperature contributions (PTCs). These terms include SAF, cloud radiative effect (CRE), changes in shortwave clear-sky radiation unrelated to SAF (SWCS), longwave clear-sky radiation (LWCS), ocean heat storage and transport (HSTOR), and surface turbulent fluxes (HFLUX, positive from atmosphere to ocean). In this decomposition, the LWCS term includes the effects of CO

 </sup> because biases due to the decomposition approach interfere with the assessment of inter-model differences. The HSTOR term represents the surface energy imbalance, including surface heat storage and ocean heat transport, computed as a residual (see Methods). Since the heat storage capacity of land is small compared to ocean, this term represents ocean heat content. Ocean heat transport, while potentially important to the inter-model spread, could not be assessed separately because few CMIP5 models archived the necessary output. This limits our ability to consider ocean heat storage and transport separately; however, previous work demonstrated that ocean heat storage in the mixed layer dominates changes in ocean heat transport in CMIP5 models over the 21

 </sup>; thus, we consider HSTOR changes to be from ocean heat storage.
