 </sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows a strong seasonality in SAF, CRE, HSTOR, and HFLUX. The SAF exhibits significant warming contributions peaking in June/July that mirror the increased HSTOR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, c</xref>). While the SAF is partially offset by negative CRE PTCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), summer SAF increases the energy deposited into the ocean

 </sup>. The negative HSTOR PTC (April–September) represents the accumulation of solar energy during spring and summer (more energy into the surface than out). Evidenced by the approximate equivalence of the combined SAF + CRE to HSTOR, changes in SAF and CRE primarily determine the summer HSTOR PTC. In fall/winter, HSTOR and HFLUX are approximately equivalent indicating that model HFLUX determines the fall/winter surface cooling rate change. From a process perspective, HFLUX is controlled by the air–sea temperature contrast, strongly influenced by both the presence of sea ice and atmospheric advection

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d</xref> are more than offset by positive fall/winter LWCS PTCs (not shown).
