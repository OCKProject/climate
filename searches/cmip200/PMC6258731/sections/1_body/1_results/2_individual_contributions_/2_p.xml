<p id="Par11" class="p">Annual mean PTCs and formulae are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>; PTCs are additive, each representing the individual feedback contributions to the total ensemble mean Arctic temperature change of 7.38 K by 2100 in RCP8.5. At least three times larger than any other feedback, the strongest annual surface warming contributions are from LWCS changes, 7.27 K. The SAF feedback exhibits the second strongest ensemble average annual warming contribution (1.82 K) and the cooling influence of HFLUX (−1.67 K) the third largest contributor.
