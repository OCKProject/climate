 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> illustrates two primary process loops contributing to increased LWDN: remote and local mechanisms. In the remote mechanism, changes in the non-polar (tropical and mid-latitude) circulation increase atmospheric poleward heat transport (APHT) into the Arctic and warm, moisten, and produce a cloudier Arctic atmosphere, increasing LWDN. Proposed processes facilitating the increased APHT include mid-latitude circulation changes such as increased moisture intrusions
