<p id="Par27" class="p">The fact that the remote and local mechanisms contribute to AA via increased LWDN (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) also links these two mechanisms

 </sup>. These links suggest the potential for constructive and destructive interference between these mechanisms, however it is unclear how this interference influences the inter-model spread and cannot be assessed from the current methodology. We hypothesize that quantifying the strength of interactions between the local and remote mechanisms in observations is key to determining if the largest projected AA is likely. This is an important area for future work.
