<p id="Par25" class="p">Ocean mixed layer processes and heat transport modulate the local and remote mechanisms. The summer SAF warms the upper ocean making it less dense and more stably stratified. Heat entering the ocean is trapped near the surface, where it melts and thins sea ice [Graham et al. 2013]. Sea ice melt freshens the mixed layer and increases stratification encouraging the development of a near-surface temperature maximum

 </sup> â€”a layer of warm water below the shallow summer ocean mixed layer (OML). In fall, the OML cools, deepens, and transfers heat to the atmosphere via HFLUX and longwave radiation

 </sup>. More ice-free ocean supports greater upper ocean mixing by atmospheric winds, which can entrain warm water from the near-surface temperature maximum layer and delay fall sea ice freeze-up
