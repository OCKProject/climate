<p id="Par24" class="p">The local mechanism represents the combined surface albedo (radiative) and ice-insulation (non-radiative) feedbacks whereby a warmer Arctic with less sea ice stores more energy in the ocean in summer via the SAF supporting increased HFLUX in fall/winter. The increased absorbed radiation is not immediately radiated away but stored and transferred from summer to fall/winter delaying fall sea ice freeze-up and providing an energy source to the atmosphere
