<p id="Par14" class="p">The model spread between the contributions of individual SEB terms is represented by the inter-model standard deviation in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>. LWCS and HSTOR exhibit the largest annual mean, domain-averaged standard deviation, 1.4 K and 1.2 K, respectively. Considering percent differences however, the HSTOR inter-model spread is 400%. Clouds represent the second largest percentage spread at ~125%. Different from other feedbacks, the ±1 standard deviation bounds for these two feedbacks includes zero indicating that models disagree on the annual mean magnitude and sign of these contributions.
