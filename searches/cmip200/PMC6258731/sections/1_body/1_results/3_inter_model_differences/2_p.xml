<p id="Par15" class="p">The strong seasonality of the PTCs renders the annual mean picture potentially misleading. Despite a modest annual mean inter-model spread (~40%), the SAF shows the widest inter-model range in any month, between +2 to +13 K in July (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). A strong correlation (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> = −0.89) is found between annual mean albedo changes (peaking in summer) and AA (peaking in winter) even though the SAF seasonal cycle is out-of-phase with the maximum warming. The inter-model range in HSTOR (from −2 to −11 K) also maximizes in summer, aligning with the SAF inter-model spread. The inter-model spread in the CRE PTCs is the largest in fall (from +1 to +7 K) and smallest during summer. Models with the largest summer SAF do not exhibit the largest negative CRE PTC and therefore do not compensate for sea ice loss by simulating more reflective clouds. HFLUX exhibits its largest inter-model spread in winter (from −1 to −7 K) and smallest spread in summer (from −1 to +0.5 K). Seasonal cycles of the PTCs exhibit greater amplitude over ocean than land as in Laîné et al.
