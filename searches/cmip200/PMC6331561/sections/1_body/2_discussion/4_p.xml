<p id="Par19" class="p">In summary, our analyses using multiple climate indices and different vegetation growth indices (tree-ring width and NDVI) consistently showed that forests experienced enhanced growth after extreme wetness, roughly compensating for carbon sink reductions owing to drought legacy effects across the global water-limited regions. This enhanced growth pattern was not captured by the current CMIP5 models, suggesting the weak ability of current land surface models to represent the lagged effects of extreme wetness on the carbon cycle, although increasingly observational studies have reported that previous water conditions have substantial legacy impacts on subsequent vegetation dynamics at local, regional, and global scales

 </sup>. The findings of this study indicate that extreme wetness events have significant and positive hysteresis impacts on forest ecosystem processes. The enhanced growth can at least be partly explained by structural and/or biogeochemical carryover effects, yet studies based on manipulative experiments are needed in the future to clarify the underlying physiological mechanisms.
