<p id="Par16" class="p">Our analyses revealed substantially enhanced tree radial growth and enhanced vegetation greenness after extreme wetness years across the global water-limited regions (where tree chronologies and/or NDVI pixels showing significantly positive correlation with climate indices). Previous studies have reported that extreme wetness has a significant impact on forest ecosystems

 </sup>. However, these studies are limited to few sites or specific ecosystems. Here, we expanded the analysis to much larger temporal and broader spatial scales to gain more knowledge of how different types (dry vs. wet, gymnosperm vs. angiosperm) of forests respond to antecedent extreme wetness.
