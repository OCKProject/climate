<p id="Par17" class="p">The effects of extreme wetness have strong and pervasive positive impacts on tree radial growth in the following several years, especially in dry forests. This means that trees, especially in dry environments, are particularly sensitive to extreme wetness pulses and these pulses can largely stimulate tree radial growth. The enhanced tree radial growth after extreme wetness in dry forests has a potentially significant impact on long-term carbon storage and the inter-annual variability of the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle. A previous study estimated that the drought legacy effect could lead to a substantial loss of carbon in semi-arid forests

 </sup>, but our study suggests that this may be largely compensated over time by the increased growth after wet years. However, insufficient compensation, that is, negative asymmetry between dry and wet year responses, was detected in some regions (such as southwestern North America) and species (such as angiosperms).
