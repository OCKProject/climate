<p id="Par18" class="p">The enhanced tree radial growth after extreme wetness can at least partly be explained by structural and/or biogeochemical carryover effects from the antecedent year. Forest ecosystems tend to have more leaves and roots than average owing to excess carbon storage after extreme wetness

 </sup>, thus allowing more photosynthesis and the exhaustive exploitation of resources (e.g., water, solar radiation, and nutrients) in the following years, leading to enhanced growth. Another possible reason accounting for the enhanced growth is increased nutrient availability, such as increased nitrogen (N) availability, owing to more decomposition by microorganisms in the years following extreme wetness in areas where N availability depends on litter input

 </sup>, facilitating tree radial growth. In addition, as mortality is not recorded or measured by tree-ring records, the potential positive legacy effects (self-thinning effects) for surrounding trees from drought-induced mortality are not assessed in this study. Interestingly, the intuitive explanation for the enhanced growth resulting from soil water carryover from the previous wet year is not the major contributor to the enhanced growth because no significant partial autocorrelation coefficient was found in this study (partial autocorrelation coefficient (PAC)
