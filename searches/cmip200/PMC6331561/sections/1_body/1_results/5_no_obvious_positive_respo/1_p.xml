<p id="Par15" class="p">Limited or no enhanced growth after extreme wetness years (exceeding the 95th quantile of annual forcing precipitation in each pixel from each model) was found from the CMIP5 model outputs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The correlation coefficients (mean 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.05) between wood carbon content (a variable of the CMIP5 output, see Methods) and the climate indices were much smaller than those from tree-ring width. Some models (CanESM2, MRI-ESM1, CMCC-CESM, CCSM4) showed slightly enhanced growth after extreme wetness for 1–5 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), but this enhanced growth anomaly was very small (mean value &lt; 1%) relative to that diagnosed from tree-ring width and NDVI series. None of the six models from CMIP5 captured the enhanced growth after extreme wetness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), indicating the possibility of lacking some mechanisms to represent the legacy effects of extreme wetness in the current state-of-the-art land surface models.
