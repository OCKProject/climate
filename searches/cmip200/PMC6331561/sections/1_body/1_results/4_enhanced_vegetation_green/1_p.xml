<p id="Par14" class="p">The spatial pattern of Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the NDVI
 <sub class="sub">GS</sub> (mean NDVI during the growing season, see Methods) and climate indices was similar to that of tree-ring width (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b, c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11</xref>). Among the studied pixels, 32% pixels were significantly correlated with the soil moisture, 18% were significantly correlated with the P−PET, and 16% were significantly correlated with the SPEI, suggesting that the NDVI
 <sub class="sub">GS</sub> is also most tightly related to soil moisture. Among the pixels where the NDVI
 <sub class="sub">GS</sub> was significantly correlated with the climate indices and experienced greenness changes after extreme drought or wetness, the majority of pixels showed enhanced greenness (SPEI, 70%; P−PET, 71%; soil moisture, 58%) after extreme wetness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d, e, f, i</xref>). The largest enhancements of greenness after extreme wetness were observed in dry regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref>), such as southern African, southwestern North America and Australia, for both the SPEI and P−PET (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d, e</xref>). Reduced NDVI
 <sub class="sub">GS</sub> values after extreme drought were also detected in arid and semi-arid regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3g, h</xref>). The overall growth compensation of extreme wetness for extreme drought was sufficient for both the SPEI (8% ± 4% vs. −7% ± 3%), P−PET (9% ± 4% vs. −6% ± 3%) and soil moisture (2% ± 2% vs. −1% ± 2%) with prominent compensation effect in Australia, southern South America, and southern Africa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
