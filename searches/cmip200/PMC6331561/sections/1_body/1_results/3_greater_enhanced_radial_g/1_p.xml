<p id="Par11" class="p">The enhanced growth after extreme wetness was significantly greater for gymnosperms than angiosperms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b, d, f</xref>). But enhanced growth anomalies after extreme wetness were comparable to reduced growth anomalies after extreme drought in gymnosperms for all three climate indices. In contrast, enhanced growth anomalies after extreme wetness were smaller than the reduced growth anomalies after extreme drought for angiosperms when using SPEI and P−PET, implying adequate compensation for gymnosperms but not for the angiosperms.
