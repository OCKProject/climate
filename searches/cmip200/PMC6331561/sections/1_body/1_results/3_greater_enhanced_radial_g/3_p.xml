<p id="Par13" class="p">The spatial patterns of Pearson’s correlation coefficients between tree-ring width and the three different climate indices were similar, with high values observed in arid or semi-arid regions, such as mid-western North America, Inner Asia, and southern Europe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, b, c</xref>). The mean Pearson’s correlation coefficient was higher between ring width index and soil moisture (mean 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.22) compared with those for SPEI (mean 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.18) and P−PET (mean 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.16), suggesting that tree radial growth was more closely related to the soil moisture conditions. Significant enhanced growth after extreme wetness was widely observed in dry forests of the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d, e, f</xref>), where tree radial growth was strongly controlled by the soil moisture availability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a, b, c</xref>). The most prominent enhanced growth after extreme wetness was observed in western North America and in Western Europe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d, e, f</xref>). The enhanced growth for SPEI and P−PET was larger than that for soil moisture, and reduced growth after extreme drought using SPEI and P−PET was lower than that for soil moisture (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2g, h, i</xref>); thus, the compensation for SPEI and P−PET was more sufficient than that for soil moisture (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2j, k, l</xref>). Growth suppression after extreme wetness was detected in central North America, for SPEI and P−PET (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d, e</xref>), and in southern North America for soil moisture (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2f</xref>). By contrast, the strongest drought legacy effects were observed in the southwestern United States and northern Europe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2g, h, i</xref>). Notably, the absolute values of enhanced growth after extreme wetness were smaller than those for reduced growth after extreme drought in the southwestern North America for all three climate indices, indicating insufficient compensation in this region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2j, k, l</xref>).
