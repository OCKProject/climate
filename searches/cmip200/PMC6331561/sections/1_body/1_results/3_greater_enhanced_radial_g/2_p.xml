<p id="Par12" class="p">The gymnosperms in both wet and dry regions showed substantially greater enhanced growth than that in angiosperms (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>), which probably was associated with their intrinsic hydraulic or nutrient utilization characteristics. By contrast, much smaller enhanced growth after extreme wetness was found for the angiosperms in wet regions, and even slightly reduced growth after extreme wetness was observed for the angiosperms in dry regions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). Sufficient compensation was found in the gymnosperms in wet regions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). Within the gymnosperms, greater enhanced growth was observed in Cupressaceae than in the other main gymnosperm family, Pinaceae (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>). Meanwhile, the reduced growth in Cupressaceae after extreme drought was smaller than that in Pinaceae, leading to sufficient compensation for Cupressaceae but insufficient compensation for Pinaceae.
