<p id="Par8" class="p">We found that enhanced growth lasted 1–5 years after extreme wetness in the tree-ring chronologies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The magnitude of enhanced tree radial growth to wetness was found to be similar when using the SPEI (22% ± 7% increase in growth above normal conditions, calculated by the difference between observed and predicted growth with a linear model, integrated value of the whole enhanced growth period) and P−PET (21% ± 6%), but a smaller increase (10% ± 5%) was found using soil moisture. The enhanced growth duration differed according to the choice of climate indices, with 5 years for the SPEI, 3–5 years for the P−PET, and 3 years for soil moisture. These results indicate that both the duration and magnitude of enhanced growth after extreme wetness depend upon the water availability indices used to characterize water availability but give broadly consistent (all enhanced growth on average) results. However, the relative magnitude of enhanced growth after extreme wetness was globally (across all sites in different regions) comparable to the magnitudes of reduced growth after extreme drought for the three water availability indices (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). The mean compensation ratio (enhanced growth after wetness divided by reduced growth after drought) was 93 ± 8%, suggesting that, on average globally, extreme wetness has offset the negative impacts of extreme drought when considering tree-ring growth anomalies (not account for stand mortality, as drought-induced mortality is generally not sampled or reported by tree-ring records).
