<p id="Par9" class="p">Growth changes caused by extreme wetness were also detected using partial autocorrelation analysis (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Enhanced growth was consistently observed regardless of the climate indices used (see above and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>) or the percentile thresholds adopted to define extreme wet years (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). An additional null linear model (i.e., randomly selected the same number years as fake extreme wetness to calculate the growth change pattern, see Methods) indicated that non-climatic drivers (e.g., CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, nutrient availability, and disturbance history) of the positive autocorrelation in the chronologies did not significantly influence the inferred enhanced growth (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). To test whether the increasing nitrogen (N) deposition and/or rising CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> influences our findings, we further analyzed post-wetness and post-drought effects at three epochs (~ 20 years each epoch) in the last 60 years. We found the tree growth recovery from extreme events is getting faster during last six decades, but the enhanced tree radial growth after extreme wetness all sufficiently compensated for the growth deficit after extreme drought at the three epochs (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>), suggesting the trends of N and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> also do not change our findings. The magnitude of enhanced growth after extreme wet events was negatively correlated with mean background annual precipitation (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.13, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) but not with temperature (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.03, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.50) nor with the intensity of the extreme wetness (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.00, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.93) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>). These results suggest that the enhanced growth after extreme wetness is higher in regions with lower mean annual precipitation.
