<p id="Par10" class="p">The enhanced growth after extreme wetness in dry forests (with regional mean annual precipitation &lt; 400 mm, regardless of the complex topography-dependent forest distribution) was significantly higher than that in wet forests (mean annual precipitation &gt; 800 mm) based on the SPEI (24% ± 8% vs. 13% ± 6%, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 2.01, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and P−PET (29% ± 12% vs. 3% ± 3%, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 4.06, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>, d) and slightly higher when using soil moisture (5% ±5% vs. 4% ± 6%, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 0.5, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.1) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1f</xref>). Reduced growth after extreme drought was also significantly larger in dry forests than that in wet forests (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Enhanced growth anomalies after extreme wetness and reduced growth anomalies after extreme drought in dry forest ecosystems were thus both greater in magnitude than those in wet forests, indicating that trees growing in dry regions are more sensitive to fluctuations in moisture condition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b, d, f</xref>). Similar results were generated when using only precipitation instead of water availability indices (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). Nevertheless, the enhanced growth anomalies after extreme wetness were smaller than the reduced growth anomalies after extreme drought in dry forests for all three climate indices, and the reverse was true in the wet forests (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b, d, f</xref>).
