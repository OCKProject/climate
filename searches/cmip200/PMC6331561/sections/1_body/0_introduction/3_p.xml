 </sup>. Nonetheless, the scarcity and relatively short duration of field experiments make it difficult to obtain a full picture of how forests respond to extreme wetness, a response that likely differs among regions and ecosystems. In this study, we analyze 1929 stand-level tree-ring chronologies, containing 83,107 site-years across the globe covering the period of 1948–2013, complemented by 32-year of global satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data together with land surface model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5), to investigate the growth response of forests after extreme wetness across the global water-limited regions, i.e., tree-ring sites and/or NDVI pixels showing significant (
