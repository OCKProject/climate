<p id="Par7" class="p">We found that substantial enhanced radial growth after extreme wetness lasted for 1â€“5 years, and mostly compensated for the growth deficit from drought legacy effect. In detail, the enhanced radial growths were greater in dry forests and gymnosperms. By contrast, no obvious positive response after extreme wetness was captured by CMIP5 models.</p>
