<p id="Par6" class="p">We investigated tree radial growth after extreme wetness and compared the legacy effects of extreme wetness and droughts. Extreme wetness and droughts were defined as years when climate indices related to water availability exceeded the 95th quantile and were below the 5th quantile of their site-level distribution during the period of coverage of each data set, respectively. Tree-ring width master chronologies were obtained from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank

 </sup>. Only chronologies with &gt; 25 years of data within the period of 1948–2013 were selected. We defined the legacy effects of extreme wetness and drought as the difference between actual (ring width index) and predicted growth (based on a linear climate-growth model, see Methods) after extreme wetness and drought

 </sup> (for the 0–100 cm soil depth, all averaged over each year, see Methods). To avoid overlapping effects of extreme wetness and drought, only isolated extreme wetness and drought events (one event within a 5-year window) were considered. To extend the analysis of pointwise tree-ring time series, we also investigated NDVI changes after extreme wetness and extreme drought using the same protocol. NDVI is not equal to tree radial growth but is used here as a proxy of productivity

 </sup>. Further, we calculated effects of antecedent extreme wetness on current-year wood production from the output (wood biomass carbon per unit land area, see Methods) of six land surface models from the CMIP5. Specifically, we aimed to answer the following questions: Whether and to what extent tree radial growths change after extreme wetness? If tree stems experience enhanced growth after extreme wetness, can this growth enhancement compensate for the drought legacy effects across the global water-limited regions? Are the observed growth responses to extreme wetness captured by CMIP5 land surface models?
