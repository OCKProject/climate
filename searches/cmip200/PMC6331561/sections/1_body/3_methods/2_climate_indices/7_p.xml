 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). The comparison shows that the correlation coefficients between tree radial growth and these different climate indices exhibit similar spatial patterns (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>), with higher correlation coefficients in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. The correlation coefficients between tree radial growth and SPEI03 (with a timescale of 3 months), scPDSI, and CPC soil moisture were relatively higher than those of the three monthly global precipitation data sets (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Moreover, a similar enhanced growth pattern after extreme wetness was observed for the different climate indices (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>), strengthening the robustness of our findings.
