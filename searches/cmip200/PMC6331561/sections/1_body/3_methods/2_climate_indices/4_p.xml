 </sup> rather than CRU TS 3.22 was used to calculate P−PET to gain a different index from SPEI (calculated based on precipitation and PET both from CRU). The PREC/L precipitation data sets (covering the period of 1948–2010) were constructed using the optimal interpolation technique applied to gauge observations from over 17,000 stations collected in the Global Historical Climatology Network and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System data sets
