<p id="Par37" class="p">To test whether non-climatic drivers (e.g., CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, nutrient availability changes, or disturbance history) with potentially positive autocorrelation in chronologies influence the findings of this study, we constructed a random null model. In this random null model, we firstly randomly picked the same number of years for each site than extreme wet years to obtain fake wet extremes. Then, we conducted the same analysis of growth change anomalies after each selected year and repeated this process 5000 times, and concluded to no significant growth change. This suggests that random non-climate effects do not affect our main conclusions (Supplementary Fig.Â
