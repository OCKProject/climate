<p id="Par32" class="p">Two methods were used to quantify changes in the tree-ring width chronologies after extreme wetness/drought: the residual value of the observed tree-ring width minus the predicted growth after extreme wetness based on a linear climate-growth relationship and partial autocorrelation analysis. These two effective methods have been used in previous studies to quantify the legacy effects of drought on forest
