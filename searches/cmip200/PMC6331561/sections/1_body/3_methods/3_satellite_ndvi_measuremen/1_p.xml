<p id="Par29" class="p">The latest version of the biweekly NDVI data set, which was derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer observations, during 1982 to 2013 were obtained from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS,

This data set has been processed to address various deleterious effects, including calibration loss, orbital drift, sensor degradation, intersensor differences, cloud cover, zenith angle, and volcanic aerosols

 </sup>. The GIMMS NDVI3g data set has a spatial resolution of 0.083° (~ 8 km) and was aggregated to a spatial resolution of 0.5° to match the climate indices. It has been widely used to characterize land cover and to monitor spatiotemporal changes in vegetation activity and productivity in response to climate variations and extreme events both regionally and globally

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>,

Pixels with multiyear mean annual NDVI values below 0.1 during 1982 to 2013 were removed from further analyses.
