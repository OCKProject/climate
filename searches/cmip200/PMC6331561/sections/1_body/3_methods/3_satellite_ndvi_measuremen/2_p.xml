 </sup> to investigate greenness changes from the NDVI3g. We grouped evergreen broadleaf forest, evergreen needle-leaf forest, deciduous needle-leaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, and mixed forest as forests; closed shrub lands, open shrub lands, woody savannas, and savannas were categorized as shrubs. As many tree-ring sites were located in shrub areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">15</xref>), we also investigated the vegetation greenness changes of shrubs (defined in this study) after extreme wetness/drought. In addition, the woody characteristics of the shrubs also facilitated comparison with the woody biomass outputs from the CMIP5. The classification was based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land cover product MOD12C1 (

It identifies 17 land cover classes (nine types were used in this study) defined by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program scheme (Supplementary Fig.
