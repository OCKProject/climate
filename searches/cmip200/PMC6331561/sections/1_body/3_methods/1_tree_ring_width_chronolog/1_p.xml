The ITRDB is the world’s largest public archive of tree-ring data and is managed by the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) Paleoclimatology Team and the World Data Center for Paleoclimatology. Hundreds of research groups and dendrochronologists from all over the world contributed generously to this data bank. The tree-ring samples were collected in the field by using increment borer to get a cylinder of wood along the radius of a tree by investigators. Typically, the minimum threshold is 20 trees per site to get reliable statistical analysis, but this will vary according to the specific characteristics (such as the strength of the climate signal) of the sites and the purpose of the collection. Two samples were generally collected per tree to facilitate cross-correlation and accurate dating of the annual ring. The samples are mounted and finely sanded to allow cross-dating and measured the widths of the annual rings. The ring widths are measured to the ~ 0.01 mm or 0.001 mm and recorded in computerized data files. Then, a statistical evaluation of the cross-dating has been conducted by using the COFECHA program

 </sup>. After that, cross-dated raw ring width measurements are converted to site-level chronologies of standardized ring width indices via detrending (commonly based on modified negative exponential curve fitting or cubic smoothing spline

 </sup>. There are several types of standardization methods, and we collected the site-level standard chronologies generated by each research group and assumed that those researchers selected the most suitable standardization for their data

 </sup>. We chose these chronologies based on three criteria: they covered at least 25 years during 1948–2013, the basic information (e.g., species name, longitude, latitude, elevation) was complete, and the chronologies had detrended-only files to remove longer-term signals embedded within the raw ring width.
