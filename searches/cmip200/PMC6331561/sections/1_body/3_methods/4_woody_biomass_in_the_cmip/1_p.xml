Only one realization of each model is needed because enhanced growth should be insensitive to the initial conditions and be presented in all realizations

 </sup>. We only used the pixels in the model output in which the tree-ring width index was significantly and positively correlated with the climate indices and calculated the growth change pattern after extreme wetness using the same approach as the calculation of the tree radial growth change pattern.
