  <p class="p">Substantial enhanced radial growth after extreme wetness. Enhanced/reduced growth (unitless) after extreme wet/drought years was observed across 1929 tree-ring chronologies using the SPEI 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>, P−PET 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>, and soil moisture (for the 0–100 cm soil depth) 
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>. Enhanced growth across sites that were significantly correlated with climate indices were reclassified into different mean annual precipitation bins and gymnosperm and angiosperm forest types
