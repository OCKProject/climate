  <p class="p">Response to extreme wetness in woody biomass from six CMIP5 models. Growth change patterns after extreme wet years (exceeding the 95th quantile of the annual precipitation forcing data distribution during the analysis period) in the same grid cells in which the tree-ring chronologies were located (those significantly correlated with the climate indices)
