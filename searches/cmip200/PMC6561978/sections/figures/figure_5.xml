  <p class="p">Effectiveness of the protected areas of Atlantic Forest in safeguarding snake species. Relationship between present and future snake species richness, (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) for oviparous species and (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) for viviparous species. Open blue circles correspond to richness according to a null model of random location of protected areas in the biome. Filled red circles indicate protected areas predicted to have severe species richness losses. Orange filled circles indicate protected areas predicted to have mild species richness losses. Green filled circles indicate protected areas predicted to gain species richness. Dashed lines are the extrapolated regressions of the expected species richness according to the null model. Solid lines indicate the regression of modelled species richness in the future against modelled species richness in the present. Maps of protected areas predicted to gain (green) or lose (orange, red) species in future changing (
