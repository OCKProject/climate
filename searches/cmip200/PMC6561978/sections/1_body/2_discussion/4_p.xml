<p id="Par18" class="p">Our data indicate that Atlantic Forest snakes, especially oviparous species, may suffer drastic range loss by 2080. Among the more alarming results is the predicted extinction of 
 <italic class="italic">Phalotris lemniscatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clelia hussami</italic> from the biome. The former is a species distributed from the state of Santa Catarina in Brazil to Uruguay

 </sup> and the latter is an endemic species of the Atlantic Forest
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>
 </sup>, for which habitat suitability losses will imply global extinction. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">lemniscatus</italic> has only 1.23% of its current distribution covered by the existing PAs, and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hussami</italic> has its current distribution area completely unprotected (MPO = 0.00%; see Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>), which tend to decisively contribute to the disappearance of these species from the biome irrespective of climate change effect, since unprotected ranges expose the species to multiple, impactful human stressors. Conversely, 
 <italic class="italic">Xenodon merremii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Drymarchon corais</italic> should benefit from climate change. These oviparous species have opportunistic dietary habits and a wide geographic distribution, and can also be found in open areas in the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes
