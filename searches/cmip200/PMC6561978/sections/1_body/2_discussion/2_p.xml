<p id="Par16" class="p">However, besides the thermoregulation and tolerance of the species, structural features of habitats can mitigate the effects of climate change addressed here. When the thermal conditions increase, abundantly shaded environments can provide favourable conditions and serve as thermal refuges or retreat sites

 </sup>. This more pristine condition of the habitat could explain the greater species richness in this region for reproductive groups, as well as lower losses and turnover of species. Also, it is expected that the retraction of ranges predicted for 2080 reduce species richness peaks for the very small portion of this region that is close to mountains. Species with access to mountainous regions may migrate to higher altitudes, which have lower temperatures
