  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>
 </sup>. In this sense, our study points out a very limited capacity of the existing PAs to protect snakes at the current time and in the face of climate change. The mean percentage of overlap between snake species distribution and PAs territories ranged from 2.63% to 3.63% considering both reproductive groups and times. These are values markedly lower than those reported for reptiles, amphibians and bats from Europe
