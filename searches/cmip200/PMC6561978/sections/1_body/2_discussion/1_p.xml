<p id="Par15" class="p">Our study showed that the changes and losses of climatically suitable areas in the Atlantic Forest projected for 2080 can trigger important range shifts of snake species, with most species suffering range contractions towards their distribution centers. In these cases, the persistence of species in their original ranges will be dependent on the degree of physiological and phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary adaptation of each species to changing conditions (either abiotic or biotic), or a combination of these processes

 </sup>. Nonetheless, the behavioural plasticity of snakes to adjust to suboptimal thermal conditions seems to be considerably limited
