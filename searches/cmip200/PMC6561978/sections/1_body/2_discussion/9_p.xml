<p id="Par23" class="p">In addition, our analyses pointed out that the major negative impact of climatic changes should occur along the PAs in the coastal line of the biome. It is also important to mention that the effectiveness of the few PAs in the south (i.e., National Park of Serra Geral) and extreme north (i.e., Biological Reserve Saltinho), here demonstrated by the gain of species in the future, is dependent on the capacity of the snakes to reach such areas. Snake species have a very low vagility

 </sup>. Thus, it is possible that climatically suitable PAs will not receive new snake species in the future due to the intrinsic dispersal limitation of this group, and by the lack of essential biotic interactions
