<p id="Par17" class="p">Our results showed that mainly the southwest and northeast regions of the Atlantic Forest should experience great losses of habitat suitability and a greater turnover of snake species over time. These areas have been severely impacted by human activities. Forests in the northeast have been largely devastated by cattle ranching and the timber industry
