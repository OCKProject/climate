<p id="Par22" class="p">Regardless of the reproductive group, the conservation scenario is especially worrisome for the snake species in the lower left corner of the MPO relationship polygon, which have restricted distributions and practically no protection from PAs network (see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Among the more alarming cases are 
 <italic class="italic">Chironius carinatus</italic>, which is entirely unprotected by existing PAs at current and future times and 
 <italic class="italic">Bothrops pirajai</italic>, which has less than 2% protection at current time and completely loses protection at future time. 
 <italic class="italic">Clelia hussami</italic>, which is not currently protected by the existing PAs tends to become extinct in the future due to the absence of suitable environmental-climatic conditions. In this sense, we highlight the role of our study in contributing to the adoption of focal management measures to long-term protection of the Atlantic Forest snakes most prone to extinction in the face of projected climate change.
