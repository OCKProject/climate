<p id="Par13" class="p">The comparison provided by the null model indicating the gains and losses of species in PAs in the face of climate change revealed great variation between how many snake species the PAs would lose (and also gain in case of distance methods). For the vast majority of real locations of PAs the average richness for current and future climatic scenarios was lower (red dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a,c</xref>) than those obtained from the random locations of PAs (blue dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a,c</xref>). Thus, for both reproductive groups the most PAs should become highly climatically unsuitable, suffering severe species richness losses (red protected areas in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b,d</xref>), especially along the coast or in adjacent mountains. The number of PAs predicted to experience mild species losses under climate change was also high (orange protected areas, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b,d</xref>). Conversely, the number of PAs predicted to gain species (green dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a,c</xref>) was very low. Areas with such characteristic are located in the cooler southern region of the Atlantic Forest for both reproductive modes (green protected areas in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b,d</xref>), and in the extreme northern portion of biome for viviparous species (green protected areas in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>).
