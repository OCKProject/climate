<p id="Par11" class="p">We observed that oviparous species presented a broader distribution than viviparous species in the Atlantic Forest in current time, with the most species occurring in between 2,500 and 3,000 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Currently, most viviparous snakes occupy between 1,500 and 2,000 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). Our results illustrated a drastic range contraction of snakes in the Atlantic Forest Hotspot under climate change, especially for oviparous species, for which the mode of observations was reduced in four size classes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). For viviparous species, the mode of observations was reduced in two size classes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>). For both reproductive modes the majority of species should occupy only between 500 and 1,000 cells in the future (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,d</xref>). Nonetheless, it was possible to observe that one oviparous species tends to greatly expand its geographic range with climate change, occupying between 6,000 and 7,000 grid cells in future (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>; see details below).
