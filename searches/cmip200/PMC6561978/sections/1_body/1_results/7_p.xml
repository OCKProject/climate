<p id="Par14" class="p">The analysis of the mean percentage overlap (MPO) between snake species distribution and protected areas (PAs) network in Atlantic Forest revealed a negligible protection of both reproductive groups. At the current time, the mean percentage overlap was 2.33% (ranging from 0.03 to 6.08%, SD = 1.51%) for viviparous (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>) and 3.06% (ranging from 0.00 to 6.29%, SD = 1.44%) for oviparous species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). At the future time, the mean percentage overlap was 3.63% (ranging from 0.00 to 40.91, SD = 6.83%) for viviparous (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>) and 3.36% (ranging from 0.00 to17.48%, SD = 2.75%) for oviparous species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6d</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). The MPO relationship exhibited a polygonal form, evidencing a more precarious conservation scenario for the species located inside, and mainly below of the random range, for which the protection from existing PAs is respectively equal to or worse than the expected by a random distribution of the species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Within the scenario of scant protection of snakes, 35.29% and 32.35% of the viviparous species presented MPO higher than expected by chance at present and future times, respectively, and 38.23% and 29.41% of the species presented MPO not significantly different than that expected by chance at present and future times, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a,b</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). More importantly, the representativeness was lower than expected by chance for 32.35% and 29.41% viviparous species at present and future times, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a,b</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). For the oviparous snakes, we found that 60.00% and 57.40% of the species presented level of representativeness in PAs higher than expected by chance at present and future times, respectively. For 28.18% and 26.85% of the oviparous species, the MPO values were not significantly different than expected by chance at present and future times, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c,d</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). In even less favourable conditions are 11.81% and 15.74% of the oviparous species, for which the MPO values were lower than expected by chance at present and future times, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c,d</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>).
