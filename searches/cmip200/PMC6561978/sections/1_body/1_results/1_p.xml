<p id="Par8" class="p">The first two PCA axes explained a large proportion of variation between species richness maps generated by different ENMs. The accumulated proportion of variation explained by the two axes ranged from 87.3% to 93.3% for viviparous species in 2080 and oviparous species in the current time, respectively (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). In general, BIOC and GOWD produced similar results in both time periods for both reproductive groups (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The predictions of MAXENT were similar to ENFA, especially for oviparous species. The CONS model had the highest loading for the first PCA axis, reflecting the main direction of variation among suitability maps (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Consequently, only the outputs derived from the consensus of multiple ENMs (CONS) were retained for interpretation.
