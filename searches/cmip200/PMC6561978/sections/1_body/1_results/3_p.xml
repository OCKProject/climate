<p id="Par10" class="p">In general, CNRM and MRI showed two distinct species-rich areas, whereas CCSM and MIROC produced more homogeneous results, with the latter being more restrictive (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). The full ensemble model showed that in the future the species richness peaks will be restricted to a reduced portion of the central-eastern region of the biome, in locations closer to the mountains of the Atlantic Forest (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>, last column). Similar to species richness, the turnover outputs were distinct between GCMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). In general, CCSM and MRI produced similar results for both reproductive groups. Already CNRM presented lower turnover values and MIROC overestimated the composition changes across the biome. By combining the results of AOGCMs in a full ensemble model, we observed that the temporal turnover was high, especially for oviparous species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>, last column). Changes in the species composition are predicted to be greater on the western edge and on the north-eastern edge of the biome, especially for oviparous species. Values above 0.8 were found in 45.0% and 32.5% of cells covering Atlantic Forest territory for oviparous and viviparous species, respectively.
