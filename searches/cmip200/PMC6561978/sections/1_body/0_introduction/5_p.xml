<p id="Par6" class="p">In our study, we assess the effects of climate change on climatically suitable areas for the occurrence of snake species in the Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot for conservation

 </sup>. This biome, which is marked by rich diversity of endemic species, have been largely impacted by poor soil management, extensive destruction and simplification of the forests, and hence fragmentation

 </sup>. Based on ecological niche modelling, our study relies on the correlations between climate and snake species’ occurrences to estimate current and future richness patterns, as well as turnover tendencies. Considering that snakes of distinct reproductive groups respond in a particular way to alterations in climate conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>, they may also respond differently with respect to their geographical distribution given their habitat requirements. Based on this premise, we deconstructed the responses of the snakes into two functional reproductive modes (oviparous and viviparous) to identify process underlying the general distributional pattern. By predicting the current and future range size of species, we also explore, in a descriptive sense, the threat status of snake species projected at the end of the century while affected by climate change. Finally, we evaluate whether current locations of PAs in the Atlantic Forest Hotspot are efficient in protecting snake diversity in the face of climate-induced shifts in species richness inside PAs.
