<p id="Par7" class="p">Due to the ectothermic features of snakes, an analysis with ecological niche models can reflect more accurately the possible direction of species facing the climatic changes. Furthermore, snakes are pointed out as susceptible to climate change partially due to their low population size and poor dispersal capacity

 </sup>. Nevertheless, studies assessing the potential impacts of climate change on snakes’ distribution in Brazil, and specifically in the Atlantic Forest Hotspot are lacking. Besides that, most research and conservation efforts have prioritized iconic species with socio-economic interest

 </sup>. By introducing a multi-species analysis within the climate change context, identifying the species that require more conservation attention as well as analysing the effectiveness of PAs in safeguard species, our study provides useful information that aggregated to findings of other taxa should help to improve conservation strategies in the Atlantic Forest Hotspot.
