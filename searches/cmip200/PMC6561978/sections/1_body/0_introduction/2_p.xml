 </sup>. However, as they confront climate change, such areas could lose the effectiveness of their conservation function, mainly due to changes in species ranges. This trend is alarming from a conservationist’s viewpoint, because if these areas fail to protect species in the future, the current biodiversity crisis would reach unprecedented levels

 </sup>. Thus, there is an emerging need for conservation plans to abandon their traditionally static nature and move toward a more dynamic conservation criterion that takes the climate instability into account

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. For now, most solutions offered by conservation scientists and practitioners to deal with the effectiveness of conservation units in the future involves the establishment of new PAs harbouring areas with future suitable climate
