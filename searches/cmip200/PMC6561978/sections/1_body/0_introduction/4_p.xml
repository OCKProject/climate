Although changes in temperature and rainfall tend to negatively affect the physiological processes of both reproductive groups, viviparity provides important advantages because mothers are able to reduce the effects of environmental restrictions through careful behavioural thermoregulation

 </sup>. In this context, itâ€™s important to assess if snake species with these two reproductive modes tend to respond differently to climate change with respect to their geographical distribution.
