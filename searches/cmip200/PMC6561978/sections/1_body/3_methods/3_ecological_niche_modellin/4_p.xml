<p id="Par31" class="p">For all individual models, we randomly partitioned presence (and pseudo-absence in the case of Maxent) data of each species into 75% for calibration (or training) and 25% for evaluation (or test); repeating this process 50 times by cross-validation. For each ENM, we converted the continuous predictions of suitability into a binary vector of 1/0 (presence and absence in each cell), finding the threshold that maximizes sensitivity and specificity values in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) for each model and species. The ROC curve is generated by plotting the fraction of true positives vs. the fraction of false positives at various threshold settings (all the possible values between 0 and 1). Thus, the decision threshold for each model and species corresponded to the value maximizing true positive and minimizing false positive rates. The distribution area of each species was estimated obtaining 800 predictions (4 ENMs × 50 randomizations × 4 AOGCMs) for each species and time period of climatic conditions (present and future). This allowed us to generate a frequency of projections in the ensemble. Then, we generated the frequency of projections weighted by the TSS statistics for the present and future (i.e. the best models according to this metric have more weight in our consensus projections). The TSS range from −1 to +1, where values equal to +1 is a perfect prediction and values equal to or less than zero is a prediction no better than random

 </sup>. The CONS was obtained by considering the species present only in cells where at least 50% of models retained in the ensemble (the best models according to TSS metric) pointed out the species as present. The CONS was done for each AOGCM and time period (present and 2080). Thus, the final maps of richness and turnover for present and future were obtained by averaging richness values projected by CONS for each grid cell in each different AOGCM. All models were run using the computational platform Bioensembles
