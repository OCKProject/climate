<p id="Par29" class="p">We used the following bioclimatic variables in the modelling process: annual mean temperature, temperature annual range, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation of driest month and precipitation of warmest quarter, which were determined as the most independent by a factorial analysis. These variables were obtained for the present (pre-industrial) and future (mean of simulations for 2080–2100) from CMIP5 – Coupled Models Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (

We assumed the temporal stationarity (constancy of the altitude values up to 2080–2100) of this variable to perform future predictions. For estimates of future climate, we used the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory corresponding to the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 that represents a moderated emission scenario within an optimistic context. We used simulations provided by four Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs), obtained from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project – Phase 5 (CMIP5): Community Climate System Model (CCSM), Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM), Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) and Meteorological Research Institute (MRI). Original data resolution varied from 1° to 2.8° (in longitude and latitude) and both current and future climate variables were rescaled to fit our grid resolution.
