<p id="Par32" class="p">To determine the species richness patterns of Atlantic Forest snakes, we employed the modelling strategy at the community level of “predict first, assemble later”

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115" class="xref">115</xref>
 </sup> was used to compare species richness patterns derived from alternative ENMs and their consensus. This analysis allowed us i) to evaluate the degree to which different ENMs converge in estimates of regional species richness and ii) to determine which model reflects the main direction of variation among richness maps

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">85</xref>
 </sup>. In our study, only the results of the model reflecting the main direction of variation among suitability maps were interpreted. Finally, we calculated species turnover between current and future species distributions in each cell according to formula (G + L/S)/S + G, where “G” was the number of species gained, “L” the number of species lost and “S” is the contemporary species richness found in the cell
