<p id="Par27" class="p">We obtained occurrence records for 144 snake species inhabiting the Atlantic Forest from museum records (Species Link,

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>
 </sup> to map occurrence records of each species on a regular geographic grid of 10,359 cells with 0.1° (about 10 × 10 km) of spatial resolution covering all of the Atlantic Forest (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Cells corresponding to oceanic islands were excluded from analyses. We removed from analysis the species with recorded occurrence in 4 or less grid cells, since many studies demonstrate that the precision and accuracy of ENMs increase with area of species geographic distribution

 </sup>. Thus, the sampling size of the species occurrence data ranged from 5 to 816 occupied cells. We used the “Spatial Join” ArcGIS toolbox to transform species’ spatial occurrences in matrices, matching rows from the join features to the target features based on their relative spatial locations. Then, we combined vector files based on expert knowledge of the species’ ranges into an overall coverage for species distribution modelling. We only considered spatial occurrences by those species where the distribution data intersected at least a grid cell. We also used the “Count Overlapping Polygons” ArcGIS toolbox to obtain the species richness at the spatial resolution assessed, removing all duplicate records from the analyses (i.e., repeated records of a species at a single locality). The 144 species considered for analysis were classified accordingly to their reproductive modes: oviparous (110 species) or viviparous (34 species). It is possible that some areas of the biome have been poorly sampled, resulting in few records of snake in the museums (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Potential distribution modelling is able to deal with species unsatisfactorily sampled; therefore, it can remedy part of this problem.
