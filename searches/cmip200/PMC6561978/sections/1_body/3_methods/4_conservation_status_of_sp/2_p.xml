 </sup>, considering the following categories: I. species whose loss is estimated at &lt;30% for the projected time interval; II. species whose loss is estimated at 30% for the projected time interval; III. species whose loss is estimated at 50% for the projected time interval; IV. species whose loss is estimated at 80% for the projected time interval and V. species whose loss is estimated at 100% for the projected time interval (from present until 2080). It is noteworthy that these approaches only considers the effects of climate change on species distribution, thus providing a synthetic view of the specific threats imposed on the species by the alteration in climatic conditions.
