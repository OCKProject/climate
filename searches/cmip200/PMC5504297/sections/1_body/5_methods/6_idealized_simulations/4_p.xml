<p class="p">We also conduct patterned SST warming experiments for both CAM5 and GFDL, which also include decreases in sea-ice and increases in GHGs (not shown). For CAM5, SST and sea-ice concentration anomalies (2090–2099 relative to 2006–2015) from the ensemble mean of the 40 CESM LENS simulations are used. GHG concentrations and aerosol emissions are also set to the RCP8.5 2090–2099 mean. For GFDL, GHG concentrations are set to the RCP8.5 2090–2099 mean, and SST and sea-ice concentration anomalies (2090–2099 relative to 2006–2015) from the CMIP5 ensemble mean are used. These experiments are designed to resemble the CMIP5 RCP8.5 simulations, which include both patterned SST warming and increases in GHGs. We also conduct an additional patterned warming experiment, analogous to the original, but Niño 3.4 SSTs are held constant. Both CAM5 and GFDL patterned SST warming experiments yield a similar response, including a significant increase in DJF CA precipitation (2.04 and 1.66 mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively). Furthermore, both models yield tropical and extratropical dynamical responses similar to those in CMIP5 RCP8.5 models. However, a muted signal is obtained when Niño 3.4 SSTs are fixed. CA precipitation increases by only 0.38 (0.20) mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, not significant at the 90% confidence level, in CAM5 (GFDL). Consistently, the dynamical response is also much weaker.
