<p class="p">We also conduct similar uniform warming experiments (not shown) that focus on the Niño 3.4 SST region (as opposed to the entire tropical Pacific), including simulations that lack Niño 3.4 SST warming, or include only Niño 3.4 SST warming. These Niño 3.4 SST experiments yield qualitatively similar results as those based on uniform tropical Pacific SST warming-without warming of Niño 3.4 SSTs, the increase in CA precipitation, and the dynamical responses, are significantly muted.</p>
