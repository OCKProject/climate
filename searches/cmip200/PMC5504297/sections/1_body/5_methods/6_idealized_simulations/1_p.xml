<p class="p">Uniform SST warming CAM5 simulations-the atmospheric component of CESM-are conducted at 0.9° × 1.25° resolution, and integrated for 10 years. This experiment features SSTs that are 3.3 K warmer than the control, which corresponds to the annual mean SST warming anomaly (2090–2099 relative to 2006–2015) from the ensemble mean of the 40 CESM LENS realizations. We also conduct an additional uniform warming experiment that is analogous to the original, but tropical Pacific SSTs (5S–5N; 120-270E) are held constant. Finally, we conduct a uniform warming experiment where only tropical Pacific SSTs are increased (by 3.3 K). Similar experiments are conducted with GFDL AM3. Here, the SST anomaly is 3.0 K, which corresponds to the annual mean SST warming anomaly from the RCP8.5 ensemble mean. Like CAM5, GFDL AM3 is able simulate the observed teleconnection between Niño 3.4 SSTs and CA precipitation (
