<p class="p">Finally, we conduct additional uniform tropical SST warming experiments, including (1) uniform warming of the entire tropics (5S–5N; 0-360E) and (2) uniform warming of the tropical and subtropical Pacific (15S–15N; 120-270E). Both experiments yield results consistent with tropical Pacific (5S–5N; 120-170E) warming, including similar dynamical responses and a significant increase in CA precipitation. For example, uniform tropical warming yields a CA DJF precipitation increase of 1.81 (2.44) mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in CAM5 (GFDL). Uniform tropical and subtropical Pacific warming yields a CA DJF precipitation increase of 9.82 (6.37) mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in CAM5 (GFDL). Thus, we find an increase in CA precipitation is a robust feature to several patterns of uniform tropical warming.
