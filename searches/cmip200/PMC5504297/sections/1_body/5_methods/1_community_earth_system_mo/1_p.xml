<p class="p">CESM LENS simulations were downloaded from the Earth System Grid at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. They are run at 0.9° × 1.25° resolution, and span 2006–2100 using the business-as-usual scenario, RCP 8.5. Time-varying forcing includes estimated concentrations of GHGs, ozone, and aerosols. Each of the 40 realizations is identically forced; the only difference is the initial condition, which allows the assessment of internal climate variability.</p>
