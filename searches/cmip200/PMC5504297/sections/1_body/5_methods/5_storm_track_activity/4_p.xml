<p class="p">California DJF precipitation is significantly correlated with DJF storm track activity off the coast of California. The 1979/80 to 2014/15 correlation between east Pacific 
 <italic class="italic">pp</italic> from National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis and CA precipitation from Global Precipitation Climatology Project is ∼0.80. Here, the ‘east Pacific’ is defined as the area covering the region of highest CA precipitation-
 <italic class="italic">pp</italic> correlation. We adopt a similar definition of the east Pacific, but based on the ensemble mean CESM LENS correlation between 
 <italic class="italic">pp</italic> and CA precipitation. The corresponding, ensemble mean (detrended) correlation between east Pacific 
 <italic class="italic">pp</italic> and CA precipitation is 0.85 (
