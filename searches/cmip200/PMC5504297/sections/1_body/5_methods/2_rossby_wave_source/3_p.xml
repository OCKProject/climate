 </sub> is the divergent wind,

 <italic class="italic">D</italic> is the divergence. Monthly data are used to calculate

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> shows that El Niño (that is, warming of Niño 3.4 SSTs) is associated with an increase in Rossby wave generation at 500 hPa near the Niño 3.4 SST region. CMIP5 HIGH-r models reproduce this relationship (as does CESM LENS, not shown). We have also verified that the 
 <italic class="italic">RWS</italic> response-including that in the central/eastern tropical Pacific-is dominated by the first term (−
 <italic class="italic">ζD</italic>), the generation of vorticity by divergence. Thus, changes in RWS in our experiments are primarily driven by changes in divergence.
