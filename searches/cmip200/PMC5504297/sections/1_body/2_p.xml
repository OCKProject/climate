During Northern Hemisphere winter, when most of the CA precipitation increase occurs, models simulate robust changes in the mean circulation reminiscent of an El Niño teleconnection. This includes weakening of the Walker circulation, a poleward propagating Rossby wave that originates in the tropical central/eastern Pacific, a southeastward shift of the upper level winds and an increase in storm track activity in the east Pacific, and an increase in CA moisture convergence. Idealized simulations with two different models: the atmosphere component of CESM, the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref> and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Atmospheric Model version 3 (GFDL AM3)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>, show that the increase in CA precipitation is associated with tropical Pacific SST warming. CMIP5 models that better simulate the observed El Niño-CA precipitation teleconnection yield larger, and more consistent increases in CA precipitation through the 21st century.
