 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figure 4g</xref> shows the CESM LENS DJF ensemble mean trend in extratropical cyclone (storm track) activity (Methods). In the east Pacific, off the coast of California, a significant increase in storm track activity (
 <italic class="italic">pp</italic>) exists. The corresponding trend realization agreement shows most grid boxes in the east Pacific have 65â€“75% of the realizations yielding an increase in 
 <italic class="italic">pp</italic> (significant at the 95% level based on the aforementioned binomial test; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Furthermore, a significant correlation between the trend in east Pacific 
 <italic class="italic">pp</italic> and the trend in CA precipitation (across realizations) exists at 0.49 (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. For our analysis, the corresponding correlation in CMIP5 HIGH-r is 0.81 (significant at the 99% confidence level) and 0.54 (significant at the 95% confidence level) in CMIP5 LOW-r. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figure 4h</xref> also shows that CMIP5 HIGH-r yields a larger increase in east Pacific storm track activity relative to CMIP5 LOW-r.
