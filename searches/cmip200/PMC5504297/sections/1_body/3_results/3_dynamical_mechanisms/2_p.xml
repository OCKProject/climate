 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows the DJF CESM LENS ensemble mean trend in zonal (U300) and meridional (V300) wind at 300 hPa. Both show a significant increase over the California region, and more specifically, a southeastward shift of the climatological winds. A similar shift in the zonal winds across CMIP5 models was also found
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>, implying an eastward extension of the jet stream, which would help steer mid-latitude storms toward the California coast. Our results are consistent with this interpretation. The CESM LENS correlation between the U300 trend in the east Pacific and CA precipitation (across realizations) is 0.61, significant at the 99% confidence level (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> shows that CMIP5 models that better reproduce the observed correlation between Niño 3.4 SSTs and CA precipitation (that is, CMIP5 HIGH-r) yield a larger southeastward shift of the upper level winds (see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The CMIP5 HIGH-r correlation between the U300 trend in the east Pacific and CA precipitation is 0.72, significant at the 99% confidence level. The corresponding correlation in CMIP5 LOW-r is 0.51, significant at the 95% confidence level. Similar conclusions exist based on CMIP5 1% CO
