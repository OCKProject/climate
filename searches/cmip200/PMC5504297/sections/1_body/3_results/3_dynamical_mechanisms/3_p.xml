<p class="p">We note another study that relates the increase in precipitation for the west coast of North America to an increase in meridional winds
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. This, in turn, was related to strengthened zonal mean westerlies in the subtropical upper troposphere (20–40N and 100 hPa), which alters the intermediate-scale stationary wave field. Our analysis suggests the changes in meridional winds are of lesser importance to CA precipitation, as the CESM LENS and CMIP5 LOW-r correlation between the V300 trend in the east Pacific and CA precipitation is not significant at 0.15 and 0.31, respectively. The lone significant correlation occurs in CMIP5 HIGH-r at 0.51 (significant at the 95% confidence level). We also find nonsignificant correlations between CA precipitation and the zonal mean westerlies in the subtropical upper troposphere (20–40N and 100 hPa). The corresponding correlation based on CMIP5 HIGH-r and CMIP5 LOW-r is 0.28 and 0.11, respectively. Furthermore, despite the significant difference in CA precipitation projections between CMIP5 HIGH-r and CMIP5 LOW-r, the ensemble mean trend in 20–40N 100 hPa zonal mean westerlies is similar between the two model subsets, at 8.3 and 8.2 m s
