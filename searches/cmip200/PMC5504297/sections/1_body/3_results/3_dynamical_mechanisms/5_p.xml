<p class="p">These extratropical DJF changes are consistent with warming of Ni単o3.4 SSTs and the associated dynamical response in the tropics (that is, the El Ni単o-like teleconnection;

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Figures 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">6</xref> show that models yield a significant DJF increase in central/eastern tropical Pacific precipitation, weakening of the Walker circulation, a poleward propagating Rossby wave response that originates in the tropical eastern Pacific, and an increase in divergence and Rossby wave generation in the tropical central/eastern Pacific. These features are generally larger, and more robust, in CMIP5 HIGH-r models, including CESM LENS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Although model biases may influence this projection, including possible overestimation of tropical convection
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>, there are relatively fundamental arguments that support these model projections. The Walker circulation is expected to weaken due to thermodynamical constraints-tropical precipitation increases at a slower rate than water vapour (which increases according to Clausius Clapeyron scaling, assuming constant relative humidity), so the tropical overturning circulation, including the equatorial easterly trade winds, slow down
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. The Bjerknes feedback, a positive feedback between trade wind intensity and the zonal SST gradient, implies that the above changes would lead to a reduced zonal SST gradient. Warming of the central/eastern tropical Pacific SSTs, in turn, leads to an eastward shift in convection, precipitation and divergence, which would excite a Rossby wave response. Thus, models suggest continued GHG-induced warming will lead to an El-Ni単o-like climate state in the tropical Pacific
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. However, as will be discussed below, the increase in CA precipitation and the associated dynamical responses are not dependent on a reduction in the zonal SST gradient in the tropical Pacific. Model simulations with uniform SST warming also yield a robust increase in CA precipitation, including similar dynamical responses. Moreover, idealized simulations suggest warming of the tropical Pacific-not just the Ni単o 3.4 SSTs-results in a similar dynamical response and an increase in CA precipitation.
