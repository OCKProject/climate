<p class="p">We now focus on the wintertime (DJF) change in CA precipitation, and investigate possible dynamical mechanisms associated with the increase. At monthly timescales (&gt;10 days), the atmospheric moisture budget indicates that precipitation, evaporation and net moisture flux into/out of an atmospheric column through its lateral boundary are in a balance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. The CESM LENS ensemble mean increase in DJF CA precipitation is divided into a DJF moisture flux convergence (MFC) increase of 0.69 mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> century
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and an increase in evaporation of 0.23 mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> century
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). All of the MFC increase is related to an increase by the mean flow, as the MFC mean trend is 0.72 and the MFC transient trend is −0.04 mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> century
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Further decomposing the MFC mean into its dynamic and thermodynamic components (Methods) shows that all of the increase in the MFC mean is related to dynamical processes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. The dynamic component increases by 0.80, whereas the thermodynamic component decreases by −0.10 mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> century
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Thus, the increase in CA precipitation is consistent with an increase in MFC by the mean flow, and more specifically, the component related to dynamical as opposed to thermodynamical processes (that is, changes in wind as opposed to humidity).
