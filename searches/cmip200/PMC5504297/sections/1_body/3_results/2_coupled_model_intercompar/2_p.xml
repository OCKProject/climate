<p class="p">It is well known that El Niño/La Niña accounts for some of the interannual variability in CA precipitation. Observations from 1948/49 to 2014/15, including precipitation from National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration’s Precipitation Reconstruction, show the correlation between Niño 3.4 SSTs (5S–5N; 190-240E) and CA DJF precipitation is 0.36, which is significant at the 99% confidence level. Similar values are found using alternative precipitation data sets, including the Global Precipitation Climatology Project, where the corresponding correlation from 1979/80 to 2014/15 is 0.40. During winter, in response to warmer central/eastern tropical Pacific SSTs, the El Niño teleconnection is associated with weakening of the Walker circulation and an eastward shift of deep convection and associated diabatic heating, which excites a Rossby wave response that alters the extratropical circulation

All but one (FGOALS-g2) CMIP5 model-realization and all CESM LENS realizations shows warming of Niño 3.4 SSTs through the twenty-first century. Furthermore, 70% of the CMIP5 model-realizations and all CESM LENS realizations show enhanced warming of the tropical eastern Pacific (5S–5N; 190-240E) relative to the western Pacific (5S–5N; 120-170E). These results suggest a possible shift of the tropical Pacific to a more El Niño-like background state
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. Many CMIP5 models, however, are unable to reproduce the observed correlation between Niño 3.4 SST and CA DJF precipitation. On the basis of the CMIP5 RCP8.5 models, this correlation (based on detrended time series) ranges from −0.12 in MIROC-ESM to 0.58 in GFDL-CM3 (
