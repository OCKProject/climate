<p class="p">We note that high correlation between CA precipitation and Niño 3.4 SSTs alone does not guarantee a more realistic response. Overly high correlation would also be unrealistic, and high correlation can go with unrealistic amplitude response. Some models exhibit larger than observed regressions of CA precipitation onto Niño 3.4 SSTs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref> shows late twentieth century DJF correlations, regression coefficients, and climatological CA precipitation by region for CMIP5 models, along with the observed values and their 1-sigma uncertainty. The CA precipitation sensitivity to Niño 3.4 SSTs, and regional climatologies, for many models falls outside the observed range (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>). We define an alternative ‘HIGH-r’ model subset that satisfies the following criteria: (1) late twentieth and twenty-first century correlations between DJF CA precipitation and Niño 3.4 SSTs are significant at the 90% confidence level; (2) late 20th century DJF CA precipitation versus Niño 3.4 SST regression coefficient falls within 1-sigma of the observed range; and (3) late 20th century DJF CA precipitation climatologies fall within 1-sigma of the observed range. These criteria result in three models, with 12 realizations. The ensemble mean twenty-first century DJF (ANN) CA precipitation trend in these models is 0.91 (0.24) mm day

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, both significant at the 99% confidence level. 83% (83%) of the realizations yield an increase in DJF (ANN) CA precipitation. These values are very similar to those based on our original correlation-based threshold. Moreover, the tropical and extratropical dynamical responses in these three models (not shown) are similar to those that will be discussed. Thus, we continue to find significant and robust increases in twenty-first century CA precipitation, particularly in models that better simulate CA precipitation statistics.
