 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> further supports the importance of Niño 3.4 SST warming to future increases in CA precipitation. On the basis of observed DJF seasonal variations, the spatial correlation between CA precipitation and SSTs yields a significant El Niño-like pattern, with more CA precipitation associated with warmer Niño 3.4 SSTs. Similarly, both CMIP5 HIGH-r and CESM LENS yield a similar spatial correlation, but based on twenty-first century DJF trends in CA precipitation and SSTs. In particular, both show significant trend correlations near the Niño 3.4 SST region. Thus, realizations that yield a larger increase in DJF CA precipitation are also associated with larger warming of the tropical central/eastern Pacific SSTs (that is, an El Niño like pattern). We note that CMIP5 LOW-r does not reproduce this relationship. Similar results are obtained for 1% CO
