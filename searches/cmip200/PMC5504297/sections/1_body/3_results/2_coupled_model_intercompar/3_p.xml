<p class="p">Sub-selecting the CMIP5 models that yield a detrended CA DJF precipitation versus Niño 3.4 SST correlation of at least 0.30 yields 14 models (29 realizations in total), including CESM1-CAM5 (the CMIP5 version of CESM LENS). Using this CMIP5 subset, which we refer to as ‘CMIP5 HIGH-r’, we find larger, and more consistent, increases in CA precipitation (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). For example, the ensemble mean DJF (ANN) precipitation increase in this CMIP5 subset is 0.84 (0.16) mm day

CMIP5 HIGH-r also better reproduces the dynamical teleconnection associated with Niño 3.4 SST warming, including weakening of the Walker circulation, the increase in divergence, Rossby wave generation (Methods) and Rossby wave response in the tropical central/eastern Pacific, the southeastward shift of the upper levels winds and the increase in storm track activity in the east Pacific (
