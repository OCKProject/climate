<p class="p">Based on 38 CMIP5 Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 models (78 realizations in total; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), the CA annual mean precipitation trend ranges from −0.68 to 0.61, with a multi-model mean of 0.06 mm day

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (significant at the 95% confidence level). Fifty-five per cent of the trends yield an increase in CA ANN precipitation. During DJF, the CMIP5 CA mean precipitation trend ranges from −1.14 to 2.62, with a multi-model mean of 0.51 mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> century
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (significant at the 99% confidence level). 71% of the trends yield an increase in CA DJF precipitation. These results show that CMIP5 models, relative to CESM LENS, yield a larger range (by at least a factor of two) of future CA precipitation projections, including significant drying. Thus, although internal climate variability accounts for some of the CMIP5 (and CESM LENS) spread, model differences appear to account for most of the spread.
