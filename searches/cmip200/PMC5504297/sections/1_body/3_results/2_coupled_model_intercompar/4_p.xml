<p class="p">In contrast, sub-selecting the CMIP5 models that yield a CA DJF precipitation versus Niño 3.4 SST correlation &lt;0.20 (12 models and 17 realizations), which we refer to as ‘CMIP5 LOW-r’, yields an ensemble mean DJF (ANN) precipitation trend of 0.09 (−0.15) mm day

Thus, CMIP5 models that better reproduce the observed Niño 3.4 SST and CA precipitation teleconnection tend to yield larger, and more consistent, increases in CA precipitation through the twenty-first century.
