<p class="p">Similar to our CMIP5 and CESM LENS analysis, the DJF CA precipitation response across AMIP4K and AMIP Future models significantly correlates with the east Pacific 
 <italic class="italic">pp</italic> and U300 response. The DJF CA precipitation versus 
 <italic class="italic">pp</italic> response correlation is 0.93 in AMIP4K and 0.72 in AMIP Future, both significant at the 99% confidence level. The corresponding correlation between DJF CA precipitation and east Pacific U300 is 0.85 in AMIP4K and 0.84 in AMIP Future, both significant at the 99% confidence level. In contrast, the correlation between DJF CA precipitation and east Pacific V300 is negative at −0.47 for AMIP4K and −0.34 for AMIP Future, although neither are significant at the 90% confidence level.
