<p class="p">Furthermore, AMIP4K and AMIP Future HIGH-r models yield the extratropical and tropical dynamical responses found in CMIP5 RCP8.5 simulations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs 11â€“15</xref>). The main difference between AMIP4K and AMIP Future appears to be the ensemble mean tropical precipitation response
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. The bulk of the precipitation increase in AMIP4K occurs in the South Pacific Convergence Zone. However, some AMIP4K models do yield a maximum precipitation increase in the tropical central/eastern Pacific, and nearly all AMIP4K models yield an (weak) increase in central/eastern tropical Pacific precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>). Nonetheless, both AMIP4K and AMIP Future yield weakening of the Walker Circulation, an increase in central/eastern tropical Pacific divergence and Rossby wave generation, a poleward propagating Rossby wave, an increase in east Pacific storm track activity (
