<p class="p">We also note that the increase in zonal mean westerlies in the subtropical upper troposphere (20–40N and 100 hPa) does not significantly correlate with the increase in CA precipitation across AMIP models (similar to our results based on CMIP5 models). In AMIP4K, the corresponding correlation is 0.09; in AMIP Future the correlation is −0.24. Thus, our results suggest wetting of CA does not appear to be similar to the relationship between wetting for the west coast of North America and an increase in meridional winds, driven by strengthened zonal mean westerlies in the subtropical upper troposphere
