<p class="p">We also analyse 11 CMIP5 atmosphere model intercomparison project (AMIP) simulations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). These include (1) the control simulation (AMIP), which is forced with 1979â€“2008 observed SSTs and sea-ice concentrations, as well as GHGs; (2) uniform warming (AMIP4K), which is identical to AMIP, but includes a uniform 4K SST anomaly; and (3) patterned SST warming (AMIP Future), which is identical to AMIP, but includes SST anomalies from the composite SST response from the 1% CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> coupled CMIP3 model experiments at the time of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> quadrupling. Taking AMIP4K-AMIP yields the climate response from a spatially uniform 4K SST warming; AMIP Future-AMIP yields the climate response from a patterned SST warming at the time of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> quadrupling, which features enhanced warming of the central/eastern tropical Pacific SSTs.
