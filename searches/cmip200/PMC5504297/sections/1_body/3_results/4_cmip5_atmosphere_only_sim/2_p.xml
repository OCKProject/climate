AMIP4K and AMIP Future models that were included in our CMIP5 LOW-r subset, including HadGEM2-A and bcc-csm1-1, yield much smaller increases in CA precipitation relative to those models there were included in our CMIP5 HIGH-r subset (including MRI-CGCM3, CCSM4, CanAM4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5B-LR and MIROC5). Although this is a small sample size, the ensemble mean CA DJF precipitation response for AMIP4K and AMIP future based on the two models with a lower ability to simulate the observed El Niño teleconnection is 0.34 and 0.27 mm day
