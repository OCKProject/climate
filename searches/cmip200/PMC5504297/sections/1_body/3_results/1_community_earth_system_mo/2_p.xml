Grid points for which 25 out of 40 realizations (∼65%) agree on sign pass a binomial test to reject the null hypothesis of equal probability of positive or negative sign at the 95% confidence level. During DJF, all but a handful of CA grid boxes (those in the southeastern corner) pass this test, indicating a high degree of consistency across realizations.
