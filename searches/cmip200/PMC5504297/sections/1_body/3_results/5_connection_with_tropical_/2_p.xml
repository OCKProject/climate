<p class="p">In contrast to the uniform warming response, the climate response without warming of tropical Pacific SSTs yields a muted signal. The hypothetical situation of the tropical Pacific SST not warming as the rest of the globe is a technique to partition regional effects of the overall warming in different locations. Here, CA precipitation decreases by −0.27 mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, not significant at the 90% confidence level. Consistently, the dynamical response is also much weaker (

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, not significant at the 90% confidence level. As with CAM5, the east Pacific jet stream and precipitation response moves northward when tropical Pacific SSTs are not allowed to warm.
