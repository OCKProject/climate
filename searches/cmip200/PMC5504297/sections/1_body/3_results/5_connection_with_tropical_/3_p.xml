<p class="p">The climate response to warming of tropical Pacific SSTs alone is qualitatively similar to, but much stronger than, the uniform warming response (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10" class="xref">10</xref>). Here, CA precipitation increases by 5.01 mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; in GFDL AM3, the corresponding increase is 2.96 mm day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Both responses are significant at the 99% confidence level. Moreover, the tropical and extratropical dynamical response is very similar to what occurs under uniform warming, including a southeastward shift of the upper level winds and an increase in storm track activity in the east Pacific, as well as an increase in central/eastern tropical Pacific divergence and a poleward propagating Rossby wave response (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs 17 and 18</xref>). Similar results are obtained if we vary the location of the uniform tropical SST warming (Methods). Thus, these idealized simulations show the importance of tropical Pacific SST warming to future increases in CA precipitation. Together with the AMIP simulations, our results imply that the increase in CA precipitation may not be dependent on the exact pattern of SST warming, as long as tropical Pacific SSTs warm-a robust response to future increases in GHGs.
