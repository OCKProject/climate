<p class="p">To explicitly show the importance of tropical Pacific SST warming to an increase in CA precipitation during the twenty-first century, we conduct uniform SST warming and present day time slice simulations with CAM5, the atmosphere component of CESM (Methods). CAM5 (and GFDL) models are chosen because they are able simulate the observed correlation between Niño 3.4 SSTs and CA precipitation. However, these models tend to overestimate the sensitivity of CA precipitation to Niño 3.4 SSTs, as well as the CA precipitation climatologies (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> shows the CAM5 uniform warming response for DJF precipitation, upper level winds and storm track activity. Similar to AMIP4K simulations, CAM5 shows an increase in CA precipitation; the magnitude of the increase is 1.34 mm day

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9" class="xref">Fig. 9</xref> show that a similar extratropical dynamical response also occurs, including a southeastward shift of the upper level winds, and an increase in storm track activity in the east Pacific. The tropical dynamical response also features an increase in central/eastern tropical Pacific divergence, and a poleward propagating Rossby wave that emanates out of the tropical eastern Pacific (
