This uncertainty is related to several factors, including relatively large internal climate variability, model shortcomings, and because CA lies within a transition zone, where mid-latitude regions are expected to become wetter and subtropical regions drier. Here, we use a multitude of models to show CA may receive more precipitation in the future under a business-as-usual scenario. The boreal winter season-when most of the CA precipitation increase occurs-is associated with robust changes in the mean circulation reminiscent of an El Ni&#x000f1;o teleconnection. Using idealized simulations with two different models, we further show that warming of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures accounts for these changes. Models that better simulate the observed El Ni&#x000f1;o-CA precipitation teleconnection yield larger, and more consistent increases in CA precipitation through the twenty-first century.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>California lies in the transition zone where mid-latitude regions are expected to become wetter and subtropical regions drier, and precipitation projections for the region remain uncertain.

Although Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were not found to exhibit a strong correlation with CA precipitation projections, only a portion of the CMIP5 ensemble was available. A subsequent study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> looked at the CMIP5 model ensemble uncertainty in this region, and also explicitly sought an explanation in tropical Pacific SST. It found that the leading mode affecting the inter-model range of CA precipitation projections under global warming was related to a more complex large-scale pattern of SST changes with little expression in the equatorial cold tongue region. A second mode of North Pacific inter-model precipitation change differences was related to SST patterns that included a substantial El Ni&#x000f1;o-like component, but this had relatively modest expression in California rainfall.</p><p>Although future projections yield a zonal mean poleward (and upward) shift of the storm tracks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, as well as storm track weakening in the Pacific<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, there is some evidence that storm track activity in the east Pacific may increase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.

During Northern Hemisphere winter, when most of the CA precipitation increase occurs, models simulate robust changes in the mean circulation reminiscent of an El Ni&#x000f1;o teleconnection. This includes weakening of the Walker circulation, a poleward propagating Rossby wave that originates in the tropical central/eastern Pacific, a southeastward shift of the upper level winds and an increase in storm track activity in the east Pacific, and an increase in CA moisture convergence.

During DJF, all but a handful of CA grid boxes (those in the southeastern corner) pass this test, indicating a high degree of consistency across realizations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Coupled model intercomparison project version 5</title><p>Based on 38 CMIP5 Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 models (78 realizations in total; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), the CA annual mean precipitation trend ranges from &#x02212;0.68 to 0.61, with a multi-model mean of 0.06&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;century<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (significant at the 95% confidence level). Fifty-five per cent of the trends yield an increase in CA ANN precipitation.

These results show that CMIP5 models, relative to CESM LENS, yield a larger range (by at least a factor of two) of future CA precipitation projections, including significant drying. Thus, although internal climate variability accounts for some of the CMIP5 (and CESM LENS) spread, model differences appear to account for most of the spread.</p><p>It is well known that El Ni&#x000f1;o/La Ni&#x000f1;a accounts for some of the interannual variability in CA precipitation. Observations from 1948/49 to 2014/15, including precipitation from National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration&#x02019;s Precipitation Reconstruction, show the correlation between Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs (5S&#x02013;5N; 190-240E) and CA DJF precipitation is 0.36, which is significant at the 99% confidence level. Similar values are found using alternative precipitation data sets, including the Global Precipitation Climatology Project, where the corresponding correlation from 1979/80 to 2014/15 is 0.40. During winter, in response to warmer central/eastern tropical Pacific SSTs, the El Ni&#x000f1;o teleconnection is associated with weakening of the Walker circulation and an eastward shift of deep convection and associated diabatic heating, which excites a Rossby wave response that alters the extratropical circulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

All but one (FGOALS-g2) CMIP5 model-realization and all CESM LENS realizations shows warming of Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs through the twenty-first century. Furthermore, 70% of the CMIP5 model-realizations and all CESM LENS realizations show enhanced warming of the tropical eastern Pacific (5S&#x02013;5N; 190-240E) relative to the western Pacific (5S&#x02013;5N; 120-170E). These results suggest a possible shift of the tropical Pacific to a more El Ni&#x000f1;o-like background state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Many CMIP5 models, however, are unable to reproduce the observed correlation between Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST and CA DJF precipitation. On the basis of the CMIP5 RCP8.5 models, this correlation (based on detrended time series) ranges from &#x02212;0.12 in MIROC-ESM to 0.58 in GFDL-CM3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Sub-selecting the CMIP5 models that yield a detrended CA DJF precipitation versus Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST correlation of at least 0.30 yields 14 models (29 realizations in total), including CESM1-CAM5 (the CMIP5 version of CESM LENS). Using this CMIP5 subset, which we refer to as &#x02018;CMIP5 HIGH-r&#x02019;, we find larger, and more consistent, increases in CA precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). For example, the ensemble mean DJF (ANN) precipitation increase in this CMIP5 subset is 0.84 (0.16) mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;century<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, both significant at the 99% confidence level. Furthermore, 79% (72%) of the model-realizations yield an increase in DJF (ANN) CA precipitation. CMIP5 HIGH-r also better reproduces the dynamical teleconnection associated with Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST warming, including weakening of the Walker circulation, the increase in divergence, Rossby wave generation (Methods) and Rossby wave response in the tropical central/eastern Pacific, the southeastward shift of the upper levels winds and the increase in storm track activity in the east Pacific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 2 and 3</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, sub-selecting the CMIP5 models that yield a CA DJF precipitation versus Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST correlation &#x0003c;0.20 (12 models and 17 realizations), which we refer to as &#x02018;CMIP5 LOW-r&#x02019;, yields an ensemble mean DJF (ANN) precipitation trend of 0.09 (&#x02212;0.15) mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;century<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the latter (negative) trend significant at the 99% confidence level. Furthermore, only 59% (24%) of the model-realizations yield an increase in DJF (ANN) CA precipitation. A <italic>t</italic>-test for the difference of means shows that these two model subsets are significantly different at the 99% confidence level based on both DJF and ANN CA precipitation trends. Similar results are obtained with different RCPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) and 1% CO<sub>2</sub> experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), and if we slightly modify the correlation threshold used to define CMIP5 HIGH-r and LOW-r models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>). Thus, CMIP5 models that better reproduce the observed Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST and CA precipitation teleconnection tend to yield larger, and more consistent, increases in CA precipitation through the twenty-first century.</p><p>We note that high correlation between CA precipitation and Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs alone does not guarantee a more realistic response. Overly high correlation would also be unrealistic, and high correlation can go with unrealistic amplitude response. Some models exhibit larger than observed regressions of CA precipitation onto Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Furthermore, some models have a storm track that hits the US West Coast too far south. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> shows late twentieth century DJF correlations, regression coefficients, and climatological CA precipitation by region for CMIP5 models, along with the observed values and their 1-sigma uncertainty. The CA precipitation sensitivity to Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs, and regional climatologies, for many models falls outside the observed range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>). We define an alternative &#x02018;HIGH-r&#x02019; model subset that satisfies the following criteria: (1) late twentieth and twenty-first century correlations between DJF CA precipitation and Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs are significant at the 90% confidence level; (2) late 20th century DJF CA precipitation versus Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST regression coefficient falls within 1-sigma of the observed range; and (3) late 20th century DJF CA precipitation climatologies fall within 1-sigma of the observed range. These criteria result in three models, with 12 realizations. The ensemble mean twenty-first century DJF (ANN) CA precipitation trend in these models is 0.91 (0.24) mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;century<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, both significant at the 99% confidence level. 83% (83%) of the realizations yield an increase in DJF (ANN) CA precipitation. These values are very similar to those based on our original correlation-based threshold. Moreover, the tropical and extratropical dynamical responses in these three models (not shown) are similar to those that will be discussed. Thus, we continue to find significant and robust increases in twenty-first century CA precipitation, particularly in models that better simulate CA precipitation statistics.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> further supports the importance of Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST warming to future increases in CA precipitation. On the basis of observed DJF seasonal variations, the spatial correlation between CA precipitation and SSTs yields a significant El Ni&#x000f1;o-like pattern, with more CA precipitation associated with warmer Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs. Similarly, both CMIP5 HIGH-r and CESM LENS yield a similar spatial correlation, but based on twenty-first century DJF trends in CA precipitation and SSTs. In particular, both show significant trend correlations near the Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST region. Thus, realizations that yield a larger increase in DJF CA precipitation are also associated with larger warming of the tropical central/eastern Pacific SSTs (that is, an El Ni&#x000f1;o like pattern). We note that CMIP5 LOW-r does not reproduce this relationship. Similar results are obtained for 1% CO<sub>2</sub> experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dynamical mechanisms</title><p>We now focus on the wintertime (DJF) change in CA precipitation, and investigate possible dynamical mechanisms associated with the increase. At monthly timescales (&#x0003e;10 days), the atmospheric moisture budget indicates that precipitation, evaporation and net moisture flux into/out of an atmospheric column through its lateral boundary are in a balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The CESM LENS ensemble mean increase in DJF CA precipitation is divided into a DJF moisture flux convergence (MFC) increase of 0.69&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;century<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and an increase in evaporation of 0.23&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;century<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). All of the MFC increase is related to an increase by the mean flow, as the MFC mean trend is 0.72 and the MFC transient trend is &#x02212;0.04&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;century<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Further decomposing the MFC mean into its dynamic and thermodynamic components (Methods) shows that all of the increase in the MFC mean is related to dynamical processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The dynamic component increases by 0.80, whereas the thermodynamic component decreases by &#x02212;0.10&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;century<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Thus, the increase in CA precipitation is consistent with an increase in MFC by the mean flow, and more specifically, the component related to dynamical as opposed to thermodynamical processes (that is, changes in wind as opposed to humidity).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> shows the DJF CESM LENS ensemble mean trend in zonal (U300) and meridional (V300) wind at 300&#x02009;hPa. Both show a significant increase over the California region, and more specifically, a southeastward shift of the climatological winds. A similar shift in the zonal winds across CMIP5 models was also found<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, implying an eastward extension of the jet stream, which would help steer mid-latitude storms toward the California coast. Our results are consistent with this interpretation. The CESM LENS correlation between the U300 trend in the east Pacific and CA precipitation (across realizations) is 0.61, significant at the 99% confidence level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> shows that CMIP5 models that better reproduce the observed correlation between Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs and CA precipitation (that is, CMIP5 HIGH-r) yield a larger southeastward shift of the upper level winds (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The CMIP5 HIGH-r correlation between the U300 trend in the east Pacific and CA precipitation is 0.72, significant at the 99% confidence level. The corresponding correlation in CMIP5 LOW-r is 0.51, significant at the 95% confidence level. Similar conclusions exist based on CMIP5 1% CO<sub>2</sub> experiments (not shown).</p><p>We note another study that relates the increase in precipitation for the west coast of North America to an increase in meridional winds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. This, in turn, was related to strengthened zonal mean westerlies in the subtropical upper troposphere (20&#x02013;40N and 100&#x02009;hPa), which alters the intermediate-scale stationary wave field. Our analysis suggests the changes in meridional winds are of lesser importance to CA precipitation, as the CESM LENS and CMIP5 LOW-r correlation between the V300 trend in the east Pacific and CA precipitation is not significant at 0.15 and 0.31, respectively. The lone significant correlation occurs in CMIP5 HIGH-r at 0.51 (significant at the 95% confidence level). We also find nonsignificant correlations between CA precipitation and the zonal mean westerlies in the subtropical upper troposphere (20&#x02013;40N and 100&#x02009;hPa). The corresponding correlation based on CMIP5 HIGH-r and CMIP5 LOW-r is 0.28 and 0.11, respectively. Furthermore, despite the significant difference in CA precipitation projections between CMIP5 HIGH-r and CMIP5 LOW-r, the ensemble mean trend in 20&#x02013;40N 100&#x02009;hPa zonal mean westerlies is similar between the two model subsets, at 8.3 and 8.2&#x02009;m&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;century<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4g</xref> shows the CESM LENS DJF ensemble mean trend in extratropical cyclone (storm track) activity (Methods).

Although model biases may influence this projection, including possible overestimation of tropical convection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, there are relatively fundamental arguments that support these model projections. The Walker circulation is expected to weaken due to thermodynamical constraints-tropical precipitation increases at a slower rate than water vapour (which increases according to Clausius Clapeyron scaling, assuming constant relative humidity), so the tropical overturning circulation, including the equatorial easterly trade winds, slow down<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The Bjerknes feedback, a positive feedback between trade wind intensity and the zonal SST gradient, implies that the above changes would lead to a reduced zonal SST gradient. Warming of the central/eastern tropical Pacific SSTs, in turn, leads to an eastward shift in convection, precipitation and divergence, which would excite a Rossby wave response. Thus, models suggest continued GHG-induced warming will lead to an El-Ni&#x000f1;o-like climate state in the tropical Pacific<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, as will be discussed below, the increase in CA precipitation and the associated dynamical responses are not dependent on a reduction in the zonal SST gradient in the tropical Pacific. Model simulations with uniform SST warming also yield a robust increase in CA precipitation, including similar dynamical responses. Moreover, idealized simulations suggest warming of the tropical Pacific-not just the Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs-results in a similar dynamical response and an increase in CA precipitation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>CMIP</italic>5 atmosphere-only simulations</title><p>We also analyse 11 CMIP5 atmosphere model intercomparison project (AMIP) simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

CAM5 (and GFDL) models are chosen because they are able simulate the observed correlation between Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs and CA precipitation. However, these models tend to overestimate the sensitivity of CA precipitation to Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs, as well as the CA precipitation climatologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9</xref> shows the CAM5 uniform warming response for DJF precipitation, upper level winds and storm track activity.

Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref> show that a similar extratropical dynamical response also occurs, including a southeastward shift of the upper level winds, and an increase in storm track activity in the east Pacific. The tropical dynamical response also features an increase in central/eastern tropical Pacific divergence, and a poleward propagating Rossby wave that emanates out of the tropical eastern Pacific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the uniform warming response, the climate response without warming of tropical Pacific SSTs yields a muted signal. The hypothetical situation of the tropical Pacific SST not warming as the rest of the globe is a technique to partition regional effects of the overall warming in different locations. Here, CA precipitation decreases by &#x02212;0.27&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, not significant at the 90% confidence level. Consistently, the dynamical response is also much weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). In fact, the east Pacific jet stream and precipitation response moves northward. Similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10</xref>) are obtained with an alternative climate model, GFDL AM3, where CA precipitation increases by 0.92&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (significant at the 95% confidence level) in the uniform warming experiment. Without warming of tropical Pacific SSTs, CA precipitation decreases by &#x02212;0.14&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, not significant at the 90% confidence level. As with CAM5, the east Pacific jet stream and precipitation response moves northward when tropical Pacific SSTs are not allowed to warm.</p><p>The climate response to warming of tropical Pacific SSTs alone is qualitatively similar to, but much stronger than, the uniform warming response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figs 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">10</xref>). Here, CA precipitation increases by 5.01&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; in GFDL AM3, the corresponding increase is 2.96&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Both responses are significant at the 99% confidence level. Moreover, the tropical and extratropical dynamical response is very similar to what occurs under uniform warming, including a southeastward shift of the upper level winds and an increase in storm track activity in the east Pacific, as well as an increase in central/eastern tropical Pacific divergence and a poleward propagating Rossby wave response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 17 and 18</xref>). Similar results are obtained if we vary the location of the uniform tropical SST warming (Methods). Thus, these idealized simulations show the importance of tropical Pacific SST warming to future increases in CA precipitation. Together with the AMIP simulations, our results imply that the increase in CA precipitation may not be dependent on the exact pattern of SST warming, as long as tropical Pacific SSTs warm-a robust response to future increases in GHGs.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that there is a dynamically coherent extratropical response to global warming, consistent with previous analyses, involving a southeastward shift of the upper level winds, an increase in storm track activity in the east Pacific, and an increase in CA moisture convergence. We have also shown that there is a dynamically coherent tropical response, including an increase in central/eastern tropical Pacific divergence and a poleward propagating Rossby wave. Both are reminiscent of an El Ni&#x000f1;o-like teleconnection. CMIP5 models with higher correlation between CA precipitation and El Ni&#x000f1;o interannual variability yield larger and more consistent increases in California precipitation under global warming. Similar conclusions are obtained when additional criteria are used to subsample the models, including the ability to simulate CA precipitation climatologies, and the observed sensitivity of CA precipitation to El Ni&#x000f1;o variations.</p><p>The increase in CA precipitation and the dynamical responses, however, occur in both patterned and uniform SST warming experiments. This implies El Ni&#x000f1;o-like tropical Pacific SST warming&#x02014;a feature of most coupled ocean&#x02013;atmosphere warming simulations&#x02014;is not necessary for the response to occur. Using idealized simulations from two different climate models, we show the increase in CA precipitation, and the associated dynamical responses, are associated with SST warming over the entire tropical Pacific. In these models, uniform tropical Pacific warming results in an El-Ni&#x000f1;o-like teleconnection, and an increase in CA precipitation. We suggest that such a response is related to the zonal heterogeneity of the climatological state of the tropical Pacific-relative to the western tropical Pacific, the central/eastern tropical Pacific features colder SSTs. Since tropical tropospheric temperatures approximately follow a moist-adiabatic temperature profile, tropospheric temperatures in the central/eastern tropical Pacific are also colder than those in the west (not shown). Thus, uniform (and patterned) SST warming of the tropical Pacific results in greater destabilization of the atmosphere in the central/eastern tropical Pacific, which, in turn, leads to the increase in divergence and Rossby wave response that is associated with the increase in CA precipitation. Although models possess uncertainties, including possible overestimation of tropical convection, our results suggest future GHG-induced warming may lead to an increase in CA precipitation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Community earth system model large ensemble</title><p>CESM LENS simulations were downloaded from the Earth System Grid at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

However, these models tend to overestimate the sensitivity of CA precipitation to Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), and also tend to overestimate CA precipitation climatologies-especially in the case of GFDL.</p><p>We also conduct similar uniform warming experiments (not shown) that focus on the Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST region (as opposed to the entire tropical Pacific), including simulations that lack Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST warming, or include only Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST warming. These Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SST experiments yield qualitatively similar results as those based on uniform tropical Pacific SST warming-without warming of Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs, the increase in CA precipitation, and the dynamical responses, are significantly muted.</p><p>Finally, we conduct additional uniform tropical SST warming experiments, including (1) uniform warming of the entire tropics (5S&#x02013;5N; 0-360E) and (2) uniform warming of the tropical and subtropical Pacific (15S&#x02013;15N; 120-270E). Both experiments yield results consistent with tropical Pacific (5S&#x02013;5N; 120-170E) warming, including similar dynamical responses and a significant increase in CA precipitation. For example, uniform tropical warming yields a CA DJF precipitation increase of 1.81 (2.44) mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in CAM5 (GFDL). Uniform tropical and subtropical Pacific warming yields a CA DJF precipitation increase of 9.82 (6.37) mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in CAM5 (GFDL). Thus, we find an increase in CA precipitation is a robust feature to several patterns of uniform tropical warming.</p><p>We also conduct patterned SST warming experiments for both CAM5 and GFDL, which also include decreases in sea-ice and increases in GHGs (not shown). For CAM5, SST and sea-ice concentration anomalies (2090&#x02013;2099 relative to 2006&#x02013;2015) from the ensemble mean of the 40 CESM LENS simulations are used. GHG concentrations and aerosol emissions are also set to the RCP8.5 2090&#x02013;2099 mean. For GFDL, GHG concentrations are set to the RCP8.5 2090&#x02013;2099 mean, and SST and sea-ice concentration anomalies (2090&#x02013;2099 relative to 2006&#x02013;2015) from the CMIP5 ensemble mean are used. These experiments are designed to resemble the CMIP5 RCP8.5 simulations, which include both patterned SST warming and increases in GHGs. We also conduct an additional patterned warming experiment, analogous to the original, but Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs are held constant. Both CAM5 and GFDL patterned SST warming experiments yield a similar response, including a significant increase in DJF CA precipitation (2.04 and 1.66&#x02009;mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively). Furthermore, both models yield tropical and extratropical dynamical responses similar to those in CMIP5 RCP8.5 models. However, a muted signal is obtained when Ni&#x000f1;o 3.4 SSTs are fixed. CA precipitation increases by only 0.38 (0.20) mm&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, not significant at the 90% confidence level, in CAM5 (GFDL). Consistently, the dynamical response is also much weaker.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Trend and correlation significance</title><p>Ensemble mean trend significance is based on a standard <italic>t</italic>-test, accounting for the influence of serial correlation by using the effective sample size, <italic>n</italic>(1-<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>)(1+<italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of years and <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> is the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient.
