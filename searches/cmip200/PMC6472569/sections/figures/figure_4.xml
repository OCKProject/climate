  <p class="p">Differences between the distributions of regionally averaged Δ(P − ET) from the full model ensemble (red) and the constrained ensemble (blue) for increasing global mean temperature with respect to the preindustrial period (1870–1899). Dots represent the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentiles; lines reach the 5th and 95th percentiles; and boxes cover the interquartile range. The spatial domain of each region is shown on the top left. Regional mean present‐day water availability from the constrained ensemble is indicated as (P − ET)
   <sub class="sub">ref</sub>. P = precipitation; ET = evapotranspiration.
