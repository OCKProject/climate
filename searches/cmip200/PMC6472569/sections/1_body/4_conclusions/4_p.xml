<p class="p">The resulting constrained estimates of projected changes in long‐term mean P – ET generally show a narrower distribution compared to the full model ensemble, together with a shift in the distribution toward wetter conditions in several regions around the world. However, there is an increased likelihood for drying in the Amazon. We highlight that the constrained ensemble suggests a reduced likelihood of extreme drying over most of the land surface. This is especially noteworthy and relevant for Europe, Southern Africa, and Western North America. Nonetheless, this reduction in drying does not necessarily imply that strong drying is not possible; for example, 5% (25%) of the constrained ensemble members still project a decrease in water availability relative to the present‐day ensemble mean of up to 53.3% (23.6%) in the Mediterranean and 19.4% (8.2%) in Southern Africa, under a 3 K global warming. The reduced uncertainty in multidecadal mean water availability projections obtained in this study is highly relevant for climate adaptation and decision making.</p>
