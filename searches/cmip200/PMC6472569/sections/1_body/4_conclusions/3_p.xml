<p class="p">To evaluate and to constrain the considered model ensemble, a novel approach that is based on quantifying the probability of each model to be included in a constrained ensemble is introduced. The distributions of these probabilities help to identify models with evident agreement with observations and models with evident disagreement, as well as the ability of the method to account for very similar models. Furthermore, the presented algorithm is applicable to cases involving different constraining metrics, and it can incorporate both multiple ensemble simulations per model and multiple observational products. Finally, it is important to recall that while our study focuses on reducing uncertainty stemming from differences between climate models, emission scenarios and internal variability might also influence the spread of the projections.</p>
