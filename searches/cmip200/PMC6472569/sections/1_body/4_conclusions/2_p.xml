<p class="p">This study describes how present‐day mean precipitation in climate models influences projections of future changes in multidecadal mean P minus ET. We identify regions such as Western North America, Central Europe, the Mediterranean, and Southern Africa, where a wetter reference state in the models is negatively correlated to the projected change in P – ET. This suggests that model simulations with high present‐day water availability often dry more under global warming in these regions; whereas if water availability is already low, it is less likely to decrease and might even increase. On the other hand, the intensification of the hydrologic cycle with global warming may explain why simulations with wetter conditions in the present tend to project a larger increase in P – ET in regions with high P, such as Southern Asia and La Plata basin in South America. Based on the relevance of the reference state, we argue that simulations that agree better with observations are likely more reliable for future projections.</p>
