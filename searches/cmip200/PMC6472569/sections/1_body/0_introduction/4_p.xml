<p class="p">Previous research has identified relations between simulated climate characteristics and future projections of P and ET. For example, Lemordant et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) found that differences in stomatal resistance under future CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels can have a strong impact on the projections. However, stomatal resistance is an unsuitable variable for constraining climate models since it cannot be compared with reliable present‐day observations. Li et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) identified a dependency of changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall on P in the tropical western Pacific. He and Soden (
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) found that differences between simulations in their present‐day climatology of sea surface temperatures can be relevant for projected P changes, and that models with a similar P climatology tend to project similar P changes. In our study we build upon this last finding and exploit biases in present‐day water availability to constrain projected changes in P – ET.
