<p class="p">Uncertainties of climate projections, forced by any given emission scenario of greenhouse gases, stem from both internal climate variability and structural differences between models (e.g., Deser et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Although internal variability has been shown to influence trends in water availability for 20‐year periods (Kumar et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), Greve et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) found that model uncertainty is dominating the spread of projected changes in long‐term water availability. Moreover, Lorenz et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) highlight that model uncertainty is the best starting point to reduce the spread in climate projections. Observations are commonly used to evaluate models and constrain ensemble estimates of future hydroclimatic change, as comprehensively reviewed by Flato et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). To constrain the projections in a meaningful way, model performance needs to be evaluated against observations of a present‐day quantity that can at least partially explain the differences in the model projections.
