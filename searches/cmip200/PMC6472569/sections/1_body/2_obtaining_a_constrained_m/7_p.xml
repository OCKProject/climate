<p class="p">After optimizing 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub>, it becomes evident that some models are almost always included in the constrained ensemble, that is, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> ≈ 1 (e.g., CMCC‐CM and CanESM2); whereas others are instantly excluded, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> ≈ 0 (e.g., BNU‐ESM and FIO‐ESM). There are also cases where the similarities and dependencies across models allow to interchange one of them for the other with minor effect on the CRPS (e.g., HadGEM2‐CC with HadGEM2‐ES and MRI‐CGCM3 with MRI‐ESM 1); this is why the variability of their optimized 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> is higher. For CESM1‐CAM5 and CNRM‐CM5, the high variability of 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> suggests that their inclusion in the constrained ensemble has a small effect on the agreement with observed P.
