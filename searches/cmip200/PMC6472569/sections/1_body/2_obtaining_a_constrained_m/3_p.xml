<p class="p">To evaluate the agreement between observations and models, we use the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), which is designed to evaluate ensemble simulations (e.g., Jollife &amp; Stephenson, 
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The CRPS computes the integrated square difference between the cumulative distributions from the multimodel ensemble and the observations. Precipitation data are log‐transformed when computing the CRPS to avoid excessive influence of grid cells with high P. Also, weights are assigned to each grid cell proportional to their area and the absolute magnitude of the correlation between P
 <sub class="sub">ref</sub> and Δ(P − ET). The latter ensures that the focus is on regions where the potential to constrain projected changes is the greatest. Finally, Greenland and desert regions defined by Kottek et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) are not considered when evaluating model performance, as observational P estimates are generally not reliable in these regions.
