<p class="p">The uncertainty in the projections of future hydroclimatic change can be constrained by attributing more influence or a higher weight to model simulations that agree better with observed precipitation. Therefore, we require observations of present‐day long‐term mean P to evaluate the models. To account for some of the observational uncertainty, we consider mean P from two global gridded products: CRU TS v.4.01 (Harris et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) from the period 1976–2005 and MSWEP (Beck et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) from the period 1979–2005. These products are relatively independent; whereas CRU TS consists of interpolated gauge data, MSWEP combines gauge, satellite, and reanalysis data.
