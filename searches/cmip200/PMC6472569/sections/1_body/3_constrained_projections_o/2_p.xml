<p class="p">A global summary of water availability projections from the constrained ensemble for the end of the century is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58462-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. Although the mean changes in P – ET are not strikingly different than what we know from the full ensemble, there are interesting differences regarding the ensemble spread. For the constrained ensemble, 44.4% of the grid cells have an absolute signal to noise ratio &gt; 1, indicating confidence in the sign of Δ(P − ET). This corresponds to an increase of 8.1% relative to the full ensemble, which is mainly attributed to a higher model agreement on a wetting of western Russia and northeast China. Furthermore, the differences in the signal‐to‐noise ratio indicate that the full model ensemble is overall drier than the constrained ensemble for latitudes between 30° and 60° North.
