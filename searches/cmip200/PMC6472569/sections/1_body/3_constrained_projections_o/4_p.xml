<p class="p">Summaries of changes in regional water availability provide a more detailed view of the increased confidence obtained with the constrained ensemble. Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58462-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> presents the results for selected regions from Seneviratne et al. (
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) that show a strong reduction in the ensemble spread for different global warming levels (see Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58462-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> for all other regions). This analysis considers periods for which all models exhibit the same increase in global mean temperature (Δ
 <italic class="italic">Tg</italic>) with respect to preindustrial conditions (here 1870–1899), as opposed to using fixed time windows. To put the reported values of Δ(P − ET) in each region into context, the figure also includes mean present‐day water availability from the constrained ensemble. The results indicate that the constrained distributions are predominantly shifted toward wetter conditions relative to the full ensemble, although the opposite is true for the Amazon. Other relevant features of the constrained ensemble are the less severe drying for the 5th percentile in economically important regions like Western North America, Central Europe, and Southern Africa; as well as the reduced wetting for the 95th percentile in Western Africa and Southern Asia.
