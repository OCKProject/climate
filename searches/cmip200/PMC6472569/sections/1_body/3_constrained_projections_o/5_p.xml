<p class="p">A key aspect of the constrained ensemble is the reduced likelihood of extreme changes in water availability relative to the full ensemble. To quantify this reduction, we start by defining 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub> as the probability of exceeding an extreme threshold in Δ(P − ET) within the full ensemble, and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">c</italic>
 </sub> as the probability of exceeding the same threshold within the constrained ensemble. The probability ratio 
 <italic class="italic">PR = p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">c</italic>
 </sub> ∕ 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub> can then be used to quantify the change in the likelihood of exceeding the selected threshold—for example, 
 <italic class="italic">PR</italic> = 1 indicates no change, 
 <italic class="italic">PR</italic> = 1/2 indicates that it is two times less likely to exceed the threshold in the constrained ensemble, and 
 <italic class="italic">PR</italic> = 2 that it is two times more likely. Here we compute 
 <italic class="italic">PR</italic> by selecting the 5th and 95th percentile of Δ(P − ET) from the full ensemble as the respective thresholds to represent extreme drying and wetting. For both cases, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 </sub> = 0.05, while 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">c</italic>
 </sub> is obtained at each grid cell from the magnitude of the corresponding thresholds.
