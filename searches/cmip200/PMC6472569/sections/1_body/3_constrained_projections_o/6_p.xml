 <italic class="italic">PR</italic> highlight the strong reduction of the likelihood of extreme Δ(P − ET) for the constrained ensemble, with values below 1/5 in several regions (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58462-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Note, however, that there is an increased likelihood of extreme drying in parts of the Amazon, as well as of extreme wetting in Eastern Africa and Western Russia. To complement these results, we compute the global cumulative distribution of the differences between the 5th percentiles of the constrained and full ensemble and also between the 95th percentiles. Results for the 5th percentile indicate that extreme drying is reduced in approximately 73% of land grid cells, with low dependence on global warming levels. Furthermore, in 25% of all land grid cells, the reduction for a 3 K global warming is greater than 18% of mean present‐day P – ET. Finally, extreme wetting is also substantially reduced in the constrained ensemble, although to a slightly smaller degree than extreme drying.
