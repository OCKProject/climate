<p class="p">From a climate‐impact perspective, insights on possible extreme changes are highly relevant. For this purpose, we focus on the 5th and 95th percentiles of the ensemble at each grid cell. The extreme projected drying, represented by the 5th percentile, is less intense for the constrained ensemble throughout most regions of the globe when compared to the full ensemble—this is the case in 84% of land grid cells within the latitudinal band 30–50°N. Furthermore, the reduction in the drying magnitude can be greater than 100 mm yr
