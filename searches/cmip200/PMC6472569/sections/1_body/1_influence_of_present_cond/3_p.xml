<p class="p">To test the above‐mentioned hypothesis, we consider P and ET data from climate model simulations of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). For the reference period 1976–2005, we use data from historical simulations, whereas for the future period 2006–2100, we use data from simulations with the “business as usual” RCP8.5 emissions scenario (Moss et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58462-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). A total of 36 different models (or model configurations) with one initial condition simulation (i.e., the “r1i1p1” member) are considered. Data from all models are bilinearly interpolated to a common 2.5° × 2.5° grid.
