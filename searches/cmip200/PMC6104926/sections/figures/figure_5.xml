   <italic class="italic">R</italic>〉) in Germany for the five models in the EURO-CORDEX ensemble. Boxes represent the 25% to 75% quantiles, whiskers indicate the 5% and 95% quantiles, the red line is the median, the blue dot shows the mean and black dots represent outliers. Results are shown for the historical time frame (h, 1970-2000) and the end of the century (eoc, 2070-2100) for a strong climate change scenario (RCP8.5). 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>, Relative change of the duration assigned to the 95% quantile by the end of the century with respect to the historical time frame for 29 European countries. The color code corresponds to the average of the five models and the hatching indicates the robustness of the results. No hatching: 5/5, striped: 4/5, crossbred: 3/5 models agree on the sign of change.
