  <title class="title">Conversion of near-surface wind speeds to country-wise aggregated wind power generation combined with backup and storage infrastructures.</title>
  <p class="p">
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>, Near-surface wind velocities of the downscaled ERA-Interim data over Europe for one exemplary point in time. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>, Corresponding estimated wind power yield for each country in units of the installed capacity at this exemplary time step. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>, Renewable generation (black) and load (grey) in Germany for one exemplary week in spring assuming a power system with 100% wind power on average. The vertical line denotes the time selected in panels 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>. The color indicates the operation of the storage system. Green: Excess power is stored. Yellow: Residual load is covered by the storage. Red: Residual load is covered by backup power plants as the storage is empty. Blue: Excess power must be curtailed as the storage is fully charged. 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>, Evolution of the storage filling level
