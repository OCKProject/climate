<p class="p">The complete distribution of durations is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>. We find that for Germany (panels a) not only the duration associated with the 95%-quantile tends to increase but also the probability for particularly long durations (except for CNRM-CM5). Considering the perfectly interconnected European power system (panels b), we also find that the 95% quantile shifts to higher values by the end of the century. Furthermore, the probability for low-wind periods having a duration of up to about 500 hours increases (again except for CNRM-CM5). For longer durations, the curves often cross. However, it is difficult to evaluate such extreme events appropriately in the context of climate change given the finite duration of the time series. All in all, this analyis indicates that long lasting low-wind conditions, which extend over the whole European continent, are projected to become more likely (see also [
