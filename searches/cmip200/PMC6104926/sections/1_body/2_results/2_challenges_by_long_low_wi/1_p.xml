<p class="p">During long periods of low renewable generation, the storage facilities get depleted with a high probability such that the residual load has to be covered by backup power plants leading to a high backup energy need. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> we show the duration distribution of periods for which wind power generation is continuously lower than average (i.e.

 <italic class="italic">R</italic>〉) for Germany (panel a) and the relative change of the 95% quantile (panel b). The 95% quantile shifts to longer durations in most of Central Europe, France, the British Isles, Sweden and Finland and decreases on the Iberian Peninsula by the end of the century. These findings are robust in the sense that all five models in the EURO-CORDEX ensemble agree on the sign of change as illustrated for Germany in
