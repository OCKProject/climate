 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. An increasing magnitude for such extreme events thus represents a serious challenge for renewable integration. In Eastern Europe, Italy, Greece and Norway relative changes are weaker and not robust. The effect develops mostly in the second half of the century (cf. Fig B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201457.s002" class="xref">S2 Appendix</xref>) and for strong climate change (RCP8.5, cf. Fig B in
