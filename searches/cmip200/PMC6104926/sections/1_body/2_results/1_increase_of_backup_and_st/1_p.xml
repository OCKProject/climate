<p class="p">We assess the impact of climate change on the average backup energy per year 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> as a function of the storage capacity 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. The storage capacity is given in units of the yearly load 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>
 <sub class="sub">year</sub> of a country and is shown on a range between 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup> to 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 10
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The case of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup> can be regarded as the no-storage case. Results hardly differ for even smaller storage capacities. It should be noted that storage capacities above about 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> correspond to a scenario with massive extension of (effective) storage capacities. This could include the large-scale deployment of novel technologies, in particular chemical storage and/or virtual storage. As in highly renewable power systems huge amounts of storage will be necessary (see e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]), we decided to consider also these highly optimistic cases.
