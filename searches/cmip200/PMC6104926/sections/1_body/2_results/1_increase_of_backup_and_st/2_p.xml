<p class="p">All models in the EURO-CORDEX ensemble predict an increase of the necessary backup energy in most of Central Europe (i.e. Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium), France, the British Isles and Scandinavia for a strong climate change scenario (RCP8.5) by the end of the century relative to the historical time frame (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g002" class="xref">Fig 2c and 2d</xref>). This implies that even though the same amount of energy is produced by renewables in both time frames, less renewable energy can actually be used. Relative changes are highest in Switzerland and the United Kingdom with a range between 12.2 to 24.2% (ensemble mean: 15.6%) and 7.1 to 16.5% (ensemble mean: 12.1%), respectively for a storage capacity of

 <sub class="sub">year</sub>. However, results for mountainous regions like Switzerland should be regarded with caution as wind farms might be placed at sites which are unsuitable. In addition, climate model results over complex terrain are known to have large uncertainties. An opposite effect is observed for the Iberian Peninsula, Greece and Croatia where the need for backup energy decreases (e.g., Spain: -4.7 to -15.5%; ensemble mean: -9.1% for

 <sub class="sub">year</sub>). These results hold for a variety of scenarios for the development of storage infrastructures leading to different values of the storage size

In the Baltic region and South-Eastern Europe, relative changes are weaker and the models most often do not agree on the sign of change and can therefore be regarded as not robust [
