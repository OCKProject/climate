<p class="p">In a perfectly interconnected Europe, the average relative backup energy per year is much smaller than for individual countries (e.g., for Germany, cf Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g002" class="xref">2a</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g004" class="xref">4a</xref>). This is because the balancing takes place over a large spatial scale with many different wind patterns at the same time step. For all five models and all storage capacities, we find an increase of the average backup energy per year

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Values range from 0.3 to 2.2% of the average yearly consumption

 <sub class="sub">year</sub>. For high storage capacities, the change depends strongly on the seasonal wind variability (cf. below). Hence, we find increasing backup energy needs for many single European countries as well as for a perfectly interconnected Europe. This implies that, even though balancing takes place over large spatial scales, certain wind situations occur simultaneously in many countries. In fact, Wohland 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] find that wind conditions become more homogeneous within Europe in a future climate, which decreases inter-state balancing of electricity. For mid century, the same effect albeit at a weaker magnitude can be observed.
