<p class="p">The identified increase in the seasonal variability of wind power generation has been discussed in terms of the projected changes of large-scale atmospheric circulation and regional wind conditions. A consensus exists about general changes in the large-scale circulation patterns in the Eastern North Atlantic region and Europe, which is however dependent on the time of the year [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. During winter, the eddy-driven jet stream and cyclone intensity are extended towards the British Isles [

 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], leading to enhanced winds over Western and Central Europe. The signal in summer corresponds rather to a northward shift of the eddy driven jet stream, cyclone activity and lower tropospheric winds, together with an increase in anticyclonic circulation over Southern Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The latter is associated with an expansion of the Hadley circulation due to enhanced radiative forcing [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. These developments are projected to decrease wind speeds during summer [
