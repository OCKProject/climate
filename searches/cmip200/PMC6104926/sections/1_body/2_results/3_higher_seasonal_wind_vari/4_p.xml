<p class="p">The higher seasonal wind variability also explains the relative increase of the backup energy for higher storage capacities (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). A high storage capacity allows to store some part of the energy for several months. However, as the storage capacity is still limited, a higher seasonal wind variability implies that the storage is fully charged earlier in winter and that it is depleted earlier in summer. Thus, less excess energy can be transferred from the winter to the summer months if the seasonal variability of wind power generation increases.
