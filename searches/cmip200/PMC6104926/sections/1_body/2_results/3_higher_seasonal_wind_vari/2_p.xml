<p class="p">The winter-summer ratio increases for most of Central and North-Western Europe, and decreases for the Iberian Peninsula, Greece and Croatia (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>) for four or all five models in the EURO-CORDEX ensemble. In these countries the seasonal variability therefore contributes to the observed changes of backup needs. Changes are small and not robust in Italy, most of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia (except Denmark). Hence, the increase of backup needs in Northern Europe is attributed solely to the higher probability for long periods with low wind power generation. For mid century (see Fig C in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201457.s003" class="xref">S3 Appendix</xref>), results are comparable but less robust for some countries.
