<p class="p">In this paper, we analyzed the change of the temporal characteristics of wind power generation in a strong (RCP8.5) and a medium climate change scenario (RCP4.5, see

Backup and storage needs increase in most of Central, Northern and North-Western Europe and decrease over the Iberian Peninsula, Greece and Croatia. As these effects are observed for both aggregation approaches used in this study (approach (a): aggregation per country, approach (b): European copperplate), we hypothesize that the effect will also be observed in intermediate scenarios with restricted interconnection between countries. By mid century and for medium climate change, results are less pronounced and often not robust. Two main climatologic reasons for the observed increase were identified: a higher probability for long periods of low wind power generation and a stronger seasonal wind variability.
