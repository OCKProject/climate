<p class="p">To isolate the change of the temporal characteristics of wind power generation, we made several simplifications. First of all, we assumed that wind provides a fixed share 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic> of the load for all time frames. This procedure normalizes out a possible change of global wind yields (previously discussed [

 <italic class="italic">γ</italic> and of the exact load time series on our results and found the same tendencies, albeit at different magnitude. Technological progress of the wind turbines and changes of typical hub heights were not considered in a detailed way. However, a different siting of wind farms or a higher hub height of 120 m hardly impacts our results (see Figs D-G in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201457.s004" class="xref">S4 Appendix</xref>). For an integrated assessment, technological progress should be taken into account, but our approach reveals the impact of climate change on the temporal characteristics clearly.
