<p class="p">The projected increase in backup energy needs may partly be compensated in some countries by using an appropriate mix of wind and PV (see also Fig H in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201457.s004" class="xref">S4 Appendix</xref>). Furthermore, wind generation from offshore wind farms is often more persistent and installed capacities are strongly increasing. In a further study, climate projections for onshore and offshore wind and PV should thus be analyzed together in order to account for possible changes in the temporal variations of the combined system of renewables.
