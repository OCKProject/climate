<p class="p">The operation of wind turbines is determined by weather and climate and thus strongly depends on the regional atmospheric conditions. Hence, the generated electric power is strongly fluctuating on different time scales. These fluctuations are crucial for system operation [

However, the potentially crucial impact of climate change on temporal wind fluctuations has not yet been considered in the literature. In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of the temporal statistics of wind generation in a changing climate and we assess their potential impact on energy system operation.
