<p class="p">In this article, we study how climate change affects the temporal characteristics of wind power generation and the necessity for backup and storage infrastructures in wind-dominated power systems in individual European countries and for a perfectly interconnected European power system. Our analysis is based on five state-of-the-art global circulation models (GCMs) downscaled by the EURO-CORDEX initiative [

 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The paper is organized as follows. We first introduce our model to derive the backup need of a country as a function of the storage capacity. Additionally, we present the methods to analyze the CMIP5 ensemble. Afterwards we report our results. The article closes with a discussion.
