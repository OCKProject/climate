<p class="p">The operation of future renewable power systems with large contributions of wind crucially depends on weather and climate. GCMs are used to simulate the dynamics of the earth system on coarse spatial scales for different scenarios of future greenhouse gas concentrations (representative concentration pathways, RCPs [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]). To analyze the operation of the electric power system, a high spatial and temporal resolution is required. Our analysis is thus based on a subset of the EURO-CORDEX ensemble which provides dynamically downscaled climate change data at high resolution (0.11Â° and 3 hours). Time series for the aggregated wind power generation in a country are obtained from the near-surface wind speed (see
