<p class="p">Backup and storage infrastructures are needed when renewable generation drops below load. In order to quantify the necessary amount of backup and storage to ensure a stable supply, we adopt a coarse-grained model of the electric power system (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201457.g001" class="xref">Fig 1c and 1d</xref>). Backup and storage needs crucially depend on the temporal characteristics of wind power generation, in particular the length of periods with low wind generation and the seasonal variability. In the present paper, we thus focus on temporal characteristics and their potential alteration due to climate change.
