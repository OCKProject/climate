 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]). The GCM output is analyzed with a statistical method developed by Reyers

 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. We characterize the large-scale circulation over Central Europe by determining the prevalent circulation weather type (CWT, [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]) using instantaneous daily mean sea level pressure (MSLP) fields around a central point at 10°E and 50°N (near Frankfurt, Germany) at 00 UTC (see also Fig 2 in Reyers 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). The different CWT classes are either directional (‘North’, ‘North-East’, ‘East’, ‘South-East’, ‘South’, ‘South-West’, ‘West’, ‘North-West’) or rotating (‘Cyclonic’, ‘Anti-cyclonic’). Additionally, a proxy for the large-scale geostrophic wind (denoted as 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>-parameter) is derived using the gradient of the instantaneous MSLP field. Higher geostrophic wind values (i.e. higher 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>-parameters) correspond to larger wind power yields in Central Europe [
