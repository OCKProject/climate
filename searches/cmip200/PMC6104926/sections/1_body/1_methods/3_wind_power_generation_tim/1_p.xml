<p class="p">Our analysis is based on a subset of the EURO-CORDEX regional climate simulations which provides dynamically downscaled climate change data at high resolution for Europe based on five GCMs: CNRM-CM5, EC-EARTH, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MPI-ESM-LR [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201457.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). All data is freely available for example at the ESGF (Earth System Grid Federation) node at DKRZ (German Climate Computing Centre) [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. The five models are downscaled using the hydrostatic Rossby Centre regional climate model RCA4 [

 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The downscaling provides continuous surface (10 m) wind data from 1970 to 2100 with a spatial resolution of 0.11Â° and a temporal resolution of

 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Considering the use of only one regional climate model, Moemken 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0201457.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] show that differences between different GCMs are usually larger than differences between different regional climate models.
