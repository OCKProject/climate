<p class="p">Anthropogenic land-use change has had a critical role in historic biodiversity loss, which is expected to continue in the future. Meanwhile, climate is another essential dimension that influences ecosystems, particularly in the future with a wide range of possible climate outcomes. To identify the importance of each factor, biodiversity models may be required to isolate land-use change and climate change factors, which could be performed using the AIM-SSP/RCP dataset. For example, extracting the data for the five SSPs under the same climate conditions would clarify purely socioeconomic effects. ScenarioMIP data do not allow for this application in the sense that it has limited SSP land-use data for each climate mitigation level. More importantly, the land-use data are generated by five IAMs with substantially different mechanisms, making it difficult to interpret differences among SSPs. 7.</p>
