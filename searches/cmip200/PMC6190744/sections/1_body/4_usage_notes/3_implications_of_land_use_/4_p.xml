   <p class="p">The ScenarioMIP data underwent a data harmonisation process creating almost identical data for the base year across IAMs. Our AIM-SSP/RCP data have not undergone this process, meaning that all scenarios are incompatible with ScenarioMIP data. In addition, it may have some disconnections with CMIP6 historical land-use and emissions data, although the AIM provides the SSP3-Baseline scenario (i.e. SSP3-7.0), which is harmonised with other IAMs as part of the ScenarioMIP data.</p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The classifications and resolutions of the AIM-SSP/RCP data differ from the ScenarioMIP data. For example, ScenarioMIP data have 0.25° spatial resolution, while the resolution of the AIM-SSP/RCP is 0.5°.</p>

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Since the AIM-SSP/RCP data are generated with a single IAM, we cannot assess the uncertainty associated with IAM representation; however, it is well known that IAM outcomes differ substantially. In the SSP quantification process, this is also described from various perspectives, such as energy
