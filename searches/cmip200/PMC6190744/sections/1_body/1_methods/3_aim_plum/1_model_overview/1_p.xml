<p class="p">The AIM/PLUM is a global land-use allocation model used to downscale regionally aggregated land-use projections into a spatially gridded land-use pattern for the interactive assessment of human activities and biophysical elements

 </sup>. In this study, the regionally scaled land demand provided by the AIM/CGE model (17 regions) was spatially distributed into grid cells (0.5° × 0.5°). The land allocation was based on economic efficiency (profit maximisation), where a landowner was assumed to decide the mix of land uses to obtain the highest profit for a given biophysical land productivity (production per unit area). Because land was allocated for each region with the same regional classification as that used in the AIM/CGE, land transactions across regions were considered in the AIM/CGE but not in the AIM/PLUM. Seven crop types, with or without irrigation, were considered.
