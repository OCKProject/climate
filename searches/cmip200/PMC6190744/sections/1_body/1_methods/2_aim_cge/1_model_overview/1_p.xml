 </sup>. The main inputs of the AIM/CGE are population, GDP, food preferences, assumptions of energy technology progress on both the supply and demand sides, and air pollution control level. The model provides energy consumption, agricultural and land-use indicators, and GHG and AP emissions. The AIM/CGE considers CO
