<p class="p">With respect to land-use and agricultural representation, the AIM/CGE model employs a land-nesting strategy, similar to the approach used in previous studies

 </sup>. In this approach, land is categorised in one of three agro-ecological zones (AEZ) that are aggregated from the original 18 classifications, where there is a land market for each zone. The allocation of land by sector is formulated as a multinomial logit function to reflect differences in substitutability across land categories with land rent. As such, the function assumes that landowners in each region and AEZ decide on land sharing among options with land rent depending on the production of each land unit (i.e. crops, livestock, and wood products). One approach to using nesting strategies is based on the assumption that land regions are small enough that all competing options are equally substitutable. This assumption implies that it is as easy to switch from forest to wheat as it is to switch from corn to wheat; however, in reality this conversion would not occur unless wheat was more profitable than forest or corn. To calibrate the functions for both managed and unmanaged land in the base year, because no data were available for unmanaged land, we assigned the average base-year land rent of managed land to unmanaged land. It should be noted that the land rent of forest includes both revenue from wood products and the carbon stock price, as evaluated in the case of a particular climate mitigation scenario.
