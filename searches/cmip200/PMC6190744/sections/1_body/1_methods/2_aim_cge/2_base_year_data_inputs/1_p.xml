<p class="p">CGE models use a social accounting matrix (SAM) to calibrate the model parameters. To more precisely and realistically assess the energy flow and GHG emissions, CGE models should account not only for the original SAM, but also for energy statistics. The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)
