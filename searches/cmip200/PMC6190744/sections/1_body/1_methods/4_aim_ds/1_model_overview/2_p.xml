<p class="p">We used national-level population, urbanisation rate, and GDP data to generate the spatially gridded populations and GDPs. The base consisted of 2.5′ data from the Gridded Population of the World

 </sup>. As the initial values, we used 0.5′ population data to produce population distributions within the 2.5′ grid cells. Initial population data and national urban population data were used in urban areas. We set population density thresholds based on the initial populations in the 0.5′ grids so as to match national urban populations. We treated the 0.5′ grid cells above the threshold as urban cells and those below the threshold as rural cells. For the 30′ grid cells, we used urban population/area ratios as the urban index. The data were sourced from the Greenhouse Gas Initiative database provided by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
