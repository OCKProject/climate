<p class="p">The AIM/DS is a model used to downscale regionally aggregated emissions based on an AIM/CGE model on a grid-based map with 0.5Â° resolution. The algorithm is differentiated by sectors, and the emission sources are assigned to one of three groups (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In group 1, GDP and population are the drivers of emissions. This algorithm is adopted mainly for energy-related emissions, which we assumed to have a relationship with GDP or population. Group 2 is downscaled in proportion to the total regional emissions. The base year map information is scaled up or down according to the total regional emissions. The base year represents the starting year of the AIM/CGE simulation (i.e. 2005). Therefore, the spatial distribution pattern for future scenarios is the same as that of the base year. Group 3 is downscaled in proportion to the total global emissions of the base year spatial map. The basic logic in the case of group 3 is the same as that of group 2, but applied to cross-border sectors.
