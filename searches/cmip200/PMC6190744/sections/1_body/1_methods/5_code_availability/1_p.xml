<p class="p">The code and relevant configuration files are in the data repository (Data Citation 1) as “AIMGridemissioncode.zip” and “AIMGridLandusecode.egg” for emissions and land-use respectively. After unzip, there are batch files to make emissions and land use data. For the emissions, /AIMGridemissioncode/shell/python.bat is the batch file that make all emissions NetCDF files. To run the model, python and relevant libraries, and GAMS need to be installed and moreover, both software paths also need to be configured. Regarding land-use, there is a file “AIMGridLandusecode.egg/prog/shell/csv2nc.bat” which processes the NetCDF file. The execution is confirmed under the Cygwin and NetCDF relevant packages installed environment.</p>
