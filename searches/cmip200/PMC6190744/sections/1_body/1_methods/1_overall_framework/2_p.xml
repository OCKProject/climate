<p class="p">We generated 24 scenarios, as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The baseline case does not include a climate mitigation policy. The climate conditions are represented by four RCP levels (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) and three additional forcing levels (1.9, 3.4, and 7.0 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>). For comparison, the case with a forcing level of 7.0 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> roughly corresponds to the SSP2 and SSP3 baseline cases. The levels of 1.9 and 3.4 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> are policy-relevant in the sense that these mitigation levels are used in the 1.5 and 2 °C scenario sets
