 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the method used to calculate the AIM-SSP/RCP gridded emission and land-use data. First, an AIM/computable general equilibrium (CGE) model representing all economic activities was used to compute energy, emissions, and land-use information. The AIM/CGE is a global model that classifies the world into 17 aggregated regions (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Then, an AIM/PLUM (integration Platform for Land-Use and environmental Modelling) disaggregated regionally aggregated land-use data into a gridded basis using land biophysical productivity potential, water, and land conservation information as inputs. Meanwhile, emissions were downscaled using an AIM/DS (DownScaling) model. Since some climate models require CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations for their simulation, we prepared a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration dataset, albeit not on a gridded basis, using the simplified climate model MAGICC (Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change) version 6
