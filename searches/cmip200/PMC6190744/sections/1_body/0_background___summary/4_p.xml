<p class="p">The SSPs employ a concept called scenario matrix architecture, which has a two-dimensional space comprising socioeconomic patterns and climate mitigation levels. The former is classified by the SSPs and the latter is represented by radiative forcing levels, which are sometimes interpreted as RCPs, although they differ from the RCPs because 1.9 and 3.4 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> forcing levels are added to the original RCPs and, more importantly, scenarios that achieve the same levels of mitigation are not identical across the SSPs (e.g. the 2.6 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> mitigation scenario under SSP1 differs from that under SSP2).
