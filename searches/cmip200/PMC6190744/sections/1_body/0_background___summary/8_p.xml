 </sup> for emissions and land-use respectively, our paper has different goals from these two studies, which derived methodological implications of climate simulation outcomes and land-use model integrations, respectively. The aims of this paper are as follows. First, we provide all combinations of SSPs and RCPs and its description while these papers just examined one of the examples. Second, this paper explains how our data is different from ScenarioMIP data from the point of view of advantages and disadvantages of our AIM-SSP/RCP data compared to ScenarioMIP data. Third, data file naming convention and how it can be used, and technical data comparison with the currently available data is shown.
