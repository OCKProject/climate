<p class="p">Over the last ten years, the IAM community has developed multisets of scenarios for use by other climate research communities. The first set of scenarios includes the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)

 </sup>, which have been used extensively in studies cited by the Fifth Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and conducted mainly by the ESM and IAV communities. The RCPs include main climate forcing emissions, atmospheric concentrations, and land-use data. Carbon dioxide (CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O), methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), and other AP species are provided as gridded data. In addition, land-use information is provided as gridded data. The RCPs include four global warming levels represented by radiative forcing at stabilised points: 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 Wm
