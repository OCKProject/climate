<p class="p">Although ScenarioMIP data could be sufficient for CMIP6 and IAV analysis which uses CMIP6 outcomes for many purposes, there may be additional needs for gridded data. For example, the current ScenarioMIP protocol could lack combinations in the SSP/RCP matrix that might be of interest to certain IAV or ESM groups. In addition, the ScenarioMIP data were originally created with five IAMs with different characteristics in the representation of emissions and land-use dynamics. This means that these data encompass inherent SSP characteristics, but also IAM model fingerprints, which do not allow users to isolate pure SSP dimensions.</p>
