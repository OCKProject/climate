<p class="p">There are three main domains of future climate change research: climate simulations performed mainly with earth system models (ESMs) or general circulation models using greenhouse gas (GHGs) and air pollutant (AP) emission data and land-use data; impact, adaptation, and vulnerability (IAV) models that assess climate impacts using future climate information and socioeconomic conditions; and GHG and AP emission scenarios and climate change mitigation policy assessments performed with integrated assessment models (IAMs). However, gridded emissions and land-use data are necessary for both ESM projections and IAV assessments.</p>
