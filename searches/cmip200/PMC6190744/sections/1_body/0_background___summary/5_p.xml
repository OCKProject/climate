<p class="p">Similar to the RCPs, the SSPs are supposed to be for use by the ESM, IAV, and IAM communities; however, the number of scenarios in the full scenario matrix is too large for use in ESMs. As a compromise, the ScenarioMIP (Scenario Model Intercomparison Project) of the CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) created a protocol to select representative scenarios for use in CMIP6 exercises that allows them to cover sufficiently a rational and practical range of mitigation levels and socioeconomic development patterns

 </sup>. Ultimately, the IAM community is expected to provide gridded emissions and land-use information for the aforementioned selected scenarios (this dataset is referred to as ScenarioMIP data hereafter).
