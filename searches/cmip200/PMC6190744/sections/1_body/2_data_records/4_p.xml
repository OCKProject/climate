<p class="p">The naming convention for each file is AIM-SSPRCP-Emissions_$[socioeconomic assumption]_$[climate mitigation level]_$[species]_$[version]. The elements in each of the three dimensions are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. For example, the BC emissions in SSP1 under a 2.6 Wm
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> climate mitigation level are stored in the file named “SSP1-26-BCE.nc”. Moreover, emissions are differentiated by source sector, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, which are named as listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t6" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. All data are represented as the mean (kg/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/s). Zero values are represented as “NaN”. The full list of file names and their corresponding species and scenarios are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>.
