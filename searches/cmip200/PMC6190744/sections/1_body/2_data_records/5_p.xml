<p class="p">The land-use data from the land-use downscaling are stored for each scenario (all land-use categories in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref> are in the same NetCDF files). 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S3</xref> presents the full list of files. The naming convention for each file is AIM-SSPRCP-LUmap_$[socioeconomic assumption]_$[climate mitigation level]_$[version]. The units are the fractions of each land-use category in each pixel. For example, if the cropland share of a grid is 60%, the value in that cell is 0.6.
