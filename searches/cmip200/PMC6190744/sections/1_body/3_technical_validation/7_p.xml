 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>. We observed several unique characteristics. First, AIM-SSP/RCP had a cut-off below 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>, whereas LUH2 had even smaller pixels. Second, some grid cells had AIM-SSP/RCP values around 1 but lower LUH2 values. Third, to obtain data consistent with the regional aggregated AIM/CGE, we reconciled the data using an optimisation model requiring a lower boundary to obtain a numerical solution, as described by Hasegawa

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>
 </sup>. The first point was also related to this reconciliation process, mainly to maintain consistency with the regionally aggregated AIM/CGE model output. Another possible reason for the discrepancy between the two datasets is the original source data, since AIM-SSP/RCP uses Monfreda
