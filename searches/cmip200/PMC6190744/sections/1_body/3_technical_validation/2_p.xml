<p class="p">We used the SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emitted by the energy sector in 2005 as an illustrative example of emissions. The two datasets showed certain agreements; however, the coefficient of determination (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) was not very high, and there were some spatial discrepancies in emissions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a and b</xref>). For example, the AIM-SSP/RCP data were spread thinly and broadly (e.g. in China), whereas the CEDS was condensed in limited places. In addition, many points had a value of zero for one dataset but a non-zero value for the other (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>). There are several possible reasons for this. First, the total emissions for each country or region differ between the scenarios and CEDS. In addition, our data were calibrated to EDGAR4.2, which differs from CEDS. Similarly, the 2005 gridded data were calibrated to the RCP data in the AIM-SSP/RCP, which could differ from CEDS. In principle, there are no observations for global AP emissions; therefore, we could only compare the datasets, but could not judge which was better.
