<p class="p">Since it is worthwhile for users to know how the ScenarioMIP and AIM-SSP/RCP data are different, we compared these two datasets for future scenarios. In ScenarioMIP, SSP3-baseline (SSP3-radiative forcing 7.0 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) scenarios are comparable because AIM provides this scenario. As examples, SO2 and NOx, and the years 2015 (ScenarioMIP starting year), 2050 and 2090 are selected. We found that the differences are similar over time, which means that the base year has strong influences on the future gridded emissions as well (

One of the reasons why the base year fingerprint remains strong in the future is the characteristics of the SSP3-baseline scenario, in that this scenario does not include strong policy intervention.
