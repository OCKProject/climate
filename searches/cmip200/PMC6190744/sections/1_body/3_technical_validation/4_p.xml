<p class="p">To explore the differences between these two datasets more systematically, we present two relevant types of analysis for the base year data. The first is the level of agreement between the datasets for the 17 aggregated regions that are used for classification in AIM/CGE (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t7" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). There are global variations across sectors and species but the ratios of AIM-SSP/RCP to CEDS values are in the range 0.66â€“1.11, which can be interpreted as modest differences. Individual regions could exhibit more variations. The energy sector, which has a large share of both species, shows relatively small differences while the building sector, which is a small contributor to the total emissions, exhibits high discrepancies.
