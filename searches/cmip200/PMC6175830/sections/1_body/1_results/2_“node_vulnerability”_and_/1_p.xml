<p id="Par15" class="p">Since the giant component size 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> is closely related to the node-connection pattern of a given network, to study why some models (such as NorESM1-M) reproduced the observed 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> pattern while some others (such as INMCM4, MRI-ESM1, etc.) failed, it is straightforward to investigate the node vulnerability

 </sub> in the network. As described in the “Methods” section, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>

 </sup>. It is defined as the ratio of the times that a given node is isolated to the entire time period of an ENSO event. If the ratio is high, we consider the node to have high vulnerability. Based on reanalysis data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>), it has been found that nodes in the SAT network are highly vulnerable over the tropical central eastern Pacific. This is reasonable since ENSO events have the strongest influences on the upper SATs over this key region

 </sup>. From model simulations, we find that models with good skills in simulating the percolation phase transition (e.g., NorESM1-M) have similar 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> patterns as that obtained from reanalysis data. However, those that cannot reproduce the desired phase transition (e.g., INMCM4, GFDL-CM3, etc.) fail in fully capturing the observed 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> pattern. For instance, one can see clearly that the simulated vulnerable areas determined by GDFL-CM3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6g</xref>) and GFDL-ESM2G (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6h</xref>) are much larger than that obtained from reanalysis data. This overestimated node vulnerability may lead to a percolation phase transition, but at larger 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3g,h</xref>). For models with smaller vulnerable areas (e.g., INMCM4 and MRI-ESM1), the node links are too stable. This underestimated node vulnerability may be responsible for missing the percolation phase transition (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3o,p</xref>). For other models such as FGOALS-g2, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5B-LR, MPI-ESM-P, and MIROC-ESM, the simulated 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> distributions are remarkably different from the observed pattern, which may contribute to the biased simulations of the percolation phase transition.
