 </sup>, the simulated SSTA might give an in-depth understanding of why the percolation phase transition differs greatly among different models. Especially considering that percolation phase transition measures the models’ ability to capture sea-air interactions, it is essential to further compare the simulated SSTA with the node vulnerability in the upper SAT network. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, since the node vulnerability is related to the magnitude of SSTA, the composites of SSTA during ENSO events (La Niña events being represented by the absolute value) are calculated. From reanalysis data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>), one can see that the regions with strong absolute SSTAs are exactly the same regions with high

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>). This is reasonable as the SSTA should have the strongest influences on the upper SAT of the same region

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup>. In other words, if the sea-air interaction is fully captured, the

  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> patterns in the tropical central eastern Pacific should be similar to the SSTA patterns in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>. However, by comparing the SSTA patterns in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> with the 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> patterns in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, we found mismatches in many models. For example, in the GFDL-CM3 and MIROC-ESM models, the vulnerable regions with high 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6g,n</xref>) are much larger than the regions with strong SSTA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7g,h and n</xref>). In the FGOALS-g2, MPI-ESM-P, and INMCM4 models, the simulated vulnerable regions in the tropical central eastern Pacific (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6f,m and o</xref>) are smaller than the regions with strong SSTA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7f,m and o</xref>). All these models with mismatches between the SSTA patterns and the 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> patterns in the tropical central eastern Pacific fail in reproducing the desired percolation phase transition. Only in the models in which the two patterns in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> are similar, such as NorESM1-M, was the percolation phase transition reasonably simulated. Accordingly, the improper simulations of percolation phase transition may rely on the mismatches of the SSTA pattern and the

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub> pattern in the tropical central eastern Pacific, or in other words, the imperfectly simulated sea-air interactions.
