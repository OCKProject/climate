 <italic class="italic">S</italic> (red) and the percentage of isolated nodes 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> (blue) for each SAT network. From reanalysis data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), when the standardized monthly Niño3.4 index is larger (smaller) than 0.5 (−0.5), nodes in the upper SAT network are more likely to become isolated (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> increases) and the giant component size becomes smaller (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> decreases). In some cases, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> falls abruptly from a high level to a low level, indicating a phase transition (Fig.

 </sup>. From the model simulations, the anti-correlations between 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> are well reproduced for nearly all the models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b–p</xref>), even though the simulations from some models (CNRM-CM5, IPSL-CM5B-LR, etc.) are more violent, while from some others (INMCM4, MRI-ESM1, etc.) are more stable. However, regarding the percolation phase transitions, different simulations are produced. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, we classified all of the considered time points into two groups according to the definition of an ENSO event. That is, if the standardized three-month running mean Niño3.4 index ≥ (≤) 0.5 (−0.5) for five consecutive overlapping three-month periods, we consider it an El Niño (La Niña) event. Time points in these events are gathered as the “ENSO” group, while other points belong to the “Normal” group. For the “Normal” group, the variations of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> verus 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> are plotted in the left-hand panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a–p</xref>. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref> (reanalysis data), one can see that the giant component sizes 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> of most time points are well above 0.8, implying a well connected network. There is no abrupt changes of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. This behavior was well simulated by most models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b–p</xref>). Only in the models GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, and IPSL-CM5B-LR, a rightward shift of the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> pattern is found, indicating overestimated 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values. In the “ENSO” group, however, an abrupt decrease of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> was observed using the reanalysis data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Although the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> values are higher than 0.8 for most time points during ENSO events, as long as the fraction of isolated nodes reaches the critical points (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">c</italic>
 </sub> = 0.48), the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> drops to a very low level (approximately 0.4), indicating a percolation phase transition. This phenomenon was not reproduced by most models. As in GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, and IPSL-CM5B-LR models, the percolation phase transition happens at either larger or smaller 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values, while for HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, INMCM4, and MRI-ESM1, no phase transition is even detected. Only in CNRM-CM5, FGOALS-s2, and NorESM1-M does a reasonable percolation phase transition seem to be reproduced.
