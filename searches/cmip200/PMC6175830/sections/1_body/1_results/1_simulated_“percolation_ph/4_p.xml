<p id="Par13" class="p">It is worth noting that not all the time points within an ENSO event point to low 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> values. The percolation phase transition does not occur with the arising of an ENSO event. Only when the fraction of isolated nodes reaches 48% do the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> values decrease from a higher level (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> &gt; 0.6, above 0.8 for most cases) to a lower level (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> &lt; 0.6, approximately 0.4 for most cases). This means that even if the SAT network is influenced by the SSTA below, as long as the impacts are not strong enough, a percolation phase transition cannot be triggered. Accordingly, we further divided the “ENSO” group into two parts: one includes the cases when the percolation phase transition is not triggered (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> &gt; 0.6), and the other is for the time points at which the percolation phase transition occurred (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> &lt; 0.6). To better evaluate the models’ ability to simulate the percolation phase transition, we further presented the Taylor diagrams

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup> for the “Normal” group, the “ENSO” group with 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> &gt; 0.6, and the “ENSO” group with 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> &lt; 0.6 separately. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, results from the reanalysis dataset are considered as the “reference” (black point in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), while results from models are marked in the diagram with other colors. The cosine of the polar angle represents the spatial correlation coefficient (SCC) between the observed (reanalysis dataset) and the modeled 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> patterns
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. The distance from each point to the origin is the standard deviation (SD), while the distance to the “reference” point is the RMSE
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. In general, the SCC refers to phase simulation while standard deviation refers to amplitude simulation. Thus, a model simulation that is relatively accurate would lie near the dotted arc (indicating similar variance) and close to the reference point. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>, it is clear that the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> patterns simulated by more than half of the models have similar SD to that calculated from the reanalysis dataset. As for the SCC, except the GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC-ESM models, all of the other models have high SCCs between 0.5 and 0.8 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Accordingly, most models can reproduce the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> pattern for the “Normal” group with small RMSE. For the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> patterns in “ENSO” groups with 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> &gt; 0.6, similar results are found as in the “Normal” groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). Most models have reasonable simulations of the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> pattern with similar SD and high SCC (0.6–0.8). However, regarding the “ENSO” groups with 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> &lt; 0.6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>), poor simulation skills of the models are found. In addition to the four models without percolation phase transition (HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, INMCM4, and MRI-ESM1; see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), there are another five models (MIROC-ESM, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, FGOALS-g2, and MPI-ESM-P) in which the simulated 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> patterns are nearly uncorrelated with the “reference”. Moreover, the SCCs are also very low in the IPSL-CM5B-LR, CMCC-CMS, CESM1-FASTCHEM and FGOALS-s2 models. Only two models (NorESM1-M and CNRM-CM5) show some skills in simulating the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> pattern. They have relatively high SCC values (0.5–0.6), reasonable SDs, and most importantly, smaller RMSEs. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>, the NorESM1-M model seems to provide the best simulations of the percolation phase transition.
