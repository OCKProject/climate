<p id="Par4" class="p">Recently, the concept of complex network has been introduced as a powerful framework for extracting information from large volumes of data, allowing the study of the full complexity of the statistical interdependency structure within a multi-variate dataset

 </sup>. In climate science, there are growing interests in applying the concept of complex networks, as climate networks can be easily constructed using different regions (grids) of the world as nodes, and the interactions between the nodes (such as heat, material, or even force exchanges) as links

 </sup>. By measuring the similarity of observations at different nodes, one can determine how nodes are linked in a network, which further allows climate studies from the perspective of complex networks.
