  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>. This state conversion is named a percolation phase transition, which is an advanced way to measure the non-linearity of a high-dimensional structure. Under the influences of external forces, a percolation phase transition indicates an abrupt collapse of the “old” network. For example, the electrical power networks in the real world can be damaged by malicious attacks or natural disasters, which may further result in abrupt power blackouts

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">c</italic>
 </sub> = 0.48, the SAT network will abruptly be divided into many small isolated clusters, indicating a conversion of the network state

 </sup>. This abrupt percolation phase transition means that the anomalous SST warming/cooling in the tropical central eastern Pacific has significantly changed the SAT field, which may further transport the influences of ENSO to remote regions via an atmospheric bridge. Accordingly, the fraction of isolated nodes 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> was conjectured to be a new index to determine whether the influences of ENSO can be transported remotely.
