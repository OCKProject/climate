<p id="Par7" class="p">The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the “Results” section, we first study how the simulated SAT networks respond to the anomalous SST warming/cooling in the tropical central eastern Pacific. By comparing the results with those from reanalysis dataset, the performance of the models in simulating the percolation phase transition was evaluated. After listing the models with reasonable simulations and the models with poor simulation skills, we further analyzed the performance from the spatial distribution of simulated node vulnerability and sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) that probably have influences on the performance of percolation phase transition. With all the findings, a detailed discussion is made in the “Discussion and Conclusion” section, and a brief description of the data and methods is provided in a section so-named at the end of this paper.</p>
