 </sup>, it can be considered a robust metric with which to evaluate the ENSO simulations in dynamical models. Whether the models are able to capture the percolation phase transition of the SAT network is of great importance for their further simulated ENSO impacts. However, as a newly revealed phenomenon, the current state-of-the-art models may ignore this process and their performance in simulating this phase transition is still unclear. In this work, we aim to address this issue. By studying historical simulations of 15 models participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), we evaluated their ability in simulating the observed percolation phase transition. From this new perspective, directions for further model improvement are suggested.
