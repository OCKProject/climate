<p id="Par2" class="p">El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the dominant mode of inter-annual climate variability, is one of the most important ocean-atmosphere coupled phenomena. It is characterized by large-scale anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) warming (El Niño)/cooling (La Niña) in the tropical central eastern Pacific, and exerts great influences on regional and global climate
