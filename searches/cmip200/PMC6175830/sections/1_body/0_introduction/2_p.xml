<p id="Par3" class="p">With these metrics, many CGCMs have been evaluated and further improved. However, these metrics are mainly based on variables that are averaged over a given region. In this case, the complexity is reduced, but detailed information from high dimensions is also ignored. As a result, some important aspects of ENSO may be missed. For example, it is not possible to diagnose the internal interactions within the Niño3 region if the Niño3 index is used. For ENSO events with the same amplitude (Niño3 index), it is also difficult to judge whether the events have similar impacts on remote regions without a detailed analysis of how the influences transported. Therefore, to better evaluate the ENSO simulations in CGCMs and further improve our understanding of the dynamics of ENSO, new metrics focusing on more detailed, high dimensional information are needed.</p>
