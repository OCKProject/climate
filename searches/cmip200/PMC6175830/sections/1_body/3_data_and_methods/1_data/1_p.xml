<p id="Par21" class="p">In this study, historical simulations of 15 CMIP5 models were analyzed. Information on the 15 models is listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. For each model, the simulated daily SAT and monthly SST data were downloaded from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) via

All of the data end in 2005 and cover at least 100 years. Using SAT data, the SAT network was constructed over the domain 120

In addition to the model simulated data, we also downloaded daily SAT data from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 1 project at the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, via

 </sup>. The reanalysis SAT data were used to construct a SAT network. Since it covers only 69 years (1948–2016) with a spatial resolution of 2.5° × 2.5°, to maintain consistency among different datasets, the SAT networks were constructed using data from 1950 to 2005 with the spatial resolution set as 5° × 5°. As for the standardized three-month running mean Niño3.4 indices, we defined an ENSO event when the indices ≥(≤) +0.5(−0.5) for five consecutive month periods. Monthly SST anomalies (with annual cycle removed) were also used in this study (see Fig.
