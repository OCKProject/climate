<p id="Par19" class="p">It is worth noting that when studying the simulated percolation properties, we used the simulated Niño3.4 index to classify both the “Normal” and “ENSO” groups. Therefore, the low skills of most models in simulating the percolation phase transition are not related to the models’ ability to simulate the SST anomalies. More likely, it is the inappropriate atmospheric component, or the coupler of the CMIP5 models that leads to the poor simulations. As discussed in

 </sup>, it has been proposed that the differences in performance between the FGOALS-s2 and FGOALS-g2 models in simulating the percolation phase transition mainly arise from the different atmospheric components. In this study, the simulations of these two models show good agreement with the previous study, although the data length is slightly different between the two works

 </sup>. However, for the other two pairs of models that are the different versions of the same model, GFDL-CM3/GFDL-ESM2G and HadGEM2-CC/HadGEM2-ES, significantly different simulation performance is not shown. In fact, both versions of the HadGEM2 model (HadGEM2-CC and HadGEM2-ES) miss the percolation phase transition (Fig.
