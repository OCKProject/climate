<p id="Par20" class="p">Finally, we emphasize that the percolation phase transition is not only a metric for the evaluation of ENSO simulations. It may also serve as an indicator for the ENSO impacts. In previous studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>, it has been conjectured that the transition of the percolation phase indicates that the upper SAT field has been fully changed by the SSTA, and the influences of ENSO may be further transported to remote regions through an atmospheric bridge
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>
 </sup>. If there is no percolation phase transition, however, the influences of ENSO may be mainly trapped in nearby regions. In this study, we can see that even in the “ENSO” group there are also stages in which the phase state stays stable with

 </sub>. Accordingly, compared to the Niño3.4 index, checking the percolation properties of the SAT network maybe a better way to judge the ENSO impacts. Although this discussion is beyond the scope of the present work, it deserves more detailed study in the future.
