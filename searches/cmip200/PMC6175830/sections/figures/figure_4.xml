  <p class="p">Taylor diagram of 
   <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> patterns shown in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Shows the results for the “Normal” group, (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) for the “ENSO (
   <italic class="italic">S</italic> &gt; 0.6)” group, while (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) the “ENSO (
   <italic class="italic">S</italic> &lt; 0.6)” group. Each dot represents a model as shown in the bottom box, while the black dot stands for the results calculated from NCEP reanalysis data, which serves as the reference. The azimuthal positions represent the spatial correlation coefficients between the 
   <italic class="italic">S</italic> − 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> pattern obtained from the reanalysis data and those simulated from models. The radial distance from origin to each dot stands for the standard deviation, and the distances from the black dot to the other dots are the root mean square errors (RMSE). It is worth to note that, since the percolation phase transition is missed by HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, INMCM4, and MRI-ESM1, no dots are shown for the four models in (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>).
