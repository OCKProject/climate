<p id="Par2" class="p">Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) from June to September (JJAS) sources its water from vapour transport by southwesterlies, which supports convection over the Indian subcontinent

 </sup>. By contrast, a positive IOD, when free of an El Niño’s influence, induces atmospheric circulation anomalies which would result in anomalously high ISMR. In particular, the cold anomalies in the eastern Indian Ocean are conducive to vapour transport by generating anomalous meridional circulation
