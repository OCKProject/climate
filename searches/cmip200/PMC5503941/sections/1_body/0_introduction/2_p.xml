 </sup>. CMIP5 models project an increase in ISMR in a warmer climate in terms of a multi-model ensemble mean (MMEM) with a reasonably strong inter-model consensus

 </sup>. However, these models suffer from many biases and the projections have a large inter-model spread, undermining the confidence in the projections

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>. One such model bias is the IOD-ISMR positive correlation which is too weak, manifesting as a shorter time fraction in which a positive IOD causes an increase in ISMR, leading to an overly weak IOD-ISMR positive correlation, or an overly strong IOD-ISMR negative correlation

 </sup>. Understanding the cause of this unrealistic correlation is important for tracing the source of uncertainties in future projections of ISMR.
