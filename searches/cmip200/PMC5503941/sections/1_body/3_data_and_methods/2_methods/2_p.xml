 </sup>. The ISMR index is the area-averaged rainfall anomalies over the Indian subcontinent (7°N-28°N, 70°E-90°E), and the SLP index is the area-averaged anomalies over the same domain. Future ISMR changes are expressed in terms of percentage change in present-day climatology per degree Celsius of global warming [GW; % (°C of GW)

Here, we use two metrics to benchmark the realism of ENSO and IOD simulations in models: (1) the amplitude of the IOD (ENSO) measured by the standard deviation of the IOD (ENSO) index; (2) the response of atmosphere circulation to the IOD (ENSO) defined as the correlation between atmospheric fields with the IOD (ENSO) index
