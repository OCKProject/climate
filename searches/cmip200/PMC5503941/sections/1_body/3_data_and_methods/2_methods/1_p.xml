<p id="Par16" class="p">All data are bi-linearly interpolated onto a uniform 1° × 1° grid. Anomalies in present-day climate are referenced to the period of 1950–1999 and linearly detrended. The IOD is described through an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on detrended SST anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean domain (20°S-20°N, 40°E-120°E). In the EOF analysis, the IOD mode does not always come out as EOF1. For each model, we correlate the observed IOD pattern with each of the model EOF patterns. The EOF pattern that gives highest correlation is objectively identified the IOD mode in the model. The IOD index is defined as the associated time series, which, with the total variance of the EOF pattern scaled to unity
