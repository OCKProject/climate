<p id="Par15" class="p">We analyse a suite of simulations from 34 models taking part in CMIP5, in which historical and representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenarios are used to simulate the present-day and future climates respectively. Here, SST, precipitation, and sea level pressure (SLP) outputs from one ensemble member (r1i1p1) in each model are utilized (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> for a list of models). We define the second half of the 20
