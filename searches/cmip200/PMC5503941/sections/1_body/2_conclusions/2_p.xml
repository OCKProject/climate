<p id="Par14" class="p">There are many avenues in which the present-study can be extended. Firstly, Indian summer monsoon winds can in turn affect the IOD development

 </sup> in a positive feedback. Whether models simulate this feedback and whether the realism of model simulation of this feedback contributes to the weak IOD-ISMR positive correlation need to be investigated. Secondly, a positive-IOD SST pattern promotes monsoonal cross-equatorial atmospheric flows conducive to increased ISMR
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>. It is not clear the overly-weak IOD-ISMR positive correlation in models is solely due to the overly-strong control by ENSO, or also due to poor simulations of other factors such as the IOD-induced cross-equatorial flows. Finally, we have not entered into the debate as to the relative importance of the dynamic and thermodynamic change to the projected ISMR increase

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>
 </sup>. Whether under greenhouse warming, a change in the IOD properties contributes to the relative importance needs to be assessed. Nevertheless, everything being equal, without the bias of the overly-weak IOD-ISMR positive correlation, the projected ISMR increase would be larger.
