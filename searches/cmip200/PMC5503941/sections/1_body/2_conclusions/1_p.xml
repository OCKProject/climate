<p id="Par13" class="p">We assessed the ISMR correlation with ENSO and the IOD in climate models and found that there is an overly strong IOD-ISMR negative correlation compared to observations. We demonstrated that the overly large IOD-ISMR negative correlation results from the exceedingly strong El Ni√±o-induced positive SLP anomalies over the Indian subcontinent. This contributes to the suppression of an IOD-ISMR positive correlation. We showed that this bias in the present-day climate is relevant to future projection of ISMR, and would lead to an underestimation in the projected future ISMR increase. Our result suggests that the uncertainties in ISMR projection can be in part induced by the present-day simulation of ENSO, the IOD, their relationship, and their rainfall correlations. Therefore, improving model simulation of the IOD, ENSO, the feedback processes, and their relative importance in regional correlations is important for increasing our confidence in projected ISMR changes.</p>
