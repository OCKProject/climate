<p id="Par7" class="p">To date, it is not clear what causes the significant negative correlation in the simulated present-day climate, and how it is related to the model performance of ENSO simulation. Over the Indian subcontinent, the resemblance of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c to d</xref> suggests that ENSO is a potential factor influencing the IOD-ISMR correlation. During El Niño, the SLP over the Indian subcontinent is stronger than normal, suppressing convection and resulting in rainfall reduction, and vice versa. Although the majority of CMIP5 models simulate such SLP response to ENSO, the ENSO-SLP correlations in most models are stronger than in observations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Further, models with a larger ENSO amplitude tend to produce a greater correlation, and the tendency is systematic, with the inter-model correlation (C = 0.47), statistically significant above the 95% confidence level. These overly strong SLP anomalies suppress development of any negative SLP anomalies, or positive rainfall anomalies, a concurrent positive IOD would induce.
