<p id="Par8" class="p">Besides generating the overly large SLP anomalies over the Indian subcontinent, ENSO affects IOD properties such as amplitude. Previous studies have demonstrated that ENSO is a trigger of an IOD event

 </sup>. During an El Niño event, the weakening of the Walker circulation generates easterly anomalies in the eastern and central equatorial Indian Ocean, lifting the central equatorial Indian Ocean and eastern Indian thermocline. This induces upwelling in the eastern Indian Ocean, leading to anomalous cooling in the surface water; the cooling contributes to an anomalous positive west-minus-east surface temperature gradient, which, in turn enhances the easterly anomalies in a Bjerknes positive feedback process

 </sup>. Indeed, there is an inter-model relationship showing that models with a greater ENSO amplitude systematically produce a greater IOD amplitude (Fig.

 </sup>. Therefore, the response of the IOD to any forcing, including ENSO, is greater in models than in observations.
