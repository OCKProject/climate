<p id="Par9" class="p">Given that ENSO overly influences IOD amplitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) and SLP anomalies over the Indian subcontinent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), and given that the IOD amplitude is strongly associated with the IOD-ISMR negative correlation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), it follows that models with a greater ENSO amplitude are associated with a greater IOD-ISMR negative correlation, and this is seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>. In the majority of models, ENSO overly controls IOD amplitude because the simulated Bjerknes feedback in the eastern Indian Ocean is too strong. ENSO also enhances the IOD-ISMR negative correlation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>), or suppresses the IOD-ISMR positive correlation because the El Niño-induced positive SLP anomalies are overly strong (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). These overly strong ENSO-induced SLP anomalies suggest that ENSO 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic> contributes to the suppression of the IOD-ISMR positive correlation. This is confirmed from the inter-model relationship between the ENSO-SLP correlation and the IOD-ISMR correlation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>). Models with an overly strong ENSO-SLP positive correlation produce an overly strong IOD-ISMR negative correlation.
