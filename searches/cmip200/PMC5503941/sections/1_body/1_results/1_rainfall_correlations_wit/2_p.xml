 </sup>. However, in terms of the MMEM, ENSO’s influence on the ISMR is stronger than the observations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b,d</xref>). The IOD-ISMR correlation pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>) resembles the ENSO-ISMR correlation pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref>). This implies that there is an overly strong IOD-ISMR negative correlation in the present-day simulation; i.e., positive IODs tend to be associated with an ISMR reduction, more so in models. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref> shows that models with greater IOD amplitude produce a greater IOD-ISMR negative correlation. The same analysis was conducted for each grid point with respect to models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>), and the result further confirms that models with a greater IOD amplitude tend to produce a greater IOD-ISMR negative correlation. This is seen in other IOD-affected regions, for example, negative correlations over the IOD eastern pole and southern Australia but positive correlations in the east African countries

 </sup>. The result contradicts with the previous studies in which the IOD-ISMR correlation without ENSO influence should be positive; and the positive correlation should increase with an intensified IOD
