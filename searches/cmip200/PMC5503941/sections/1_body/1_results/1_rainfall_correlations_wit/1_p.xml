<p id="Par5" class="p">We focus on JJAS because these months see fast development of both ENSO and the IOD, and are the time when ISMR peaks. The impact on ISMR from the IOD and from ENSO tends to offset during JJAS, and this was documented using observations and model simulations

 </sup>. For example, the 1997 El Niño event was strongest of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, which alone would lead to an ISMR reduction, but a moderate ISMR increase occurred; this is because ENSO’s influence on ISMR was overwhelmed by the concurrent 1997 extreme positive IOD event

 </sup>. As such, in observations the correlation map between the IOD and the ISMR differs from its ENSO counterpart (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a,b</xref>), despite the recent weakening of the ENSO-ISMR relationship

 </sup>. Rainfall responses to ENSO show a broadly consistent and significant region in the Indian subcontinent, i.e., a monsoonal rainfall reduction during El Niño (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). However, there is no significant rainfall response to IOD events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), as the dominant and concurrent effect from ENSO suppresses the impact from IOD events.
