<p id="Par12" class="p">Therefore, the extent of the projected ISMR increase depends at least partially on how well the present-day IOD-ISMR correlation is simulated. In the present case, the projected ISMR increase is underestimated because of the bias of the overly large IOD-ISMR negative correlation. In other words, without this bias the projected ISMR increase would be greater. Here, we estimate the potential impact of the underestimation in the projected ISMR increase, based on the present-day IOD-ISMR correlation derived from observations and MMEM simulations. The difference between the future ISMR change derived from the MMEM IOD-ISMR correlation (black asterisk in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>) and that from observations (intersection of red line and black line) is about 2.4% per °C of GW. Assuming a global warming of 4 °C in the next century, the total underestimated ISMR increase will be nearly 10% of climatological ISMR of the present-day climate. As 10% fluctuations of ISMR are considered as the threshold for drought and flood

 </sup>, this magnitude of underestimation due to the bias in the IOD-ISMR correlation alone could have far reaching implications in terms of climate change adaptation options.
