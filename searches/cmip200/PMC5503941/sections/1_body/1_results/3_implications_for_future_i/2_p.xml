<p id="Par11" class="p">This result is consistent with the mean state change in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Under greenhouse warming, the majority of models produce a warming pattern with a slower warming in the east than in the west Indian Ocean, namely a positive IOD-like warming pattern

 </sup>. However, this pattern is in part induced by the weakening of the Pacific Walker circulation

 </sup>. Thus, the inter-annual process in which a weakening Walker circulation leads to overly large positive SLP anomalies suppressing the IOD-ISMR positive correlation, also operates in the long-term timescale; in other words, the overly strong IOD-ISMR negative correlation on inter-annual time scales is not alleviated by the positive IOD-like long-term warming trend, because the latter is a consequence of weakening of the Pacific Walker circulation.
