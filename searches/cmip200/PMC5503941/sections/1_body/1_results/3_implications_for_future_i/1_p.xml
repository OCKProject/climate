<p id="Par10" class="p">The aforementioned biases are large and common in CMIP5 models. Are they relevant to future projection of ISMR under greenhouse warming? If relevant, models that simulate a larger IOD-ISMR negative correlation should systematically produce a greater ISMR change in the future, and the inter-model relationship should be statistically significant. Indeed, the inter-model relationship between future ISMR changes and the present-day IOD-ISMR correlation shows that models with a greater IOD-ISMR negative correlation does tend to produce a smaller ISMR increase in the future, and the tendency is significant above the 95% confidence level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). Such tendency is also seen in a correlation map between grid-point rainfall changes and the present-day grid-point IOD-rainfall correlation (Fig.
