  <p class="p">Inter-model relationship between future projections with present-day simulations. Inter-model variations in the present-day IOD-ISMR correlation versus variations in (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) future ISMR change (units: % per °C of global warming), and in (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) grid-point future rainfall change (units: % per °C of global warming) vs grid-point rainfall correlation with the IOD. In (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>), the solid black line denotes the linear regression, and symbols for models are the same as in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, and the red vertical line represents the observed IOD-ISMR correlation in present-day climate. Areas within green contours in (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) denote regions where the correlation is statistically significant above the 95% confidence level. The statistical significance is calculated using a two-tailed Student’s 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test. The plot and map were generated by NCL version 6.3.0 (
