  <p class="p">Inter-model relationships among ENSO, IOD and its atmospheric correlations. Inter-model relationship in present-day climate between (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) ENSO-SLP correlation and ENSO amplitude, (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) IOD amplitude and ENSO amplitude, (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) IOD-ISMR correlation and ENSO amplitude, and (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) IOD-ISMR correlation and ENSO-SLP correlation. The observations and MMEM are shown as the black circle and black asterisk, respectively. Each colored symbol represents a CMIP5 model. Solid line in each plot denotes the linear regression line with correlation coefficient (C), p-value (P) and regression coefficient (S) provided. A p-value smaller than 0.05 means statistical significance above the 95% confidence level. All plots were generated by NCL version 6.3.0 (
