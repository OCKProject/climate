  <title class="title">Most important wheat-growing areas and the effect of SWS on wheat yields.</title>
  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Colors mark the spatial distributions of the wheat-growing area and the top 10 wheat exporters during 2009–2012 in descending order, with light gray showing arable land without wheat cultivation. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) Comparison of wheat yield deviations during years with and without severe water scarcity (SWS) occurrence, combining the 10 main wheat exporters [European Union (EU), Russia, Canada, United States, Ukraine, Australia, Kazakhstan, Argentina, Turkey, and Brazil]. SWS and yield data over the period 1991–2016 were used. (B) Frequency of yield deviation expressed as the 
   <italic class="italic">Z</italic> score and smoothed by Gaussian filter for years with no SWS occurrence (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 136) versus years when at least 1% of the exporter’s wheat-growing area was affected by SWS (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 78) during the year of harvest. (C) Yield differences at the exporter entity level relative to the previous year for years with no SWS occurrence (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 136) versus years when at least 10% of the exporter’s wheat-growing area was affected by SWS (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5).
