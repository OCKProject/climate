  <title class="title">Areas that are most and least at risk of an increased probability of SWS during the wheat season.</title>
  <p class="p">The hot spots depict the 10% (or 25%) of grids with the highest SWS occurrence, which are also important wheat-producing areas. The good spots represent the 10% or 25% of wheat-producing grids with the lowest probability of SWS. The estimates are based on the analysis of the entire set of projections of 27 GCMs (table S2) for RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 for the period 2041â€“2070, which was compared with the SWS occurrence from 1961 to 1990, based on the control run using the same set of GCMs. The grids where wheat is being grown outside hot/good spots are depicted by light yellow, and light gray depicts the remaining agricultural land.</p>
