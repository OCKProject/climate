<p class="p">The WhP area was determined for each 5″ grid (~10 km) on the basis of the datasets developed by Hoekstra

 </xref>). For these datasets, the total acreage of arable land in each grid was first estimated and then used to estimate the share of wheat over the global WhA, and these results are presented in fig. S1. First, we selected grids where wheat has been grown, and we weighted each grid on the basis of the area of arable land within the grid. This value represented the current potential area for WhP (i.e., wheat grids), and latitudinal changes in the grid area were considered. Then, weights were assigned to each wheat grid on the basis of the proportion of the total global wheat-growing area of 210 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> hectares represented by a given grid. This approach allowed us to estimate how much of the global WhA was affected by SWS/EWS during each harvest year. A similar approach was applied to estimate weights according to the share of global WhP (570 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> metric tons) represented by each grid (i.e., WhP). The WhP of the land area mass of a grid cell was used on the basis of FAOSTAT 1999–2013 mean yield data (on the national or regional level). These data were used to derive the weights. Last, on the basis of the FAOSTAT database, the top 10 exporting regions during 2009–2012 (fig. S1) were determined, and the wheat-producing grids were weighted separately (WhAEx and WhPEx) in these countries, as shown in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and fig. S1. For each grid cell, the long-term mean harvest and sowing dates were estimated on the basis of data provided by Sacks
