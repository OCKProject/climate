<p class="p">A comparison of the SWS/EWS data for the period 1861–2010 from the climate models, i.e., the “control run” data from the ensemble of the CMIP5 climate models (table S3), with the CRU-based calculations over the same time period showed very good agreement in terms of various SWS characteristics (e.g., 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and figs. S6 and S8). The CRU-based SWS within the 95% confidence interval of the CMIP5 simulations (fig. S6) showed very similar return probabilities of SWS events (
