<p class="p">We analyzed simulations from 27 global climate models (table S3) from the CMIP5 database (
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">25</italic>
 </xref>). These simulations included model runs with specific historical, natural, and anthropogenic forcings from 1861 to 2005 and included 21st century changes in anthropogenic aerosols and GHGs following the RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 scenarios (
 <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">59</italic>
 </xref>). If a model had multiple ensemble simulations, then we analyzed only the first ensemble run. All the monthly modeled data (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind speed, solar radiation, and relative humidity) were first interpolated from the original model grids to a common grid with half-degree resolution and then bias-corrected using the delta method (
 <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">62</italic>
 </xref>). Temperature and precipitation were bias-corrected on the basis of the observed 1961–1990 monthly climatology developed by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) (
 <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">63</italic>
 </xref>), whereas the other variables were bias-corrected on the basis of the observed 1961–1990 monthly climatology data developed by the CRU of the University of East Anglia (
 <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">64</italic>
 </xref>). This bias correction method ensured that the modeled variables had the same monthly climatology as the observations from CPC or CRU during the period 1961–1990.
