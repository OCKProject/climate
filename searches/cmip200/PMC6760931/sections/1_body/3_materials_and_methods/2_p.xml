<p class="p">Our study first considered all grids (fig. S1A) where wheat is grown (i.e., wheat grids) (
 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">60</italic>
 </xref>), with weights assigned to each grid according to the acreage of arable land and production within the respective grid. We also weighted each grid (fig. S1, B and C) on the basis of its share of the total WhA. Last, we based the grid weight on the importance of each grid in terms of the global WhP. The wheat grids constituted areas where wheat was produced in 2000 (
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">54</italic>
 </xref>), and we assumed that these weights represented how the SWS/EWS risk would change if the wheat-growing conditions remained as they were in the year 2000. WhA and WhP weighting allowed us to examine how changes in water scarcity affected the risk in the current primary production areas based on either area or production. To analyze changes in the SWS/EWS patterns in the top exporting regions, we examined the SWS/EWS probability for grids located in the territories of the 10 most important wheat exporters, and we weighted the grids according to their share of the entire production area (WhAEx) and the production quantity (WhPEx) of wheat. Similar analyses were also conducted for the top five producers and for individual continents. The data were obtained from FAO Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) (

  <italic class="italic">6</italic>
 </xref>) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">8</italic>
 </xref>). These steps and data are described in detail below.
