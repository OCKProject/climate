<p class="p">The total area of WhP is unevenly distributed across the world, with several relatively well-defined production regions within the global arable land (fig. S1). An increase in water scarcity events in these regions might significantly increase the probability of key wheat-producing areas simultaneously (or near simultaneously) experiencing SWS or EWS (

 </xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the likelihood of multiple wheat-producing areas experiencing SWS and EWS events during the same harvest year. In each region, we analyzed the water scarcity (as defined in table S1) occurrence over either the 4 months preceding the local harvest date or, alternatively, between the usual regional-specific sowing and harvest dates. The probability of SWS/EWS events between 1861 and 2100 was based on the SPEI (

  <italic class="italic">58</italic>
 </xref>). We used a global grid and defined a location within the grid as an area affected by water scarcity if both the short-term SPEI affecting WhP and the long-term SPEI affecting water resource availability occurred in a given grid cell with water scarcity conditions based on the above predefined magnitudes (table S2). The SWS/EWS probability from 1861 to 2100 was estimated using the outputs of 27 climate models from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) (table S3). Occurrences of SWS/EWS during the period 1901–2016 were evaluated using the Climate Research Unit (CRU) dataset, which represent the “observed” SWS/EWS (
