<p class="p">In this study, the PET was estimated using the physically based Penman-Monteith method [PET_PM; (

We applied an approach that derives PET_PM from the surface energy budget (i.e., Rn-G = SH + LH), where Rn, G, SH, and LH are the net radiation, ground heat flux, and sensible and latent heat flux, respectively (
