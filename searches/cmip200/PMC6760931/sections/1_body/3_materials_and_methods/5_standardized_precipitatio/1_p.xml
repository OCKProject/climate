<p class="p">To evaluate changes in the occurrence of water scarcity, this study used the SPEI (
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">58</italic>
 </xref>). The SPEI is a multiscalar drought index that quantifies drought intensity on various time scales. The SPEI can be computed on the basis of 1, 3, 6, 9, or 12 months of accumulated surface water deficits and surpluses (i.e., precipitation minus PET). The calculation then uses statistical probability distributions to quantify the drought intensity, termed the 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, or 12-month SPEI, respectively. The 1-month SPEI is closely related to the shallow layer soil moisture and can be used to evaluate short-term drought variability. The 12-month SPEI is closely related to the deep layer soil moisture and long-term drought variability.
