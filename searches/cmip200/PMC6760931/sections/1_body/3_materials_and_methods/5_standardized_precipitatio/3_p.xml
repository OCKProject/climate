<p class="p">The 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month SPEI values were calculated on the basis of the monthly precipitation and PET. The snow-melting module developed by Van der Schrier

However, the differences between SWS/EWS with and without considering snow melt were not significant over the wheat-growing areas. A simplified scheme that did not account for snow melting was therefore implemented. For a given climate model output, the statistical probability distribution parameters (

  <italic class="italic">58</italic>
 </xref>) used to calculate the SPEI were determined on the basis of the modeled monthly data from 1901 to 2000. These parameters were subsequently used to calculate the SPEI values for this grid cell from 1860 to 2005 and under different future scenarios. The same procedures were applied to calculate the SPEI from 1901 to 2016 based on the CRU dataset.
