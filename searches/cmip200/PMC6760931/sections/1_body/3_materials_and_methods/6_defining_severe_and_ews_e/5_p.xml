<p class="p">The overall differences in drought indexes resulting from using the different SPs (fig. S7) were small and, at most, five percentage points during the control run. Therefore, a 4-month SP was primarily used in the study, as it allowed us to consider water scarcity over the same length of time across all wheat-growing regions. In most cases, the area affected by water scarcity was larger when the SP was defined from sowing to harvest, rather than as the 4 months before harvest.</p>
