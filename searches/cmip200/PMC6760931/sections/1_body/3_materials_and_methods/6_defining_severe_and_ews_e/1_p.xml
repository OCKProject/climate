<p class="p">SWS and EWS events (table S1) were first defined to quantify the short- and long-term impacts of water shortage on crops. A grid cell was considered to be affected by water scarcity only if both the short-term water scarcity indicators (i.e., 1- and 3-month SPEI) and the long-term water scarcity indicators (i.e., 12-month SPEI) reached predefined thresholds (table S1). The thresholds were adopted on the basis of Blauhut
