<p class="p">When the usual harvest date was on or later than the 20th day of the month, the drought index for the month of harvest and the three preceding months was used. When wheat was harvested before the 20th day of the harvest month, the drought index for the 4 months before the month of harvest was used. This offset was used because the harvest date of wheat, in practice, follows the physiological maturity of wheat by several days or even weeks, and the sensitivity of wheat to drought decreases rapidly at the end of the grain filling stage and postmaturity. Drier conditions during harvest are generally beneficial for wheat quality and could increase the efficiency of the harvest. In all calculations, calendar months were used.</p>
