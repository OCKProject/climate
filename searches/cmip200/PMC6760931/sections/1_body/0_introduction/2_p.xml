<p class="p">Here, we focus on wheat, the world’s primary rain-fed crop in terms of harvested area that is directly influenced by water scarcity (

  <italic class="italic">5</italic>
 </xref>). Wheat provides approximately 20% of all calories consumed by humans (
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref>), the global wheat trade equals those of maize and rice combined (

 </xref>). Ten key wheat-producing regions (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>) account for 54% of the global wheat-growing area, 57% of the global wheat production (WhP), and more than 92% of global wheat exports (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">8</italic>
 </xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that global WhP strongly depends on water availability during and before the crop-specific and typically unirrigated growing season (

 </xref>). Between 1985 and 2007, drought effects on the global WhP doubled compared to those in 1964–1984 (
