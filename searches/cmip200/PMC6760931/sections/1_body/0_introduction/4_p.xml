<p class="p">We use spatially and temporally coherent analyses of the global SWS risk for all wheat-growing areas, including those in developing countries and low-income regions (

 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref>). This study introduces and applies a method that allows the estimation of the probability of simultaneous droughts affecting geographically distant wheat-growing areas on different spatiotemporal scales and accounting for a representative range of global climate models and emission scenarios. The results indicate a severely heightened risk of high-impact extreme events under the future climate, which would likely affect all market players, ranging from direct influences on subsistence farmers to price-mediated changes in international markets.
