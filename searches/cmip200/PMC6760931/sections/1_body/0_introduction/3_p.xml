  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>) modeling currently predict a 4.0 to 6.5% decrease in global WhP per 1°C of warming if no adaptation occurs. However, a suitable crop replacement for wheat in a drier future seems unlikely, because wheat exhibits a very low total water requirement overall (

  <italic class="italic">13</italic>
 </xref>) and, furthermore, is characterized by its ability to withstand substantial reductions in water availability over relatively long periods of time (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>). These characteristics make wheat likely to remain an important crop in rain-fed crop production systems. We therefore aim to estimate the changes in the likelihood of key wheat-producing areas being simultaneously affected by major drought events as a consequence of projected future increases in drought events under different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">15</italic>
 </xref>). To achieve this, we calculate the distribution of the global WhP area within actual agricultural land (fig. S1), account for a regional phenological calendar, and particularly model the spatial extent affected by severe water scarcity (SWS) events each year. This new water scarcity indicator combines three different time scales of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The analysis of SWS facilitates the depiction of drought episodes that affect the entire wheat growing season, peak during its critical portion, and happen against the backdrop of long-term drought, which deplete regional water resources in general (table S1). Furthermore, we define extreme water scarcity (EWS) events to evaluate changes in the area affected by extreme levels of water scarcity that are highly unlikely under the current climate (tables S1 and S2). Our study complements existing crop model–based analyses that thus far have not allowed the investigation of potential synchrony in water scarcity events across the global wheat-growing area.
