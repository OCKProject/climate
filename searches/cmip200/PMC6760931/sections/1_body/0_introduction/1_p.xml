<p class="p">The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (

 </xref>) has projected a 43% increase in the global annual demand for cereals from approximately 2.1 Gt in 2006 to 3.0 Gt by 2050, which is fairly conservative compared to other projections of the cereal demand (
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </xref>). The increase in the consumption of cereals (including maize, rice, sorghum, and millet, in addition to wheat itself) will predominantly come from developing countries. Moreover, if sustainable intensification is unsuccessful in developing countries, these regions will increasingly depend on expanding net cereal imports (
