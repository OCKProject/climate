<p class="p">The relationship between the peaks in international commodity prices observed in 2007/2008 and those observed in 2010/2011 and SWS is complex, as these spikes are a result of a “perfect storm” in the form of mutually reinforcing simultaneous developments in multiple drivers, rather than of a single isolated event [e.g., (7)].

 </xref>) distinguished between fundamental drivers (which refer to shocks on the demand and supply side) and macro drivers (which act outside of the agricultural sector). Over time, fundamental drivers can potentially lead to reductions in the stock-to-use ratio. Macro drivers have an indirect impact on prices, for example, through costs due to exchange rate effects or energy prices. Last, the financialization of commodity markets, which refers to the unprecedented flow of capital into commodity markets, has made them subject to speculation. Within this context, our results provide unique insight into shocks on the supply side, as they coherently quantify water scarcity in terms of time and space on the global scale, including future developments of the SWS intensity, extent, and frequency across all key wheat-growing areas. Our results suggest that, even under the ambitious mitigation scenario aimed to stabilize global warming at 2°C compared to preindustrial levels (

 </xref>), the increase in the frequency and extent of adverse weather extremes and related shocks on the production side would be unprecedented. How much this will affect food prices and food security will depend on the development of other influencing factors.
