<p class="p">It is well known that warmer temperatures will accelerate crop development, leading to earlier maturity, which creates a higher water demand per day, but the total demand depends on the length of the growing season. Therefore, projecting seasonal SWS should consider the changes in crop duration under climate change. This analysis is based on the assumption that this change will be limited to 1 month, as found in other studies (

 </xref>). Therefore, we provide a sensitivity analysis of shifting the sowing/harvest date by 1 month (fig. S10) to ensure that the effects of changes in the crop duration and the associated water demand resulting from climate change are captured by the calculated SWS. A notable and significant drought risk reduction (

S10). However, the advancement of the harvest date was insufficient in terms of reducing the areas of SWS to the levels experienced during 1961–1990, and such a change is also likely to decrease the yield potential, unless cultivars are adapted (

 </xref>). Postponing the harvest by 1 month will lead to a significant (
