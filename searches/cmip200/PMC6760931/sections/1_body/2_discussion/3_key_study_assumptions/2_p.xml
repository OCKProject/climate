<p class="p">We assumed that the current wheat-growing areas and their relative weights will remain static during the entire 21st century. Therefore, we tested the potential benefit of shifting WhP to other agricultural land that has a lower SWS probability than that in current wheat-growing areas. Although the incidence of SWS over the current global arable land/agricultural land increased by 7.7%/9.8% per 1Â°C of global warming, the rate was fairly similar (8.5%/9.3%) over the entire or main wheat-growing areas (figs. S8 and S9). Thus, there is relatively little to be gained globally in terms of decreasing SWS exposure by shifting wheat-producing areas both within and outside the present wheat-growing area. Although we did not consider expanding the wheat-growing area to regions that are not cultivated at present because it would lead inter alia to increased CO
