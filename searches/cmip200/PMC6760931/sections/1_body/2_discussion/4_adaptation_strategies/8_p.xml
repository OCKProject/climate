<p class="p">Although even major mitigation efforts (represented by RCP 2.6) do not prevent the doubled risk of SWS simultaneously affecting wheat-growing areas, it certainly makes the increase more manageable, especially in comparison with the increases projected under RCP 8.5. Limiting global warming by the end of 2100 to +1.5°C instead of the targeted 2.0°C threshold would reduce the mean area affected by SWS by approximately 3% (figs. S8 and S9), which significantly exceeds the potential achieved by all possible shifts in the wheat growing season (fig. S10). Reported changes in SWS levels and the apparent sensitivity of wheat prices to SWS increases should be considered, together with reports on dwindling water resources across many wheat-growing regions (
