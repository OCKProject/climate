<p class="p">Our understanding of the impacts of climate change on agricultural prices has relied to a large degree on global agricultural market models. These models also include the potential of incremental adaptations that rely on currently available management systems and crop varieties. Lecl√®re

Incremental adaptation achieved by selecting an appropriate management system, relocating crop production to more suitable or less negatively affected areas, and expanding the crop area could buffer 17, 44, and 22% of the negative climate effect, resulting in a residual calorie availability decrease due to climate change of only 3%. Similar results were found in a multimodel study by Nelson

However, these studies considered only gradual changes in yields due to climate change, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies have assessed the economic potential for adaptation to an increased frequency of extreme weather events.
