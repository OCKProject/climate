<p class="p">Using drought- and heat-adapted wheat varieties seems to be a promising option; however, the breeding of enhanced drought- or heat-tolerant wheat cultivars depends on which physiological factors cause yield penalties under drought and to what extent these factors are under genetic control. Phenomic and genomic approaches need to be integrated with crop physiological investigations and ecophysiological and genetic modeling to design wheat traits for future climate conditions (
