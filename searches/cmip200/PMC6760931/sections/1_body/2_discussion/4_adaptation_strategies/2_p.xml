<p class="p">Shifting the sowing and harvest dates has already been documented for adaptation [e.g., (
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">42</italic>
 </xref>)] and is likely to be combined with the use of more resilient cultivars and management optimized for the specific environment. Another strategy for coping with water stress has been and will likely continue to be drought avoidance, e.g., shifting the harvest date to earlier (or later) in the season by shifting the sowing date and/or by using early-ripening cultivars to alleviate drought stress. Shifting the harvest time may reduce the yield losses caused by water scarcity in some regions (
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">43</italic>
 </xref>). However, in some regions with the highest risks of increasing water scarcity within the wheat season (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), such as the Mediterranean, this strategy has a limited scope if the dry period extends into late autumn. In addition, for temperate climates, particularly those at higher latitudes, this avoidance strategy can lead to less global radiation being intercepted by the crop [effective global radiation (EfGr)] (
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">44</italic>
 </xref>) and, thus, a lower yield potential. Therefore, although adjusting the harvest date may be a beneficial strategy in several regions, it will most likely reduce production levels, unless the sowing date can be adjusted to maintain the EfGr.
