<p class="p">Our study has performed analyses to assess the probability of simultaneous large-scale severe and extreme drought across the globe during critical wheat development phases and has shown an increasing risk for global WhP as a whole. Even ambitious climate change mitigation efforts would not fully alleviate the increased risk. To fully quantify the impacts of large-scale water scarcity events on WhP and the effects of potential adaptation strategies, additional factors such as information on soil characteristics, water resources for irrigation, and the capacity of markets to absorb drought-induced production anomalies need to be included. Process-based or statistical modeling approaches can be used, although recent ensemble model studies revealed large uncertainties in the assessment of the climate change impact on crop production (

Moreover, increasing competition for water use between different sectors must be considered, which has implications not only for crop production but also for regional conflicts concerning water use. The results of our study underline the urgent need for concerted global efforts to limit global warming within the targets of the Paris Agreement.
