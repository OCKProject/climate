 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">57</italic>
 </xref>), it was thought that this increase would mainly come from the expansion of irrigated areas and from enhancing nitrogen fertilization in some production regions. The increased probability of SWS years reported in this study would, in many regions, constrain efforts to increase irrigated areas but would also lead to a lower nutrient use efficiency. The efficacy and feasibility of available adaptation options should therefore be interpreted with caution and should account for changes in the SWS probability in combination with other adverse factors to avoid what has been coined “adaptation illusion” (
