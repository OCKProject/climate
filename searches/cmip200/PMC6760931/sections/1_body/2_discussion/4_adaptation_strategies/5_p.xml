<p class="p">Another option that should be considered is soil management focused on building up the soil water for the next crop. This is partially possible by conserving water through minimizing tillage and reducing nonproductive water loss (i.e., evaporation) (

 </xref>) from the unshaded soil surface. The latter can be achieved by covering the soil surface with a mulch of plant residues or plastic, which reduces evaporative water losses (

 </xref>). Water use can be further improved by water harvesting approaches, where water is captured in the soil or by water reservoirs located on the farm or in the catchment for later use by crops (

  <italic class="italic">52</italic>
 </xref>). There are many approaches that can be implemented to enhance water harvesting and management, and these methods need to be tailored to the local landscape, soil, and climatic conditions. In addition, possible adaptations usually have other implications (e.g., forcing changes in crop rotation) and thus should not be considered as cost-free strategies, as rightly noted by Lobell (
