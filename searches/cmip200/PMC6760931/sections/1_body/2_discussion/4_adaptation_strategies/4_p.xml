<p class="p">Irrigation represents a seemingly attractive option as well; however, dwindling water resources in some regions (

 </xref>) cast doubt on the feasibility of irrigation being able to increase wheat yield on a global scale without massive investment programs. Therefore, developing management strategies to improve field conditions in a bid to increase drought resilience is crucial. For example, in the Mediterranean, the application of only one supplementary irrigation event during sensitive stages in combination with the selection of an optimized sowing date and cycle duration can maximize the grain filling length while preventing environmental stressors at both the end (at sowing) and the beginning (at grain filling) of the dry summer period (

 </xref>). Deficit irrigation is a common on-farm water-saving strategy, which involves irrigating crops below the requirements defined by evapotranspiration (

 </xref>). In general, this approach aims to increase the water use efficiency while minimizing reductions in crop yields and saving available water resources. Although deficit irrigation can improve the water use efficiency and may reduce the total withdrawals for irrigation, the consumptive use of water may also increase, thereby reducing return flows and causing negative groundwater balances [see, e.g., (
