<p class="p">The suitability of a given adaptation measure will vary on the basis of the climate and soil conditions, as well as the type and timing of the drought event. If the variability in drought timing increases (in addition to the frequency and severity, as shown above), then it will further complicate decision-making and the efficient use of adaptation measures. Integrated strategies for entire catchments have rarely been introduced so far because of governance complexities, although this is potentially the most efficient approach.</p>
