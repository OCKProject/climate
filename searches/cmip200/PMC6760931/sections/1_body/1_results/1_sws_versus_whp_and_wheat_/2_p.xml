<p class="p">In the next step, we compared the area annually affected by SWS (i) calculated over all arable land (fig. S2), (ii) weighted by the affected wheat-growing area (fig. S3), and (iii) weighted by the affected wheat-growing area of the top 10 exporters (fig. S4) with the global time-detrended (and nondetrended) wheat prices. In all cases, there was a statistically significant relationship (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01) between the area affected by SWS and fluctuations in the global wheat price (figs. S2 to S4). The correlation between SWS and the international wheat price is highest when the SWS area is evaluated for only the top 10 exporting countries and is the lowest when the SWS-affected area takes into account all arable land. This result again seems to favor the SWS concept, as it is reasonable to expect that markets are most sensitive to SWS events in the countries responsible for wheat exports compared to the overall wheat-growing area or even global arable land. When SWS was calculated considering the wheat-growing area of the top 10 exporters, the spatial extent of SWS explained 81% of the price fluctuations of wheat (and 24% of their first-order differences) between 2000 and 2016 (fig. S4). The explained variability decreased to 67% (and 23% in the case of the first-order differences) when the SWS extent over the global wheat-growing area was considered and to only 37% (12%) when SWS was integrated over all arable land. We are aware that dimensional approaches tend to overestimate the explanatory power of any single driver (

 </xref>). The proportion of explained variability was smaller, i.e., 57% (22%) when a more extended period, namely the period 1990–2016, was considered. This could be related to the higher stock-to-use ratio during the period 1990–1999 than that during the period 2000–2016 (

 </xref>), as well as to the substantial financialization of agricultural markets during the second period, both of which led to a higher sensitivity of prices to production-side shocks (

  <italic class="italic">21</italic>
 </xref>). The global wheat price shows similar temporal dynamics to the area affected by SWS between 1994 and 2016, including the 2007–2008 price hike (

 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
 </xref>), and the subsequent period of price decreases in 2015 and 2016 (fig. S4). The relationship between SWS and international wheat prices remains statistically significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), even when any given 1 or 2 years are discarded. This finding indicates that the results would hold even if the years of peak prices in 2007/2008 and 2010/2011 were ignored. The correlation between the extent of the wheat area (WhA) affected by SWS and international wheat prices observed over the past 20 years does not allow us to make any quantitative conclusions about the role of drought in the observed price spikes because numerous other factors were at play, such as the biofuel demand, market speculation, the stock-to-use ratio, oil prices (

  <italic class="italic">20</italic>
 </xref>), and policy responses or trade shocks (

  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>). However, our results are in line with those of other studies [e.g., (
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">19</italic>
 </xref>)] and confirm that production-side shocks are one of the key drivers of price variability. The results show that variations in the proposed SWS indicator are, at least to some extent, related to wheat markets, and therefore, projected shifts of the future SWS probability should be factored in when estimating future WhP variability and price levels.
