<p class="p">We tested the hypothesis that years with an unusual SWS extent should be reflected in the WhP and be considered in wheat prices. Although such a notable relationship would not imply that SWS could or should be used to estimate wheat price anomalies, it is important to test the SWS conceptâ€™s relevance under the present climate. We use the highest spatial resolution data available to examine whether SWS occurrence has any observable relationship with WhP (

Because there were only a few events when more than 10% of the wheat-growing area of any major wheat-producing region or country was affected by SWS, we also investigated events with at least 1% SWS occurrence. This is due to the low SWS probability during the baseline. Nevertheless, we found significantly (
