<p class="p">According to the RCP 2.6 pathway, a reduction in emissions would considerably decrease future SWS levels in the key wheat-producing areas in the late 21st century (

Under RCP 8.5, and even under RCP 4.5, the extent of the area affected by SWS each year is likely to rise above any observation over the past 100 years (fig. S6). If the mean area affected by SWS is considered during a 3-year window, then 44.5 ± 12.3% (RCP 4.5) and 62.3 ± 13.7% (RCP 8.5) of the wheat-growing area are projected to suffer from SWS (figs. S8 and S9). Even under RCP 2.6, the median area of SWS by the end of this century surpasses all existing records since 1901.
