<p class="p">When we consider projections for RCP 8.5 at the end of the current century, there is a significant increase in the likelihood of a sequence of 3 years during which SWS will occur across multiple key wheat-producing regions (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref> and fig. S6). The increase in the area affected by SWS in the top 10 wheat-exporting countries is significantly higher (Î± = 0.01) (fig. S7), and the absolute difference in SWS levels among RCPs is particularly high when only changes in these top 10 exporting regions are considered.
