<p class="p">Although the area affected by SWS was estimated to be slightly smaller when using meteorological observations than when using GCM-based simulations of historical weather conditions, the overall differences were nonsignificant (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>) and were mostly within the GCM model range (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>). The observed and projected increase in the wheat-growing area affected by SWS is summarized in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. The wheat-growing area affected by SWS over a 3-year period will increase significantly, from a mean value of 11.8 ± 4.4% during 1961–1990 to 26.8 ± 10.6% and 28.5 ± 11.7% by 2011–2040 under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively. This result is concerning, given the recent wheat price fluctuations in response to a much smaller area being affected by SWS. There were no significant (α = 0.01) differences among the RCPs during 2011–2040, but the divergence among RCPs rises sharply during 2041–2070 (
