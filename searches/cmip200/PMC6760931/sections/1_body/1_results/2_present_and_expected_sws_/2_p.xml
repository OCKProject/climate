 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Significant increases in SWS will also very likely affect southeastern Ukraine, southern regions of Russia, and western parts of the United States and Mexico, as well as southwestern Australia and South Africa. Meanwhile, Europe, Asia, and North America will experience a sharp upward trend in SWS (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and fig. S5), but South Americaâ€™s wheat-growing areas will be affected only marginally. Increasing SWS for the top 3 exporters, i.e., the European Union (EU), Russia, and the United States, will be significantly higher than that for the two current leading wheat importers, i.e., India and China (fig. S5, B to D). Together, the EU and Europe as a whole exhibit the largest amplitude in SWS occurrence among the different RCPs (fig. S5), indicating that WhP in these regions would benefit more than any other region from reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Within the EU, the highest SWS increase will occur in the drought-prone southwestern and southeastern regions of the Mediterranean (
