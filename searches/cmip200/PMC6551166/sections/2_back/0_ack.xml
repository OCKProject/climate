 <p class="p">We thank weather forecasters B. Ziv, A. Reitzfeld, and B. Nehemiah for interesting discussions regarding the December 2013 storm Alexa and regarding the difficulty of predicting snow events in Jerusalem. We thank Y. Levi for providing the ECMWF ensemble forecasts for Jerusalem. We thank D. Faranda for helpful discussions on the dynamical systems approach underlying our analysis. 
  <bold class="bold">Funding:</bold> We thank Tel-Aviv Universityâ€™s President, the Mintz Family Foundation, and the Mediterranean Research Centre of Israel (MERCI) for their support. This study was also partially supported by cooperation with the international virtual institute DESERVE (Dead Sea Research Venue), funded by the German Helmholtz Association and by the Porter School of Environmental Studies at Tel-Aviv University.
