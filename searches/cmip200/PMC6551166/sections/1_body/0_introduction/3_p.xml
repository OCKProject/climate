<p class="p">Recently, the traditional description of synoptic systems—and more generally atmospheric configurations—has been complemented by a novel approach issued from dynamical systems theory. This is grounded in the seminal work of Lorenz (

  <italic class="italic">13</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>) and is based on metrics describing the instantaneous state of atmospheric fields (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">15</italic>
 </xref>). Contrary to this, previous dynamical systems approaches focused on the mean properties of the atmosphere, with limited applications in the context of atmospheric variability (

  <italic class="italic">16</italic>
 </xref>). Faranda 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">15</italic>
 </xref>) have shown that key instantaneous properties of an atmospheric field can be summarized by two metrics: the local dimension (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>) and the persistence of the state being considered (θ
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The value of 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> for a given atmospheric state ξ is a proxy for the number of active degrees of freedom and provides information on the state’s intrinsic predictability (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">15</italic>
 </xref>). θ
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is instead a measure of average persistence time of the atmosphere around that state. For discrete time data, the value of θ will depend on the dataset’s time step. If an atmospheric state ξ is a fixed point of the dynamics, θ(ξ) = 0. For a trajectory that leaves the neighborhood of state ξ immediately, θ(ξ) = 1. Accordingly, low 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and high θ
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (or low θ) imply a high predictability state and vice versa. Full details of how 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ are computed are provided in the Methods.
