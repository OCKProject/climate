<p class="p">The aim of this study is to integrate the SC approach with the above dynamical systems metrics. This provides a new perspective on regional atmospheric configurations with direct implications for weather forecasting. Furthermore, the combination of these two approaches presents a powerful tool for evaluating the ability of climate models to capture the fundamental dynamical features of regional synoptic systems.</p>
