<p class="p">In most of the mid-latitudes, synoptic-scale patterns exert a strong control on regional weather. Since the pioneering work of Lamb (

 </xref>), the classification of synoptic systems has therefore elicited a broad interest in meteorology and climatology, especially in the context of weather forecasting. Lamb proposed a catalog of daily weather types over the British Isles during 1898â€“1947, related to synoptic-scale circulation categories. Other approaches have later been implemented in different regions, including, for example, Greece (
