<p class="p">These methodologies are not, however, immediately applicable to all regions. For example, in the eastern Mediterranean (EM) region, very different synoptic configurations are associated with similarly warm and dry weather conditions. Weather in this region is largely governed by small-scale synoptic systems originating from both mid-latitude and tropical regions that are modified over the complex terrain of the eastern Mediterranean (
