  <italic class="italic">43</italic>
 </xref>). As a caveat, we note that θ is dependent on the temporal resolution of the data used, because θ
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is in units of the time step. For a very long time step, all instantaneous states will tend to θ = 1. However, as long as the time resolution of the dataset being used is smaller than the typical time scale of the process being studied (in our case, the typical persistence of a synoptic system in the EM), θ values should be informative. For further details on the abovementioned metrics, the reader is referred to the studies of Lucarini
