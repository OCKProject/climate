<p class="p">The above procedure results in a value of 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ for every time step in our dataset. The first is a proxy for the number of active degrees of freedom of the system. The second represents the mean residence time of the trajectory in the neighborhood of a given point ξ. Both therefore have a direct link to the ease with which the evolution of the trajectory to/from this state can be predicted, which we have termed here the state’s intrinsic predictability. This is a somewhat different type of information from that gleaned from the spread of an ensemble numerical weather forecast initialized from ξ because it is independent of the characteristics of the forecast model and because of its local nature.
