<p class="p">In this study, we exploited a recently developed approach, which combines extreme value theory with Poincaré recurrences to compute the local properties of a dynamical system. We applied this approach to daily SLP latitude-longitude fields over the EM. We interpreted the succession of daily fields as a long trajectory in the phase space of the atmosphere. Each field therefore corresponds to a single point in phase space, for which local properties can be computed. Locality in phase space therefore translates to instantaneity in time. We focused our analysis on two metrics, namely, the local dimension
