<p class="p">The semi-objective SC algorithm (

 <italic class="italic">V</italic> at 850 hPa at 25 grid points (27.5째N-37.5째N, 30째E-40째E; fig. S1) over the southeastern part of the EM, as recently presented by Hochman

Five main synoptic systems were defined as follows: the PT characterizing the summer; the RST peaking in the autumn; the SL, which is noticeable during spring, albeit with a low frequency of occurrence relative to the other systems; the High pressure system, which appears throughout the year, with the lowest occurrence in summer; and the CL, which is dominant during the winter (
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">10</italic>
 </xref>). CLs are mid-latitude disturbances that tend to develop in the Levantine Basin when upper troughs or cutoff lows penetrate the EM (
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">35</italic>
 </xref>). CLs transport cool air, originating from eastern Europe, over the warmer Mediterranean, where it becomes moist and unstable (
