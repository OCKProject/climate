<p class="p">We combined a very recent dynamical systems theory approach with a daily classification of synoptic systems over the eastern Mediterranean to investigate atmospheric predictability. It was found that the instantaneous measures of local dimension (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>) and persistence (θ
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), derived from daily SLP data, can serve as an extremely informative qualitative method to evaluate the intrinsic predictability of synoptic systems. Moreover, the two dynamical systems indicators discriminate between synoptic classes such that Cyprus Lows, Red Sea Troughs, and Persian Troughs emerge as extreme values of 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ. This complements the results of Faranda 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">15</italic>
 </xref>), who found that 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ could be used to recover the four canonical North Atlantic weather regimes.
