<p class="p">Because the synoptic classification approach has been widely used by weather forecasters, the information provided by 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ may have implications for operational forecasts. Here, we have made a plausibility argument in support of this idea, which we plan to pursue in future research. Extreme 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ values often correspond to cyclonic atmospheric systems, which, in turn, commonly match extreme weather conditions in the EM region. Furthermore, it was shown that these new measures, combined with the synoptic classification method, can be used as an evaluation tool for the dynamics of climate models [see also (

 </xref>)]. The evaluation of CMIP5 models presented here suggests that the models capture a number of the salient qualitative features found in reanalysis data, thus providing the basis for an investigation of the changes in the predictability of synoptic systems under future climate scenarios. At the same time, they fail to reproduce a number of the reanalysis’ quantitative features. The novel perspective presented here, which leverages a dynamical systems approach to investigate the predictability of weather patterns, outlines an important avenue for future research, and we envisage that it may be fruitfully applied to other regions of the globe.
