<p class="p">A critical appraisal of the information provided by both the dynamical systems indicators and the ensemble forecast for “Alexa” may have allowed more appropriate warnings to be issued and more effective measures to be taken. We also highlight that the dynamical systems indicators, which are inexpensive to compute, could have been available to forecasters several hours before the ensemble forecast was issued. This points to the relevance of investigating further the use of dynamical systems indicators in operational weather forecasting. While the five-event sample considered above is insufficient to fully demonstrate the operational relevance of
