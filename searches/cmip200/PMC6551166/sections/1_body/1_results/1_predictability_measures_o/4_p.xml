 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>; see also Methods). The instantaneous dynamical systems properties capture the difference between these two types of CLs and indicate that the deeper lows are less predictable than the shallow ones. 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1 (C and D)</xref> also displays the 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ values for the 11 to 14 December 2013 storm named “Alexa.” The storm, associated with a deep CL, led to widespread snowfall and caused mayhem to millions of people across the region, especially refugees from the Syrian conflict. In Israel, four people were killed, 35,000 homes were disconnected from electricity for about a week, 9000 flights were canceled, and roads, including those leading to Jerusalem, were blocked for more than 48 hours. The damage was estimated at about $100 million, which is the cost liest natural disaster ever recorded in Israel. This storm is considered an exceptional and rare event; the weather forecasters in the region struggled to predict its extent, especially concerning snow cover and depth at such an early stage of winter (
