<p class="p">Snow events in Jerusalem are extremely rare events, which the weather forecasters in the region have long considered challenging (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">26</italic>
 </xref>). Thus, we have tested the dynamical systems indicators on four additional Jerusalem snow events, which occurred during the period covered by The Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) dataset (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">27</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">28</italic>
 </xref>). Four of the five events (including Alexa) are found in the upper five percentile of the 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> distribution, and three of the five events are found in the lower five percentile of the θ distribution (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). The other one to two events are still in the high/low percentiles of 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ, respectively. All events display a large ensemble spread with large differences between observed and predicted precipitation and snow depth (table S1). For the small five-event sample considered here, the 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> ranking from high to low exactly follows the ranking of the difference between predicted and observed snow depth, i.e., forecast snow-depth error. That is, low predictability events according to the dynamical systems indicator have large errors in the predicted snow depth (table S1 and
