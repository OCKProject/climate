<p class="p">Beginning 11 December, there was a big anticyclone over Europe, whose eastern edge drew cold air southward from the Arctic. This polar air outbreak then spread over the EM, pushing ahead of it moist air associated with a cold front and causing heavy snowfall over higher grounds and heavy precipitation and flooding over warmer locations, peaking on 13 December. The calculation of 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ for 12 December shows that the large-scale atmospheric pattern associated with Alexa was relatively persistent with a very high local dimension (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 13.71; θ = 0.71). This is an unusual combination, as co-occurring high 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and low θ extremes are rarely seen for atmospheric fields (

  <italic class="italic">25</italic>
 </xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ values therefore highlight the uniqueness of the situation and the potentially large uncertainty in the forecasts. As an example, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble forecast for Jerusalem initialized at 00:00 UTC on 11 December (31.9°N 35.2°E; fig. S2) displayed a large uncertainty for the short-range total precipitation and wind speed forecasts on 11 December and the morning of 12 December. While the ECMWF forecast predicted a median total precipitation for the entire storm of ~50 mm, snow cover of ~10 cm, and wind speeds of ~7 m/s, the observed values in Jerusalem were 227 mm, 50 cm, and 14 to 17 m/s, respectively, with wind gusts over 25 m/s (
