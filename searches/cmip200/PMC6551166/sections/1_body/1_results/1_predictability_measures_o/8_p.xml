<p class="p">Last, we verify whether the synoptic systems can be recovered purely based on the information provided by the two dynamical systems metrics considered here. We select the top and bottom five percentiles of the (
 <italic class="italic">d,</italic> θ) distributions and compare the SLP composites of these four groups of days to those of the four most frequently occurring synoptic systems: RSTs, CLs, PTs, and Highs, which account for ~99% of the days in the dataset (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>; fig. S3 shows the corresponding synoptic systems’ mean composites, including SLs). A visual inspection highlights that the high 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ values resemble CLs, the low 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>’s liken RSTs (although they also display some features of the Highs and PTs), and the low θ’s match PTs. Euclidean distances between the maps largely confirm these inferences. A number of key features of the semi-objective classification used here are therefore mirrored by the dynamical systems metrics. The fact that the Highs are not recovered from the (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>, θ) extremes is not surprising, as they are characterized by intermediate (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>, θ) values (e.g., 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>) and therefore should not emerge as dynamical extremes. As a caveat of our analysis, we note that the synoptic systems are defined using multiple variables, while 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ only use SLP. A full analysis of the bidirectional link between the synoptic systems and dynamical systems indicators would require more advanced pattern recognition techniques and the computation of multivariate 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> and θ values.
