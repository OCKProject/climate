<p class="p">These results are supported by the SC transition probability matrix (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). The matrix describes the probability of occurrence of a synoptic system at time 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> + 1 as a function of the synoptic system occurring at time 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>. This is a simple complement to the dynamical systems approach, providing additional information on the evolution and predictability of the synoptic systems that govern eastern Mediterranean weather. Although beyond the scope of the present discussion, we note that more rigorous transition analysis tools, which consider the evolution over an arbitrary number of time steps, have been developed (

  <italic class="italic">24</italic>
 </xref>). The low-dimensional, high-persistence RST and PT systems have the highest fraction of self-transitions, namely, cases where the RST/PT systems are followed by another day with the same configuration. The CL and SL cases display lower values (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figures 1 (A and B)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref> therefore reveal that the CL and SL systems have a lower intrinsic predictability than the PT and RST systems, which instead emerge as high-predictability states.
