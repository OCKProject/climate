<p class="p">In addition to successfully distinguishing between the different synoptic systems the dynamical systems indicators also underscore their salient physical characteristics. The PTs and RSTs are quasi-stationary systems (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>), which typically display high persistence. On the contrary, the CL and SL systems are moving disturbances (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
 </xref>) and would hence be expected to have lower persistence. The Î¸ CDFs show the distinction between the two (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>). The high persistence of the PT and RST systems is accompanied by low values of
