 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> (see also table S4) shows the transition probability matrices of the synoptic systems based on the CMIP5 and NCEP/NCAR data. Again, these refer to transitions between successive days. The CMIP5 models show a reasonable agreement for CL and RST transitions, in both absolute and relative terms, as compared with the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. The self-transitions of CLs are, however, systematically overestimated. The transition probabilities for PTs show good agreement except for an underestimation of self-transitions and an overestimation of transitions between PTs and CLs in most models. The CCSM, Norwegian Climate Center (NORESM), and CANESM models reproduce very closely the NCEP/NCAR rates for all PT transitions. Most models show good agreement for the Highs’ transitions except for an underestimation of those between Highs and PTs. The bias is particularly severe in the MRI model, which essentially excludes the possibility of such a transition. All models struggle to capture the SL transition probabilities. There is no single model that performs best for all transition probabilities between synoptic systems. The mean transition probability rates from all the CMIP5 models considered here (

 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6E</xref>), although many of the biases discussed above emerge in the multimodel mean values. Table S5 shows the mean absolute and weighted differences for each model with respect to the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. The ranking of the models does not always correspond to that of the CDF medians (see table S3), highlighting the complementary information provided by these two diagnostics. No obvious link between the horizontal spatial resolution of the models and the dynamical properties was found (see table S2). However, a number of other factors may be responsible for the spread in model performances. There are several processes that are known to exert a strong control over the eastern Mediterranean weather and climate. These include large-scale teleconnections, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation or the Indian monsoon (
