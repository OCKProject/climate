 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figures 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> show the CDFs of θ and 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>, respectively, for SLP fields from models participating in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">29</italic>
 </xref>) over the period 1986–2005 (table S2; see the “Data” section for the choice of years). Each panel corresponds to a single model. The results for the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis over the same period are shown for reference. As in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1 (A and B)</xref>, each line in the plots is related to the CDF of a specific synoptic system (RSTs, PTs, Highs, CLs, and SLs). It can be seen that all models capture the main (
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>, θ) differences between the synoptic systems. Specifically, the models adequately represent the significant differences in the persistence (θ
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) between PTs and CLs, as well as the lower predictability of the CL system with respect to the other synoptic systems (high θ and 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>, i.e., low predictability). The SL synoptic system displays noisier results due to their low frequency of occurrence in the CMIP5 models, again matching the results from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. A rank score (
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">30</italic>
 </xref>) for each model with respect to NCEP/NCAR is presented in table S3 (see table caption for details of the score’s calculation). The German Max Planck Institute (MPI), Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CANESM), Meteorological Research Institute of Japan (MRI) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (CCSM) models, capture the median dynamical properties of the synoptic groups comparatively well. Nonetheless, both these and the other models struggle to capture the finer details of the CDFs, with only a few of the model-synoptic class combinations actually matching the NCEP/NCAR distributions according to the RS and KS tests at the 5% significance level.
