<p id="Par21" class="p">The inter-model spreads in the RRC and ACS demonstrated that the difference between the DRC and RRC determined the ACS. Models with high climate sensitivity were more likely to have small differences between the DRC and RRC, whereas models with low sensitivity tended to have large differences between the DRC and RRC. Thus, the DRC mediated the climate sensitivity against the RRC in the Arctic. This finding was also confirmed in previous studies, in which atmospheric-energy transport was negatively associated with changes in polar-climate sensitivity
