<p id="Par22" class="p">Therefore, if the DRC is accurately quantified, the TOA radiative response that is observed by satellites will be an accurate indicator of future Arctic warming. However, RRCs that are derived from a state-of-the-art climate model cannot be directly compared to RRCs that are estimated from satellite sensors. The former are based on historical periods (1981–2005), while the latter are from satellite-operation periods (2000–2016); additionally, historical simulations of the CMIP5 model cannot cover the early 2010s, when Arctic sea ice was observed to have reached its minimum extent. Therefore, the relationship between the ACS and RRC in each climate model may involve uncertainty. However, as CMIP6 currently extends the period up to 2014, these limitations of this study may be overcome in the future work. Nevertheless, this study revealed the linkage between Arctic climate sensitivity and satellite observations of the TOA radiative response, which is controlled by compensation effects from atmospheric dynamical energy transport.</p>
