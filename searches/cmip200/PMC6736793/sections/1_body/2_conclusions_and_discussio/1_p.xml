<p id="Par19" class="p">The ACS was determined from the balance between the radiative and dynamical responses based on the standard energy-balance framework for the Arctic climate system. Accordingly, we investigated the relationship among the RRC, DRC, and ACS in twelve CMIP5 general-circulation models. First, the RRC values, which were determined from regional radiative-feedback processes, varied between models. When comparing the RRCs between all-sky and clear-sky conditions, the cloud radiative effect explained the inter-model diversity in the RRCs. In particular, the SW radiative response under all-sky conditions strongly differed among the models because of the different parameterizations of the ice albedo–cloud–radiation interactions

 </sup>, implying that changes in SW radiation considerably affect the RRC. Next, larger DRCs, which were induced by dynamically transported atmospheric-energy flux, were linked to larger RRCs. Additionally, transient poleward eddy is known to modulate the DRC. If transient-eddy activities largely decrease, the response of horizontally transported dynamical energy-flux to Arctic warming would be small. Therefore, we can conclude that changes in the incoming TOA radiative flux interact with changes in poleward transport of dynamical energy flux via a reduction in transient eddy activity.
