<p id="Par20" class="p">However, we cannot quantify the contribution from atmospheric dynamics to Arctic warming, which is directly related to the DRC, because the poleward dry static and latent energy fluxes, which are driven by eddies, compensate one another

 </sup>. Moreover, transient and stationary eddies counteract each other

 </sup>. We only analyzed the average transient poleward eddies over the entire Arctic region and the annual mean, so the quantitative contribution from transient poleward eddies to the DRC is still unclear. Furthermore, the effect of oceanic heat flux on the DRC was not considered in this study because the contribution from oceanic transport to the total transport is relatively smaller than the atmospheric energy transport at 60Â°N
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>
 </sup>. However, recent studies suggested that the perturbed ocean heat flux at lower latitudes can affect Arctic warming, with increased poleward energy transport

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, a careful analysis of changes in the transient and stationary eddies in different seasons and regions and the role of oceanic heat transport should be further investigated to determine the source of the DRC. In addition, quantifying the DRC values depends on linear assumptions following the standard energy-balance framework; therefore, one must be cautious that an indirectly calculated DRC might have uncertainty because of nonlinearity.
