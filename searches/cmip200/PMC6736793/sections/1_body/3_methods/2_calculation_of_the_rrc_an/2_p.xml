 <sub class="sub">2</sub> quadrupling. ∆ means the difference between the abrupt 4xCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and pi-Control experiments. To examine the reliable temperature response to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> forcing, we did not analyze the entire experimental period because any temperature changes were largely a response to TOA radiative flux over the first few years. Afterwards, these changes non-linearly fluctuated to approach the equilibrium state, and the correlation coefficient between the two variables gradually decreased. The intercept of the regression line at ∆T = 0 measures the radiative forcing, F, while the regression slope, λ, implies the climate-feedback parameter. Accordingly, the ACS was derived as F/2λ because the CO
