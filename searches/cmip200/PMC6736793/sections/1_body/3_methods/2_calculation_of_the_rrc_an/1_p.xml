 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="" class="xref">2a</xref>), the RRC was estimated from the regression slope of R on T by using satellite observations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>) and the CMIP5-model outputs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b–p</xref>) under the assumption that any TOA radiation changes (red) were largely a response to the temperature (black) in the Arctic region. We applied monthly time-dependent perturbations to estimate a reliable RRC over the Arctic region. If time-dependent perturbations with short time scales (a few hours to days) were applied, some of R’s response to T may not have excluded long-term feedback processes, such as the ice-albedo feedback. Similarly, time-dependent perturbations with long time scales (over a month) may have included an equilibration effect of R

 </sup>. Next, we took 12-month moving averages over monthly anomalous time series to exclude any non-feedback factors (e.g., strong seasonality and autonomous cloud variations) while retaining any radiative-feedback processes with time spans longer than a month, such as the ice-albedo feedback process
