 <sub class="sub">2</sub> quadrupling (4xCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and pre-industrial control (pi-Control) experiments. The monthly TOA ISR, OSR, OLR, and SAT from the historical-simulation outputs for the 25-year period of 1981â€“2005 were used to analyze the inter-model spread of the radiative response, and the annually averaged variables from the 4xCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and pi-Control outputs were used to calculate the modeled ACSs. To calculate the dynamical response, daily averages of the vertical profiles of the zonal wind (u), temperature (t), geopotential height (z), and specific humidity (q) from the historical simulations were also analyzed.
