<p id="Par17" class="p">The ACS of each model is then compared to DRC–RRC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,c</xref>). The models with relatively small DRC–RRC values tend to have high ACS, while the models with large DRC–RRC values tend to have low ACS. In addition, the relationships among the RRC, DRC, and ACS can be applied to the current Arctic climate system. The ACS is proportional to the RRC (following the gray line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>), so the ACS can be estimated from the RRC based on satellite observations. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>, the observational RRC is marked as a red dashed line for the value of 0.11 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. If the DRC is large enough to compensate the RRC (corresponding to a large DRC–RRC value in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), the Arctic climate warms slowly (low ACS); if the DRC does not compensate the RRC (corresponding to a small DRC–RRC value in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), the Arctic climate warms rapidly (high ACS). Although the actual DRC is not assured in this study, this value may be inferred from an inter-model comparison to be approximately 0.33 W m
