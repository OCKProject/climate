<p id="Par16" class="p">More importantly, the DRC minus the RRC (DRC–RRC) appears to be negatively related to the RRC (r RC-0.6) in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>. A large RRC requires a small DRC–RRC, and the DRC–RRC values range from 0.0 to 0.4 W m

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. This negative relationship is apparently shown for RRCs that are estimated under all-sky conditions but not for RRCs that are estimated under clear-sky conditions (figure not shown). Hence, the relationship between the RRC and DRC–RRC might be associated with model differences in terms of cloud radiative effects.
