<p id="Par11" class="p">To understand the physical meaning of the RRC, the contributions from longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) radiation to the RRC are compared for each model, and cloud effects are examined by comparing the all-sky and clear-sky conditions. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> represents the observed and inter-model spreads of the RRC. The RRC ranges from negative to positive values, with positive values indicating anomalous increases in the incoming (or anomalous decreases in the outgoing) TOA net radiative flux to surface air warming and negative values indicating anomalous increases in the outgoing TOA net radiative flux to surface air warming. A negative LW response includes the Planck feedback. The observational RRC value (0.11 W m

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) falls within the model range (−0.47 to 1.07 W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), and the models in the middle ranks of the RRC (CanESM2 and MPI-ESM-MR) are not statistically different with the observational RRC. Therefore, these models should approximately reflect the radiative response of the real Arctic climate system. In addition, the observational RRC value that was estimated in this study is somewhat consistent with the total radiative response according to recent research (0.55 ± 0.54 to 1.55 ± 0.62 W m

 </sup> by replacing the TOA radiative fluxes from CERES with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 or three different reanalysis products. Under all-sky conditions, the models with larger RRC values are more strongly influenced by the SW response. Meanwhile, the models with smaller RRC values are more strongly influenced by the LW response (Fig.
