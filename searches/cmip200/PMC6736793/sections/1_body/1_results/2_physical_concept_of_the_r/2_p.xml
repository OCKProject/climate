<p id="Par12" class="p">In contrast, the LW and SW radiative responses in the models have small variances under clear-sky conditions (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Except for the SW RRC in the models with lower net RRC, the variances of SW and LW RRCs in the all-sky condition tend to be larger than that in the clear-sky condition (not shown). This different radiative response under clear- and all-sky conditions demonstrates that clouds significantly influence the modeled RRC in the Arctic region. This inter-model diversity of the radiative response under all-sky conditions is probably caused by considerable model differences in the interaction between clouds and the sea-ice albedo because various changes in clouds affect the sea-ice surface-energy budget in models differently
