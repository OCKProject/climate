<p id="Par14" class="p">One must be cautious that the relationship between the DRC and RRC may not be independent but complementary and interdependent. An energy imbalance could cause energy influx to the Arctic, which tends to reduce this imbalance. Consequently, the RRC could be non-linearly related to the DRC, and the difference between the DRC and RRC would determine the ACS. In the next section, we investigate this relationship between the RRC and ACS from CMIP5-model simulations.</p>
