 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> illustrates a schematic picture of the relationship between the RRC and ACS for different DRCs. The graph that links ACS to the RRC shows the same shape as in a previous study that demonstrated the relationship between “global” CS to feedback factors

 </sup>. However, for the Arctic, DRC plays a role in controls the rate of ACS changes to RRC. The RRC ranges from negative to positive values, and the ACS increases with the RRC following Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">3</xref>). For relatively small DRC values (dotted line), the ACS rises sharply with an increasing RRC. For large DRC values (dashed double-dotted line), the ACS hardly changes with an altered RRC within the same range of RRC values. The ACS, meanwhile, exhibits extreme values if the RRC is sufficiently large. When the RRC becomes zero, the ACS retains a value greater than zero, which means that horizontally transported dynamical energy-flux maintains positive ACS without a radiative response. If the RRC is greater than or equal to the DRC, the ACS shows unphysical conditions with negative ACS values (solid line in the third and fourth quadrants in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>); hence, the DRC should always be greater than the RRC in the Arctic climate system. Thus, the change in poleward energy transport from atmospheric or oceanic currents is greater than the radiative response at the TOA as the surface air temperature rises because the DRC is affected by both local climate feedbacks and remote effects, such as Arctic–mid-latitude teleconnections
