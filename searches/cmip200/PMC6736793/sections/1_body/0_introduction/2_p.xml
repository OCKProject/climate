<p id="Par3" class="p">To validate the degree of modeled future global warming in response to rising greenhouse gases, i.e., climate sensitivity (CS), recent studies have attempted to use satellite observations of the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes. For the globe (where no consideration of atmospheric energy transport across the boundary is needed), the CS can be estimated from the linear regression between changes in the global-mean energy budget and global-mean surface-temperature changes based on the Gregory method

 </sup>. However, some studies noted that a deeper understanding of the regional climate physics linking the response of TOA radiative fluxes to surface warming is required prior to quantifying the global CS because the global CS is substantially influenced by regional climate-feedback processes and different periods
