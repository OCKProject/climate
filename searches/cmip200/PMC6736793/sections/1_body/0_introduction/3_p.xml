<p id="Par4" class="p">When a regional domain, such as the Arctic, is chosen, the atmospheric and oceanic energy influx/outflux at the boundary of the domain should be considered to understand the regional climate physics. Changes in the regional surface temperature are naturally closely related to changes in the (vertical) TOA radiative flux and (horizontal) dynamical energy-flux

 </sup>. The observed monthly change in TOA radiative fluxes in response to surface air-temperature change (hereafter, radiative response) over the Arctic could be decomposed into individual radiative-feedback components, such as the surface albedo, water vapor, lapse rate, and clouds

 </sup>. However, these radiative-feedback components alone cannot thoroughly explain the present-day radiative response because residual-feedback parameters, which are calculated by subtracting the sum of individual feedback parameters from the radiative response, represent relatively large values

 </sup>. Therefore, some other processes, especially the role of horizontally transported dynamical energy-flux, should be considered to estimate future Arctic temperature changes
