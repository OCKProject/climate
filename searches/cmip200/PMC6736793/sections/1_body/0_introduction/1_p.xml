 </sup>. This high sensitivity can be attributed to positive radiative-feedback processes that operate over the Arctic region. The ice–albedo feedback, for example, occurs because of the reduction in sea ice, which enhances shortwave radiation absorption by opening up the dark ocean. This feedback process is often considered the leading cause of the high climate sensitivity of the Arctic

 </sup>. For longwave radiation, the feedback processes can operate in association with the vertical structure of warming and changes in water vapor. That is, regionally enhanced lapse-rate and water vapor feedbacks reduce the outgoing longwave radiation, resulting in Arctic amplification
