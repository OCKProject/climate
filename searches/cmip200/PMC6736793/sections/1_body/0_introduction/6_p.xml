<p id="Par7" class="p">Given this consideration, this study attempts to relate Arctic climate sensitivity (ACS) to satellite observations of TOA radiative fluxes, serving as an observational estimate of ACS. We can also explain the role of dynamical energy flux in ACS. To these ends, this study uses Clouds and Earthâ€™s Radiation Energy System (CERES)-retrieved TOA radiative fluxes and the corresponding outputs of twelve climate models participating in the Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).</p>
