<p class="p">A number of measures of economic inequality have been developed (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). Given the limited availability of long timeseries of subnational economic data, investigations of changes in global inequality often rely on country-level metrics (e.g., refs. 
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>). However, when using country-level metrics, weighting by country-level population is critical to accurately capture trends in global inequality (
