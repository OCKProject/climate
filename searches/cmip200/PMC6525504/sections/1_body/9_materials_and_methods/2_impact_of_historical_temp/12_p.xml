<p class="p">Our primary analysis is focused on quantifying the impacts that historical global warming has had during the full period for which socioeconomic data are available (1961–2010). However, because the socioeconomic data do not extend to 1961 for a large number of countries, we repeat our analysis for the 1991–2010 period. For all analyses that start in 1961, we analyze only those countries that have continuous socioeconomic data from 1961 through 2010 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 86); for all analyses that start in 1991, we analyze only those countries that have continuous socioeconomic data from 1991 through 2010 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 151). Observed and estimated counterfactual temperatures and growth rates are the same for the years that overlap between the two periods, but growth rates are cumulated over 30 more years in the longer period, yielding larger (in absolute value) impacts on economic outcomes by the end of the period (
