<p class="p">In the current study, we repeat the primary regression calculation described in Burke et al. (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>), using historical data from 1961 to 2010, and bootstrapping with replacement to estimate a separate response function for each of 1,000 resamples, which we denote

 </sub>. The uncertainty in the magnitude of the temperature optimum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1

 </xref>) creates uncertainty in exactly which countries are likely to benefit or be penalized at different levels of warming, and is the largest source of uncertainty in the response of GDP growth to elevated levels of global climate forcing (
