<p class="p">We compare the Historical and Natural climate model simulations from the CMIP5 archive (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). As in Burke et al. (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>), we analyze the subselection of CMIP5 realizations analyzed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>). For the Natural experiment, this includes one realization each from 21 of the participating global climate models, which are paired with the 21 corresponding Historical realizations. Note that although the socioeconomic data are available through 2010, the CMIP5 experimental protocol for the Historical and Natural experiments ends in 2005. Thus, as in Burke et al. (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>), we use the IPCC’s 20-y historical baseline period (1986–2005) as the baseline period for climate model bias correction.
