<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">It has been frequently observed that wealthy countries have benefited disproportionately from the activities that have caused global warming, while poor countries suffer disproportionately from the impacts (e.g., refs. 
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). Our results show that, in addition to the direct benefits of fossil fuel use, many wealthy countries have likely been made even more wealthy by the resulting global warming. Likewise, not only have poor countries not shared in the full benefits of energy consumption, but many have already been made poorer (in relative terms) by the energy consumption of wealthy countries. Given the magnitude of the warming-induced growth penalties that poor countries have already suffered, expansion of low-carbon energy sources can be expected to provide a substantial secondary development benefit (by curbing future warming-induced growth penalties), in addition to the primary benefits of increased energy access.
