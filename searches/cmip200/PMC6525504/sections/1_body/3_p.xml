 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). A key insight is the nonlinear response of many outcomes to temperature change, with the coolest regions often benefitting in warm years, and warmer regions being harmed. As a result, empirical evidence combined with projections of future climate change suggests that, although some wealthy countries in cooler regions could benefit from additional warming, most poor countries are likely to suffer (
