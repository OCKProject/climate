<p class="p">As a result, anthropogenic climate forcing has decreased economic growth of countries in the low latitudes and increased economic growth of countries in the high latitudes (

Many countries in the middle latitudes exhibit median impacts smaller than ±10%, along with greater uncertainty in the sign of the response (particularly in the northern hemisphere). Thus, the global-scale pattern is of cool countries benefitting and warm countries suffering, with temperate countries exhibiting the greatest uncertainty.
