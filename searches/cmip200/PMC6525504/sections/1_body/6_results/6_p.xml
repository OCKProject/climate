<p class="p">The net effect of these economic impacts is that country-level inequality has very likely increased as a result of global warming (

 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>)] has become 25% larger (5th to 95th range of −6% to +114%) during the 1961–2010 period compared with a world without global warming, with ∼90% likelihood that the ratio has increased (
