<p class="p">Although this global pattern could be expected from the concave structure of the empirical temperatureâ€“growth relationship (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1
  <italic class="italic">B</italic>
 </xref>), such an outcome is not determined for historical climate forcing, because internal climate variability creates uncertainty in the sign and magnitude of regional temperature change (e.g., refs. 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref> and 
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). However, because the mean temperature response is positive across all land areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 </xref>), and because the differences in temperature change between countries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 </xref>) are small compared with the range of country-mean temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1
  <italic class="italic">B</italic>
 </xref>), the median economic response is that countries that are currently warmer than the median optimum have experienced losses, while countries that are currently colder than the median optimum have experienced benefits (
