<p class="p">Trade between countries has likely already influenced the impacts of global warming on population-weighted inequality. First, a large part of the reduction in historical inequality during our sample period has been due to the unprecedented growth in incomes in East Asia [and particularly China (

 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>)], much of which was built on critical trading relationships with high-income countries. In a no-trade counterfactual, China would likely grow much less rapidly. Thus, because of China’s large population and small sensitivity to historical warming (

 </xref>). However, trade can also serve as a buffer against climate shocks, particularly in poor countries (e.g., ref.
