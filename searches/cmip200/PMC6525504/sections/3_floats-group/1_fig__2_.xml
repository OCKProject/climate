  <p class="p">Country-level economic response to global warming. (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>) The median impact on country-level per capita GDP across the &gt;20,000 realizations of the world without anthropogenic forcing, calculated for each country over the 1961–2010 period. (
   <italic class="italic">B</italic>) As in 
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>, but for the 1991–2010 period. Differences in the presence/absence of countries between the 1961–2010 and 1991–2010 periods reflect differences in the availability of country-level economic data. Differences in the magnitude of country-level values between the 1961–2010 and 1991–2010 periods reflect the influence of accumulation time on the net accumulated economic impact. (
   <italic class="italic">C</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">D</italic>) The probability that historical anthropogenic forcing has resulted in economic damage, calculated as the percentage of the &gt;20,000 realizations that show a decrease in per capita GDP relative to the counterfactual world without anthropogenic forcing.
