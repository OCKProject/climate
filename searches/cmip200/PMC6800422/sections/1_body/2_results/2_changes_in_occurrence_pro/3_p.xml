<p id="Par25" class="p">We now investigate how extreme events would change at the national level. To do so, we make the areal average, over whole China, of TXx for each year of our considered periods. We are aware that averaging over large domain for extreme indices (such as TXx) may not have a physical significance, since they may be geographically independent for different grids. However, they may have a practical meaning for policy decision makers to have a national-level evaluation of extreme events. This gives us an ensemble of areal-mean values which forms a probability distribution. Despite the averaging operation over space, such a distribution does not pass the normality test. A GEV distribution is then used to fit the data.</p>
