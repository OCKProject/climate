The occurrence probability for 10-, 20- and 100-year TXx increases by 4.40 times (4.34–4.48), 5.97 times (5.82–6.13) and 11.79 times (11.07–12.53) in stabilized simulations, respectively, while it increases by 6.38 times (6.07–6.67), 10.65 times (9.92–11.40) and 36.86 times (32.04–42.19) in transient simulations. The two modes of running simulations both suggest that limiting global warming at 1.5 °C can effectively reduce probabilities for extreme hot events. The occurrence probabilities for extreme hot events with different return periods in transient simulations are higher than that in stabilized simulations under the additional 0.5 °C warming. And the uncertainty ranges of projected occurrence probabilities for extreme hot events are obviously narrower in stabilized simulations than in transient simulations, due to the large ensemble members of HAPPI data.
