Under 1.5 °C warming, the median PR for 10-, 20- and 100-year TXx over China is 2.35, 2.69 and 3.68, and the range of which is 1.55–3.8, 1.64–5.06 and 1.81–11.42 respectively, with the biggest PR located in the south of the Tibetan Plateau. The values and ranges of PR are both larger under 2.0 °C global warming, indicating that the occurrence probabilities of extreme events will change a lot and the difference between regions will become larger when global warming rises from 1.5 °C to 2.0 °C.
