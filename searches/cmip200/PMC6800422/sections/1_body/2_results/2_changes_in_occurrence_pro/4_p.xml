 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, the uncertainty ranges of PR for areal-mean TXx series are estimated from 1000 bootstrapped subsamples. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>, The PDF curves of TXx shift toward right, indicating an increase of TXx with warming; and the shape of PDF curves doesn’t change too much, meaning that there is no obvious change in variability of TXx. Under 1.5 °C global warming, the occurrence probabilities for present 10-, 20- and 100-year TXx increase by 5.96 times (5.88–6.04), 8.79 times (8.61–8.98) and 20.86 times (19.86–21.75) respectively, while under 2.0 °C warming the increase up to 9.42 times (9.39–9.45), 17.34 times (17.23–17.45) and 64.24 times (62.71–65.43) as in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>. The rarest extreme events receive the largest value of PR, especially for the higher global warming. The extreme hot event with 100-year return period is expected to occur every 4.79 years in a 1.5 °C warmer world and every 1.56 years in a 2.0 °C warmer world, the quite large difference between the return periods under different warming levels suggests that the probability for severely extreme hot event will experience an intensive increase in higher global warming scenarios.
