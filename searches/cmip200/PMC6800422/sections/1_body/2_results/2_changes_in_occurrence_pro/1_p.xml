<p id="Par23" class="p">We firstly examine the spatial distributions of PR for extreme hot events calculated at each grid point. We used Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) approach to evaluate their probability and PR from the reference period to warming scenario. The methodology that we used is the same as in Kharin

 </sup>. It is to be noted that important biases may exist among various models and their individual members

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>, which makes the ensemble of data incoherent among them and inapplicable for a GEV distribution. To remediate this issue, we use anomalous fields calculated from each individual model, and add the general mean value just before performing the GEV fitting. After the calibration of the three free parameters of GEV (location, scale, and shape), the PR is calculated for three probabilities, 90%, 95% and 99%, respectively, corresponding to events that occur every 10, 20 and 100 years. The PR of extreme hot events increases over China with global warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). It can be seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a–h</xref> that the spatial patterns of PR are similar between 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C global warming, whereas the value is larger for a higher warming level and a rarer event. The PR is relatively high in the south of the Tibetan Plateau and Northwest China in a future warmer world, with occurrence probability for 100-year extreme hot event increases by 4 and 3 times in these regions respectively (that is, the return values of such event change to 25.0 and 33.3 years) under 1.5 °C global warming; and in a 2.0 °C warmer world, the occurrence probability for 100-year extreme hot event becomes 16 and 8 times respectively (the return values of 100-year extreme hot event change to 6.3 and 12.5 years). The additional warming of 0.5 °C leads to higher PR in Northwest China and the occurrence probability for 100-year extreme hot event increases by about 4 times (the return value is 25.0 years) relative to the 1.5 °C warming level.
