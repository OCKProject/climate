<p id="Par20" class="p">It can be seen that, in terms of spatial distribution, WSDI increases mainly in the south of the Tibetan Plateau and in Southeast China, with an increase reaching 12 days, 21 days and 9 days for the 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C warming levels and the additional warming of 0.5 °C, respectively. These areas would suffer severe heat waves in the future. FD decreases in most parts of China, with the largest decrease in the Tibetan Plateau with values larger than 9 days/15 days under the 1.5 °C/2.0 °C warming levels, and larger than 7 days for the additional 0.5 °C warming, which implies that the Tibetan Plateau would be strongly affected by global warming. The transient response of WSDI and FD based on CMIP5 also exhibits similar response, as shown in Lang
