 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> (three columns on the left) shows the projected changes of WSDI and FD under 1.5 °C/2 °C global warming levels and for the half-a-degree warming respectively, while areal-means are shown on the right with results from transient simulations added (blue bar). The areal-mean WSDI increases obviously with global warming, which is 9.9 days (7.1–12.7) and 18.1 days (14.3–21.8) respectively in 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warmer world. There is an obvious decrease in areal-mean FD, which is 7.8 days (6.0–9.5) and 13.2 days (11.3–15.0), respectively. When considering the additional warming of 0.5 °C, the stabilized response of areal-mean WSDI shows an increase of 8.2 days (5.3–11.2), and the transient response is 9.5 days (5.3–13.8). The decrease of FD is 5.4 days (3.9–6.9) and 6.7 days (5.1–8.2) in the stabilized and transient simulations respectively. For both WSDI and FD, the response in transient simulations is larger than that of stabilized simulations (the last two bars in Fig.
