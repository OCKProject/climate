<p id="Par22" class="p">To quantify the two sources of uncertainty in relation to spreading among models and internal variability among different runs, we perform an analysis of variance for the temporal (whole duration of runs) and spatial (whole China) averages of different climate indices. Results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. It can be seen that, under 1.5 °C (dark orange and light yellow) and 2.0 °C (dark red and light red) global warming, the mean temperature shows a larger inter-model spreading (60 and 67%) against internal variability. For most extreme indices, we observe a dominant internal variability, except for WSDI which shows a large spreading among models (consistent with what found in Shi

 </sup> for models running transient scenarios). For an additional warming of 0.5 °C (blue) and for all indices, the variance is mainly brought in by internal variability whose contribution is more than 85%. WSDI again shows a particular behavior with an important inter-model spreading.
