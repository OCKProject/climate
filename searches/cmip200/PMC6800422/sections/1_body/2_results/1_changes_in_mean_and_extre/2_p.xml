 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> depicts changes of TXx and TNn at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming levels, and in the case of half-a-degree additional warming in panels a, b and c respectively. The areal-mean over China increases by 0.93 °C (0.63–1.23 °C), 1.63 °C (1.33–1.93 °C) for 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming, and the areal-mean TNn increases by 0.99 °C (0.43–1.55 °C) and 1.8 °C (1.25–2.35 °C) respectively, the magnitude of which is a little larger than TXx, indicating that global warming has more effect on extreme cold events, which is consistent with previous studies

 </sup>. The largest increase of TXx occurs over North China and the west of the Tibetan Plateau, with 1.1 °C/1.75 °C warmer under 1.5 °C/2.0 °C global warming levels; and TNn increases mostly in northern China, with more than 1.1 °C/2.0 °C warmer in Northwest and Northeast-North China, the spatial distribution in transient simulations also exhibits similarly

 </sup>. The magnitudes of both TXx and TNn increase are higher than that for mean temperature in these areas, indicating that extreme temperature events are more sensitive to global warming.
