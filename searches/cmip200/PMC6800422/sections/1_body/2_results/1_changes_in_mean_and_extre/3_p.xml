<p id="Par18" class="p">As for the additional warming of 0.5 °C, the areal-mean TXx increases by 0.7 °C (0.43–0.97 °C) in stabilized simulations, while the increase is 0.85 °C (0.55–1.15 °C) in transient simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>); and areal-mean TNn increases by 0.81 °C (0.3–1.32 °C) and 0.94 °C (0.19–1.69 °C) respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2h</xref>), it can be seen that the transient response is a little higher than the stabilized one. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>, TXx increases more than 0.5 °C all over China under the additional half-a-degree warming, especially in Northwest China with a higher increase over 0.7 °C; TNn also has an increase of more than 0.5 °C in most regions of China, with the largest increase of more than 0.9 °C in part of Northwest and Northeast China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2g</xref>).
