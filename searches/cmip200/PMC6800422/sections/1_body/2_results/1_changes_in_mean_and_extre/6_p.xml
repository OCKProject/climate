 </sup>, we can find that the areal-mean extreme temperatures over China show an increase larger than their global counterpart in both stabilized and transient simulations, and key regions are located in Northwest and Northeast-North China; while WSDI increases mostly in Southeast China, FD decreases mostly in the Tibetan Plateau. The results indicate that the response of these regions to global warming is robust, that is, these regions are truly more sensitive to global warming and will suffer severe effects, whether under which warming scenarios. Under the additional warming of 0.5 °C, the change of areal-mean temperature and all extreme indices are larger in transient simulations than that in stabilized simulations (the difference between them is significant in mean temperature, TXx and FD). Moreover, the uncertainty ranges of all areal-mean indices are narrower in stabilized simulations than that in transient simulations, for the ensemble mean of HAPPI project (which has large ensemble members) can reduce the uncertainty caused by climate internal variability

 </sup>. But it should be noted that in this study we only use 4 models of HAPPI project, but 15 models of CMIP5; moreover, the uncertainties of HAPPI results are composed of the spread among different models and different individuals, while the uncertainties of CMIP5 are only due to model spreads.
