<p id="Par16" class="p">Changes of annual-mean temperature over China under 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming levels are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a,b</xref> for geographic distributions and in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref> for the areal-average (grid area-weighted). The areal-mean over China increases by 0.94 °C (0.71–1.17 °C) and 1.59 °C (1.36–1.82 °C) respectively, higher than the global mean which increases by 0.67 °C (0.64–0.7 °C) and 1.15 °C (1.11–1.19 °C) respectively. As generally practiced, changes shown hereafter are relative to present climate (2006–2015), while warming levels (1.5 °C and 2.0 °C) are relative to pre-industrial. Temperature increases over 0.7 °C across China under the level of 1.5 °C global warming. Large values (&gt;1.0 °C) are mainly located in Northwest and Northeast China. They can reach values larger than 1.6 °C under 2.0 °C global warming. We note that the spatial distribution shown here is quite close to what obtained from transient simulations, as shown in previous studies

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>, while the areal average (yellow bars) is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref> which also adds that from transient simulations (blue bar). Under the additional warming of 0.5 °C, the mean temperature increases mostly in Northwest and Northeast China by more than 0.7 °C. The mean increases are 0.65 °C (0.5–0.8 °C) and 0.78 °C (0.62–0.94 °C) for stabilized and transient simulations respectively. The difference between them is statistically significant according to a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test (p &lt; 0.05). The K-S test is a non-parametric test, suitable for extreme indices which generally show non-Gaussian distribution characteristics
