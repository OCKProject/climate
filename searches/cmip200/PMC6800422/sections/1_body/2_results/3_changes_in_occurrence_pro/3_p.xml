<p id="Par30" class="p">For the additional 0.5 °C warming, the PR for 5-, 10- and 20-year TNn is 0.33 (0.32–0.34), 0.25 (0.23–0.67) and 0.2 (0.16–0.21) respectively relative to that under stabilized 1.5 °C global warming; while in transient simulations, the PR for TNn with different return levels is 0.32 (0.26–0.38), 0.29 (0.21–0.37) and 0.29 (0.18–0.42) respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3c</xref>), the results between different return periods are similar and hold wider uncertainty ranges than stabilized results, due to the quite small ensemble members compared to HAPPI simulations. Both of the warming simulations indicate that occurrence probabilities for extreme cold events will be mitigated when limiting global warming at 1.5 °C.
