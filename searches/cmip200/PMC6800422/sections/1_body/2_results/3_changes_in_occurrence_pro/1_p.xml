 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> shows the spatial patterns of PR for extreme cold events in stabilized simulations. The GEV estimation is also used to evaluate the occurrence probability of TNn. Note that GEV distribution is only suitable for extreme large values, thus we simply take a negative sign for TNn when calculating PR. Considering the probability of 100-year TNn is too small and contains large uncertainty, we analyze the extreme cold event with 5-, 10-, and 20-year return periods. And we also remove the systematic biases among models in TNn series before further processing, as what we did to TXx series in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. There are very similar spatial patterns between the 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warming targets, whereas rarer events have much smaller values, especially over higher warming levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a–h</xref>). For an extreme cold event in present climate, a smaller PR means that it has a lower probability to occur under future warming scenarios. The occurrence probabilities of extreme cold events reduce all over China (PR &lt; 1) in warmer worlds, areas with smaller PR located in the east of the Tibetan Plateau, Northeast and Southeast China, the PR of 10-year TNn in the present climate is 0.5/0.3 under 1.5 °C/2.0 °C global warming, that is, the return period of which is 20/33 years. Under the additional 0.5 °C warming, the PR of 10-year TNn is still relatively small in the east of the Tibetan Plateau and Northeast China (PR is 0.5 approximately), indicating that a TNn event expected once every 10 years in a 1.5 °C warmer world is expected to occur about every 20 years in a 2.0 °C warming climate, suggesting that limiting global warming at 1.5 °C will reduce the change of occurrence probabilities for extreme cold events in these regions, which is also identified in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>. It can be seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> that the median PR for 5-, 10- and 20-year TNn over China is 0.54, 0.48 and 0.42 under 1.5 °C warming, and the range of which is 0.31–0.75, 0.2–0.76 and 0.11–0.8 respectively. The PR values are much lower in a 2.0 °C warmer world, with the minimum PR for 20-year TNn closed to 0 (located in Southeast China), meaning that the once-in-20-year TNn happened in present climate may not occur in this area under 2.0 °C global warming.
