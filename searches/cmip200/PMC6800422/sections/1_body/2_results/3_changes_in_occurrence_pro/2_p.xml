<p id="Par29" class="p">To understand how extreme cold events would change at the national level, the PR and PDF for areal-mean TNn series are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>. As in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3a</xref>, the right shift of the PDF indicates an increase of TNn with global warming, which also suggests that the occurrence probabilities of present extreme cold events may become very small in the warmer worlds. The shape of PDF curves doesn’t change much, meaning that there are no obvious changes in variability of TNn under stabilized simulations. When global warming stabilized at 1.5 °C, the PR for 5-, 10- and 20-year TNn is 0.23 (0.21–0.24), 0.15 (0.14–0.17) and 0.10 (0.08–0.11), respectively; and in a 2.0 °C warmer world the PR for TNn with different return levels is 0.039 (0.034–0.044), 0.013 (0.010–0.018) and 0.003 (0.001–0.006) respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3b</xref>). It can be seen that the values of PR for TNn will be smaller with higher global warming levels and rarer extreme cold events. For example, the areal-mean extreme cold event expected every 10 years in the present climate is expected about every 67 years under stabilized 1.5 °C global warming, while under 2.0 °C warming the return period of which will be more than 700 years, meaning that such extreme cold event is unlikely to happen in a 2.0 °C warmer world.
