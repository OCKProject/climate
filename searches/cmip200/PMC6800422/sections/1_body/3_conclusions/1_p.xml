<p id="Par31" class="p">In this study we used HAPPI datasets to analyze the response of extreme temperature in China when global warming stabilizes at 1.5 °C/2.0 °C, and compared the response difference between stabilized and transient simulations under the additional 0.5 °C warming. Main results are as follows:

   <p id="Par32" class="p">Under stabilized 1.5 °C/2.0 °C global warming (relative to pre-industrial), the global mean temperature increases by 0.67 °C/1.15 °C relative to present climate (2006–2015), and the increase of areal-mean temperature over China is higher, which is 0.94 °C/1.59 °C; TXx increases by 0.93 °C/1.63 °C, TNn increases by 0.99 °C/1.8 °C, WSDI increases by 9.9 days/18.1 days and FD decreases by 7.8 days/13.2 days. Under the additional warming of 0.5 °C, the change of mean and extreme temperature is higher in transient simulations (multi-model ensemble from CMIP5 datasets) than that in stabilized simulations. The uncertainty ranges are narrowed in stabilized simulations, due to the large ensemble members in HAPPI datasets.</p>

   <p id="Par33" class="p">Under stabilized warming scenarios, the mean temperature, TXx and TNn increase mostly in Northwest and Northeast-North China, the increase is about 1.1 °C in 1.5 °C warmer world, and is higher in 2.0 °C. TXx and TNn have a higher increase compared to the mean temperature; WSDI increases mostly in Southeast China, which increases more than 12 days/21 days under 1.5 °C/2.0 °C global warming; and FD decreases more than 9 days/15 days in the Tibetan Plateau. The results are similar with those from transient simulations, indicating that these areas are sensitive to global warming in both stabilized and transient warming scenarios.</p>

   <p id="Par34" class="p">The HAPPI experimental design, with a large ensemble size, allowed us to decompose the total variance into a part related to inter-model variability and another related to internal variability. This decomposition serves as a surrogate to estimate uncertainties of climate projections. In the case of 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warming levels, the two variances are roughly equal (about 50% each) for the mean temperature, WSDI and FD, while the internal variability dominates for TXx and TNn. In the case of additional half-a-degree warming, the internal variability is clearly dominant over the inter-model variability (80 versus 20%) for most variables (except for WSDI which shows half-and-half).</p>

   <p id="Par35" class="p">The PR of extreme hot/cold events will increase/decrease under global warming. There is larger change of occurrence probabilities in higher global warming levels, especially for rarer extreme events. For geographic distribution, the occurrence probabilities for TXx are higher in the south of the Tibetan Plateau, where the return period of 100-year TXx changes to 25/6.3 years under stabilized 1.5 °C/2.0 °C global warming; the occurrence probabilities for TNn change mostly in the east of the Tibetan Plateau, Northeast and Southeast China, where the 10-year TNn event becomes 20/33 years, which can be inferred that limiting global warming at 1.5 °C can reduce the change of occurrence probabilities for extreme temperature events. For the national averaged extreme events, the return period of 100-year TXx over China changes to 4.79 and 1.56 years under stabilized 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C global warming, and the return period of 10-year TNn changes to 67 years and more than 700 years; for the additional warming of 0.5 °C, the uncertainty ranges of PR for areal-mean TXx and TNn are obviously narrower in stabilized simulations than that in transient simulations.</p>
