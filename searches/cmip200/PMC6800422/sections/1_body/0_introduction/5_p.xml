<p id="Par6" class="p">The paper is organized as the following. The datasets and methods used are introduced in section 2. Section 3.1 describes the response of extreme temperature in China to 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C and the additional 0.5 °C global warming, and we also perform an analysis of variance for HAPPI multi-member simulations. In section 3.2 and 3.3, we analyze changes of occurrence probabilities for extreme temperature events under different warming targets. We also use CMIP5 experiments to present an analysis of temperature extremes over China under transient warming simulations, which contributes to assess the reliability of our research.</p>
