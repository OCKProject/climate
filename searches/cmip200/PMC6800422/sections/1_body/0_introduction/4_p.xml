<p id="Par5" class="p">Since the release of HAPPI data, many interesting studies using HAPPI have been reported in literature for stabilized climate response in different regions. Several hot spots have been revealed in Asia in the 1.5 °C warmer world, while extreme high temperature increases from about 0.5 to 1.5 °C (relative to present time) over most land areas and the intensity of heat waves also strengthens

 </sup> indicated that the heat extremes in Australia may increase by twice the global-mean warming. However, few studies with HAPPI are reported for climate change in China. We want to fill up this gap with the present study, and we believe that East Asia provides a favorable test-bed to investigate behaviors of extreme temperature events in stabilized and transient simulations respectively, considering the unique geographic location and regional terrain.
