<p id="Par4" class="p">However, results based on transient simulations may suffer uncertainties due to climate internal variability. We need to find a suitable way to make the global mean surface temperature stabilized at specific warming targets, i.e., 1.5 °C and 2 °C above pre-industrial levels

 </sup>. Moreover, the small ensemble size of CMIP5 (a few members) constitutes another obstacle to suitably assess the uncertainty in relation to climate extremes

 </sup>. To remediate these issues, the ‘Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts’ (HAPPI) project proposed an alternative modelling strategy. An examination of all available CMIP5 simulations under RCP2.6 reveals that by chance the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century has the global warming level of 1.55 °C, compared to pre-industrial period (1861–1880). If we subtract the sea-surface temperature and sea-ice anomalous fields from those in RCP8.5 scenario present time (2006 to 2015, reference period), we can then superimpose such anomalous fields onto the observed sea-surface temperature and sea-ice fields from 2006 to 2015. For the 2 °C warming level, the end-of-the-century fields are a combination of weighted RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 to ensure the target warming. Actually the 1.5 °C global warming level (from pre-industrial 1861–1880) shows a global warming of about 0.7 °C from the reference period (2006–2015), and the 2.0 °C warming level shows a global warming of 1.2 °C. For the reference and the two perturbed levels, one can thus perform ‘stabilized simulations’ (of AMIP-type), and with a large ensemble size. The large ensemble size (≥100) in each model of the HAPPI project can help us to estimate the uncertainty caused by internal variability
