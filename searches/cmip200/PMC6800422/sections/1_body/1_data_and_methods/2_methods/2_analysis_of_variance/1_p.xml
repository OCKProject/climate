<p id="Par10" class="p">The analysis of variance is based on variance decomposition which partitions the total observed variance of a given variable into components of separated variation sources. The HAPPI experimental design permits to explore variation of results attributable to inter-model differences and internal (inter-member) variation. This can be served as a surrogate to measure uncertainty of climate projections which is generally considered as from three different sources: emission-scenario uncertainty, model-related uncertainty and internal variability

 </sup>. The HAPPI experiment is obviously not applicable to issues of emission scenarios, but very useful to quantify uncertainties due to modelsâ€™ spreading and internal variability.
