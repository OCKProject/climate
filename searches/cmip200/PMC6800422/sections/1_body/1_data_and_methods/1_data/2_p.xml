<p id="Par8" class="p">In order to assess eventual differences between transient and stabilized simulations for the half-a-degree additional warming, we also use datasets under RCP4.5 scenario from 15 models in CMIP5 (as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). A single member (r1i1p1) is used for each model, and the 1.5 °C/2.0 °C global warming period under transient simulations is selected as an 11-year period centered on the time of 1.5 °C/2.0 °C global warming targets, as shown in Shi

 </sup>. The same data manipulation strategy as for HAPPI is used here. That is, relevant diagnoses and indices are calculated at the native grid of each model, and final results are re-gridded to the 1° × 1° grid to facilitate a fair comparison with HAPPI. However, it is to be noted that due to different states in CMIP5 and HAPPI for their own references, they can’t be compared directly. But it is fair and meaningful to compare them when considering the additional 0.5 °C warming from 1.5 to 2.0 °C.
