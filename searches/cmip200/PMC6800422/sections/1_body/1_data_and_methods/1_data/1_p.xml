<p id="Par7" class="p">The HAPPI datasets that we downloaded are the 3 simulations of the Tier-1 experiment: (1) present-day climate (2006–2015); (2) 1.5 °C warming level (relative to pre-industrial) for which the actual warming is about 0.7 °C if present-day is taken as reference; (3) 2.0 °C warming level (relative to pre-industrial) for which the actual warming is about 1.2 °C compared to present-day. The detailed experimental protocol can be found in Mitchell

 </sup>. Our analysis is performed on daily mean, minimum and maximum surface air temperature from CanAM4, ECHAM6-3-LR, MIROC5 and NorESM1-HAPPI models contributing to HAPPI (as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Relevant diagnoses, including calculation of extreme indices, are performed on their native grids to achieve the highest accuracy possible. But to facilitate operations such as data visualization or areal average, indices calculated from different models with different resolutions are re-gridded to a common 1° × 1° grid with a bilinear interpolation scheme.
