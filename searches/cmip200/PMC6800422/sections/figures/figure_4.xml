 <caption class="caption">
  <p class="p">Percentages of variances (for different areal-mean climate indices over China) attributed to inter-model variability (dark colors) and inter-member variability (light colors). The former measures the spreading among the four HAPPI models, the latter measures the internal spreading among the 100 realization members performed within each model. Each group of three bars represents the warming levels 1.5 °C (orange), 2.0 °C (red), and the effect of half-a-degree increase (blue), respectively.</p>
