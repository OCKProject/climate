  <p class="p">Precipitation variability change by timescale. The change in standard deviation of precipitation averaged over all land grid points divided by the change in global-mean surface air temperature in 2071–2100 relative to 1976–2005 in the CMIP5 multi-model mean for time scales ranging from 1 day to 3 years (note that the value at 3 years represents the change in 2050–2100 relative to 1955–2005; see text for details). Gray envelope denotes the 95% confidence interval according to a two-tailed student’s
