 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>. While temperature variability does not change systematically in response to projections of global warming in most regions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
