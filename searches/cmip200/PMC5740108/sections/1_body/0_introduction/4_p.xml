<p id="Par5" class="p">Here we quantify the change in precipitation variability on timescales from daily to decadal with warming in three ensembles of global climate model simulations: the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5) ensemble, and two large initial-condition ensembles using the CESM1 and GFDL models (see Methods for details). We use standard deviation of precipitation as a metric of its variability (following refs

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>; alternative metrics are discussed in the Supplementary Information). We primarily focus on land because this is where most impacts will be felt. The changes in precipitation variability are interpreted in the framework for the changing distributions of moisture, vertical velocity, and precipitation presented in ref.
