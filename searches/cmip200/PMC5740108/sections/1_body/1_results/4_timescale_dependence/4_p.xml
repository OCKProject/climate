<p id="Par18" class="p">The uncertainty in precipitation variability due to internal variability alone (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) is small for short timescales and increases dramatically moving to longer timescales. This stands in contrast to the uncertainty across the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble, which is relatively large at all timescales. This indicates large structural uncertainty at short timescales, and that changes in short timescale variability would be detectable in the observational record before changes in variability at longer timescales.
