<p id="Par17" class="p">A notable feature of the precipitation variability change is that no individual timescale stands out, including ENSO timescales (&gt;3 y; see also Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). Recent work shows that the ENSO-related precipitation increases in magnitude with warming, maintaining a similar spatial pattern

 </sup>. The consistent response of precipitation variability across timescales indicates that this reflects processes whose influence is felt on all timescales, like the increase in moisture, rather than processes related predominantly to ENSO. Indeed, if we think of precipitation as a red-noise process, the effects of moisture on the change in the characteristics of this process project onto all timescales. That said, ENSO does modulate the

 <italic class="italic">among</italic> models, particularly in the tropics in DJF. The CESM1 and GFDL models happen to bracket the responses of precipitation variability across all CMIP5 models (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>); but the GFDL model has an ENSO variability response that is an outlier among CMIP5 models
