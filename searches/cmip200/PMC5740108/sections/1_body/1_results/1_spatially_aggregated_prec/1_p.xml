  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup> asserted that changes in variability were not important by visual inspection of precipitation time series at individual grid points because modern precipitation variability is already large. To assess whether models predict an increase in interannual precipitation variability with warming, we examine the spatially-aggregated change
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup> in the interannual standard deviation of seasonal-mean precipitation. Spatial aggregation is useful for expressing the risk of climate impacts probabilistically over land areas, because variability at each particular grid cell is high and models do not accurately simulate the location of all precipitating features. Grid cells are binned according to their change, and the resulting histogram is plotted with the frequency represented as a fraction of land area. FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows these histograms of the change in interannual standard deviation of precipitation by land area from each member of the CMIP5 and CESM1 ensembles from the end of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century to the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. As a reference case to quantify the expected internal variability in precipitation when no change in climate occurs, the difference between members of the CESM1 ensemble drawn randomly without replacement during the historical period is also included.
