<p id="Par7" class="p">Spatial aggregation of precipitation variability reveals a robust change in response to warming. The change in interannual standard deviation of precipitation is distinct from present-day internal variability. The interannual standard deviation of precipitation increases over a larger land fraction than it decreases in the CMIP5 and CESM1 ensembles in most regions, seasons, and models (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> for results from the GFDL ensemble; which are similar in the extratropics but have some differences in the tropics, addressed later). In the extratropics in summer, internal variability is relatively small, and variability across models is only slightly higher (see Methods for region and season definitions). Agreement across CMIP models as well as with CESM1 (and GFDL: Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) is higher over extratropical land than over tropical land. In the tropics, CESM1 shows a larger increase in variability than the CMIP5 models.
