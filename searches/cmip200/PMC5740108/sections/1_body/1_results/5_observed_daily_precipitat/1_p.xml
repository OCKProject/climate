<p id="Par19" class="p">Are changes in precipitation variability already occurring? Daily precipitation variability can be estimated with greater certainty than interannual precipitation variability because the number of samples during the period of observations is larger (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Precipitation variability has increased at most stations (though this increase in variability is similar in magnitude to the increase in mean precipitation), consistent with model projections of increased variability with warming.
