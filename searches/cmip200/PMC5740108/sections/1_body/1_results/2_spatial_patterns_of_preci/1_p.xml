 </sup> showing increasing interannual monsoon variability in response to a doubling of carbon dioxide. Mean, variability, and extreme precipitation all have minima in the subtropics, particularly the eastern ocean basins, extending to adjacent land areas. The regions of decrease are most extensive for mean precipitation (26% of land area), less for variability (7.3% of land for seasonal and 2.9% for daily) and least for extreme precipitation (1.5%).
