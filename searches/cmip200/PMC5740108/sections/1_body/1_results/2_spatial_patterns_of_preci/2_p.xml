<p id="Par9" class="p">There are also differences between the spatial patterns of changes in interannual variability and mean precipitation. The increase in variability is smaller at high latitudes than mean precipitation change, in winter in the Arctic and both winter and summer over the Southern Ocean (Fig.Â
