 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the change in spatially-averaged precipitation variability over successively warmer decades of the CMIP5 simulations (single-model ensemble results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). The rate of change of precipitation interannual standard deviation is generally at least as large as mean precipitation and smaller than moisture for the CMIP5 multi-model mean over land (also for CESM1 and GFDL). In the tropics and extratropical summer, the increase in standard deviation is greater than the increase in mean precipitation and less than near-surface moistening. In extratropical winter it increases at a rate similar to mean precipitation change. Changes over ocean have slightly smaller magnitudes but are otherwise similar (not shown). The relationship between standard deviation and global-mean temperature is essentially linear when taken in average over large areas and ensembles of model simulations. In contrast to precipitation variability, temperature variability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>) does not change systematically with warming, with the exception of high latitude winter where it decreases in association with sea ice decline
