<p id="Par10" class="p">By how much do climate models predict precipitation variability to change in response to changes in climate? We consider the magnitude of the change in precipitation variability with warming in the context of two null hypotheses. The first hypothesis arises from a statistical argument for a positive-definite variable like precipitation. The simplest form of change for precipitation is to scale an initial timeseries by a constant, which leads to a change in standard deviation equal to the change in its mean

 </sup>. Our first hypothesis, then, is that the change in standard deviation follows mean precipitation. The predicted rate of increase of global-mean precipitation is energetically constrained to about 2% K
