<p id="Par14" class="p">Because the magnitude of precipitation variability increase is in most cases greater than the change in mean precipitation, the first hypothesis can be rejected as an explanation. The second hypothesis, that precipitation variability is driven by moisture, can provide a starting point to explain its changes. Because in most models and regions the change in variability is smaller than the change in moisture, the simple model discussed above implies that circulation must also weaken. The mean, variability, and extreme of precipitation each measure a different aspect of the distribution of precipitation, but they are not independent of one another. In order to reconcile the differing changes in variability with extreme precipitation, there must also be a change in the shape of the distribution of circulation, because merely changing its strength does not break the symmetry between the changes in mean precipitation, variability, and the magnitude of extreme precipitation change.

 </sup> showed that an increase in the skewness of the vertical velocity distribution reconciles these differences.
