If precipitation rate is proportional to moisture and vertical velocity (when vertical velocity is upward), then a strengthening of the circulation (and thus the average magnitude of vertical velocity) would increase precipitation variability, while a weakening of the circulation and decrease in magnitude of vertical velocity would decrease precipitation variability. Climate models project a decrease in variability of the tropical circulation in response to warming
