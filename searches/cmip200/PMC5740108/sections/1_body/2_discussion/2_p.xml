<p id="Par21" class="p">In our analysis, we quantify precipitation variability by its standard deviation, and we examine its change in a set of model simulations subject to just one forcing scenario. While the standard deviation is a crude metric of precipitation variability, especially on short timescales with many dry periods, precipitation variability also increases when quantified by other metrics (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). The standard deviation has the advantage of being well-defined, with a straightforward behavior in response to simple scaling of the distribution. Our analysis focuses on model simulations driven by a large increase in greenhouse gas forcing along with changes in aerosol forcing. Changes in variability will differ with the type of forcing, e.g., in an extreme example of geoengineering by stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection, where global-mean temperature does not change but mean precipitation decreases
