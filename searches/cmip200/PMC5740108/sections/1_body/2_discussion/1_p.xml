<p id="Par20" class="p">In summary, precipitation variability simulated by climate models from daily and monthly to interannual and decadal timescales increases robustly over almost all land areas in response to anthropogenic warming in most models. For longer timescales, particularly interannual and longer, the forced increase may well be compensated for or amplified by natural variability (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). We also show that observed daily precipitation variability increased over the second half of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century. In most models, regions, and seasons, the change in precipitation variability (measured by the mean standard deviation) is higher in magnitude than the change in mean precipitation and lower in magnitude than the change in moisture and extreme precipitation (heaviest day of rainfall each year). In most regions and seasons, mean precipitation increase sets a lower bound on the change in precipitation variability; the increase in precipitation variability is at least as large and in many cases greater than the increase in mean precipitation. We attribute this to the role of increasing moisture counteracted by weakening circulation.
