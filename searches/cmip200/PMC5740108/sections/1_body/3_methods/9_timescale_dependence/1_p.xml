<p id="Par31" class="p">For each timescale, the standard deviation is calculated for an initial and final time period. Spatial averaging is carried out as described above. For daily through annual timescales, the initial period is 1976–2005 and the final period is 2071–2100. Daily data for 34 CMIP5 models are used. For the 1-month timescale, the annual cycle is removed before the standard deviation is calculated. For the 3-month timescale, monthly data with annual cycle removed are averaged in 3-month seasons and the standard deviation is calculated. For the 1-year timescale, monthly data is averaged over years. For the 3-year timescale, monthly data are averaged in 3-year periods over the 51-year periods 1955–2005 and 2050–2100 to achieve sufficient sampling.</p>
