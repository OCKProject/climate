<p id="Par29" class="p">For maps of the CMIP5 multi-model mean, calculations (mean, standard deviation, or extreme precipitation) are made on each model’s grid, data are regridded to a common 2.5 × 2.5° grid, the multi-model mean initial field is calculated, each model’s change is scaled by its change in global-mean surface air temperature, and then the multi-model mean absolute change is divided by the initial multi-model mean.</p>
