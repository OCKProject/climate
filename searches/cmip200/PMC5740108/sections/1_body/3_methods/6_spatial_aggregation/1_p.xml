 </sup>. We use each model’s own land mask and grid cell area fields to calculate the land fraction contributed by each grid cell. Where summer and winter seasons are identified, summer seasons are defined as June to August (JJA) north of the equator and December to February (DJF) south of it; vice versa for winter. Tropics and extratropics are defined as latitudes less and greater than 30°, respectively. Internal variability is quantified by comparing two members of the CESM1 ensemble drawn randomly without replacement during the base period.
