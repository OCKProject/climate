<p id="Par30" class="p">For Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, the spatial-average change in each of mean precipitation, standard deviation of precipitation, or mean moisture is calculated by first calculating the variable at each grid cell. In the case of standard deviation, it is squared. Then, the spatial average of the variable for the initial and final time periods is calculated, and in the case of standard deviation, the square root is taken. Next, the difference of the spatial average between the time periods is calculated, followed by scaling by each model’s global-mean surface air temperature change over the appropriate period of time (in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), and finally calculating the multi-model mean.
