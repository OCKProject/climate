 </sup> and use the subset of stations in the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Surface Network (GSN). This subset of stations has better spatial sampling than the total network. Only stations with data for at least 50% of each period are used. Global-mean surface temperature observations are calculated from NOAA GlobalTemp

 </sup>. Change in the standard deviation of daily precipitation is calculated from 1960–1969 to 1990–1999. The time periods are chosen to maximize the number of stations; we repeated the analysis for start dates in the 1950s and 1970s and end dates from the 1990s through 2016, with similar results.
