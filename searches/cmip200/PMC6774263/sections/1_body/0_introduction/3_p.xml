 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) demonstrated that a GCM's ability to capture Euro‚ÄêAtlantic regimes appears to depend on the horizontal resolution of the model. In particular, improvements in the spatial structure, geometric robustness (by which we mean the extent to which the data can be divided into tightly knit clusters), and persistence statistics of the regimes were all identified upon increasing the resolution. However, these studies used only one model, with a single ensemble member at each resolution. This leaves open the question as to how robust this resolution dependence is across models, as well as the possibility that sampling variability may be playing a role. In this paper, we address these issues by examining the impact of increasing resolution on three different models, each with three ensemble members. Besides examining the impact of resolution, we also evaluate the impact of using an ensemble: By concatenating multiple ensemble members, we can obtain larger data sets, effectively reducing the impact of excessive noise and/or poorly constrained regimes.
