<p class="p">We will show that, for all three models considered, the low‐resolution models struggle to replicate the regime structure seen in reanalysis data sets. None of the nine individual simulations achieve comparable levels of clustering to that of reanalysis, and while the regime patterns on average have a relatively high spatial correlation with those of reanalysis, the spread is often large with some individual members performing notably poorly. Persistence of the blocking regime is also systematically underestimated in all simulations, with the model tending to vacate the regime faster than reanalysis. Increasing the horizontal resolution leads to notably more tightly clustered data, with a few individual high‐resolution simulations achieving a regime structure comparable to reanalysis. A systematic improvement in the persistence statistics of the blocking regime is also seen across all the models; no such systematic change is identified for the other regimes. This is consistent with the results of the multimodel study conducted in Schiemann et al. (

However, no systematic improvement in the spatial patterns of the regimes are seen, with the net impact being a slight degradation compared to the low‐resolution patterns.
