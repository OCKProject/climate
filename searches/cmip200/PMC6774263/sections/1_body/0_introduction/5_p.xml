<p class="p">We also show that, for single ensemble members at low resolution, there can be a notable spread around the average value of the metrics in question, suggesting that sampling variability for these quantities can be large. For the low‐resolution models, one generally needs to use all three members in order to generate regime statistics comparable to reanalysis over the approximately 30‐year periods considered, while for high resolution, two ensemble members suffice. This supports the idea that models at lower resolution have too weak regime structure and that increased resolution can be expected to ameliorate this to some extent. It also highlights the fact that, for models with weaker regime structure, a large sample size of simulation years is necessary to diagnose regimes robustly.</p>
