<p class="p">To assess the impact on persistence, we considered the seasonal persistence probabilities of the four regimes. These are computed for a given season by estimating the probability that if the atmosphere is in a regime on day 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>, it will remain in the same regime on day 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>+1. This gives an indication of how persistent that regime tended to be in said season. For each model and each regime, distributions of these seasonal persistence probabilities were computed on the concatenation of the three ensemble members. These distributions were used to assess persistence.
