<p class="p">All the models display biases in persistence statistics, but, with the exception of the blocking regime, we observed no systematic such bias, nor did we find a systematic improvement with resolution across all the models. For the blocking regime, all the models underestimate persistence, placing too much weight in the tail of short‚Äêlived events. This is consistent with previous studies showing that GCM's tend to underestimate persistent blocking (e.g., Anstey et al.,

 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The move to higher resolution results in all cases in the distribution shifting closer to reanalysis, implying that levels of persistence have increased for all three models. Indeed, the average persistence across the three models increases by around 1.5%, and the number of occurrences of less persistent years (probabilities lower than 80%) decreases by around 11%. This is in agreement with the recent multimodel study conducted in (Schiemann et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), which also showed an improvement in blocking persistence upon increasing the resolution. Note that in all these papers atmospheric blocking was defined in a very different way, so our results are
