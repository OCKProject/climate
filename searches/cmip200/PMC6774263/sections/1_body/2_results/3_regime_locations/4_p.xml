<p class="p">These results suggest first that there remains considerable uncertainty in any model estimate of these quantities as diagnosed from even three ensemble members and, second, that one cannot expect to see a consistent improvement in pattern correlation upon increasing resolution: The opposite may in fact be expected to happen. It is unclear to what extent sampling error is influencing the estimates: It is possible that with a much larger ensemble, one would be able to spot more robust changes. Using all 10 EC‐Earth members makes the uncertainty estimates smaller and much more uniform across the four regimes. However, the reduced uncertainty, of ±0.16 on average, still does not allow a statistically significant distinction between high and low resolution for all four regimes.</p>
