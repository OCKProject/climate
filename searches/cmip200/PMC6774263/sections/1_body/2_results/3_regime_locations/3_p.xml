<p class="p">While for the Atlantic Ridge and NAO− regimes, the spread in the pattern correlation goes down when increasing resolution; for NAO+ and Blocking, it frequently goes up. The mean correlation itself also shows no systematic improvement and is sometimes degraded when increasing resolution. This can be seen more starkly in the “All” quantities in the table, which show the pattern correlations obtained from the model regimes after concatenating all three ensemble members. While we saw in the previous section that after combining the data in this way, the sharpness notably increased with resolution, the pattern correlation tends to slightly 
 <italic class="italic">decrease</italic>, with the average decrease across all models and regimes being approximately −0.05. The average change in pattern correlation across all unconcatenated experiments and all regimes, is approximately −0.007, with a standard deviation of 0.08, indicating no significant change. Therefore, the impact is at best neutral, and more likely a slight degradation.
