<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="grl59251-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> shows the mean pattern correlation of the model clusters (across the three ensemble members) relative to ERA‚ÄêInterim, with the error given as twice the standard deviation as computed across the three entries. High pattern correlation implies the cluster centroids of the model are in approximately the same location in phase space as reanalysis and is therefore a measure of the regimes being in the correct location or not. In particular, the regime patterns will look similar to those in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59251-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> when this correlation is high. The contents of the table demonstrate that there is significant variability in this quantity, with no clear improvement across all three models upon increasing the resolution.
