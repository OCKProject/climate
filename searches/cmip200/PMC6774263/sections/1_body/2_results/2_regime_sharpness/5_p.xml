<p class="p">We note also (see Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59251-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) that the increase in sharpness upon increasing the resolution is roughly twice as large as the maximum difference in sharpness between the two reanalysis products ERA‚ÄêInterim and NCEP, with the former approximately 20% and the latter at 10%. This, combined with the fact that the increase is consistent across all three models, suggests that this improvement is statistically robust.
