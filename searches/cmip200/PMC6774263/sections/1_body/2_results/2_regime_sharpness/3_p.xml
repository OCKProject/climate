<p class="p">The four sharpness metrics for reanalysis are almost identical (approximately 97%), with the exception of that covering the period 1986–2011, where the metric is notably lower (approximately 87%). As the time period covered is shorter, it is possible that this is simply random sampling variability in a significantly clustered system. It is also possible that the extent to which regime dynamics drive the atmosphere is nonstationary, with the period 1979–1985 being particularly tightly clustered. However, since the concatenation of all three MRI experiments covering 1986–2011 have a sharpness close to 100%, we will assume that the drop in sharpness seen with NCEP is sampling variability. Therefore, a difference in sharpness of up to 10% might be expected by chance alone.</p>
