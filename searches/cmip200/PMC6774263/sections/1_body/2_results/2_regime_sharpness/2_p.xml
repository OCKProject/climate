In plot (a), the blue (red) dots/crosses/triangles associated with the ECEall/HadGEMall/MRIall labels are sharpness metrics for the relevant low‐resolution (high‐resolution) model obtained after concatenating all three ensemble members, effectively tripling the sample size compared to the reanalysis data sets. The horizontal black line shows the sharpness of ERA‐Interim over the period 1979–2010, while the black circles/crosses/triangles show the sharpness metrics for the NCEP reanalysis computed over the different time periods covered by the three models. Note that the sharpness of NCEP during the period 1979–2010 matches that of ERA‐Interim almost exactly, suggesting that this metric is well constrained. The two reanalysis data sets also produce nearly identical sharpness metrics when viewed over the two other time periods. In plot (b), we show the sharpness metrics for each individual ensemble member of the three models at low resolution (blue dots/crosses/triangles) and high resolution (red dots/crosses/triangles). The blue/red lines in these triplets indicate the mean of the three points, and the shading encloses one standard deviation.
