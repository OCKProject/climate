<p class="p">The impact of increased resolution is apparent for all three models, where sharpness increases whether looking at individual members or after concatenating all three. It can also be seen that increasing the sample size, by using more than one ensemble member, increases sharpness. This can be understood by noting that a model with weak regime structure will be more prone to producing clusters that cannot be robustly distinguished from random noise when using a small sample size. Increasing the sample size effectively filters out noise in phase space. This can be examined further by evaluating the average sharpness metric obtained after concatenating two random members from each simulation. The results are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59251-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, which summarizes the dependence of sharpness on ensemble size (i.e., sample size). It can be seen that the high‚Äêresolution models typically need twice the sample size of reanalysis data to achieve comparable regime structure, while for low resolution three times the sample size may still not suffice.
