<p class="p">All three models exhibit deficiencies in the geometric robustness of the regimes (measured with sharpness), the location of the regime centers (how similar the regime patterns are to those in reanalysis), and the persistence lifetime of regimes. Increasing the horizontal resolution leads to a notable improvement in the sharpness metric, suggesting that improvements in certain aspects of atmospheric dynamics are resulting in the atmosphere traversing phase space in a more tightly clustered fashion. Furthermore, the persistence statistics of the blocking regime did systematically improve, consistent with previous studies. However, the persistence statistics of the other three regimes, as well as the spatial pattern of all four regimes (including blocking), did not systematically improve, with some of the regimes deviating even further from reanalysis in some of the high‚Äêresolution simulations. This suggests that, while the increased horizontal resolution in these models is helping some crucial processes responsible for clustering behavior, it fails to alleviate other biases.</p>
