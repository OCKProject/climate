<p class="p">The above discussion becomes more pertinent when observing that horizontal resolution cannot by itself account for regime skill. Indeed, Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59251-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows that the low‐resolution (180 km) MRI simulations perform almost as well as the significantly higher‐resolution (25 km) HadGEM simulations. This implies that other aspects of the model, such as the model mean or small‐scale variability related to differing physics parametrisations, are likely equally important for producing robust regimes. Interestingly, MRI also has the coarsest vertical resolution of the three models, seemingly ruling this out as an important factor.
