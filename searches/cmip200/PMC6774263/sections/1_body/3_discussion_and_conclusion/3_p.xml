 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) demonstrated the importance of the mean flow in determining the precise locations of blocking events. Given the synoptic scale of the Euro‐Atlantic regimes, it is plausible that mean state biases may be important not just for the blocking regime but for all four of the Euro‐Atlantic regimes, and these biases are not always improved upon increasing horizontal resolution. Similarly, interannual variability due to global teleconnections such as ENSO, known to influence the NAO (see, e.g., Li &amp; Lau, 
 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), may change in nonobvious ways with resolution. Thus, while certain aspects of the atmospheric dynamics may be improving from the increased resolution, leading to more pronounced clustering, the exact locations of these clusters may still be subject to errors due to other biases. This may be exacerbated in situations where the higher‐resolution model has not been tuned to achieve as realistic a mean state as the lower‐resolution version (as was the case with the models considered here). A detailed examination of this speculation is, however, beyond the scope of the present study.
