<p class="p">Our results also show that the sampling variability in both the sharpness and spatial correlation metrics is large for both high‐ and low‐resolution experiments. This may be due to excessive noise in the model atmosphere, or the weak regime structure allowing the model to populate phase space too liberally: In a potential well picture of the regimes, if the wells are too shallow, the model atmosphere will not stay trapped for longer periods of time, leading to less tightly clustered data. Either way, increasing the sample size by concatenating data from multiple ensemble members can help filter out this noise. We find that the low‐resolution models appear to need three times as much data to detect a comparable regime structure as that found in reanalysis data, while the high‐resolution models, by improving the regime structure, need only twice as much data. This implies that multiple ensemble members, or a sufficiently long simulation period, are crucial for a statistically meaningful assessment of regime metrics, with changes due to resolution or other model upgrades being potentially completely invisible due to random noise.</p>
