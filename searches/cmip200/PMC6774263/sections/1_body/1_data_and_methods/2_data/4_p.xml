<p class="p">The second model is the U.K. Met Office model HadGEM3‐GA3 (Walters et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The integrations were run as part of the UPSCALE project (Mizielinski et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and cover the period 1986–2011. The low‐resolution simulations were performed on a N216 grid, corresponding to roughly 60‐km grid spacing near the equator, while the high‐resolution simulations were done on a N512 grid, corresponding to roughly 25‐km grid spacing. Both configurations use 85 levels in the vertical.
