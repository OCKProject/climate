<p class="p">The first model is EC‐Earth v3.1, an Earth system model maintained by the EC‐Earth Consortium (Hazeleger et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Its atmospheric component is based on the Integrated Forecasting System model cycle 36r4, developed by the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts. The integrations were made as part of the Climate SPHINX Project (Davini et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and covered the period 1979–2008. Ten such ensemble members were produced in the SPHINX Project: Only three were considered in the analysis in order to make the comparison across all models and resolutions as uniform as possible. Results were found to be qualitatively identical irrespective of which three ensemble members were selected, so the results presented here used the first three members. The low‐resolution simulations had a spectral truncation of TL255, or roughly 80‐km grid spacing near the equator. The high‐resolution simulations had a spectral truncation of TL511, corresponding to around 40‐km grid spacing. Both use 91 levels in the vertical. Note that the studies Dawson et al. (

 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) considered an earlier version of the same model.
