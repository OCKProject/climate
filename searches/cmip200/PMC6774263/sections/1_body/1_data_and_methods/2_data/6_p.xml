<p class="p">The primary reanalysis product used to act as our reference data set was the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts dataset ERA‐Interim (Dee et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), covering the period 1979–2011. To bolster confidence in the results, and to estimate the potential sampling variability of the metrics inherent to the real atmosphere, we also utilized the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set (Kalnay et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>), hereafter referred to as NCEP, and the Japanese 55‐year reanalysis (abbr. JRA55; see Kobayashi et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In general, the difference between the three data sets for a given metric were small, being an order of magnitude smaller than the model biases and the impacts seen from a resolution change. Because all three data sets show such close agreement, we will only present explicit values for ERA‐Interim and NCEP in tables/figures.
