<p class="p">We use model data from three models, all run in atmosphere‐only mode, covering between 25 and 31 years in the period 1979–2011. Each model produced three simulations at both a “low” and “high” resolution, where the exact meaning of low and high varies between the models. This leaves us with nine low‐resolution simulations and nine high‐resolution simulations to compare across: due to the varying nature of the resolution increase, we always group results by model, to see the relative impact in each model. We also note that the monikers “low” and “high” resolution are essentially arbitrary here and are used simply for convenience to denote the lower/higher of the two available resolutions, rather than any objective measure. The study is therefore only concerned with the effect of 
 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">increasing</styled-content> resolution, and not on the exact impact of any 
 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">particular</styled-content> resolution choice.
