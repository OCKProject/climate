<p class="p">We will focus on three metrics for assessing the models representation of regimes. First, the sharpness metric will be used as a measure of the geometric robustness of regimes. A high sharpness suggests strongly defined regimes but can be obtained with regimes that do not look like those in reality. Therefore, second, pattern correlation between the regime patterns of the models and those in reanalysis is used as a measure of how similar to reanalysis the diagnosed regimes are. Finally, we look at the level of day‐to‐day regime persistence.</p>
