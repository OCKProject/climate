<p class="p">Applying the algorithm to reanalysis data shows, as noted in Dawson et al. (
 <xref rid="grl59251-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), that four clusters are the minimum number required to produce statistically significant regimes (i.e., a sharpness exceeding 95%). For this reason, we restrict our attention to a four‚Äêregime picture, both for reanalysis and our model data. Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59251-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the spatial patterns of these four regimes in the reanalysis data, which agree well with previous studies. These patterns are generated by taking the mean across all the daily fields that are sorted into a given cluster by the algorithm.
