  <p class="p">The sharpness metric for reanalysis products and the three models. In (a), for NCEP reanalysis over the three different periods considered (black dots, crosses, and triangles), along with that computed for all low/high EC‐Earth resolution data sets concatenated (ECEall low/high, blue/red dots), all low/high HadGEM data sets concatenated (HadGEM low/high, blue/red crosses), and all low/high MRI data sets concatenated (MRIall low/high, blue/red triangles). In (b), sharpness for the same reanalysis data (black dots, crosses, and triangles), and the sharpness metric for each individual ensemble member: EC‐Earth low/high resolution (blue/red dots), HadGEM low/high resolution (blue/red crosses), and MRI low/high resolution (blue/red triangles). The mean and standard deviation are indicated by the horizontal colored line and shading, respectively. The horizontal black line in both plots shows the sharpness of ERA‐Interim over the period 1979–2010.</p>
