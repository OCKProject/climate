Analyses are provided for changes in maximum daytime temperature (TXx), minimum night-time temperature (TNn), annual maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (Rx5day) and consecutive dry days (CDD), and for six regions (

The upper and lower hinges of the box plots represent the first and third quartile. The whiskers (coloured in blue or red) extend to the highest (lowest) value that is within 1.5 times the interquartile range of the upper (lower) hinge. The central line of each box plot indicates the median value. The dashed inclined grey line on the TXx and TNn plots indicates the 1 : 1 line of equivalent changes in regional temperature extremes and global temperature. The vertical lines indicate changes at 1°C of global warming (dotted line, corresponding to present-day climate), and 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming (dashed lines).
