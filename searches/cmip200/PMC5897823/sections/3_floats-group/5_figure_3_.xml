   <xref rid="RSTA20160450C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], and from the HAPPI simulations. The changes are computed with respect to present-day climate (1°C of warming for ESR-CMIP5, respectively 2006–2015 in HAPPI). Displayed are box plots indicating the median (middle horizontal line), interquartile range (25th and 75th percentile) indicated with lower (25th percentile) and upper (75th percentile) hinges of the box, and whiskers extending to the lowest (highest) value that is within 1.5 times the interquartile range of the upper (lower) hinge (for figures including outliers, see electronic supplementary material). Analyses are provided for changes in maximum daytime temperature (TXx), minimum night-time temperature (TNn), annual maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (Rx5day) and consecutive dry days (CDD), and for six regions (

Blue background shading indicates when there is no significant different in the median or the shape between the ESR-CMIP5 and HAPPI estimates (based on Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
