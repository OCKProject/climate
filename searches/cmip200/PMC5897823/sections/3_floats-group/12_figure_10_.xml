Reduced regional impacts can be achieved both through a decrease in the global mean temperature (light blue arrow, ‘global-scale mitigation’), as well as through a reduction in the regional sensitivity of temperature extremes to global temperature changes (violet arrow, ‘regional-scale mitigation’).
