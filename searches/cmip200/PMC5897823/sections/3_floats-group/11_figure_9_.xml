   <italic class="italic">a</italic>) CEU, (
   <italic class="italic">b</italic>) CNA. Solid lines correspond to the regional average annual maximum daytime temperature (TXx) anomaly, and dashed heavy lines correspond to the global mean temperature anomaly, where all temperature anomalies are relative to 1850–1870 and units are in °C. The black line in both panels denotes the three-member control ensemble mean with the grey-shaded regions corresponding to the ensemble range. The coloured lines correspond to the three-member ensemble means of experiments modifying crop albedo by 0.02 (ALB02, cyan), 0.04 (ALB04, purple), 0.08 (ALB08, orange) or 0.1 (ALB10, red), integrating irrigation in crop areas (IRRIG, blue), and combining both irrigation and changes in albedo by 0.1 (IRRALB, green). The light dashed grey lines indicate conditions at global warming levels of 1.5°C and 2°C, respectively. (Adapted from [
