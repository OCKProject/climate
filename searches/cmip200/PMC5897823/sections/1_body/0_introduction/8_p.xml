<p class="p">The article is structured as follows: §2 describes the methods and data used in this article. Then, §3 compares projected changes in regional extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C using the ESR approach with results from the HAPPI simulations, and §4 identifies in which regions significant differences between changes in climate extremes can be found at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming in the two sets of estimates. Section 5 provides more background on the recent literature highlighting the role of land–climate interactions and land forcing on regional projections in low-emissions scenarios, and §6 provides an overview of changes in land use in newly developed low-emissions scenarios from state-of-the-art IAM models. Finally, §7 provides a summary of the highlighted results and the main conclusions of this article.</p>
