<p class="p">Despite their attractive simplicity and consistency, empirical sampling analyses based on transient simulations may not be representative of projections with a full climate stabilization at lower levels of warming. Hence, while they have received substantial attention in the recent literature [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], it is important to evaluate their level of consistency with other more in-depth procedures relying on actual modelling of climate conditions at 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming. This is particularly relevant in the context of the upcoming IPCC special report on 1.5°C of warming (hereafter referred to as IPCC SR15), which will provide for the first time an assessment of changes in climate impacts at 1.5°C of global warming, in comparison with 2°C and higher levels of warming (
