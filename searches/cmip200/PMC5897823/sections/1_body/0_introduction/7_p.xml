<p class="p">As a consequence of the role of regional processes in affecting TCRreg, biogeophysical land-use forcing, e.g. through irrigation or changes in land surface albedo associated with changes in land cover or land management, is found to be a key driver of changes in regional climate extremes, especially in low-emissions scenarios [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. This is of key relevance for the development of climate change scenarios, since land-use changes (e.g. associated with changes in agricultural production, reforestation/afforestation, or the cultivation of bioenergy crops, in some case with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)) are a major component of integrated assessment models (IAMs) that underlie the derivation of these scenarios [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. However, these changes in land use are only considered from the perspective of carbon cycle impacts in IAM models, and do not encompass the associated biogeophysical feedbacks (see also [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]). As highlighted in this article, the integration of these biogeophysical feedbacks in future IAM developments would be critical to explore the full dimension of low-emissions scenarios. We illustrate this need by displaying the projected change in land use associated with well-established IAM models for newly developed low-emissions scenarios.
