<p class="p">Another main issue addressed in the present article is the role of land–climate interactions and land-use changes for low-emissions scenarios, with a focus on changes in temperature extremes. As demonstrated hereafter, recent publications have shown that, in several land regions, the warming in temperature extremes is much higher than the corresponding warming in the global mean temperature [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. A main mechanism underlying this feature in mid-latitude regions is related to soil moisture–temperature feedbacks, namely additional warming incurred by lack of evaporative cooling in regions projected to be affected by increased drying [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. This implies that some of the regional response of temperature extremes, which may be assessed as a ‘regional transient climate response’ (TCRreg), can be more strongly affected by regional processes than by the global mean temperature transient climate response (generally referred to as TCR, hereafter expressed as TCRglob).
