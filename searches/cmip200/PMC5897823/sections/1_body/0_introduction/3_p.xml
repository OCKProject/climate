<p class="p">As a consequence, and to provide assessments of changes in climate at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, recent assessments have used alternative approaches to classical Coupled Modelling Intercomparison Project (CMIP) [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] experiments to assess changes in regional climate, extremes and impacts at those warming levels [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. An approach that has been used extensively consists of an empirical sampling analysis, whereby regional patterns in relevant variables are assessed in available climate model simulations at given global warming levels over an averaging time window [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. When using gradual sampling over different levels of global warming, this approach can be used to derive an empirical scaling relationship (hereafter referred to as ESR) between a given quantity of interest (e.g. changes in an extreme index in a given region) and global mean temperature warming [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160450F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref> and §2). Analyses have shown that derived ESRs are often linear for multi-model averages of a range of extreme indices in the ensemble simulations of the fifth phase of the CMIP experiment (CMIP5) and mostly independent of the considered emissions scenarios [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] (see, however, §2 for some exceptions). In the case of regional temperature means and extremes (on land), the changes are found to be generally much larger than for the global mean temperature, in some cases with up to 1.5 to 3 times larger warming [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. This behaviour is due to several mechanisms, among others to land–atmosphere interactions, as highlighted hereafter.
