<p class="p">To evaluate changes at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming in conditions closer to climate equilibrium (i.e. when the sea surface temperatures are fixed to conditions associated with these respective warming levels), as well as to allow for high sampling of internal climate variability, a new model intercomparison experiment called ‘Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts’ (HAPPI) was initiated [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The HAPPI experimental set-up consists of time slice experiments with forced sea surface temperatures (SSTs) corresponding either to the present day or to future conditions at 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming, derived from CMIP5 simulations associated with RCP2.6 and (for 2°C only) RCP4.5 scenarios [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. We will evaluate the level of consistency between the ESR approach and the HAPPI experiment for the derivation of changes in temperature and precipitation extremes at different levels of global warming.
