<p class="p">The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to hold the average global warming compared to pre-industrial levels to ‘well below 2°C’, and ‘to pursue efforts’ to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels [

Their implications for regional impacts remain in part uncertain, mostly because past assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) generally focused on high-emissions rather than low-emissions scenarios [

For instance, of the four emissions pathways considered within the Working Group I Contribution to the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5), only one ‘representative climate pathway’ (RCP2.6) included a relatively high probability of climate stabilization below 2°C by 2100 [
