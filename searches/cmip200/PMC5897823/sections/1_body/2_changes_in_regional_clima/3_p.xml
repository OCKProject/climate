<p class="p">Despite large differences in the procedures underlying the ESR-CMIP5 estimates and HAPPI simulations, analyses reveal that the results based on these two approaches are overall surprisingly consistent (figures

A comparison of the median and shape of the distributions by means of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test shows that, in the majority of comparisons (for different indices and regions), the distributions from the ESR approach are not significantly different from the ones of the HAPPI simulationsâ€”although there are a few exceptions. This conclusion is also confirmed when displaying the full ESR relationships with superimposed results from the HAPPI simulations (
