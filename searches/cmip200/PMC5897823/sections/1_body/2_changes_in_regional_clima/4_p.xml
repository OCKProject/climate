<p class="p">The results are overall not qualitatively different when considering other SREX regions (see electronic supplementary material). Nonetheless, some indices in a few regions display substantial differences (e.g. Rx5day in EAS and CAM, TNn in WAS, TXx in ALA). In addition, there seems to be a slight tendency for the ESR-CMIP5 estimates to display a broader spread (interquartile range) than the HAPPI estimates. This may reflect the fact that the ESR-CMIP5 estimates are based on a larger number of ESMs (§§2a and 2b), and also that the HAPPI set-up does not take into account uncertainty of climate changes in the oceans, since it prescribes a uniform change in SSTs compared to the considered present-day decade.</p>
