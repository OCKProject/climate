<p class="p">These results also suggest that differences in land-use or aerosol forcing in the RCP scenarios used in the CMIP5 simulations overall did not strongly affect their associated ESR behaviour for temperature and precipitation extremes [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In the case of land-use forcing, this might reflect the lack of diversity in regional forcing options considered in the RCP scenarios, as highlighted hereafter. With respect to aerosols, for regions with very high current aerosol loadings, recent studies suggest that the effects of aerosol mitigation on regional extremes could nonetheless be comparable to the effects of a 0.5°C global temperature difference [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. It should furthermore be noted that mean precipitation projections also exhibit a scenario dependence in the RCP ensemble [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], and that the time dimension can be relevant for variables with large inertia (e.g. sea-level rise [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]). Despite these caveats, the fact that the ESR approach appears to emulate well the regional responses of extremes for different global temperature levels—almost independently of the scenario pathway and time frame within the twenty-first century—makes it attractive for investigating low-emissions scenarios based on existing simulations for higher-emissions pathways.
