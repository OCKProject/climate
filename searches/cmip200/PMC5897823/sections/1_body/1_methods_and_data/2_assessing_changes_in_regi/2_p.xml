<p class="p">The ESR approach consists of relating changes in regional climate variables to the change in the global mean temperature, by using an empirical sampling based on transient climate simulations (

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The ESR approach is related to the ‘time sampling approach’ described in James

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], except that instead of focusing on single time slices, it derives a relationship of the response for a range of global temperature levels. This yields an ‘empirical’ pattern scaling. Compared to the traditional pattern scaling literature [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], it does not rely on any assumption regarding dependence (e.g. linearity).
