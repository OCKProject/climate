 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] for more details and links to the data). The ESR-CMIP5 estimates are based on simulations from 26 Earth system models (ESMs) with interactive ocean including up to 10 ensembles per model. 
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> provides the list of analysed models. We compare these estimates to results from the HAPPI experiment (see ยง2b). The analysed climate extreme indices are described in ยง2c.
