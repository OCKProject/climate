 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The considered changes in land use are generally related to changes in agricultural area for food production, as well as to changes related to climate mitigation through biofuel production or reforestation and afforestation. Many deep mitigation scenarios rely strongly on the use of BECCS for negative emissions.
