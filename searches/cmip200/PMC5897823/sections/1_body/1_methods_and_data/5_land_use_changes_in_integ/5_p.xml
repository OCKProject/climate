 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], the new set of IAM scenarios explicitly separates the role of climate policy and other socio-economic drivers (SSPs), including quantifications of five different socio-economic futures that can be paired with multiple radiative forcing targets. Such a framework enables a more comprehensive view on how land use may evolve and the associated impacts. Moreover, each scenario was quantified by multiple IAMs, unlike the RCPs. As a result, we can examine the uncertainties surrounding the land-use patterns of different combination of SSPs and radiative forcing targets.
