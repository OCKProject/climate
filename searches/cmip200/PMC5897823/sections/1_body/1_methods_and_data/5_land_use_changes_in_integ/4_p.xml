<p class="p">We consider four state-of-the-art IAMs: GCAM [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], MESSAGE-GLOBIOM [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], IMAGE [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and REMIND-MAgPIE [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The reader is referred to the respective publications for more background on each model. Land-cover classes are nearly identical among these models and only minor reassignments had to be applied to have joint classes for the comparisons (
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450TB3" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 3</xref>). For each of the IAMs, we show the instantaneous land-cover state (expressed as land-cover fractions) for a particular (common) year in the future projections after remapping the model output to a common regular 0.5Â° grid, or differences of these datasets between considered time frames.
