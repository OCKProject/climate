<p class="p">We note that the HAPPI results reflect changes with respect to present-day conditions and do not include simulations for the pre-industrial time period, while the ESR-CMIP5 estimates (§2a) can be derived for different periods, including pre-industrial conditions (see 
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450TB2" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 2</xref> for an overview). For this reason, the main comparisons between the ESR-CMIP5 and HAPPI estimates are performed with respect to present-day conditions (see figures in §3). However, to also relate some of the results to the 1.5°C and 2°C global warming targets (which are defined with respect to pre-industrial and not present-day climate), we perform the following conversion. In analyses investigating responses as a function of the overall global mean warming since the pre-industrial period (see figure in §4), we further add the ESR-based differences of the indices between present-day and pre-industrial warming levels, assuming a global mean temperature difference of 1°C, to the HAPPI anomalies defined with respect to the present day.
