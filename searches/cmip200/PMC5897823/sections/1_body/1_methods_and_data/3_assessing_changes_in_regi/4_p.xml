<p class="p">The HAPPI estimates of changes in extremes for the considered climate conditions are derived from simulations conducted with five models with ensembles in the range of 100–500 members each, but we only consider 100 members per model here for consistency across models. The considered extreme indices (§2c) were calculated for the first 100 ensemble members (#1 to #100) of the following models: CanAM4, CAM4, ECHAM6-3-LR, MIROC5 and NorESM1-happi. For each of the HAPPI models and the two experiments considered (1.5°C relative to pre-industrial and 2°C relative to pre-industrial), we compute regionally averaged differences of the indices (scenario period – reference period, consisting of 10 years of data per ensemble member).</p>
