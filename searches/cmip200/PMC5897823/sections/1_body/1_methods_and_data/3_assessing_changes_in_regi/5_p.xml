<p class="p">An advantage of the HAPPI simulations compared to ESR-CMIP5 analyses based on transient climate simulations is that they assess climate conditions that are closer to climate equilibrium for the different considered temperature levels. Indeed, in the HAPPI experiments, the SSTs and sea ice are fixed and prescribed based on simulations reaching lower warming levels by the end of the twenty-first century (nonetheless, because of the used set-up, these are obviously not consistent with conditions at climate equilibrium after several millennia). On the other hand, the HAPPI estimates rely on a smaller number of ESMs, and do not account for spread in oceanic conditions. Given these various differences, it is important to assess if analyses based on the HAPPI framework would result in different conclusions with respect to changes in regional climate and extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C global mean temperature levels when compared with analyses based on the ESR approach applied to transient CMIP5 experiments.</p>
