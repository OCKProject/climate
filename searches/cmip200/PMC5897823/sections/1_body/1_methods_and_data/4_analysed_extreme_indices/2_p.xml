<p class="p">In the analyses, we use extreme indices processed using well-established definitions and procedures [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. We focus on four indices, namely the annual maximum daytime temperature (TXx), the annual minimum night-time temperature (TNn), the annual maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (Rx5day) and the consecutive dry days (CDD). TXx and TNn quantify temperature extremes, Rx5day is a measure for long-lasting heavy precipitation and CDD is a measure of dryness.
