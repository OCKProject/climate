 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160450F9" class="xref">figure 9</xref>), which assessed the impact of conceptual land-use scenarios in global climate model projections (computed with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2 [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]). The experiments include seven configurations consisting of a control (CTL) with no land-use modifications, four experiments with different levels of crop albedo enhancement, +0.02, +0.04, +0.08 and +0.10 (denoted as ALB02, ALB04, ALB08 and ALB10, respectively), one experiment with irrigation enabled (IRRIG), and finally one experiment with both crop albedo enhancement of +0.10 and irrigation enabled (IRRALB) to evaluate the level of complementarity between the two modifications. The crop albedo modifications are only applied when the leaf area index is non-zero, and only to the canopy albedo and not the soil albedo. Such increases in cropland albedo could be induced by the (possibly combined) application of conservation agriculture (no-till farming), the implementation of more light-reflective crops and other land-use management practices, whereby an increase of 0.1 represents an upper bound [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The irrigation is applied to the entire crop fraction but only when crops are the dominant vegetation cover within the given grid cell and when the conditions for triggering irrigation (i.e. growing season and water stress) are met. The experiments remain highly idealized because the respective modifications are applied globally to the whole crop area. Nonetheless, they assess a potential upper bound for the impact resulting from land-use modifications in a state-of-the-art ESM.
