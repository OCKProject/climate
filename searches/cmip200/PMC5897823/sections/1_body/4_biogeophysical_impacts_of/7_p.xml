<p class="p">This has important implications for climate projections and IAM scenarios. First, it implies that processes that affect the global transient climate response (TCRglob), i.e. the change in global mean temperature, are different from those affecting the regional response of extremes (TCRreg). Second, for low-emissions scenarios, the effects of soil moisture feedbacks can have larger implications for regional changes in temperature extremes than a change in the global mean temperature of

This means that the minimization of regional impacts requires the consideration of regional feedbacks from land processes, in particular related to water availability. This is particularly critical, since the regions displaying strong soil moisture–temperature feedbacks include many densely populated regions in North America, Europe and Asia [
