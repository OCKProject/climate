<p class="p">The important role of regional processes in mitigation is further illustrated in the schematic displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160450F10" class="xref">figure 10</xref>, showing, for example, that changes in hot temperature extremes in the Mediterranean region can be decreased not only through a mitigation of the global temperature warming (light blue arrow), but also through a decrease of the regional sensitivity of extremes to global warming (‘regional-scale mitigation’, violet arrow).
