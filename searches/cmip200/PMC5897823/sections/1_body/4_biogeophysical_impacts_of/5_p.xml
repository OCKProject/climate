 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] have analysed the role of soil moisture–temperature feedbacks for the relationship of temperature extremes with changes in global mean temperature derived using the ESR approach. Thereby, they used simulations from the CMIP5 – Global Land–Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (GLACE-CMIP5) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160450F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>). It displays ESR relationships for changes in the annual maximum daytime temperature (TXx) as a function of changes in global mean temperature derived from two sets of multi-model simulations: control (CTL) simulations, which correspond to the standard CMIP5 simulations, and modified experiments with prescribed twentieth-century soil moisture (SM20c).
