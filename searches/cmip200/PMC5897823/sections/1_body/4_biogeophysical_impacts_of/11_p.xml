<p class="p">We note that current ESMs generally do not integrate irrigation in projections, while the land-use changes simulated by IAMs imply large increases in cropland area (see ยง6), and therefore also of irrigation. Hence, especially the role of irrigation and its possible feedbacks to regional climate is likely to be particularly important. In addition, the required water amounts implied by some of the cropland expansions could exceed sustainability limits and would need to be carefully evaluated [
