 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]), soil moisture variability directly affects evapotranspiration, and thus also the latent and sensible heat fluxes. As a consequence, time periods with high soil moisture limitation, e.g. related to seasonal or occasional drought occurrence, display a high increase in air temperature. This mechanism has been shown to play an important role for the occurrence of hot extremes in both present and future climate [
