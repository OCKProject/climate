 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160450F6" class="xref">figure 6</xref>), the CESM simulations including irrigation (and thus reduced soil moisture limitation) over all of the cropland area display a much reduced warming (blue line). We note that changes in albedo are also found to have some non-negligible effect on hot extremes, in particular for albedo increases of 0.1, consistent with other analyses [
