<p class="p">These analyses reveal some intriguing findings. In many mid-latitude regions found to display a particularly large warming of hot extremes [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], the amplified warming disappears when assessing simulations without soil moisture modifications (

This suggests that much of the amplified warming of hot extremes in transitional climate regions is due to soil moisture feedbacks, and that, if these effects are removed, warming in these regions would be closer to the global mean temperature warming.
