<p class="p">Despite their lack of consideration in the development of standard socio-economic pathways, biogeophysical effects of land use and land processes on climate are substantial, in particular at regional scale. We highlight hereafter recent evidence showing the role of regional landâ€“climate feedbacks and land forcing in low-emissions scenarios, which could mean that two scenarios identified as leading to the same greenhouse gas-related forcing in 2100 could still result in very different regional climate impacts.</p>
