<p class="p">Overall, the analyses show that each model has distinctive characteristics with respect to land-use allocation and that the inter-IAM spread is substantial, both with respect to static maps, as well as with respect to changes over the course of the twenty-first century. Some of these differences reflect the fact that global land allocation for and the distribution of dedicated bioenergy plantations (with or without combination with carbon capture and storage (CCS)) in IAMs for a fixed level of carbon sequestration by 2050 or 2100 highly depends on assumptions being made on socio-economic, climate and environmental policy as well as technological developments [
