<p class="p">These differences in IAMs for resulting LUCs corresponding to the same SSP and climate scenarios reveal an additional dimension of uncertainty that has not been considered in multi-model projections so far. Indeed, biogeophysical processes associated with the respective land uses may lead to very different regional climate conditions if forest cover is, for instance, included instead of crops or grassland (e.g. [

In addition, a recent ESM multi-model study using the IMAGE low-emissions scenarios suggests that, even for the same IAM, the consideration of the land-use spread associated with different SSP scenarios may have a higher impact on climate than a difference of 0.5°C of global warming for some models and regions [
