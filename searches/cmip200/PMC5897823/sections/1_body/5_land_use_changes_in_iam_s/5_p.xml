<p class="p">It is important to consider the LUC patterns of the IAMs individually, since there are substantial differences between IAMs (see also 
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450TB4" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 4</xref>). While all IAMs display some decreases in grassland area, these are much less pronounced for the IMAGE SSP2 scenario, and in part also the REMIND-MAgPIE scenarios. The changes in forest area are very different in the four considered IAMs, with some widespread increases in GCAM and MESSAGE-GLOBIOM, but no changes in REMIND-MAgPIE, and both smaller increases (SSP1) and some decreases (SSP2) in IMAGE. The regional patterns of changes in cropland are also extremely different in the IAMs. For instance, GCAM simulates large increases in cropland extent in North America, including in the dry western part of the USA, while the other three models do not display any increase in cropland in the latter region.
