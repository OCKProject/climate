<p class="p">Dominant features of LUCs in the four IAMs can be identified, as well as substantial variations between IAMs. Overall, all IAMs display substantial decreases in grassland area, which is replaced by cropland and/or forest cover (and in some cases also other land uses). The IAMs differ substantially in how they allocate the forest and cropland areas, with some cropland areas being replaced by forest or vice versa. These differences also depend strongly on the considered SSP scenario, with SSP1 favouring increases in forest cover, and SSP2 increases in cropland.</p>
