<p class="p">Current ESMs display a substantial spread in responses to biogeophysical impacts from land use [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], as well as some systematic biases [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Hence the magnitude and direction of LUCs under low-emissions scenarios, as well as the resulting responses in ESMs, remain a large source of uncertainty, which could substantially affect the identification of desirable mitigation and adaptation pathways. Some aspects of this question will also be addressed in an upcoming CMIP6 experiment, the ‘Land Use Model Intercomparison Project’ (LUMIP) [
