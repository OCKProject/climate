<p class="p">To further interpret this spread in the IAM land-use maps, we also consider the actual 2100 maps of land-cover fractions for the single IAMs in the electronic supplementary material (figures S15–S18). The maximum range in land fraction and the respective IAM models that present the highest or lowest fraction for a given land class in each location for the considered SSP and global warming scenarios by 2100 are also displayed (electronic supplementary material, figures S19–S21). Some further systematic differences are found. For instance, the IMAGE model tends to include more forest cover in high latitudes, independently of the considered scenario. GLOBIOM on the other hand includes very little grassland.</p>
