 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] based on ESR-CMIP5 analyses, differences are generally found to be significant for temperature extremes (for TXx and TNn, in all regions). This is also the case for the results of the HAPPI simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20160450F7" class="xref">figure 7</xref>), and also consistent with recent analyses of health-related heat extremes [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Results are more inconsistent for water cycle extremes, as also previously highlighted [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, it is interesting to note that the analyses based on the HAPPI simulations seem to show more frequently significant changes between the two warming levels, also for the water cycle extremes. This could be due to the fact that the larger number of ensemble members per model allows for more robust statistics. On the other hand, it is also possible that the HAPPI-based ensemble underestimates inter-model uncertainty due to the smaller number of considered climate models (five) compared to those used in the ESR-CMIP5 estimates (26) and the prescribed SST conditions (see also previous section). This could be in particular the case for the estimates of changes in CDD, which are in part inconsistent (also in terms of sign) between the ESR-CMIP5 and HAPPI estimates (figures
