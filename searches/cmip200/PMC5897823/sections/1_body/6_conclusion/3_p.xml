<p class="p">New analyses comparing ESR-derived estimates of changes in extremes at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming with output from simulations of the HAPPI multi-model experiment reveal that the two approaches yield similar overall results. This suggests that the transient response of regional climate extremes to global warming anomalies is fairly consistent with that of responses at semi-equilibrium, when the sea surface temperatures (and sea ice extent) are fixed to conditions associated with these respective warming levels in projections for the end of the twenty-first century.</p>
