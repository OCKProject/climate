<p class="p">We further highlight that the regional amplification of hot extremes identified in many land regions with transitional conditions between dry and wet climates [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] can be related to soil moisture feedbacks [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. As a consequence, any regional biogeophysical modifications of land processes, e.g. through land-use changes affecting land-cover type or land management—and thereby albedo or moisture fluxes—are found to strongly affect these regional changes in climate extremes, especially for low-emissions scenarios [
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. This result is critical for the development of future climate projections and IAM scenarios, since biogeophysical feedbacks of simulated changes in land use are not considered in the development of IAM models and could modify the identified optimal mitigation pathways, in particular for low-emissions scenarios.
