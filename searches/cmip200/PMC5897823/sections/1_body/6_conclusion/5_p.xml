<p class="p">The identified strong effect of land-based forcing on regional extremes may also question the finding that the ESR estimates of the sensitivity of changes in regional extremes to changes in global warming appears mostly independent of the considered emissions scenario in CMIP5 experiments [

 <xref rid="RSTA20160450C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], but it may also reflect a lack of diversity in the regional details of the considered emissions scenarios within CMIP5. It is likely that more diverse projections which would consider the full (global and regional) spread of possible land-use scenarios resulting from IAMs and include biogeophysical effects of these land-use conditions would lead to a larger spread of ESR responses between the considered scenarios. A particularly important aspect is the potential role of irrigation, which is not integrated in present-day ESMs but could strongly affect temperature means and extremes in both present and future climate [
