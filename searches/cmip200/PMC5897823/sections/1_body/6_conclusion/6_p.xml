<p class="p">In conclusion, we find that the somewhat 
 <italic class="italic">ad hoc</italic> ESR procedures developed to assess changes in climate at 1.5°C versus 2°C and higher levels of warming are fairly robust when compared with actual simulations prescribing ocean temperature forcing consistent with these warming levels. This is a helpful result in view of the upcoming IPCC SR15 report, which was developed under a high time constraint and for which dedicated model experiments were mostly non-existent at the time of writing. However, we also highlight that the role of biogeophysical land-based forcing for regional changes in climate extremes and impacts is not accounted for in the development of reference IAM-based scenarios to date, nor in the majority of modelling experiments assessing changes in climate at 1.5°C versus higher levels of warming. Future investigations will be needed to better quantify the impact of changes in land use for regional projections in low-emissions scenarios and the extent to which they affect derived sustainable development pathways.
