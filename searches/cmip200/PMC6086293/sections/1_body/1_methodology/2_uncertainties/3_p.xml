<p class="p">Furthermore, we use five parameters in the two-box temperature module to capture the behavior of several CMIP3 AOGCMs (i.e., CCCMA_CGCM3_1_T47, CNRM_CM3, CSIRO_MK3_0, GFDL_CM2_0, GFDL_CM2_1, GISS_MODEL_E_H, GISS_MODEL_E_R, IAP_FGOALS1_0_G, INMCM3_0, IPSL_CM4, MEDIUM_CMIP3_ECS3, MIROC3_2_HIRES, MIROC3_2_MEDRES, MIUB_ECHO_G, MPI_ECHAM5, MRI_CGCM2_3_2A, NCAR_CCSM3_0, NCAR_PCM1, UKMO_HADCM3, and UKMO_HADGEM1). We adopt the estimates of climate sensitivity and the forcing associated with CO

The calibrated temperature results shown in Figure S2 indicate that the results obtained using MAGICC6.0 and SCM4OPT are similar; however, the uncertainty ranges obtained using the latter model are slightly larger. These larger uncertainty ranges are partly propagated from the carbon cycle and result partly from the climate system.
