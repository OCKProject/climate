<p class="p">Our analysis accounts for the uncertainties in a total of 35 key physical and biological parameters that represent the inter-model differences among 10 C
 <sup class="sup">4</sup>MIP carbon cycle models and 20 CMIP3 AOGCMs (Tables S1â€“S4). Broadly, our approach is as follows. For processes that are consistent with MAGICC6, we adopt the values of the associated parameters estimated for MAGICC6 to emulate the inter-model comparison results. On the other hand, for processes that are simplified from MAGICC6, we tune the associated parameters to provide a best fit to the emulation results from MAGICC6.
