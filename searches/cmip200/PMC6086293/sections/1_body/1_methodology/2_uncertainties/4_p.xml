<p class="p">Compared to the DICE model or other optimization IAMs, such as FUND and PAGE, SCM4OPT explicitly considers both mitigation and adaptation climate options with active feedbacks from climate change using the state-of-the-art scenario assumptions and covers a full suite of anthropogenic emissions that are of great importance for assessing low climate targets with stabilization (Su et al.

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations are larger than the results obtained using MAGICC 6.0, because the treatments of some processes are simplified to enable the complex evolution of the carbon cycle to be incorporated into the optimization procedure used in the IAM, and simplified processes also exist in the climate module. We calibrate the temperature output to be consistent with the results obtained using MAGICC 6.0; thus, the climate change-related uncertainties can be minimized.
