<p class="p">SCM4OPT consists of a socioeconomic module and a simple climate module (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The socioeconomic module is calibrated to represent the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 2 (SSP2) scenario (Fujimori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>, Su et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2017</xref>). We select the Asia–Pacific Integrated Assessment/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) (Fujimori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">b</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>), which is one of the IAMs that can implement the SSPs, for use in our working team. We use this model to generate the SSP2 assumptions based on the SSP narratives to ensure model consistency with our earlier study (Su et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2017</xref>), although AIM/CGE was used to produce the marker scenario of SSP3. As in the DICE-2013R model (Nordhaus and Sztorc 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>; Nordhaus 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2013</xref>), the global gross production output is defined using a constant-returns-to-scale Cobb–Douglas production function (Cobb and Douglas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">1928</xref>; Douglas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">1976</xref>), considering capital, population, and Hicks-neutral technological change (Hicks 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">1966</xref>). The gross output is, therefore, distributed into GDP, adaptation costs, mitigation costs, and residual damages that result from feedbacks on climate change. We maximize the total social welfare, a discounted sum of the utility of per capita consumption, weighted by population. The approach used here is based on the Ramsey economic growth model (Ramsey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">1928</xref>). We endogenously account for the emission abatements of not only industrial CO
 <sub class="sub">2,</sub> but also land-use CO

 </sub>, black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) through the use of individual marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves. The abatement levels of non-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> components are defined as a power function of control levels of industrial CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions that is based on a sensitivity analysis of the SSP2 scenario (Su et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2017</xref>). Therefore, the abatement costs and the carbon prices are attributed only to reductions in industrial CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in this study. Negative CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions from industrial sources can be realized through carbon capture and storage (CCS). The land-use emissions considered here include CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions from land use and land-use changes, including pasture conversion, deforestation, afforestation, reforestation, and soil management (Fujimori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>, Su et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2017</xref>). The net land-use emissions are determined by the base case emissions subtracting the abated amount that relates to the reduction level of industrial CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions [see Eqs. (4–5) in the Supporting Information of Su et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2017</xref>)]. The resulting net emissions are fed into the simple climate module to calculate the radiative forcing and the global mean temperature (GMT) change relative to pre-industrial levels. The simple climate module is largely consistent with MAGICC 6.0 (Meinshausen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2011a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">b</xref>), except for a few processes that are simplified in SCM4OPT. For instance, we use a two-box temperature module to estimate the GMT, instead of the upwelling-diffusion climate model used in MAGICC 6.0. Therefore, the ocean heat uptake is not explicitly considered in this study. We estimate the climate change damages using a damage function related to the GMT increase and consider both mitigation and adaptation options:
