 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2017</xref>). We explore three cases. (1) in BaseC, no climate policy is implemented in the future; (2) in 20DEG, the temperature increase is kept below 2 °C; and (3) in 15DEG, the temperature increase is kept below 1.5 °C. In this analysis, we assume that the temperature targets are met by the end of this century.
