<p class="p">Our uncertainty analysis is conducted based on C

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2011a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">b</xref>). A newer model inter-comparison, CMIP5, was released in 2013 (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2011</xref>) for the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC. It is reported that the mean values and ranges of the GMT changes simulated by the CMIP5 and CMIP3 models are generally consistent [Box TS.6 of IPCC (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2013</xref>)]. Hence, using the CMIP5 models would not substantially affect our conclusions.
