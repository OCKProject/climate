<p class="p">We evaluate 200 parameter combinations for each case and calculate the quantiles corresponding to the given probabilities for individual years. We follow the intervals used in the IPCC definition of likelihood (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2007</xref>). Specifically, the (1) median indicates the median of the probability distribution; (2) likely indicates a 66% probability or the percentile range of 17–83%; and (3) extremely likely indicates a 95% probability or the percentile range of 2.5–97.5%. Throughout this paper, the ranges indicated in the text are likely ranges, unless noted otherwise.
