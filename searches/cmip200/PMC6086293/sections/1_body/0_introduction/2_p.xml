<p class="p">In this study, we employ the simple climate model for optimization (SCM4OPT) (Fujimori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2016</xref>, Su et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2017</xref>), an IAM that considers a full suite of greenhouse gases, pollutants, and aerosols. Here, we probe the uncertainties arising from various physical and biogeochemical processes, using sets of parameter estimates obtained from model emulations. As a note of caution, this analysis does not address potentially larger uncertainties that can be seen from observational constraints based on inversion approaches (Tanaka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2009</xref>; Bodman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2013</xref>). We consider only uncertainties that result from physical climate processes and hold the socioeconomic parameters constant. The objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate emission pathways that limit the temperature increase to below 2 °C or 1.5 °C after 2100 while considering several sources of climate-related uncertainties and (2) to explore how such climate-related uncertainties are translated into uncertainties in socioeconomic quantities, such as carbon prices, mitigation costs, adaptation costs, and GDP losses.
