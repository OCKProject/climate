<p class="p">The Paris Agreement aims to hold the global temperature rise in this century to well below 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C. Integrated assessment models (IAMs), which account for the interactions among the socioeconomic and physical aspects of climate change, are used to explore emission pathways for achieving climate change targets. Considerable uncertainties surround IAMs regarding both socioeconomics and climate science (Rotmans and van Asselt

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2015</xref>). In terms of these socioeconomic aspects, recent IAM studies have investigated uncertainties stemming from socioeconomic impacts, technological change, and discount rates (Rotmans and van Asselt

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, the focus is usually placed on limited sources of uncertainty in the physical climate aspects. For instance, three IAMs that are widely used to evaluate the social cost of carbon, DICE (Nordhaus and Sztorc

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2011</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2013</xref>) address primarily the uncertainty in (equilibrium) climate sensitivity. Other sources of uncertainty, including those arising from the carbon cycle and the effects of aerosols, are not considered explicitly in these IAMs.
