<p class="p">The results indicate that climate-related uncertainties have large impacts on economic assessments of climate change. First, the upper-end carbon prices are approximately quadruple those at the lower ends for both the 2 and 1.5 °C climate targets in the second half of this century. Second, moderate GDP losses occur as a result of achieving the climate targets. However, the upper-end GDP losses are also double those of the lower end for the 2 °C target, whereas the corresponding factor is 3 for the 1.5 °C target in the same period. Third, both the carbon prices and the GDP losses are reduced, and their ranges become relatively small in 2100 compared to earlier periods, because we assume adaptation options to address climate change. Thus, the total costs of climate change can be reduced eventually, although part of the expense must be devoted to adaptation strategies. Finally, the aggregated costs obtained in this study for the 1.5 °C case are

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2015</xref>) for achieving the 1.5 °C-consistent scenario and the medium 2 °C scenario; this difference is likely due to the assumption of moderate future emissions (i.e., the use of the SSP2) and the treatment of adaptation measures. In addition, the GDP losses also show narrower ranges with relatively lower levels compared to the corresponding idealized scenarios implemented for AR5; in Fig. 6.21 in IPCC (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-eq scenarios are associated with GDP losses of approximately 4–10% in 2100. Again, the moderate future emissions and the introduction of adaptation may reduce the GDP losses in our study, whereas considering both socioeconomic and climate-related uncertainties may widen the range of uncertainty for the AR5 scenarios.
