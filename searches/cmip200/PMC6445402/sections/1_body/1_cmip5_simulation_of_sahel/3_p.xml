 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2003</xref>)): twentieth century (1900–1999) time series are depicted on the left-hand side and twenty-first century (2006–2099) time series on the right-hand side. To facilitate comparison, we standardize all the time series: each model’s ensemble mean, in the thin green lines, is standardized by its own mean and standard deviation. The multi-model mean, in the thick yellow line, is first computed as the average of the original (non-standardized) single-model ensemble mean precipitation time series and then standardized. The reason for proceeding in this order is that we wish to characterize the externally forced component of Sahel rainfall. Since the models’ ability to capture the relevant physical processes varies, if we computed the multi-model mean on the standardized single-model ensemble means, we would give all models, “good” and “bad,” equal weight. Conversely, if the multi-model mean is taken on rainfall anomalies, the internal variability that dominates models that do not respond to external forcing is weighted out, because by definition it does not have a preferred temporal sequencing. This allows the temporally coherent response to external forcing to emerge. For a comparison to non-standardized time series, i.e., Sahel rainfall anomalies in units of mm/day, the reader is referred to Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2013</xref>): there it can be seen that (i) the amplitude of variations in the multi-model mean is smaller than that in observations, as expected, given that the single real-world realization expresses the combination of internal variability and externally forced change. However, (ii) the observed evolution falls within the envelope defined by individual ensemble member simulations. The thick red line in the left panel of our Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> represents observed Sahel precipitation (Becker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013</xref>). Its correlation with the multi-model mean is 0.37 and is corroborated by a visible qualitative match: the first half of the century is characterized by variations around the mean, and is followed by a precipitous decline that lasts until the mid-1980s, and a partial recovery since. Standardization, because it normalizes the amplitude of variation, makes it possible to clearly discern the minimum in the multi-model mean, which occurs in 1982 and coincides with the first of three driest consecutive years in observations, 1982–1984, and with the eruption of El Chichón (Robock and Liu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">1994</xref>). In contrast, the twenty-first century multi-model mean (top, right panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) shows an upward trend, albeit with periods characterized by interannual-to-decadal variations that mask the trend, most notably at the end of the century.
