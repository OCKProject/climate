<p id="Par7" class="p">We restrict our analysis to 29 models participating in CMIP5, because only these have all the thermodynamic and dynamical variables necessary to evaluate their moisture budget (the subject of a parallel study). The models used are named in the tables in Supplementary Material. We focus on ensemble means, because we are interested in attribution of observed twentieth century Sahel rainfall variability, i.e., in describing its externally forced component, whether the external forcing is natural (i.e., due to variations in incoming top of the atmosphere insolation and spikes in aerosol concentration from volcanic eruptions) or anthropogenic (most notably, emissions of aerosols and GHGs from fossil fuel burning). Single-model ensemble sizes range between 1 and 10 in the historical simulations of the twentieth century and in the RCP8.5 scenario simulations of the twenty-first century. (In the case of the pre-Industrial control, typically, one simulation is run per model, albeit of varying length.) For each model and type of simulation, when more than one is available, we average realizations in the model’s ensemble mean. We then compute the multi-model mean as the average of the single models’ ensemble mean, a procedure which further suppresses the manifestation of internal variability.</p>
