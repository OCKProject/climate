<p id="Par9" class="p">We build an argument for indirect attribution based on the influence of external forcing—external to the coupled ocean-atmosphere system—on the SST patterns that affect Sahel rainfall. In the “
 <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Transformation of predictors</xref>” sub-section, we concisely describe oceanic influence using SVD applied to our set of two original predictors for Sahel rainfall, sub-tropical North Atlantic and global tropical SSTs. In the “
