<p id="Par18" class="p">Regression coefficients 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> and the correlation coefficients between simulated and predicted Sahel rainfall for the multi-model mean and for observations are reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. Since the SVD-based predictor time series are standardized and mutually uncorrelated, and predictand time series are standardized, the regression coefficients, 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>, are precisely the correlation coefficients of the predictand and corresponding predictors. In the twentieth century, correlation of the multi-model mean simulation of Sahel rainfall with its SST-based regression is 0.574 and correlation in observations is 0.633. Both terms in the regression contribute, but 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> contributes more (since 
 <italic class="italic">b &gt; a</italic>): late twentieth century Sahel drought is explained by the absence of North Atlantic warming, relative to warming of the global tropical oceans. The (positive) sign of 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>, the regression coefficient multiplying 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (NARI), is consistent across centuries. However, its magnitude and explanatory power vis à vis Sahel rainfall are drastically diminished in the twenty-first century. Over the twenty-first century, the correlation between the simulated Sahel rainfall and its in-sample prediction is 0.801. The multi-model ensemble achieves this high a correlation essentially through a positive correlation between Sahel rainfall and warming, captured by 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>. This happens because the coherence among models in projections of twenty-first century precipitation change has increased considerably from CMIP3 to CMIP5 (Biasutti 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2013</xref>): a majority of models in CMIP5 project a future increase in Sahel rainfal to go along with warming (Schewe and Levermann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2017</xref>), in analogy to paleoclimate reconstructions of the “Green Sahara”, when summer insolation was stronger than now (de Menocal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2000</xref>). Among the models with a twenty-first century correlation coefficient between 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and Sahel rainfall larger than 0.45 (thus explaining ~ 20% of the variance with the single predictor 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>), seven of nine project future wetting (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> in Supplementary Materials). In sum, regression models between centuries are nearly orthogonal: 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, analogous to the difference of predictors or NARI, explains a larger fraction of twentieth century variation, while 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, analogous to the sum of predictors or warming, alone explains the externally forced twenty-first century change.
