<p id="Par16" class="p">Our original predictors, GT and NA, are highly correlated in the twentieth and twenty-first century simulations, less so in the pre-Industrial control simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). As a consequence, the percent of variance explained by the leading mode, 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="" class="xref">4</xref>), increases in the simulations with time-dependent external forcing, as compared to those with constant forcing. The correlation further increases from twentieth to twenty-first century and consequently so does the relative variance of the leading mode, 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>/(
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> + 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) = 1 − 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/(
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> + 
 <italic class="italic">λ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), see Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="" class="xref">5</xref>). This behavior represents one prominent way in which external forcing expresses itself: it forces a positive correlation between the two predictors, through their common, GHG-induced warming. In addition, the relative cooling of the North Atlantic associated with aerosols contributes to the co-variability of indices with a second, preferred direction along which variance is expressed, which by construction is orthogonal to the first. This direction expresses more variance, visible in the scatter plots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, in the twentieth (blue dots) than in the twenty-first century (red squares).
