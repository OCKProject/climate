<p id="Par10" class="p">We relate differences between our predictors’ covariance structures to differences in the external forcing applied to the pre-Industrial control and twentieth and twenty-first century simulations. The latter two types of simulations are run with time-varying external forcing, natural and anthropogenic: variations in each realization of a single model’s ensemble are a combination of internal variability and externally forced change, and their ensemble mean is taken to filter out internal variability. The former are run with constant external forcing, including CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations held fixed at pre-Industrial levels (280 ppm), the intent being to provide a truthful estimation of each model’s internal variability. We repeat analyses on each model’s first 100 years of the pre-Industrial control simulation (typically, there is only one such simulation per model, of variable length) and on each model’s ensemble mean (with ensemble sizes varying between one and ten) for the twentieth and twenty-first century simulations.
