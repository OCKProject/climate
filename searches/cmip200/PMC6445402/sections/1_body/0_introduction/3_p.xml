 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2014</xref>). Recent work attempting to explain the disagreement in the sign of projected twenty-first century rainfall change (Biasutti and Giannini 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2006</xref>) with differences in projected SST change added the explicit consideration of oceanic warming, resulting in a linear regression model that describes Sahel rainfall as a function of two regional SST indices: the difference of tropical North and tropical South Atlantic SST averages and the average of tropical Indo-Pacific sector SSTs (Biasutti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2008</xref>)
 <italic class="italic">.</italic> This regression model was further distilled into a single predictor, the North Atlantic Relative Index (NARI; Giannini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2013</xref>), computed as the difference between SST averages over the sub-tropical North Atlantic (10°N–40°N, 75°W–15°W) and the global tropical oceans (20°S–20°N). Here, we denote these as NA and GT, respectively, so that NARI = NA − GT. In this difference, the tropical SST average (GT) captures global vertical stability (Chou and Neelin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2004</xref>): the stabilization effect of warming SSTs is communicated vertically through deep convection and is spread laterally by upper-atmosphere wave dynamics, given the weak temperature gradient constraint (Chiang and Sobel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2002</xref>). The sub-tropical North Atlantic SST average (NA) counters stabilization through moisture supply (Giannini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2008</xref>; Seth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2013</xref>). To the extent that Sahel rainfall variations on different time scales are the result of the underlying oceanic forcing’s preferred time scales of variation, our physical interpretation of NARI follows the paradigm that convection is in quasi-equilibrium with its environment (Emanuel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">1994</xref>). This assumption eliminates the need to consider time scales of variation separately, as long as these are longer than the time scales of convective adjustment (including the adjustment in the coupled ocean-atmosphere system described in Chiang and Sobel (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2002</xref>)). In addition, it should be noted that a “relative index” effectively detrends variations (Vecchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2008</xref>), in the sense that insofar as both SST time series express GHG-induced warming, taking their difference largely removes it. In observations, NARI explains ~ 50% of the variance in twentieth century Sahel rainfall variability, all time scales included (Giannini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2013</xref>).
