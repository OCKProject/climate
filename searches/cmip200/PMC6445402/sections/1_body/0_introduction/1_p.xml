<p id="Par2" class="p">The Sahel witnessed an outstanding climatic shift with the abrupt onset of drought in the late 1960s. The magnitude and spatial extent of the downward trend in precipitation over the twentieth century (Greene et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2009</xref>) led scientists to hypothesize that Sahelian drought may be a sign of anthropogenic change. Some pointed to the local pressure of rapid population growth on vegetation cover and the consequent impact of an increase in albedo on the atmospheric energy budget (Charney
