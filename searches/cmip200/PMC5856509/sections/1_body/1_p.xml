<p class="p">A lack of understanding of the mechanism of LPS development has hindered projections of future monsoon synoptic activity, leaving us reliant on simulations of future scenarios by comprehensive climate models. However, the unrealistic representation of these systems in global climate models (GCMs) used in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5; ref.

Similar issues in estimating future changes in global tropical cyclone (TC) activity were addressed using a high-resolution atmospheric GCM; the same high-resolution modeling strategy was also found reliable in simulating the distribution and structure of Indian monsoon LPS (
