<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">A change in LPS activity is expected to alter the distribution of monsoon precipitation. The climatological precipitation is strong over the BoB and into central India along the typical LPS trajectory (

 </xref>). The climatology of precipitation related to LPS originating in the BoB shows that those storms contribute to both continental and oceanic rainfall (
