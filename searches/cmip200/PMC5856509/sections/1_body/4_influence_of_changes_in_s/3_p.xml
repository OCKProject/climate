<p class="p">Furthermore, the northward shift of the genesis distribution may reduce the amount of warning India has for flood events. In the HiRAM HIST simulations it takes about 3.7 d for an LPS to make landfall after its genesis over the BoB. This time between genesis and landfall is helpful in preparing mitigation strategies for impending floods. As the LPS genesis shifts from ocean to land the Indian region may face shorter preparation times for mitigating the societal impacts of these storms.</p>
