<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Despite the importance of monsoon LPS, future changes in these systems remain poorly characterized and incompletely understood. We have shown that one of the few GCMs to successfully simulate the genesis distribution of Indian monsoon LPS projects a strong weakening and poleward shift of LPS activity in a warming environment. This occurs for all four ensemble members, despite their differing SSTs. An existing statistical model that successfully reproduces the observed global distribution of LPS also predicts a decrease in LPS genesis and furthermore attributes this decrease to a weakening and poleward shift of the large-scale monsoon flow that is widespread in CMIP5 projections. This important consequence of the weakening and poleward shift of the low-level monsoon flow has not been previously appreciated.</p>
