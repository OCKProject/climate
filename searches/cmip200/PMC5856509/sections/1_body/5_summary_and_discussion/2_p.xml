<p class="p">The poleward shift in LPS activity was shown to be associated with increased precipitation extremes over northern India in HiRAM. Given the poor skill with which most other climate models simulate LPS activity and associated precipitation, the HiRAM projections may have greater relevance for future changes in regional monsoon climates (

Whether the positive bias in the intensity of LPS simulated by HiRAM compromises the validity of these projections remains unclear, but this bias in LPS properties is substantially smaller than the LPS biases seen in nearly all other CMIP5 models (
