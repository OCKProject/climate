<p class="p">In summary, the hypothesis that future LPS genesis will decrease in frequency over the BoB is supported by numerous future projections of a weakening of the large-scale monsoon circulation and by a statistical model that links the large-scale circulation strength to LPS genesis frequency; in addition, HiRAM explicitly simulates a reduction in LPS genesis frequency for all four SST forcings. It has been argued that monsoon LPS over the BoB may result from the amplification of disturbances originating over the West Pacific (

 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>), which might link LPS frequency to the distribution of West Pacific storms, but those studies were based on relatively small samples of LPS. Automated tracking of low-level 850-hPa vorticity anomalies has not found a large number of BoB LPS to originate from the West Pacific (
