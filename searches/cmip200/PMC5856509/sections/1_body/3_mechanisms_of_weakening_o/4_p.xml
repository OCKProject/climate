<p class="p">The projected reduction in synoptic activity is due not only to reduced genesis frequency but also to the general decrease in LPS intensity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1
  <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 </xref>). We now discuss possible reasons for this intensity decrease. Although the mechanism of LPS intensification is not understood, LPS have multiple dynamical similarities to weak TCs (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>), which have been projected to decrease in number in a warming climate (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). Those projections of TC counts typically only consider storms with sustained surface wind speeds of 20 m⋅s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> or greater (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>), which is stronger than nearly all Indian summer monsoon LPS; a general reduction in LPS intensity is thus consistent with projections of reduced TC counts, as fewer LPS achieve sufficient intensities to be counted as TCs. The reduction of TC frequency has been attributed to an increase in the midtropospheric saturation deficit (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>) (amount of moisture needed to achieve saturation) and to a weakening of the large-scale tropical circulation, both of which are simulated to occur in the HiRAM future projections (

  <italic class="italic">SI Appendix</italic>, Figs. S8 and S9
 </ext-link>). In the HiRAM projections, the troposphere over the BoB and central India exhibits a stronger increase in saturation deficit than that over the equatorial Indian Ocean, possibly causing a reduction in LPS intensity by strengthening unsaturated convective downdrafts and weakening the upward convective mass flux in those storms.
