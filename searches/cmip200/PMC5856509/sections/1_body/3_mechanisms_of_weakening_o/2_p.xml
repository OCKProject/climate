<p class="p">This suggests that the large reduction in future LPS genesis simulated by HiRAM is caused by a weakening of the large-scale monsoon circulation and a corresponding drop in the ambient vorticity from which LPS form. Although the genesis mechanism of LPS is still the subject of active research (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>), the presence of large low-level vorticity has been long held to be essential for genesis (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). Recently, monsoon LPS have also been shown to have structural similarities to weak TCs (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>) and to have a statistical association with the climatological mean state similar to that of TCs (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>), which suggests that LPS genesis may also be favored by environments rich in cyclonic vorticity. This reasoning contrasts with a previous argument relating the possible recent decline in LPS activity to a midtropospheric drying (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>); HiRAM simulates such a drying, but it produces a comparatively minor effect on the MDGI (

 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). A slowing of tropical circulations in general may be expected from the increase in static stability that occurs in a warming troposphere (
