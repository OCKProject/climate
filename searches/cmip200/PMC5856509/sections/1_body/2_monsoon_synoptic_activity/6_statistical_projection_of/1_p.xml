<p class="p">These changes in genesis frequency can be understood using an existing statistical model of the observed spatial distribution and seasonal cycle of global LPS genesis. That model, the MDGI (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>), predicts the likelihood of genesis from monthly mean climatologies of precipitable water (PW), low-level absolute vorticity (

   <mi class="mi">η</mi>

 </inline-formula>), an estimate of convective available potential energy (ECAPE), and midtropospheric relative humidity (RH). These four variables were objectively selected using observed LPS counts, but when the MDGI is calculated using the same four climatological variables from HiRAM it also successfully represents the distribution of LPS genesis explicitly simulated in HIST (

 </xref>). Furthermore, the MDGI predicts a strong reduction of genesis frequency over the BoB in the future (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2
  <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 </xref>). That is, given only the simulated change in the climatological monthly mean state, the MDGI predicts a roughly 50% decrease in genesis frequency over the BoB. It also predicts a roughly 50% increase in genesis over land—much larger than the increase in LPS genesis explicitly simulated by HiRAM—but much of the MDGI increase is along the foothills of the Himalaya where genesis would likely be inhibited by orography.
