 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>) with a horizontal grid spacing of 50 km globally. One set of simulations represents the historical (HIST) period and the other a late-21st-century climate scenario based on the strongest Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5). Four ensemble members of these simulations are run, with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) taken from different CMIP5 GCMs selected for their skill in simulating the Indian monsoon. In addition, 30 ensemble members of annual cycle (ANNC) experiments are run for each of the HIST and RCP8.5 scenarios to assess model uncertainty, in which the model is forced with ANNCs of decadal mean SSTs (
