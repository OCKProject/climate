<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Although precipitating atmospheric vortices known as low-pressure systems (LPS) are found in all monsoon regions, their presence is most prominent over India, where an average of 13 (± 2.5) storms develop each boreal summer, with most originating over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and adjoining land (
