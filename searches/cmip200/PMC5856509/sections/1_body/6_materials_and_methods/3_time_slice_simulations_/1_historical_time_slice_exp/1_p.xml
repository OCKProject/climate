<p class="p">In this experiment, the HiRAM model is forced with bias-corrected SSTs for the period 1979â€“2005. In addition to the SST and sea ice concentrations (SIC) from the CMIP5 coupled models, the standard CMIP5 forcings such as monthly varying greenhouse gases, solar irradiance, aerosol, ozone, and so on are used to drive the model. An ensemble of four simulations is produced, with each simulation corresponding to the SST and SIC from a CMIP5 coupled model.</p>
