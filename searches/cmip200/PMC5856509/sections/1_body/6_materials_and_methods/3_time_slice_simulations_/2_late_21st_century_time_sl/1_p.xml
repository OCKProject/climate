<p class="p">Bias-corrected future SSTs from the four CMIP5 models along with other CMIP5 atmospheric forcings for RCP8.5 are used to drive the HiRAM model to simulate four ensemble members for the 2069–2095 period. To avoid analyzing the model spin-up period the analyses are restricted to 1981–2005 and 2071–2095 for HIST and RCP8.5, respectively.</p>
