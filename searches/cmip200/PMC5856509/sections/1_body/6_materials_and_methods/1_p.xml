<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Monthly varying SSTs from four climate models (Community Climate System Model 4, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-Earth System Model 2G, and Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate 5) participating in CMIP5 are used to force the HiRAM model. These models are chosen based on two criteria: (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) their skill in simulating Juneâ€“September seasonal mean monsoon precipitation over India (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>) and (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) the SST bias over the Arabian Sea, which is found to introduce a dry bias over India (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>) (models with weaker bias are preferred). Biases in climate model SSTs can lead to errors when atmospheric models are forced with these SSTs (
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). Hence, we applied an SST bias correction (described below). The HiRAM model is configured with a horizontal resolution of 50 km and 32 vertical hybrid pressure levels.
