<p class="p">Since performing this ensemble of HiRAM simulations is computationally intensive, another set of experiments is run in ANNC mode to quantify model uncertainty. These simulations are forced with ANNCs of 10-y mean SSTs and other model forcings. SSTs from 10 different CMIP5 coupled models (historical and RCP8.5 experiments; see

Three sets of ANNC simulations are carried out with each coupled model SST, where the SST ANNCs correspond to the decades 1971–1980, 1981–1990, and 1991–2000 for the HIST and the decades 2071–2080, 2081–2090, and 2091–2100 for the RCP8.5 scenario. In these experiments HiRAM is integrated for 24 mo, with the first 12 mo treated as a spin-up period.
