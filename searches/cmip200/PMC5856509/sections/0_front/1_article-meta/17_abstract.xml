 <p class="p">Propagating atmospheric vortices contribute more than half of the total rainfall received by the fertile and highly populated Gangetic plains of India. How the activity of these storms will change in a warming climate is not yet understood, due to both the inadequate representation of these disturbances in global climate models and a lack of theory for their fundamental dynamics. Here we show that both a high-resolution atmospheric model and a statistical model predict that the activity of these storms weakens and shifts poleward from ocean to land in a warmer environment. The associated changes in seasonal mean rainfall and precipitation extremes are expected to have serious implications for the hydrological cycle of South Asia.</p>
