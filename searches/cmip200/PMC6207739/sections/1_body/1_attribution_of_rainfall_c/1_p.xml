 </sup> to quantify future changes in Arctic rainfall and identify/evaluate the underlying processes. We use actual climate model output of surface air temperature, total precipitation and snowfall/rainfall. Arctic mean (70–90°N) precipitation is projected to strongly increase over the next century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), with the increase accelerating towards later stages of the century

 </sup>. The increase in Arctic rainfall even outpaces that in total precipitation, aided by the fact that, on average, vigorous Arctic warming causes solid precipitation to melt into rain

 </sup>. Virtually all precipitation starts as snow, especially in the polar regions, but thawing temperatures in atmospheric layers between the surface and the cloud base cause the snow to melt and transform into rain. This melt process, which is essentially driven by local temperature trends, is the main contributor to the increase in Arctic rainfall (~70%). In the (hypothetical) absence of this process, Arctic rainfall would still increase simply because the extra precipitation would transform into rain at the same rate (or snow fraction, defined as the fraction of snowfall to total precipitation) as today (30%). Increases in total precipitation are to a considerable extent associated with changes in (remote) climate variables through changes in moisture transport, sea-ice related surface evaporation and cloud microphysical processes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. In any case, the sharp increase in snowfall being transformed into rain causes Arctic mean snowfall to hardly increase in the near-future and even decline after the year 2035. As a result, the combined models project that rainfall will become the dominant form of Arctic precipitation around the year 2080 (in the RCP8.5 scenario).
