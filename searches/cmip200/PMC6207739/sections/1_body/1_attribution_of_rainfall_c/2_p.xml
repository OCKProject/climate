<p id="Par6" class="p">While all 37 climate models agree that Arctic rainfall will increase over the next century, the magnitude of the simulated changes is much less robust among models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The increase in Arctic rainfall varies by a factor of 4 between the most extreme models, but in all models local temperature changes govern increases in annually averaged Arctic rainfall. In fact, the relative contribution of local warming on changes in rainfall is remarkably constant among the various models, varying between 60 and 80%. This means that the temperature-dependent transition from snow to rain is a shared feature in the intermodel sense, despite the strong intermodel variation in Arctic warming rates (models project a 4 to 13 °C Arctic mean and annual mean 21

 </sup>). Apparently the increases in total precipitation and (local warming induced) absolute increases in rainfall are such that the fractional contribution of local warming induced rainfall is largely model independent and therefore a robust feature of Arctic climate change. However, considering annual and Arctic means averages out strong spatial and seasonal variations in rainfall changes and in the associated climate processes.
