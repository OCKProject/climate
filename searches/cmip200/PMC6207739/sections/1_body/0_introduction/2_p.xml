<p id="Par3" class="p">The relation between changes in Arctic rainfall and both temperature and precipitation is surprisingly complex, however. Obviously, higher temperatures lead to a lower snowfall fraction and thus more rain, but the rate of increase depends crucially on the ambient atmospheric temperature. In very cold conditions, temperature increases will hardly affect the snowfall fraction, which will stay close to 1. Similarly, in temperatures sufficiently far above 0 °C where snowfall fractions are close to zero, warming also will not lead to substantial increases in liquid precipitation. The largest impact on the snowfall fraction, and thus on temperature-induced rainfall changes, will occur in the temperature range close to 0 °C (ref.

 </sup>) (see Suppementary Information). In the Arctic, the largest temperature increases are projected to occur during the cold winters, and to a much lesser extent in the already fairly mild summers

 </sup>. Moreover, projected increases in Arctic precipitation exhibit a strong seasonal signature, peaking in late autumn and winter
