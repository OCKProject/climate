<p id="Par2" class="p">Changes in Arctic rainfall are dominated by two distinct processes. Firstly, changes in total precipitation, which in turn can be attributed to atmospheric moisture transports (mainly from lower latitudes) converging over the Arctic (through warmer air being able to hold more moisture and/or by changing atmospheric dynamics, including variability in the jet stream associated with changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation)

 </sup>. Secondly, changes in local temperature (of the lowest atmospheric layers), which govern whether or not the precipitation that starts off as snow will melt into rain on its way to the surface. Changes in precipitation and their underlying causes can be characterized as ‘remote’ because they depend primarily on non-local climate mechanisms, whereas changes in local temperature directly determine the transformation of snow to rain. Since the scale, magnitude and duration of various impacts of Arctic precipitation trends depend crucially on whether the additional precipitation will fall as snow or rain

 </sup>, it is imperative to accurately determine the underlying causes behind the steep increase in projected Arctic rainfall, including its dependence on local warming.
