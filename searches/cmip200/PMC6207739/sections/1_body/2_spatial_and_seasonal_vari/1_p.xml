<p id="Par7" class="p">The effect of local warming on rainfall changes exhibits a complex geographical distribution, with peak values over the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic, comparatively low values over the subarctic continents and again higher values in the mild southern regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). The fact that the local warming effect peaks in the high Arctic Ocean is a unexpected result, as one would instinctively not assume this factor to dominate in the coldest regions of the Arctic where liquid precipitation is relatively scarce to begin with. However, it is the region where projected temperature changes are largest (a phenomenon coined Arctic amplification)

 </sup>, potentially amplifying the temperature effect on rainfall changes. Interestingly, the maximum values over the central Arctic Ocean can be attributed largely to summer conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), during which changes in snowfall fraction are maximum in the central Arctic where current summer temperatures are around the freezing point. In the subarctic regions, present-day temperatures are too mild (and future warming too modest) to invoke large increases in snowfall fraction. In winter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>), the situation is largely reversed, with minimum values of the temperature effect on rainfall over the high Arctic and the subarctic continents (especially Siberia and Greenland where current winter temperatures are extremely low). This geographical pattern closely resembles that of the trends in snowfall fraction
