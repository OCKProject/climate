 </sup>). Climate models are consistent in their projections of the relative contribution of local temperature on Arctic average rainfall changes, but superimposed on these are huge spatial and seasonal variations. During winter over the Arctic Ocean and the adjacent continents, changes in rainfall are effectively decoupled from local warming owing to minute changes in snowfall fraction in these very cold climates. Hence, in such deep-freeze conditions, additional rainfall can be attributed mainly to large-scale precipitation changes, and local warming rates are not a good predictor of rainfall changes.
