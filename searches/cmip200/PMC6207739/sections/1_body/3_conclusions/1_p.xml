<p id="Par10" class="p">The intuitive notion that strong Arctic warming always leads to considerable increases in rainfall is inaccurate, even though on average (Arctic and annual mean) local warming does explain the major part (~70%) of the increase in rainfall. Our findings also link to the uncertainty in future projections of Arctic rainfall and snowfall: local, seasonal and temporal variability in precipitation potentially exhibits a different – and likely larger (due mainly to uncertain cloud-related processes

 </sup>. Addressing the magnitude, extent and potential irreversability of the various impacts of projected strong increases in Arctic rainfall (such as hydrology/run-off, permafrost thawing, ecosystem shifts, sea ice retreat, and glacier melt) will benefit from improved insights into the underlying causes, in particular the spatial/seasonal dependence of the attribution of rainfall to local warming, the associated accuracy in the projections and the effect on seasonally varying snowfall rates.
