<p class="p">Changes in aerosol‐related emissions and atmospheric aerosol concentrations are likely to have multiple effects on crops, including leading to changes in nutrient deposition (e.g., Mahowald, 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), diffuse versus direct sunlight available for photosynthesis (Mercado et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and total photosynthetically active radiation reaching plants due to atmospheric (Chameides et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>) or deposited (Greenwald et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) aerosol. There are few field studies available to quantify the role of each of these effects, preventing us from applying the type of meta‐analysis used to characterize other crop impacts in this study, and hence, impacts of aerosol composition change are not included here (impacts of aerosols on climate are included). Additional work on aerosol‐related crop impacts would of course be useful.
