<p class="p">Many prior studies have investigated agricultural responses to climate change, as summarized, for example, in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; Porter et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Though changes in the composition of the atmosphere in the case of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are typically included, changes in other aspects of atmospheric composition are generally omitted. Impacts of ozone, however, are relatively well understood, as acknowledged by the AR5 (Porter et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and have been quantified in many studies (e.g., Avnery et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Porter et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Van Dingenen et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Those studies, however, do not include climate change impacts. As such, extant research does not provide a clear indication of the impact of the individual emissions that drive, in many cases, both climate change and ozone concentrations. An initial study to quantify the effects of individual pollutants on agriculture was performed recently, examining global aggregate results only (Shindell, 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Here we build on that work, now examining the spatial distribution of the crop yield impacts of all major pollutants that occur via the physiological (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and ozone exposure) and climate‚Äêrelated (temperature and precipitation) impacts of emissions. We consider greenhouse gasses (GHGs), aerosols, and both aerosol and ozone precursors all as pollutants since all adversely affect the environment.
