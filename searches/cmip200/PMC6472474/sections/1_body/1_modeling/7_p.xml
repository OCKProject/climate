<p class="p">Impacts of methane emissions on ozone are based on simulations with the GISS and ECHAM global composition‐climate models (Shindell et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), whereas ozone responses to CO and NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> are based on prior modeling with the GISS model only (Shindell et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). There are multiple ozone metrics associated with crop yields. We use M7 and M12 (the mean 7‐ or 12‐hr exposure during the growing season, depending on the crop) rather than accumulated ozone over a threshold of 40 ppb (AOT40) since the latter is by definition highly nonlinear, as it uses a threshold, so not well suited to the linear framework used here. Metrics based on stomatal flux of ozone (e.g., Mills et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) are likely better than those based on surface concentrations, as they take into account variations in ozone uptake by plants under different meteorological conditions, but are not practical to implement in our framework with currently available model results. While direct human impacts on crops via land management (e.g., application of fertilizer and cultivar choice) obviously have large impacts on yields, these processes are not included in this study, which aims to isolate the indirect effects of worldwide pollutant emissions largely outside the control of local land managers.
