<p class="p">We have developed an empirical crop model based on statistical relationships for the impacts of temperature, precipitation, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations, and ozone rather than plant level simulations. Crop responses to changes in meteorological variables and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations are based on a meta‐analysis of more than 1,000 modeling studies (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), incorporating relationships observed in field studies. The availability of these three response factors from meta‐analysis determines the scope of our analysis, which includes wheat, maize (corn), and rice and uses separate response coefficients for each of these according to temperate or tropical conditions.
