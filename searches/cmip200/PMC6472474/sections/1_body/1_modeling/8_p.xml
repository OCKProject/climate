<p class="p">Uncertainties are propagated through from all sources using a Monte Carlo evaluation with 20,000 samples randomly selected across the distributions of each components' uncertainty range. Relative uncertainties in RF are taken from the AR5, whereas uncertainties in crop yield responses are those reported in the meta‐analysis (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Uncertainty in climate response comes from the multimodel CMIP5 analysis (Geoffroy et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). All are 5–95% confidence intervals, and the sampling assumes that all have a normal Gaussian distribution except for climate sensitivity (which is asymmetric, with a long tail at the high end). GHG and pollutant emissions are taken from the CMIP5 data set (Lamarque et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Effects are calculated as the time‐dependent response to historical emissions since 1850, and we show results for 2010 (which are hence based on all emissions through that year). Note that results for the impacts of short‐lived aerosol and nonmethane ozone precursors represent the effect of worldwide emissions and the impact of emissions at any given location might differ. Crop distributions for 2010 are taken from the Food and Agricultural Organization data sets (FAO,
