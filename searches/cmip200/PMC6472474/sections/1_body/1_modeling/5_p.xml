<p class="p">Crop responses to temperature are regionally varying with values in units of percent yield per degree warming of (temperate regions and tropical regions): maize (−2.4, −3.4), wheat (−2.4, −13.8), and rice (−3.2, −2.0) based on the meta‐analysis (Challinor et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). This compares with the uniform global mean value of −4.9% yield change per degree for all crops in Shindell (
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) based on this same meta‐analysis. For consistency with the underlying meta‐analysis, we define regions as follows: Tropical regions are those from 30°S to 30°N except for longitudes 20°W to 60°E (North Africa and the Middle East) where we use 20°S–20°N for all crops. Central and Eastern China, defined as 22–40°N, 100–122°E, is assigned to be temperate for wheat and maize, but tropical for rice (thus northeast China is temperate for all), as those were the classifications used in the meta‐analysis from which the response functions are derived.
