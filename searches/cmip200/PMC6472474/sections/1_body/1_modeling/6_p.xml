<p class="p">Turning now to composition, in addition to the response of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions, we include the very small “direct” oxidation of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and CO to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. We also include the “indirect” CO
