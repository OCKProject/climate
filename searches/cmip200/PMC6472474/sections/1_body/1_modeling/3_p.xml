<p class="p">Processes included in the modeling are summarized in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. We first use a model that calculates time‐dependent composition in response to emissions of each agent involved in climate change. Residence times for all species are those given in the IPCC AR5 (Myhre et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), with the exception of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which is evaluated using a simple carbon cycle model incorporating four response times representing major terrestrial and oceanic carbon reservoirs (Joos et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; the version used in IPCC AR4). In the next step, radiative forcing values are calculated based on the radiative efficiency of each compound given in the IPCC AR5 (Myhre et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), supplemented by results from our prior modeling for the indirect effects of aerosols, as AR5 values are not available. For short‐lived species, global mean forcing values per unit emission are used, as we only explore the response to worldwide changes in short‐lived species. It is clear that radiative efficiency varies with the location of emissions (Myhre et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), and this could be addressed in future work. Global mean temperature responses are then calculated using an impulse‐response function based on the climate sensitivity and response times of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models (Geoffroy et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), which is consistent with estimates based on paleoclimate data and analysis of modern climate (Collins et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). This impulse‐response function includes two exponential decays, one with a time constant of 8.2 years representing the relatively rapid response of the land and upper ocean and a second with a time constant of 290 years representing the comparatively slow response of the deeper ocean, and has a climate sensitivity to doubled CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> of 3.2 °C. Through this stage, the entire modeling follows that described previously (Shindell, 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), except that the impulse‐response function has been updated.
