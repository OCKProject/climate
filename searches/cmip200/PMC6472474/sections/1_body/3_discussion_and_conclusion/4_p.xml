<p class="p">The modeling performed here provides insight into the role of individual pollutant emissions, but further work is needed in several areas. For instance, production changes describe only a portion of the crop response to emissions, as factors such as nutritional content may also change (Myers et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2497-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). A full picture would also require consideration of the possible effect of the activity leading to emissions on production. For example, a large portion of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions result from fertilizer application, the net impact of which is clearly still to increase production despite the effects shown here. Impacts of F‚Äêgasses are similarly complex when these are used as refrigerants to prevent food spoilage. In the case of livestock, these results suggest that shifting to diets with lower consumption of cattle products (meat and dairy) could indirectly lead to substantial crop production benefits form decreased methane emissions, potentially including benefits for substitute sources of protein such as soybeans.
