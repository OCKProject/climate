<p class="p">The current results suggest that worldwide, we currently experience yield losses of wheat and maize of about 4–6%. Present‐day (2010) losses due to historical emissions are greater than one million tons for maize in China and for wheat in Pakistan, the United States, China, and France, with losses exceeding 10 million tons for U.S. maize and Indian wheat. Relative yield losses are greater than 10% for several large producers, including wheat in India and Mexico and maize in Egypt. Yield losses are greater than 15% for wheat in several Latin American and South Asian countries, and Ethiopia owing to the large sensitivity of tropical wheat to warming. In contrast, South and East Asian countries have experienced yield increases in rice due to the combined influence of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization and aerosol‐induced cooling. Given the role of aerosols and that maize yield losses are largely attributable to methane, these results suggest that greater attention should be paid to the role of non‐CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in affecting agriculture. In particular, there may be large agricultural benefits to targeting methane emission reductions, and such impacts are not well captured by the use of traditional metrics for comparison of GHGs that only reflect their climate impacts (Huntingford et al.,
