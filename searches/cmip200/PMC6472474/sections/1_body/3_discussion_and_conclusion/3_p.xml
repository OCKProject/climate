<p class="p">The losses experienced by a particular country are driven both by its location and the amount of crops grown there. The influence of the latter factor makes comparisons of historical “responsibility” to actual present‐day losses complex. To simplify this comparison, we assume that maize losses are attributable to methane, whereas wheat losses are assumed to be due equally to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (owing to warming) and methane. Rice is substantially influenced by many pollutants, so is not included here as short‐lived aerosol, and nonmethane ozone precursors are not considered since impacts of regional emissions may differ from the global mean. Though only a rough guide, it is nevertheless interesting to find that production losses are in some cases far less than the national‐level attributable share of time‐weighted GHG emissions whereas in other cases they are much greater. For example, losses of maize in the United States are 6.2 times greater than the U.S. share of GHG emissions driving those losses, owing primarily to the very large share of worldwide maize produced in the United States, but losses of wheat are only 40% of the U.S. share of emissions driving wheat losses. In contrast, production losses for wheat in India are 8.8 times greater than the Indian share of GHG emissions driving those losses, due to India's position in the tropics (where wheat is very sensitive to warming and where methane increases lead to large ozone responses). India's losses of maize, however, are only 10% of their share of emissions, as India produced little maize. For China, production losses tend to be more similar to the Chinese share of historical GHG emissions (50% of share of wheat losses and 120% of share of maize losses).
