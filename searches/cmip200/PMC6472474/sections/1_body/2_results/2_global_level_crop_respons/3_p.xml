<p class="p">The primary emission driving global crop yield losses for each crop is either methane or CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Both these gasses cause large gross losses due to warming, whereas there are also large gross gains due to fertilization for CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> but not for methane (or other non‐CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> GHGs). In the case of methane, losses due to temperature contribute ~2/3 to 3/4 of the total, with the remainder primarily due to ozone. N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, F‐gasses, aerosols, and ozone precursors all have important impacts, though in many cases their opposing signs mean that they largely offset one another at the global scale. For example, crop yield gains from aerosol‐induced cooling are in part mitigated by losses due to the increased ozone resulting from NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions.
