<p class="p">Returning to the effects of all historical emissions, present‐day production is primarily affected by the last decade's emissions for aerosols, CO, and NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>, but longer‐lived GHG emissions in the more distant past still influence today's production (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Emissions of methane for most of the prior 20–25 years have large impacts, as do CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions from about 5–40 or more years ago for rice and wheat. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions from the past several years have not yet greatly influenced climate, so their effect is largely via fertilization and hence can be opposite to the effect of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions from earlier years. For wheat and rice, impacts other than those from CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> are dominated by sulfur dioxide, and so recent emissions have led to increased production via cooling. In contrast, for maize impacts other than those from CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> are dominated by N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and F‐gasses (as aerosol cooling influences are more closely offset by NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>‐induced ozone losses in maize‐growing regions), so historical emissions from the past half century all have substantial impacts.
