<p class="p">The response to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is more complex in the tropics, as wheat is much more sensitive to temperature than to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, whereas tropical rice is more sensitive to fertilization than to temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This indicates that tropical wheat is damaged by both CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and methane, whereas tropical rice production can increase when the positive impact of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> outweighs the negative impact of methane. The results presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> are also influenced by where and in what volume these crops are currently grown, as these results are based on current crop distributions. For example, the responses of tropical and temperate maize to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> are qualitatively similar, but the magnitude is larger for temperate regions, as more maize is grown there, whereas the situation is reversed for rice. They thus provide an indication of the present‐day marginal impact of each additional ton of emission of these gasses.
