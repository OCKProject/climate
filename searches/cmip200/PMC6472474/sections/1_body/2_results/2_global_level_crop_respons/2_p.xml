<p class="p">Annual production changes in 2010 due to all emissions through that year vary dramatically across crops at the global scale, with large losses in wheat and maize but a modest gain in rice production (Table 
 <xref rid="eft2497-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>; note that changes in production represent changes in yield, as cultivated area is kept fixed in this analysis). The primary processes driving crop yield changes are temperature change, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization (in response to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions), and ozone changes (in response to CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions), and hereafter, we concentrate only on those. Other ozone and fertilization impacts are small, as are precipitation impacts. Note that precipitation, unlike temperature, shows substantial shifts in location rather than a more homogeneous increase, so that gains and losses driven by precipitation changes largely cancel in the global average. They can be more important at national and local scales but are still generally small compared with other factors, so that excluding precipitation impacts in irrigation‐controlled regions has little impact on our results.
