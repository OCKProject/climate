<p class="p">Analysis of the response of temperate and tropical production to a single‐year pulse of emissions helps explain the global totals and the differences across crops. We focus initially on the two primary emissions, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. In temperate regions, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions cause a substantial short‐term increase in production due to the instant response of concentrations to emissions, but the net effect decays within a decade or so to near‐zero as the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization is offset by the impacts of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>‐induced climate change (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In contrast, methane emissions lead to crop production reductions by means of both methane‐induced climate change and methane‐induced surface ozone increase, causing large crop production losses over several decades. These two primary drivers of crop yield changes tend to drive yields down throughout the temperate zones.
