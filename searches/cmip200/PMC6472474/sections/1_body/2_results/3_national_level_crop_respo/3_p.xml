<p class="p">Focusing on the most affected nations (Table 
 <xref rid="eft2497-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), we see that for maize, relative yield losses are comparable across many parts of the world with losses due to emissions to date ranging from ~5–6% across countries in North Africa, North America, Europe, and Asia. In tonnage lost, damages are concentrated on the United States (60% of world losses), and to a less extent China (14%), where total tonnage harvested is much greater than in other countries. All other countries experience 3% or less of the global tonnage loss.
