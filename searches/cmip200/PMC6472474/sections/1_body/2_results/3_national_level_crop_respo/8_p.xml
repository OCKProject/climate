<p class="p">In the case of maize production, losses in total tons (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) are driven largely by methane, with marginally smaller damages associated with other gasses (the GHGs N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and F‐gasses as well as products of incomplete combustion) offset in part by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. The combined impact of methane via warming and ozone production makes it the dominant impact for all countries with major losses, however. Turning to relative yield losses (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>), methane is again the largest driver except in the case of Egypt, which exhibits a high sensitivity of ozone to NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions. Prior studies have shown a maximum in the ozone response to pollution controls at Northern Hemisphere low latitudes due to the combination of highest pollutant loading in the Northern Hemisphere from the subtropics through midlatitudes and the greater availability of sunlight as one moves south through that region (e.g., Shindell et al.,
