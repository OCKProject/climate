<p class="p">To examine the contribution of individual pollutants to the country‚Äêlevel results, we separate ozone and aerosol precursors into products of incomplete combustion (defined here as BC, OC, and CO, as these are generally emitted together from specific sources such as biomass burning or diesel fuel use) and the aerosol precursors SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>, and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> is also an ozone precursor; SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> are often coemitted from sources such as power plants or vehicles; NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is largely from agriculture and is included with the others simply for clarity of presentation, as its impacts are extremely small and could not be seen if shown as a separate set of bars).
