<p class="p">Turning to national level results, it is clear that many countries at Northern temperate latitudes experience large tonnage losses of all three crops (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Many tropical countries show production gains for rice, but losses for wheat and maize. Australia and New Zealand also show wheat losses. Changes in maize production in the Southern Hemisphere temperate region differ from those in the Northern Hemisphere. The ozone response to methane is roughly half that in the North (as there is less NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> available), and there is a noticeably weaker land warming, presumably since the Earth's surface is mostly ocean at Southern midlatitudes. These cause the losses due to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>‐induced warming to be substantially smaller relative to gains from fertilization, so that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can have larger net positive effects than the negative effects of methane as those are substantially weaker than in the North. The result is small net gains rather than losses in a few countries, including Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand.
