<p class="p">We see that for wheat, the large sensitivity of tropical wheat to temperature leads to very large impacts from aerosol‐induced cooling, so that the net effect is an offset between production increases due to aerosols and damages from WMGHGs, with the latter winning out by approximately 2 to 1 (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Countries in temperate zones, including China for wheat, see net production increases from CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> whereas tropical nations see losses (including India, which is mostly tropical). India and to a lesser extent China have particularly large impacts from aerosols and ozone precursors owing to large levels of local pollution. This also leads to a greater sensitivity to methane emissions, as their efficiency in producing ozone depends on the availability of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and hence there are greater methane‐driven wheat losses in China than in the United States (temperate wheat is especially sensitive to ozone; see Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Examining relative yields, tropical countries experience the largest losses due to the strong net negative impacts of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> via temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Relative yield losses are quite large, 15–25%, in many tropical countries on all continents with tropical areas.
