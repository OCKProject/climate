<p class="p">Rice production exhibits the most diverse pattern of responses to emissions to date, with losses generally seen in temperate countries and gains in tropical ones. As more rice is grown in tropical countries, this accounts for the overall increase in global level production despite relative yield losses in temperate countries that are larger than the relative yield gains in tropical ones (Table 
 <xref rid="eft2497-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Among the countries that experienced yield losses in rice, the largest portion occurs in the United States (27%), Japan (24%), Egypt (16%), and South Korea (16%; of total losses of 1.6 Mt). For the countries experienced yield gains for rice, the share is largest in China (27%), followed by Bangladesh (14%), India (11%), Vietnam (10%), and Indonesia (10%; of total gains of 6.7 Mt).
