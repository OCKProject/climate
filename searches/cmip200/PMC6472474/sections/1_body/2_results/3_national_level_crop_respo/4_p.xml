<p class="p">For wheat, losses are especially large in tropical countries in both relative yield losses and in total tonnage due to the combination of damages from methane (via ozone and climate) and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (as temperature dominates over fertilization for tropical wheat). This leads to the largest relative yield losses among the three crops occurring for tropical wheat, with many nations in South Asia, Latin America, and Africa estimated to have experienced yield losses from 15% to 26%. Losses are especially high in India due to large total tonnage harvested combined with nearly 17% yield losses. In terms of total tonnage, India has nearly half (48%) of the world's losses, followed by Pakistan (7%), the United States (6%), China (6%), and France (4%). Large relative yield losses lead to low tonnage losses in parts of Africa where relatively little wheat is grown.
