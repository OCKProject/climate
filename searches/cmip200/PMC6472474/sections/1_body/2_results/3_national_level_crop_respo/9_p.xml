<p class="p">For rice in total tons (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), fairly modest net production losses in temperate countries are largely attributable to methane, whereas production gains in tropical nations are predominantly driven by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Aerosols also contribute to rice production gains in tropical countries with high pollution levels, including China, India, and Bangladesh, whereas non‐CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> GHGs offset some of the gains from CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and aerosols. In terms of relative yield changes (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>), however, losses in temperate countries are larger in magnitude than gains in tropical nations. This is attributable to both (1) the large positive impact of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the tropics compared with a net near‐zero impact in the temperate zones due to the greater sensitivity of rice to fertilization relative to temperature in the tropics (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and (2) the larger response of temperate ozone to methane relative to ozone in the tropical countries of Southeast Asia shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2497-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>.
