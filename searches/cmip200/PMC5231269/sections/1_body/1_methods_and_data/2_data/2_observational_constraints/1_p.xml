<p class="p">We use four observational constraints of volume loss in SLE to fit the model: (i) the last interglacial (LIG; ∼120 kyr BP), (ii) the last glacial maximum (LGM; ∼20 kyr BP), (iii) the mid-Holocene (MH; ∼6 kyr BP), and the instrumental period (1992–2011) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0170052.s002" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). Each observational constraint is based on previously published work and interpreted as a 95% confidence interval. These ranges include: 1.8–6.0 m (LIG), -6.9–-15.8 m (LGM), -1.25–-4.0 m (MH), and 1–2.9 mm (in the year 2002). Note that the instrumental period constraint is relative to the year 1992, whereas the other constraints are relative to the 1961–1990 period. A detailed discussion of the constraints is provided in the Supporting Information (
