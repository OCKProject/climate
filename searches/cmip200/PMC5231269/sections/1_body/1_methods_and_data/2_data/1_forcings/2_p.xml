<p class="p">For projections beyond 1997, we generate forcings with the CNRM CM5 RCP8.5 temperature scenario (as obtained from the CMIP5 model output archive,

This model simulation was chosen because both surface air and ocean temperatures were projected to the year 2300 using the extended RCP8.5 scenario. The future forcings are created using details and instructions specified in a previous analysis [
