<p class="p">We adopt the DAIS (Danish Center for Earth System Science Antarctic Ice Sheet) model as a starting point for our analysis [

 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]), hence we provide just a brief overview. The DAIS model considers three important changes in the ice sheet: ice sheet volume, volume loss in sea-level equivalence (SLE), and ice sheet radius. In this model, the volume for the entire AIS changes under four mechanisms: (i) ice sheet growth from precipitation, (ii) accumulation from precipitation minus melt runoff, (iii) accumulation from precipitation minus basal melt, and (iv) ice sheet disintegration from precipitation minus melt runoff and basal melt. The simplicity of the model stems from neglecting key processes and threshold responses. For example, the model misses the link of warming temperatures to hydro-fracturing of buttressing ice shelves, collapse of ice cliffs, and abrupt changes in melting rates by surpassing tipping points. Additionally, the simplicity of the model treats the AIS as a whole rather than capturing the regional characteristics of glaciers and subglacial basins, which would help trigger the MISI (see the section “Potential explanation for the discrepancy” for more details). However, the model quantifies the ice flux (the rate at which the ice flows towards the sea) at the grounding line (location where the ice shelf begins to float; averaged for the entire AIS), the water depth at the grounding line (distance between the sea level and the grounding line; averaged for the entire AIS), and the relationship between ice sheet volume and ice sheet radius [

In the model, ice sheet volume relates to the radius based on an undisturbed bed profile referenced to present day volume and radius taking into account isostatic adjustment and its effect on the displacement of seawater by ice [
