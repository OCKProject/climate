 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] uncertainty range for the 90% confidence/credible interval. The differences between our results versus the non-model expert assessments are likely due to several reasons. For instance, the non-model expert assessments produce their estimate based on an interpretation of various model studies and scaled to account for dynamical effects, based on formal expert elicitation by conducting expert interviews, and by using maximal kinematic constraints [

 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. None of the non-model expert assessments are calibrated to a RCP8.5 or similar scenario, making comparison to these assessments difficult.
