<p class="p">Moving from the pre-calibration method to a full Bayesian inversion improves the fit of the model to the observational constraints. As perhaps expected, the more sophisticated Bayesian calibration method increases the percentage of samples passing through each individual observational constraint (
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). More importantly, we assess the hindcast skill of the model fit with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the mean and median model fit and the observational constraints. The Bayesian inversion improves the hindcast skill by reducing the root-mean square error from roughly 5.5 and 3.8 m (mean and median pre-calibration RMSE) to 0.8 m (Bayesian inversion RMSE for both mean and median).
