<p class="p">The mean hindcast produces enough melt, decrease in radius, and increase in ice flux to suggest the model triggers MISI during the LIG period. MISI occurs when oceanic and atmospheric warming causes the ice flux at the grounding line to increase and the grounding line to retreat unabated until the grounding line reaches an upsloping bed or temperatures cool enough to reform and stabilize the buttressing ice shelf (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170052.g001" class="xref">Fig 1e and 1f</xref>). The combination of the increased melt, ice flux, and water depth at the grounding line not only demonstrates that the model captures MISI, but that the model can produce enough melt to simulate a loss of the marine ice sheet (i.e., a contribution to global mean sea-level rise of more than three meters; [
