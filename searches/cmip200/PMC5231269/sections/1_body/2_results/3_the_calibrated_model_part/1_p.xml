<p class="p">The hindcast test reveals some ability to reproduce observational constraints as well as structural model discrepancies. The model does reasonably well at reproducing the width of observational constraint (95% confidence interval) during the LGM, MH, and the instrumental period (Figs

During the LIG, our calibrated model hindcasts roughly 2.9 m, or between -0.1 and 5.9 m (mean and 95% credible interval) of AIS contribution to sea level. These results indicate that our mean hindcast is roughly 26% (1 m) lower than the LIG observed data (Figs
