<p class="p">The missing key processes and characteristics in the model such as the effect of MICI, the capturing of regional characteristics, and effect of hydro-fracturing of buttressing ice-shelves are potential explanations for this discrepancy. The calibrated model produces discrepancies during periods warmer than today (i.e., LIG and 2100). During the LIG, global mean temperatures were roughly 2Â°C above today and evidence indicates a potential collapse of the marine ice sheet [

 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. As discussed in the introduction, melting and calving from warming temperatures can trigger rapid runaway retreat of the ice sheet grounded below sea level, MISI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170052.g001" class="xref">Fig 1a and 1b</xref>). MISI is highly dependent on the regional characteristics of subglacial basins. For instance, MISI can occur for the West Antarctic ice sheet based on the stability of Pine Island Glacier, Thwaites Glacier, and other glaciers. Yet, high volume losses will be defined by thresholds for the marine part of the East Antarctic ice sheet. A potential mechanism to trigger such losses faster is the MICI mechanism, which can help facilitate MISI in such marine basins and therefore ice sheet disintegration. Despite the models ability to capture MISI, the model neglects the effects of MICI and the ability to capture regional characteristics of the ice sheet. Hence missing MICI as well as the inability to estimate regional characteristics are two potential causes of the reduced melting.
