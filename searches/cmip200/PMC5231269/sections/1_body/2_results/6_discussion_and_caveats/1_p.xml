<p class="p">This analysis adopts a relatively simple model structure and neglects several potentially important sources of uncertainty. The modeling choice is motivated by the goal to produce a transparent analysis, but this simplicity also points to caveats and future research needs. For example, we analyze the question whether and how much neglecting MICI can reduce AIS melt during warming periods by comparing our results to projections from a physically more realistic model [
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], a model accounting for MICI. A more refined (but also much more involved) approach to quantify this bias would be to calibrate a model with and without MICI. Additionally, we make expert judgments of the prior range for each parameter given that there are only four data points, but 13 parameters. Imposing hard bounds potentially cuts off the tails of the posterior parameter densities, however, providing the model with far too much flexibility given the small number of data points could lead to physically unrealistic results. Furthermore, our analysis neglects the impacts of many other uncertainties (e.g., about the paleo and future forcings). For example, the sea-level curve preceding the LIG might be considerably revised/improved using more recent work (see for example, [
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]). Despite these caveats, the relative simplicity of the analysis enables the approximation of the effect of missing MICI on AIS melt in the model.
