<p class="p">Coastal areas are at risk to sea-level rise, and will be more so if the marine part of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) were to collapse. A disintegration of the marine part of the AIS would raise global mean sea level by more than three meters and hence drive an increase in flooding vulnerability in many coastal areas [
