<p class="p">Here, we calibrate a previously published and relatively simple model of AIS volume loss [
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] to reproduce a hindcast period from the last interglacial to the present using a pre-calibration method and a Bayesian inversion. The Bayesian inversion accounts for the heteroskedastic nature of the data and the model accounts for MISI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170052.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). However, the model neglects the effects of MICI and is unable to capture regional characteristics of the ice sheet. To approximate the effects of missing MICI, we compare our projections to physically more realistic models [
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] and quantify bias during the last interglacial period, when MICI was potentially triggered. In the results section, we show that our projections are comparable to some previous expert assessments [
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], yet unable to account for the sizable melt generated from a model considering MICI [
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and that our mean hindcast is unable to reproduce the estimated mean during the last interglacial. In our analysis, we deduce that missing MICI is one possible mechanism that can lead to underestimation of warming period (i.e., the last interglacial and the year 2100) melting in the AIS model.
