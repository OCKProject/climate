<p class="p">Hindcasts and projections of AIS dynamics are deeply uncertain. This uncertainty stems in part from the complexity of the coupled AIS / ocean / atmosphere systems combined with relatively sparse data and the severely limited ability to resolve relevant processes in current models [
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. For example, consider the highly vulnerable marine part of the AIS. The marine part of the AIS is vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change because it is grounded below the sea level and in direct contact with the ocean via ice shelves [

 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Ocean-ice interactions can in part drive AIS dynamics, for example, through melting of ice shelves and calving cliffs [

 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. For the part of the ice sheet grounded below sea level, this melting and calving can lead to a runaway retreat due to threshold behavior, known as Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI) [

 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. MISI is a runaway retreat of the grounding line as warming temperatures increase both the water depth and ice flux at the grounding line [
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Once started, this mechanism will continue (even in the absence of external forcings) until the grounding line reaches an upward-sloping bed or enough buttressing is exerted to stabilize the grounding line on a retrograde slope [
 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that the additional process of Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI) may facilitate MISIs and therefore ice sheet disintegration [

 <xref rid="pone.0170052.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. MICI is defined as a weakening or structural failure of shear ice cliffs as warming temperatures increase crevasses and reduce the maximum supported cliff heights [
