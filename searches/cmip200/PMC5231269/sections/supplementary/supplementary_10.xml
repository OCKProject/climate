  <title class="title">Comparison of the pre-calibrated Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) volume loss hindcast/projection during (a) the last interglacial and (b) the year presented as probability density functions versus data constraints and expert assessments.</title>
  <p class="p">The different coloured probability density functions represent realizations using different constraints (last interglacial (green), last glacial maximum (turquoise), mid-Holocene (yellow), instrumental period (blue), all the constraints (navy), and no constraints (gray)). The black range represents the reconstructed AIS contribution to global sea level during the last interglacial period. The different coloured lines are the 90% confidence/credible intervals with their estimated medians (âˆ£) from previous AIS studies. The bars in shades of green are from model assessments projected with the RCP 8.5 or similar scenario. Bars in shades of blue, highlighted in grey, are from non-model assessments.</p>
