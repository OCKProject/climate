  <title class="title">Comparison of hindcasts and projections of Antarctic ice sheet volume loss pre-calibrated with different constraints.</title>
  <p class="p">Shown are the realizations pre-calibrated with the Last interglacial constraint (green), Last glacial maximum constraint (turquoise), mid Holocene constraint (yellow), instrumental period constraint (blue), all the constraints (navy), and no constraints (gray). The brown line represented the optimized fit and the bars are the observational constraints.</p>
