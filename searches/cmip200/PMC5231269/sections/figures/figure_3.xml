  <title class="title">Comparison of the fitted Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) volume loss presented as probability density functions versus data constraints and expert assessments.</title>
  <p class="p">The gold line is the AIS volume loss hindcast/projection in this study. The black range represents the reconstructed AIS observational constraints and the different colored horizontal bars are the 90% confidence/credible intervals with their estimated medians (âˆ£) from expert assessments. The bars in shades of green are from model assessments projected with the RCP8.5 or similar scenario. Bars in shades of blue, highlighted in grey, are from non-model assessments.</p>
