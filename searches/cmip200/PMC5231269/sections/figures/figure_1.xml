  <title class="title">Indication of Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI) triggered in the model during the last interglacial (130 to 110 kyr BP).</title>
  <p class="p">The illustration in panel a and b depict a schematic cross section of an ice sheet approaching the MISI. Ice flows from the grounded ice to the floating ice shelf. As surface runoff, calving, and basal melt increase (a to b) the flow across the grounding line increases and the grounding line retreats rapidly further inland unabated (red arrow). In the model, MISI occurs during the last interglacial period when there is (c) deglacial retreat as the (d) radius decreases, the (e) water depth at the grounding line increases, and the (f) ice flux across the grounding line strongly increases.</p>
