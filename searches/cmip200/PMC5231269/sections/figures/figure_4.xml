  <title class="title">Comparison of the fitted Antarctic ice sheet volume loss to projections considering Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI).</title>
  <p class="p">The gold line and envelope represent the mean and ± 1σ credible interval produced in this study neglecting cliff instability. The red and blue line and bar represent the mean and the ± 1σ projection in the year 2100 from a physically more realistic model [
