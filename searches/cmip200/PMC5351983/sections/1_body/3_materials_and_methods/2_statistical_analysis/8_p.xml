<p class="p">We highlighted the PCA results in fig. S1. PC6, related to Arctic sea ice forcing, was the most important, contributing 29% to the 2013 PPI extreme over the ECP region, and explained 12% of the total variance in detrended PPI. PC5, related to Eurasian snow forcing and the Siberian High variability, was the second most important, contributing 13% to the 2013 PPI extreme, and explained 34% of the total variance. PC2, related to ENSO, was the third most important, contributing 8% to the 2013 PPI extreme, and explained 28% of the total variance. We added the PPI linear trend back to the contributions in fig. S1B. The PCA-reconstructed PPI explained most of the variations of the original PPI time series as well as the extreme in 2013, thereby placing the 2013 extreme in the context of the changes in the last 35 years. From 1981 to 2015, it was only in 2013 that the contributions of all three PCs are relatively large and, more importantly, all positive.</p>
