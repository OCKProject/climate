<p class="p">We applied the MCA (
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>) to the PPI and Z850 fields to identify dominant circulation patterns affecting PPI over the ECP region. The MCA method performs a singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix of two variables to generate the coupled modes for the two variables separated in space and time dimensions. The temporal matrices are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>, and the spatial matrices are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> (B and C). The covariance of the two variables was maximized in the first mode. In our case, the first coupled MCA modes explained 33% of the covariance between the Z850 and PPI fields, 23% of the Z850 variance, and 35% of the PPI variance. These MCA modes and results remained consistent in a sensitivity test in which the 2013 data were excluded.
