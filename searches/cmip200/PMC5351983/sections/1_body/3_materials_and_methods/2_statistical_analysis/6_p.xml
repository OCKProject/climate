<p class="p">The correlation coefficients of PCs with the detrended PPI in table S4 show similar results, that is, that PC2, PC5, and PC6 are the most significant PCs. The correlation coefficients of PCs with climate indices are also shown. Of particular interest to this study were the high correlations of SCE with PC5 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.83) and of SIC with PC6 (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = âˆ’0.80).
