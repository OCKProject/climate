<p class="p">Statistical significance tests were used extensively throughout this study. We applied the moving block bootstrap method (
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>) to examine whether the January wind speed, the temperature gradient, and the Z850 daily data of 2013 are statistically different from the 30-year (1981 to 2010) climatological January data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figs. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>. The moving block bootstrap method removes biases introduced by autocorrelation of the data of time length 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic> or shorter (
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>). We first collected the daily NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data (
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">11</italic>
 </xref>) and then regenerated the moving block bootstrap samples for each grid point with a block length of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic> = 5 days and a sampling size of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5000. The null hypothesis was that the 2013 data and the 30-year data were statistically from the same probability distribution with equal means. For those grid points with 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values less than 0.01 (or 0.05), we rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that the values in 2013 over these areas were significantly different from the climatology at the 99% (or 95%) significance level. The same method was also applied to examine the significance of surface temperature anomalies in December 2012 in daily reanalysis data of fig. S4.
