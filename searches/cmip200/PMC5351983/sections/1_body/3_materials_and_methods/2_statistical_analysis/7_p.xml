<p class="p">Note that the PCA was only applied to climate indices. The relationship between climate PC and detrended PPI was established using the PCR analysis. Therefore, the PCs explaining a large portion of the variance of climate indices were not necessarily correlated with PPI. For example, PC1 contributed most to the total variance of the matrix of climate indices, but it did not make significant contribution to the variance of detrended PPI. Interested readers are referred to a previous study (
