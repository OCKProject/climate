<p class="p">We used the standard bootstrapping method (
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>) to estimate the significance of correlation coefficients in table S2, PPI sensitivity responses in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, and modeling surface air temperature responses in fig. S4 because all the time series used here were the monthly mean data of each year. For example, we estimated the correlation coefficients and their significance levels in table S2 on the basis of the empirical distribution of
