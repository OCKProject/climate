<p class="p">Finally, we examined the ensemble results of the CESM1-CAM5 model (with three ensemble members) as well as its subset CCSM4 (with six ensemble members) in the CMIP5 project (

 </xref>) based on their historical simulations (1980 to 2005) and future projections (2006 to 2100) under a medium mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) (table S6). We chose these two models because of their similarity with the model that we used in our sensitivity experiments. All the indices, including the cryospheric forcing in early seasons and PPI in January, were estimated in the same manner as described before. We then compared the correlation coefficients between the simulated cryospheric forcing and PPI with those based on reanalysis data to evaluate the modeling capability to reproduce the observed relationships. The differences between CMIP5 simulations and observations are discussed in Results.
