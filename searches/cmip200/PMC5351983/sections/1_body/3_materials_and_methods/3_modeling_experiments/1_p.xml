<p class="p">The CESM (version 1.2.1) is a fully coupled global climate model maintained by the Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory at the NCAR. We designed four experiments to investigate the impacts of cryospheric forcing on PPI over the ECP region using the component set of the CAM5 and the Community Land Model version 4.0 at a horizontal resolution of 1.9° × 2.5°. In the CTRL experiment, we conducted a 30-year simulation (with another 1-year simulation as spin-up) with prescribed climatological (averaged from 1981 to 2010) Arctic SIC (fig. S2) and SST from the Met Office Hadley Centre (HadISST) (

 </xref>). In sensitivity simulations, we used January of each modeling year from the CTRL simulation as initial conditions for the corresponding sensitivity ensemble member and conducted a 14-month simulation with different cryospheric forcing. We analyzed the continuous December-January-February (DJF) data at the end of each sensitivity simulation to examine the seasonal impact of the cryospheric forcing. In the first sensitivity experiment (SENS1), we replaced the climatological SIC and SST data from August to November, which were used in the CTRL experiment, with observed cyclical (August 2012 to November 2012) HadISST data (

Therefore, we considered the snow forcing including the surface albedo effect and the insulation-related effect (for example, thermal conductivity and latent heat flux due to snow depth changes) in SENS2, both of which could cause significant local temperature response (

S2). In the third sensitivity experiment (SENS3), we added both Arctic sea ice and boreal snow perturbations into the ensemble simulations to investigate their synergistic effects.
