<p class="p">To obtain the intensity of the dominant MCA modes in simulated Z850 and PPI fields, we projected the modeling fields onto the spatial patterns of the first MCA modes identified in the reanalysis data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, B and C) and estimated the MCA mode intensity of each ensemble member. The density distributions of the first pairwise MCA modes in fig. S3 were estimated by the two-dimensional kernel density estimation (kde2d) function included in the math package of R. By comparing density distributions of the sensitivity experiments to the control experiment, we evaluated the response sensitivities of both geopotential height and PPI fields to the specific cryospheric forcing.
