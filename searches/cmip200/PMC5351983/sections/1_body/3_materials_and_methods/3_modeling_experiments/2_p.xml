<p class="p">After numerical simulations, we calculated WSI, ATGI, and PPI over the ECP region for each scenario using the same method as that for reanalysis data. The CAM5 model uses a hybrid sigma-pressure vertical coordinate; thus, we extracted the modeling outputs at the nearest pressure levels to the reanalysis data in the calculation. The 30-year CTRL results were used as the climatological condition against which sensitivity results were compared. To evaluate the seasonal impact of cryospheric forcing, we had
