<p class="p">If the decrease of Arctic sea ice and the increase of Eurasian snowfall continue, we expect more frequent occurrences of extremely poor ventilation conditions in winter over eastern China, which will reduce the efficacy of the emission control currently being implemented (

A repeat of the January 2013 weather condition will pose a much bigger challenge for regional emission control than the 2008 Summer Olympics Games because PM can be readily removed by rain events in summer and a faster summer ventilation rate also reduces the pollution contribution from regional accumulation compared to that in winter.
