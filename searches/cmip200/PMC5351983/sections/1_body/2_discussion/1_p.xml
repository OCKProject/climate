<p class="p">The winter cold extremes and heavy snowfalls in northern high latitudes are partially attributable to Arctic sea ice loss (

The surface temperature anomalies are particularly apparent in northern Eurasia, with strong warming over the Arctic and cooling over boreal Eurasia in the subsequent months, and model sensitivity results suggest that its formation is attributable to both Arctic sea ice and Eurasia snow forcing (fig. S4). Previous studies suggest that stratosphere-troposphere coupling is critical in climate responses over mid-latitude regions to polar forcing (
