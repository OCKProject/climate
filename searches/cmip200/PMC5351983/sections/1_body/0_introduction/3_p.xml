<p class="p">This study aims to place the occurrence of the January 2013 extreme haze in the context of historical ventilation conditions in the last 35 years. The region of East China Plains (ECPs; 112°E to 122°E, 30°N to 41°N; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>) is the focus of this study. The region hosts a large portion of the Chinese population and suffers from severe air pollution problems. It resembles a horseshoe-shaped basin, where the ventilation of air pollutants relies on large-scale weather systems (

 </xref>), we first compute a normalized near-surface wind speed index (WSI) for horizontal ventilation and a potential air temperature gradient index (ATGI) for vertical ventilation and then construct a synthetic meteorological index—pollution potential index (PPI)—to better quantify the synergistic effect of ventilation on regional air pollution in January. We then explore the relationship between PPI and regional climate variability through comprehensive statistical approaches including maximum covariance analysis (MCA) (

We also conduct sensitivity simulations using the state-of-the-science Community Earth System Model (CESM) and examine the modeling results from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) (
