<p class="p">A consequence of rapid economic growth in China is a deterioration of air quality. An air pollution record was set in January 2013, with unprecedented large-scale haze lasting almost an entire month. During this so-called “airpocalypse” period, ~70% of the 74 major cities exceeded the daily PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less; see table S1 for a list of all acronyms) ambient air quality standard of China (75 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>), with the maximum daily PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> reaching 766 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> and the monthly mean concentration reaching as high as 130 μg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> (
