  <italic class="italic">13</italic>
 </xref>) using CESM1-CAM5 (the Community Atmosphere Model version 5) and CCSM4 (the Community Climate System Model version 4) models. Although the SIC hindcast agrees well with the observations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4A</xref>), the increase of cryospheric forcing is underestimated in the climate models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4C</xref>), which is largely attributed to the modelâ€™s failure to reproduce the observed increase of early winter boreal snow (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref>). The maximum simulated correlation coefficient between simulated PPI and CFI barely reaches that between observed PPI and SIC (|
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>| = 0.43; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4E</xref>), which is much lower than the observed value of 0.65 in the last 35 years. The reason is that both the observations and CESM sensitivity simulations suggest that increasing snowfalls tend to increase PPI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and table S2). However, the CMIP5-simulated early winter SCE over Eurasia shows a consistently decreasing trend (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4B</xref>), in contrast to the observed increasing trend (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">27</italic>
 </xref>), leading to a failure of the CMIP5 models to project high PPI values in response to the rapid increases of SCE and CFI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4D</xref>). Consequently, these climate projections underestimate the climate penalty and the benefit of climate change mitigation on wintertime air quality over eastern China.
