<p class="p">To examine the atmospheric processes linking cryospheric changes to PPI, we apply the MCA (
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>), which is totally independent from the PCA, to analyze the association of mid-latitude to high-latitude synoptic weather patterns [the 850-hPa geopotential height (Z850) field of the reanalysis data] with PPI (see Materials and Methods for details). We note that the formulation of PPI is not directly related to the Z850 field, that the region of interest for the gridded PPI field (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>) is of a smaller domain than that for the Z850 field (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>), and that the MCA modes remain the same if the 2013 data are excluded from the analysis. The most dominant coupling modes of the Z850 and PPI fields account for &gt;30% of the total covariance. The highest Z850 and PPI mode intensity also corresponds to the extreme PPI value in 2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). The spatial pattern of the first MCA Z850 mode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>) resembles the circulation anomaly in 2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>). Similarly, the spatial pattern of the first MCA PPI mode resembles the PPI distribution in 2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, the time series of the first MCA PPI mode intensity is highly correlated with the average PPI over the ECP region (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.93). Therefore, the extreme condition of 2013 can be understood using the more general MCA modes; that is, the poor ventilation condition over the ECP region represented by the first MCA PPI mode is driven by the regional circulation pattern represented by the first MCA Z850 mode. In contrast to the climatology characterized by large pressure gradients between the continent and the oceans (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>), the first MCA Z850 mode shows a reversed northeast-southwest pressure gradient with anticyclonic anomalies in the Arctic and northeast Asia and a cyclonic anomaly over central Siberia, leading to weakened monsoon wind and enhanced PPI over the ECP region.
