<p class="p">The 2013 event is therefore a manifestation of the first MCA mode characterized by poor ventilation over the ECP region. It is plausible that cryospheric forcing due to Arctic sea ice and Eurasian snowfall identified in the PCA enhances the first MCA Z850 mode, leading to high PPI and hence heavy haze over the ECP region. To test this hypothesis, we designed sensitivity simulations using the state-of-the-science CESM (version 1.2.1). We conducted a 30-year control (CTRL) run with prescribed climatological Arctic sea ice and sea surface temperature (SST) (
