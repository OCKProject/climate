<p class="p">To investigate the association of climate variability to the PPI extreme, we apply the PCA (

 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
 </xref>), for the past three decades (1980 to 2015; see Materials and Methods and table S3 for details). The long-term records of PPI and climate variables are necessary for climate-related analysis. We note that the construction of PPI is not directly related to any atmospheric variable or forcing factor used here. Unlike the other years, all related PCs contribute positively to the 2013 extreme, and the large contributors PC5 and PC6 are correlated with SCE and SIC, respectively (fig. S1 and table S4). As in the case of PPI, we construct a normalized cryospheric forcing index (CFI), which is an average of correlation weighted SIC and SCE (see Materials and Methods for details). As such, we have one representative variable for cryospheric forcing discussion. CFI can explain 42% of the total PPI variance (table S2). In 2013, the large CFI extreme corresponds well to the PPI extreme (
