<p class="p">The intensity distributions of the first MCA modes of Z850 and PPI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) in the ensemble simulations are symmetrical in the CTRL run because of internal model variability (fig. S3). These modes clearly shift to higher intensities, toward the 2013 anomaly when Arctic sea ice and Eurasian snow forcing are added, confirming that the cryospheric forcing provides conducive conditions for extreme haze over the ECP region. These modes respond more to Arctic sea ice forcing than to Eurasian snow forcing (fig. S3), likely reflecting in part the difference between climate model simulations and reanalysis data.
