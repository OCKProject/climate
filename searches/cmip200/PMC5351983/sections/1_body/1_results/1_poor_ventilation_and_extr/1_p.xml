<p class="p">In January 2013, the ECP region was characterized by large negative surface wind speed anomalies (weakened horizontal dispersion; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>) and positive potential air temperature gradient anomalies (more stable atmosphere with weakened vertical convection; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1D</xref>). Although precipitation is also an important factor to remove PM through wet scavenging, previous studies indicated less significant dependence of PM concentrations on precipitation in winter (

 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">

 </xref>). To simplify the multivariate statistical analysis, we construct a synthetic meteorological index, PPI, as a correlation weighted average of WSI and ATGI (hereafter, WSI, ATGI, and PPI are regionally averaged over the ECP region if not noted otherwise; see Materials and Methods for details). The PM
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> data suggest roughly equal weighting of horizontal ventilation (WSI) and vertical ventilation (ATGI) indices in PPI. The new proxy (PPI) correlates better with ground observations such as PM

 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.92), PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.79), and ViI (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.62) than satellite AOD data (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.43 to 0.50; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref> and table S2), indicating that PPI is more representative for near-surface air quality than column aerosol loading. In a historical perspective, both calculated PPI and observed ViI show that the January 2013 extreme haze is unprecedented in the last 30 years (
