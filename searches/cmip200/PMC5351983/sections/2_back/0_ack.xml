We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme’s Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modeling groups (listed in table S6 of this paper) for producing their model output and making it available. For CMIP, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provided coordinating support and led the development of software infrastructure in partnership with the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals. We also thank Y. Peings, X. Li, and Z. Xie for helpful discussion on statistical data analysis and climate sensitivity experiments.
