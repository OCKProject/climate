  <p class="p">Schematic of identified regions with names and cluster numbers. The depth‐coherent area implies a coherent vertical structure in Cluster 1. The quasi‐Sverdrupian gyre in Cluster 3 is unique due to lack of bottom pressure torque (BPT). The interior flow, vertical, in Cluster 4 has a stronger momentum driven portion of the BPT, and topographic interactions begin to become important. The interior flow in Cluster 2 has a stronger baroclinic component to the BPT and feels topography. The interior flow, Southern Ocean, in Cluster 4 is like the interior flow in Cluster 2, but with contributions of opposite sign. The remainder is dominated by nonlinear contributions, and the barotropic interpretation is not appropriate.</p>
