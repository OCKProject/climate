<p class="p">The largest cluster, accounting for 43% of the global ocean (Cluster 1 in Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a), is determined by a balance between wind stress curl and bottom torque. This depth‐coherent “negative wind curl/bottom torque” region is found primarily in zonal streaks in the tropics, and in a thin ribbon in the Southern Ocean mainly in the Pacific sector. In the Northern Hemisphere, Cluster 1 areas surround the subtropical and subpolar gyres. Large areas of the Arctic Seas are also in this Cluster. Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b demonstrates that the balance of terms is dominantly between the input of negative vorticity by the wind‐stress curl largely balanced by the positive input by the bottom interaction terms.
