<p class="p">A summary of the area of the remaining clusters that account for 9% of the world ocean is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>e: “Dominantly nonlinear.” Separate clusters have different colors. Areas of rough bathymetry stand out, such as the Pacific‐Antarctic Ridge and the Drake Passage area. Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>f is the overall average, illustrating that the nonlinear contribution to the barotropic vorticity dominates, together with the Coriolis term. The different constituents are quite varied, but strong contributions from the nonlinear torque are consistently present. Their detailed discussion is the subject of a subsequent study.
