 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c: Interior flow “positive wind curl/beta and bottom torque”), where the wind stress curl inputs positive vorticity, nearly balanced by the beta and bottom interaction terms. In the Northern Hemisphere, this cluster covers the southern extent of the subpolar gyres. A zonal streak crosses the equator in both the Atlantic and Pacific, but is absent in the Indian Ocean. The Southern Hemisphere has large Cluster 2 expanses in both the Pacific and Atlantic, but again not in the Indian Ocean.
