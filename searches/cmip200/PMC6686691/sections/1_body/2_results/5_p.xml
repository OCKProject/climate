 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> isolate the geographical area (left column) for each cluster determined as distinct by the 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>‐means algorithm. From this geographical area, the area‐weighted histogram is computed (right column) across all terms of the BV equation. These histograms relate the clusters to different dynamical regimes, illustrated in Figure
