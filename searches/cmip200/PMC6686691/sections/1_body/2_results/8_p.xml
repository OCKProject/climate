 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>e (Quasi‐Sverdrupian “negative wind torque/beta effect”). In Sverdrup balance, the wind torque and the beta effect are the only important terms. This theoretical relation is seen in Cluster 3 in the subtropical gyres where they are expected, together with regions in the Southern Ocean that the classical theory did not consider. Dominant areas in the subtropical gyres in the Northern Hemisphere Atlantic and Pacific stand out, together with thin streaks on the equator. Isolated streaks are seen in the Southern Ocean, and in a large area of the Southern Hemisphere tropical Indian Ocean. This region might be considered also as corresponding to quasi‐Sverdrup balance.
