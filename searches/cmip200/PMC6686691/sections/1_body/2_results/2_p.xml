<p class="p">The closure in ECCOv4 for the 20‐year average of the BV terms in equation 
 <xref rid="ess2278-disp-0003" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(3)</xref> is illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. Individual terms are of order ±10
 <sup class="sup">−9</sup> m s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and the residual has magnitude of less than ±10
 <sup class="sup">−12</sup> m/s. For 36% of the ocean the residual is ≪1% (Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This small residual permits going forward with confidence. Some numerical issues do exist on the continental shelf and in shallow water generally, but these regions only amount to 3% of the area of the global ocean and will be ignored.
