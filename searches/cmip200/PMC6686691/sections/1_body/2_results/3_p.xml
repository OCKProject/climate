 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>d. The remainder is largely found in the nonlinear BV contributions seen in Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>e, with the lateral viscous dissipation largely being an order of magnitude smaller, apart from localized regions in the Southern Ocean. Wind and bottom stress BV terms in Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>d are largely zonally symmetric, with large patterns of negative BV in the Southern Ocean, and large gyre patterns visible in the Pacific and Atlantic basins. BPT in Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c is associated with interactions with steep bathymetry. For example, in the Southern Ocean a large positive patch leads toward the Antarctic‐Pacific ridge, with a negative patch beyond. This structure is consistent with vortex stretching as circulation crosses the ridge. Along Western Boundaries, BPT is positive to the west and negative just adjacent to the east, consistent with studies such as Myers et al. (

 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>e is concentrated along the western edge of basins where WBCs are found, but it is less spatially coherent than the BPT term. Large activity stands out in the Southern Ocean region, particularly in the Atlantic sector. Lateral viscous dissipation is small.
