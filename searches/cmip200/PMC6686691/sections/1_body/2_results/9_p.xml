<p class="p">Cluster 4 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a: Interior flow, vertical, “positive wind torque, beta and bottom stress”), covers 7% of the ocean and is a complement to Cluster 1. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Cluster largely represents the northern edge of the subpolar gyre. In the Southern Hemisphere, it is found on the eastern edge of the Pacific and Atlantic basins, just to the south, and flaring out westward of the continental barrier. In the Indian Ocean, this barrier can be seen to be New Zealand. The area of this dynamical regime fills the subtropical Indian Ocean down to the border with the Southern Ocean, where this regime is absent. Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b illustrates that it is an amplified version of the dominant terms seen in Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d, being an order of magnitude larger, but still having the wind as the major source of barotropic vorticity, with sinks in the Coriolis term and BPT. A small source exists in the nonlinear torque.
