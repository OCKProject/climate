<p class="p">Our goal is to determine the spatial patterns that correspond to various balances between the dominant terms of the BV equation. Various combinations of terms dominate the BV equation in different regions, and spatial patterns emerge, which we seek to determine. Clustering identifies groups in data based on how the data are distributed in parameter space, the dimensions of which are defined by a set of chosen variables (or “features” as they are also called in the machine learning literature such as ; Kubat, 
 <xref rid="ess2278-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In this application, the terms of the BV equation are used to define the dimensions of the parameter space in which the clusters are identified. If groups of dominant terms are present that differ significantly, a robust separation into distinct “clusters” is feasible. For each cluster, the area‐weighted histogram is calculated of the values of each term in the BV equation. Next, the clusters are sorted by the amount of geographical area that they cover using a sorting algorithm, associating the name of the cluster as listed in Table 
 <xref rid="ess2278-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. This focuses on those clusters that featured clearly different balances between terms in the BV equation.
