<p class="p">Five regions cover 91% of the world ocean. Residual areas collected here as “dominantly nonlinear” have a small spatial extent, but are dynamically important in the overall circulation. These regions include the Drake Passage region as well as the Antarctic‐Pacific Ridge regions where the circulation interacts with topography and cross frontal transport likely takes place. In the Northern Hemisphere, areas in the Labrador Sea and on the continental shelf stand out as nonlinear. These nonlinear regions will be the subject of a separate study at higher resolution.</p>
