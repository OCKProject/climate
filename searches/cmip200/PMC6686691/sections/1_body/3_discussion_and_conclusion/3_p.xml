<p class="p">In the North Atlantic Ocean, results are generally consistent with the inferences of the relative magnitude of the terms of the BV equation (Schoonover et al.,

Cluster analysis reveals a shift from a barotropic flow in Clusters 1 and 3, to a strong interior flow (baroclinic meridional, North Atlantic Current, and North Atlantic Deep Water, and flow over the Mid Atlantic Ridge) in Clusters 2 and 4. Globally, the clustering illustrates that strong interior flow is present in vast expanses of the Southern Hemisphere, as well as in the North Pacific. Cluster 4 coincides with regions identified by Lumpkin and Speer (

The quasi‚ÄêSverdrupian regime in Cluster 3 is not present in the South Atlantic and Pacific. In the Southern Ocean Clusters 3 and 5 dominate, with significant nonlinear contributions.
