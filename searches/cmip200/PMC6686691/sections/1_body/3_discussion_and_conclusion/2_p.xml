<p class="p">In the ECCOv4 state estimate, the barotropic vorticity equation closes very accurately. The 20‐year time average ECCOv4 state estimate, was analyzed globally using 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>‐means clustering to find regions dominated by groups of balanced terms in the BV equation. Large regions of the global ocean exhibit structures of consistent term balances as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="ess2278-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. Those balances vary among the wind stress, Coriolis, and BPT terms. Areas where the nonlinear torque are small suggest that the linearized BV is a good approximation. Areas where the nonlinear torque are important are found in western boundary regions, as well as the Southern Ocean where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current interacts with bathymetric obstacles. The momentum‐dominated area (Cluster 1) implies a coherent vertical structure. Cluster 3 mainly in the subtropical gyre is unique in lacking significant contributions by BPT, implying it is shielded from topography. Transition zones have a stronger momentum‐driven portion of the BPT and topographic interactions to become important. Cluster 4 has a stronger baroclinic component to the BPT, feeling topography. The Southern Ocean Cluster is like Cluster 2, but with contributions of opposite sign. Important nonlinear contributions are present in the remaining ocean, and the linearized barotropic interpretation is not appropriate.
