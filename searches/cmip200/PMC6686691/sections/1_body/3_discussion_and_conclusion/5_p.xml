<p class="p">The sign and spatial distribution of the wind stress term suggests the importance of Ekman pumping (negative) or suction (positive). Equatorial and Southern Ocean regions show Ekman pumping, whereas the subpolar gyre areas have Ekman suction where mode waters are created. The BPT term mirrors the wind stress term, suggesting it acts as either a source or a sink in opposite complement to the wind stress. A lack of symmetry in wind driven gyres in the Southern and Northern Hemisphere show that the gyres are not driven solely by the sign of the Ekman pumping. This complex relationship among the terms is the subject of future study.</p>
