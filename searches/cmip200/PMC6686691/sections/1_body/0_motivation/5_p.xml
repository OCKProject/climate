 <xref rid="ess2278-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) used linear statistical models to infer patterns suggestive of global regimes. The present work extends the pattern determination methodology, as working only with data from the surface limits the application to a comprehensive assessment of global dynamical regimes. Use of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimate extends the previous surface data analyses to the full three dimensions of the ocean.
