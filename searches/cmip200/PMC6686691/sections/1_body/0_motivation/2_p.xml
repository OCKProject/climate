<p class="p">Before the advent of modern observational and modeling techniques, understanding of the physical/dynamical state of the ocean focused on large‐scale quasi‐laminar descriptions such as Sverdrup balance, abyssal recipes, or Stommel‐Arons flows (Munk,

Recent advances in instrumentation and modeling capability have revealed that ocean physics is characterized by complex spatial and temporal variability. It is possible that every location in the ocean has a unique physical state depending upon many factors, including local topography, meteorology, proximity to eastern and western boundaries, or latitude, rendering any global scale interpretation lacking in general applicability.
