<p class="p">The ocean is spatially and temporally diverse, but delineating spatial and temporal commonalities and continuities are central to understanding emergent patterns that lead to a global geography of dynamical regimes. Dominant physics underlying the emergent patterns become evident when common features are identified. This note's purpose is to explore unsupervised machine learning as a method for depicting and understanding the gross features of global oceanic physics. The study is restricted to the barotropic vorticity (BV) balance of a time mean global circulation as calculated from a noneddy resolving state estimate (Fukumori et al.,
