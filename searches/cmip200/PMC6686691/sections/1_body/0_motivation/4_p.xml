<p class="p">The presence of differing dynamical regimes is already suggested by the known structures of the wind‚Äêstress forcing and the geometry of the ocean basins, including the underlying topography. Classifying and identifying regions in the world ocean is done here using the variations in the dominant terms of the BV budget, following the demonstration that the global budget can be closed. Schoonover et al. (

 <xref rid="ess2278-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) have assessed the dynamics of the BV budget focusing on the North Atlantic Ocean variability and sensitivity to resolution, respectively. Here the procedures are global.
