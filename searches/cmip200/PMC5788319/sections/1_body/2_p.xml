 </sup> but the purpose of the present study is to examine how GMST variability may or may not change as the underlying climate warms. We perform detailed analysis on an experiment utilizing the fully-coupled GFDL CM3 climate model, and we supplement this with results from an atmosphere-only GFDL AM3 experiment as well as relevant results from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)
