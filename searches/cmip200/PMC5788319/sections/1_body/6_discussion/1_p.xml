<p id="P18" class="p">We show here that the magnitude of low-frequency unforced GMST variability is substantially reduced in the GFDL CM3 climate model after a doubling of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from preindustrial levels and that the mechanisms responsible for that variability are fundamentally altered. In particular, the modes of variability primarily responsible for generating GMST variability are shifted in space, and the net flow of energy associated with unforced warming events changes from being into the climate system to out of the climate system (vice-versa for unforced cooling events). We find that a primary reason for this shift is the reduction in high-latitude surface albedo variability which results from a climatological reduction in albedo. Finally, we find that local variability over many tropical and subtropical land areas increases with global warming despite the reduction in GMST variability.
