<p id="P20" class="p">Thus, we emphasize that the results from GFDL CM3 model should not necessarily be interpreted as a robust quantitative forecast of future variability change. Instead the results of this study serve to demonstrate that the magnitude and mechanisms of unforced GMST variability may depend critically on the climatological GMST. This finding indicates that some traditional means of studying GMST variability (e.g., investigating preindustrial control runs or paleo-reconstructions of past variability) may be of limited utility for surmising information on the behavior of unforced GMST variability in a warmer climate.</p>
