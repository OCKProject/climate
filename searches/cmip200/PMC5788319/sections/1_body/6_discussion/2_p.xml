<p id="P19" class="p">A number of caveats should be stressed with regard to this study. Reasons for caution include the attribute that the GFDL CM3 model has unusually large GMST variability in its preindustrial control run

As discussed above, the CMIP5 models investigated here show a smaller mean change in unforced GMST variability between their preindustrial control and RCP8.5 runs (~3% per K of climatological GMST warming on average compared to ~9% per K of climatological GMST warning in GFDL-CM3). Also, climate models differ substantially in the geographic origin and generating mechanisms of their unforced GMST variability
