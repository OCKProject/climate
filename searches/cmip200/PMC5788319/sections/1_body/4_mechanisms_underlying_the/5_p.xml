 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run exhibits GMST variability that is associated with the model’s AMO (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1e</xref>). This is consistent with an enhanced contribution of North Atlantic latent and sensible heat flux to GMST variability in this run (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run is also characterized by a positive change in the contribution of ↓N to GMST variability over the North Atlantic (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3e, 3b</xref>). Despite this local increase, there is an overall reduction in the ↓N contribution to GMST variability between the preindustrial and 2×CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> runs primarily due to a reduction over the Southern Ocean (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>). Specifically, over the Southern Ocean, climatological GMST warming is associated with a reduction in the climatological sea ice extent and associated climatological albedo (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). This causes a reduced contribution of ↓clear SW (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3c</xref>) and thus ↓N to GMST variability. Seasonally, the summer half-year produces most of the radiative change (cf. 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplementary Figs. 7i and 7o</xref>) because of the vast seasonal difference in incident solar radiation at high latitudes.
