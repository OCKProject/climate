<p id="P13" class="p">The changes in the magnitude and mechanisms of GMST variability apparent in the GFDL CM3 model are qualitatively reproduced in aggregate results from a subset of other CMIP5 models (see Methods, 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Specifically, we find that CMIP5 models show a statistically significant (at the 90% confidence level), 26% reduction in the magnitude of GMST variability (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>) between their preindustrial control runs and the 2200–2300 time period of their RCP8.5 runs. This amounts to a ~3% reduction in GMST variability per K of climatological GMST warming. Also, qualitatively consistent with the GFDL-CM3 model, the reduction in GMST variability largely emerges from a reduction in the high-latitude contribution to this variability (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>) which stems from a reduction in the ↓clear SW contribution to GMST variability (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">supplementary Fig. 12c</xref>). It has been shown that CMIP5 model spread in the magnitude of GMST variability primarily originates from differences in simulated variability at high latitudes

 </sup>. Thus, a proportionately larger reduction in high-latitude variability in a warmer climate also reduces inter-model spread in GMST variability (
