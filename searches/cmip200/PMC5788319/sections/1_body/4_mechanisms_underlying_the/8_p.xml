<p id="P14" class="p">The CMIP5 models investigated here, however, show a large diversity in their GMST variability response to climatological GMST warming. At one end of the range, MPI-ESM-LR, bcc-cms1-1, and CCSM4 simulate ~55%, ~50% and ~44% reductions in GMST variability between their preindustrial control and RCP8.5 runs (all ~6% reduction per K of climatological GMST warming). On the other end of the continuum, the CNRM-CM5 model shows a ~7% increase in GMST variability between the two runs (~1% increase per K GMST warming). Future work is required to understand this range of model behavior.</p>
