<p id="P10" class="p">In the 2×CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run, the relationship between GMST, ↓N, and ↑Q is fundamentally altered. Specifically, in the 2×CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run, anomalous GMST warmth tends to be preceded for several years by negative ↓N values, in direct contrast to the preindustrial control run. This alteration of the relationship between GMST and anomalous energy flow can be traced primarily to changes in the summer half-year (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run experiences a large reduction in the ↓clear SW component’s contribution to GMST change (cf. blue dashed line in

 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>), which is primarily due to a reduction in its summertime magnitude (cf. blue dashed line in 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplementary Figs. 2c and 2d</xref>). This effect is also apparent in the net surface shortwave component (cf. blue dashed line in
