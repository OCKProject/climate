<p id="P8" class="p">In the preindustrial control run, positive ↓N anomalies tend to precede positive GMST anomalies in time (black solid line in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>) and negative ↑Q anomalies tend to precede positive GMST anomalies in time (black solid line in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>) indicating a tendency for net flow of energy from space to the ocean concurrent with unforced GMST warming events. This relationship suggests that internally generated ↓N imbalances tend to enhance GMST variability. Of the four linearly additive components of ↓N [clear-sky shortwave (↓clear SW); clear-sky longwave (↓clear LW); cloud radiative effect shortwave (↓cloud SW); cloud radiative effect longwave (↓cloud LW); see Methods], only the ↓clear LW damps GMST variability (red solid line in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>). Both the ↓cloud LW and ↓cloud SW shortwave components enhance GMST variability, but the largest amplifying contribution comes from the ↓clear SW (blue dashed line 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>). The shortwave components of the energy budget, both at the TOA and the surface (blue dashed line in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>), tend to
