<p id="P2" class="p">Global mean surface air temperature (GMST) is one of the most well-recognized metrics of climate change both contemporarily as well as through deep time. On centennial timescales, positive external radiative forcings, mostly due to increased concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gasses, are currently causing pronounced GMST warming

 </sup>. However, unforced GMST change, which is spontaneously generated from interactions internal to the ocean-atmosphere-land system, superimposes variability on this long-term warming that can alternatively mask or exaggerate externally forced signals for years to decades at a time
