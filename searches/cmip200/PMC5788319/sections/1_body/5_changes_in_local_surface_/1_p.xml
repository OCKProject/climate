 </sup>. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate whether the noted decrease in GMST variability apparent in GFDL CM3 and the CMIP5 experiments applies uniformly to the entirety of the Earth’s surface or if there is substantial spatial heterogeneity.

Consistent with the results above, there is a large decrease in local variability over the Arctic and Southern Oceans associated with a reduction in climatological sea ice extent. The reduction of sea ice should reduce local SAT variability both because it reduces the propensity for albedo variability but also because the open ocean represents greatly enhanced surface heat capacity compared to sea ice
