<p id="P16" class="p">In contrast to the reduced SAT variability at high latitudes, a large fraction of tropical and subtropical land areas actually experience an increase in variability between the preindustrial control and 2Ã—CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> runs. A similar effect is also seen in a supplementary model run where a free running atmosphere was forced with a uniform +4K increase in sea surface temperatures (

 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>). The consistency of this effect between these different sets of experiments indicates that the enhancement of local SAT variability over some land regions is primarily driven by the climatological warming itself rather than resulting from particular changes in large-scale ocean-atmosphere-sea-ice modes of variability or in the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature warming.
