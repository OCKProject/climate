 </sup> on GMST variability, which are locations that have a statistically significant relationship between local SAT and GMST variability, have local SAT variability that tends to lead GMST variability in time, and have local SAT variability that tend to enhance the magnitude of GMST variability. In the preindustrial control run, low-frequency GMST variability (hereafter, GMST variability) is primarily associated with SAT variability over the Southern Ocean and Antarctica (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1d</xref>). In the 2×CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run, however, the origin of GMST variability shifts to be almost exclusively Northern Hemispheric in origin (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1e</xref>). In particular, GMST variability becomes much more associated with the model’s Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in the 2×CO
