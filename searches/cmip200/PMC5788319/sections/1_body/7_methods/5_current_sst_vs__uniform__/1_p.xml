<p id="P25" class="p">In order to isolate the role of atmospheric/surface process from the role ocean-atmosphere-sea ice processes, we conduct an experiment set where the atmospheric component of GFDL CM3 (AM3) is forced by annually repeating climatological seasonal cycles of SSTs and sea ice (

 </sup> repeated annually to an identical run but with a uniform +4K increase of SSTs. In the +4K SST run, sea ice and vegetation were held constant. We investigate 200 years of variability in this experiment set. Note that GMST change in the uniform SST warming run (4.6K) is very similar to the magnitude of the GMST change between the preindustrial control and 2Ã—CO
