 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from preindustrial values (1%/year) and has reached a new equilibrium state. We use the last 860 years of each run in order to ensure that the models were near equilibration. This meant that we omitted the first 220 years from the 1080-year preindustrial control run and the first 1,920 years from the 2,780 year 1%/year 2×CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> run, the latter so as not to include the transient warming phase and the subsequent slow equilibration to the new boundary conditions.
