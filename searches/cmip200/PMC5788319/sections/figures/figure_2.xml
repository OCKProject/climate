  <title class="title">Relationship between GMST and the TOA and surface energy budgets in the GFDL CM3 preindustrial control and 2×CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> runs
  </title>
  <p class="p">Cross regression (lagged linear least-squares regression coefficients) between the low-frequency component of the labeled variables and the standard deviation of the low-frequency component of GMST. TOA components are shown in (a, b) and surface components are shown in (c, d) for the preindustrial control run (a, c) and the 2×CO2 run (b, d). Note that the Y axis spans a smaller range in the 2×CO2 run (b, d) indicating that the magnitude of variability tends to be smaller. TOA components (a, b) are positive down while surface components (c, d) are positive up. The dashed black line is GMST regressed against normalized GMST. The thickness of the confidence intervals represents the 2σ range of regression coefficients between time series with similar autocorrelation but with no relation to one and other. See Methods section for further details on the calculation of the confidence intervals.</p>
