  <title class="title">Change in local temperature variability</title>
  <p class="p">
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>, Fractional change in the local temporal standard deviation of low-frequency SAT between the GFDL CM3 preindustrial control and 2×CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> runs (unitless). 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>, As in (a) but the fractional change between the GFDL AM3 observed SST run and +4K SST run (see Methods). 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>, Change in the climatological energy flux (Wm
   <sup class="sup">−2</sup>K
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) over land regions that experienced an increase in SAT variability (red) and land regions that experienced a decrease in SAT variability (blue) between the GFDL CM3 preindustrial control and 2×CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> runs. 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>, As in 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> but change between the GFDL AM3 +4K SST and observed SST run. In b and d ↑SH is upward sensible heat flux, ↑LE is upward latent heat flux, ↓R
   <sub class="sub">s</sub> is the net downward radiation, and ↓LP is the latent heat of vaporization times the precipitation. ↓LP is shaded grey to indicate that it is not formally part of the energy budget but is used here as a proxy for water availability. The vertical error bars represent the standard error across all grid points accounting for spatial autocorrelation (see Methods).
