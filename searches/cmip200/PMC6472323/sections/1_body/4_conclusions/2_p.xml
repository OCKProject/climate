<p class="p">This study implements a scenario‐neutral framework as part of a national assessment of climate change allowances for flood risk under prescribed changes in the mean and seasonality of annual precipitation for Ireland. A typology of catchment sensitivities was established from which inferences can be made about the hydroclimatologcial properties that influence sensitivity to climate change. A set of decision rules (based on easily derived physical catchment descriptors) was then used to regionalize sensitivity type to a wider catchment sample, including ungauged or data‐sparse catchments. The study identified five sensitivity types, each associated with a distinct response pattern. Discriminant analysis revealed that (among the variables tested) annual precipitation, river channel slope, drainage density, and alluvial deposits are key predictors of sensitivity to climate‐driven flood responses. Our results also highlight the notable effect of hydrological model structure on flood magnitude and hence the evaluation of catchment sensitivity to climate changes.</p>
