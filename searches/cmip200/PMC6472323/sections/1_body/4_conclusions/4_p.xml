<p class="p">Given variations in exposure and sensitivity between catchment types, we assert that a national allowance could lead to overadaptation and potential misdirection of flood defense funds in some cases. This is because some catchments have greater natural resilience and, according to the CMIP5 ensemble, are less exposed to future flood risk. Under these circumstances, a 20% allowance may be too precautionary. Hence, we advocate a more targeted, risk‐based approach whereby the sensitivity of individual catchment types is used to prioritize investment. The study highlights the importance of managing climate change risk on the basis of catchment type rather than region or administrative boundary. It is recognized that spatial proximity cannot always be assumed the best predictor of hydrological similarity (Merz &amp; Blöschl, 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Hence, any future “lookup” table of allowances should really be structured by catchment type rather than region (Reynard et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Our framework is applicable to other national contexts where authorities are also seeking to establish allowances for climate change that balance the costs of increased standards of protection versus the amount of uncertainty in future flood risk that can be accommodated.
