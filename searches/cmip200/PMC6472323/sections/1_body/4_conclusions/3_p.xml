<p class="p">Our findings demonstrate the valuable insights into climate sensitivity that can be achieved for individual or regionalized catchment types using a scenario‐neutral framework. Our approach provides a rigorous method for stress‐testing adaptation decisions—in this case implementation of national or catchment‐type climate change allowances for flood design or scenario definition. By exploring the sensitivity of additional design allowances to uncertainty within the CMIP5 climate model ensemble and two hydrological models, we show that for all five catchment types identified, a national climate change allowance of 20% caters for ~64% of the CMIP5_Sub ensemble spread (RCP8.5; 2070–2099). Conversely, a 10% allowance covers only ~27% of the same ensemble. In some instances, marginal increases of design allowances to 30% would offer greater protection, particularly given the uncertainties inherent to future flood risk estimation. Further research is needed to more thoroughly characterize these uncertainties. This applies especially in the case of hydrological model parametric uncertainty. Given its potential effects (particularly in simulating high flows), integrating this component of model uncertainty in the SN framework would provide a more robust estimate of risk exposure (Bastola et al.,

Further research is also required to examine catchment sensitivity and exposure to short‐duration (subdaily) extreme rainfall events alongside seasonal/annual changes.
