 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In a relatively data‐rich study Prudhomme, Crooks, et al. (
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) demonstrated the framework's utility for flood risk assessment using 154 UK catchments. Catchments were grouped into distinct sensitivity types and used to classify ungauged sites based on their shared physical attributes (Prudhomme, Kay, et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Similarly, Köplin et al. (
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) clustered 186 Swiss catchments based on their sensitivity and used results to identify which physiographic features discriminate response type. In an exploratory study Bastola et al. (
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) examined flood sensitivity for four Irish catchments for which the risk of design allowances being exceeded were assessed using the IPCC AR4 climate scenarios. Wilby et al. (
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) applied a similar approach to assess sensitivity of peak flows in the Boyne catchment (Eastern Ireland).
