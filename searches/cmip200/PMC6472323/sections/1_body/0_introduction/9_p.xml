<p class="p">The study focuses on the Republic of Ireland. Herein, a nationally based classification is developed for which catchments are grouped into distinct flood sensitivity types according to their shared physical attributes. Given an expected rise in the frequency and intensity of Atlantic storms, Ireland is particularly vulnerable to increases in fluvial flooding (Matthews et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). The impact of recent flood events, in combination with a comprehensive flood risk assessment has led to a 10‐year €1bn capital program to implement relief schemes (Government of Ireland,

As with other jurisdictions, to avoid maladaptation, such infrastructural upgrades will need stress testing against future changes. Here we examine present exposure to climate changes and identify those conditions under which proposed climate change allowances may be inadequate. Thus, while we contribute key information to Irish flood planning and infrastructure standards for a vulnerable sector, in a broader context we outline a framework for risk assessment which has global application. From a hydroclimatological perspective we also identify those processes and land‐surface attributes that influence catchment sensitivity—thereby deepening knowledge of flood generating mechanisms. Finally, we advance the SN framework by proposing a method for selecting climate projections that is more equitable with respect to issues of ensemble bias and model interdependence; we also highlight a more robust machine learning technique for regionalization of catchment types.
