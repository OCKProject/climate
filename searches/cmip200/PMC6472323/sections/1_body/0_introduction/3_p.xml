<p class="p">Although the amount of impact modeling required for a comprehensive sensitivity assessment may be substantial, the SN approach provides deep insight to a system's response to a wide range of climatic changes. Moreover, SN approaches overcome a key limitation of “scenario‐led” (SL) analyses, which are typically constrained by available climate model projections and thereby may fail to test sensitivity to more extreme scenarios, even so‐called “black swan” events. Nonlinearity in hydrological responses to climate variability and change (particularly for extreme events) further justifies the exploration of a wider spectrum of plausible conditions. In addition, by relying directly on GCM (Global Climate Model) projections to quantify local impacts, the SL approach is subject to biases/errors (e.g., climate model and system uncertainties) inherited through the modeling chain—thus requiring additional postprocessing and bias correction (Lin et al.,
