<p class="p">Climate change presents significant challenges for decision makers. Uncertainty about the exact trajectory of future change coupled with the complexity of hydrological processes means these difficulties are particularly acute in flood management, where robust decisions regarding the designation of at risk areas and investment in long‐lived infrastructure are required. Some national authorities are designating flood risk allowances to factor climate change impacts and attendant analytical uncertainties into engineering designs (DCLG,

SN approaches involve testing the responsiveness of a local indicator (e.g., reservoir levels) to incremental adjustments in key driving climate variables (e.g., temperature, rainfall), across a plausible range of changes in variable intensity and seasonality. This study uses a SN approach to assess the sensitivity of flood regimes and hence fitness of national design allowances to climate change. We demonstrate the analytical framework using a large set of Irish catchments that represent a range of hydrological conditions.
