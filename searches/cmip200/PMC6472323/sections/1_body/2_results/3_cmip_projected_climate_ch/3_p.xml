 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> presents results of the ensemble subselection process for a single catchment. Herein, the selected members are shown to capture regions of high density and span the original ensemble space. Dependent on the RCP, catchment, and time horizon clustering leads to a reduction in ensemble size of between 0% and 87%, with a median reduction of 56% across all permutations (i.e., RCPs, 30‐year horizons and 215 catchments). Over successive horizons and RCPs there is a similar variation in the proportion of projections retained. However, considering only those models which contribute multiple runs (&gt;1), up to 41% of EMs are assigned to a cluster containing a simulation from the same GCM. This varies dependent on the horizon and RCP, with greater redundancies for 2070–2099 and RCP8.5, reflecting the lesser significance of natural variability and the more pronounced effect of individual climate model sensitivities.
