<p class="p">Changes in the harmonic mean and amplitude of the annual precipitation regime projected by CMIP5_Sub and CMIP5 for the combined 215 catchments are shown in Figures 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>, respectively. Mean annual precipitation totals are expected to increase marginally (&lt;10% based on the ensemble median). However, this conceals marked changes in the seasonal distribution: projections generally suggest an increase in the amplitude of the annual regime consistent with a narrative of wetter winters and drier summers. This trend is most pronounced for 2070–2099 under RCP8.5. Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> illustrates the level of uncertainty associated with precipitation wherein changes in the harmonic mean span a sign change irrespective of the time period and RCP considered. By the end of the 21st century mean annual precipitation is projected to decrease/increase by up to ~25% relative to baseline conditions. Changes in seasonality are equally uncertain. However, the signal does notably strengthen over progressive horizons for the high emissions RCP6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref> shows changes in mean annual temperature projected for the 215 catchments by CMIP5 for each horizon and RCP scenario. This confirms that the majority of EMs are within the +2 °C scenario (relative to 1976–2005) used for sensitivity testing (Figure
