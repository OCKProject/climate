<p class="p">When combined with the CMIP5_Sub simulations, the response surfaces (Figures

 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) highlight the contrasting sensitivity of individual catchments to precipitation changes. Most cases reveal that a 10% climate change allowance would be insufficient to counter projected flooding. Conversely, a 20% allowance would be sufficient to cover the majority of CMIP5_Sub projections across catchments. For example, most simulations for the river Owenbeg (ID: 35002) are within the 20% boundary. However, this is not the case for all catchments—as demonstrated by the Boyne (ID: 7009; Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) which has a large proportion of GCM projections lying beyond the frontier of this allowance.
