Overlain on each plot are percent changes in the harmonic mean and amplitude of the precipitation regime projected for 2070–2099 for each RCP by individual CMIP5_Sub EMs. Also shown are indicative (10%, 20%, and 30%) climate change allowances which would provide additional capacity in the design of new flood infrastructure to accommodate future climate change (OPW,

Generally, peaks are shown to increase incrementally in line with iterative growth in the applied precipitation mean and amplitude, respectively. This reflects their singular and interactive effects on the catchment water balance and flood processes. Sensitivity to each parameter independently is expressed as their maximum gradient along each axis (Table
