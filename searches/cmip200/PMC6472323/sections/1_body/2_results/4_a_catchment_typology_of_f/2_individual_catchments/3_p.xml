<p class="p">Differences in the magnitude and shape of the response pattern reflect the extent to which catchments dampen or amplify seasonal/annual scale precipitation changes. It also highlights the role played by local rainfall‐runoff processes in determining the hydrological response and ultimately flood generation across the sensitivity domain. All catchments are more sensitive to changes in mean amounts as opposed to seasonality; however, relative to one another, some are more responsive to increases in seasonal amplitude—indicated by their greater rate of change along the

 <italic class="italic">y</italic> axis gradient: 2.53), some catchments are relatively more sensitive to changes in mean annual receipts, as is shown by their gradient along the
