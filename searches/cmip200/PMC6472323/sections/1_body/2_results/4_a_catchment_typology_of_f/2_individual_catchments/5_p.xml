 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> also show the extent to which rainfall‐runoff model structural uncertainty have on the response surfaces. In most cases, both GR4J and NAM produce surfaces with a similar pattern. However, simulated changes in the flood peak magnitude under the same forcing scenario differ noticeably. Typically, GR4J is shown to have a more sensitive peak response than NAM. In the case of both models a 30% allowance (based on the period 2070–2099 and RCP8.5) would be sufficient to cover between 80 and 100% of CMIP5_Sub projections, with the Boyne (ID: 7012) remaining most exposed.
