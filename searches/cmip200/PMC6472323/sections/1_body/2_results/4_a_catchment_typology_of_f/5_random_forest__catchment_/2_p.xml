<p class="p">Effective precipitation (variability, seasonality, and frequency/magnitude of extremes) and catchment properties (morphology, geology, soil cover, and land use type) interact to shape hydrological processes and function at different scales and ultimately influence flood sensitivity. Hence, using ensemble modeling to establish a link between class membership of distinct sensitivity types and PCDs allows inferences to be made about the expected response of ungauged or data‚Äêsparse catchments.</p>
