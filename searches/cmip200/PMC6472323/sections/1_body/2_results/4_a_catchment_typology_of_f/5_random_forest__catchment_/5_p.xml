<p class="p">The importance of the BFI means a distinction is made between runoff and groundwater‐dominated systems. Generally, catchments in clusters (a) and (e) sit at opposing ends of the BFI spectrum, with the former/latter having a higher/lower baseflow contribution. Clusters (d) and (e) have the highest proportion of peat (PEAT) coverage. They also have the largest values for FLATWET, indicating that soil moisture remains high for prolonged periods. This reflects the greater coverage of poorly draining soils in upland areas, the effect of which is to heighten flood sensitivity to heavy rainfall events. Mainstream length (MSL) is generally greatest for type (a) reflecting the more slowly draining nature of larger catchments located in the northeast. A distinction between the lowland‐ and upland‐type systems is reiterated by TAYSLO. Here slope is generally greatest for catchment type (e) underlining their upland characteristics. Of the remaining predictors, potential evapotranspiration (SAAPE), stream frequency (STMFRQ), arterial drainage (ARTDRAIN2), and forest (FOREST) coverage are among the least important. Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S9</xref> shows the posterior probability of the sensitivity type assigned to each of the 215 catchments by the RF classifier. It demonstrates RF's utility for associating a measure of uncertainty with the classification.
