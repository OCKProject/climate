<p class="p">Generally, the spatial pattern of the reduced sample (Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>) is reproduced, with west‐east and upland‐lowland gradients. The most important predictor is SAAR, which distinguishes between clusters based on annual precipitation total. Wetter/drier catchments are classified as more/less sensitive. Sensitivity class reflects the southwest to north/northeast gradient in precipitation totals across the Island. Generally, clusters (d–e) are located in upland and/or westerly locations with greater rainfall. Clusters (b and c) are representative of drier catchments in the Midlands. Finally, catchments from cluster (a) are the driest and are situated along the east coast. However, precipitation zones are correlated with a number of other features which may also influence sensitivity, including elevation, proximity to the coast, aspect, and soil type, none of which are represented by the PCDs or captured more distinctly by the catchment sample.
