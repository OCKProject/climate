 <xref rid="wrcr23804-sec-0009" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2.7</xref>) classifier in predictive mode using all (215) catchments for which PCDs (Table 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) are available. Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> shows the misclassification probability for the OOB samples across the ensemble. It indicates the extent to which the model error stabilizes as the number of trees grown increases. The RF classifier is also used to investigate which attributes contribute most to prediction accuracy, and thus have the greatest explanatory power in differentiating sensitivity type. Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref> displays the PCDs according to their standardized importance score. The six most important predictors include: SAAR, BFIsoil, TAYSLO, PEAT, FLATWET, and MSL. Their values for the 215 catchments, discretized according to the predicted sensitivity type, are also shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>.
