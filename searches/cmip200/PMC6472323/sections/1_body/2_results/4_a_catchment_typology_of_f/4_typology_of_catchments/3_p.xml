<p class="p">For Ireland, catchments from cluster (a) are classified as being the most sensitive (Table 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). However, these catchments are generally less responsive to increases in precipitation amplitude as opposed to the harmonic mean. This indicates that, due to decreases in summer precipitation, these catchments are better able to offset—through greater available storage and/or more favorable antecedent conditions (such as lower soil moisture) – corresponding increases in winter associated with an amplified regime. Conversely, as they are more linearly responsive to increases in autumn/winter rainfall, and less influenced by interseasonal storage dynamics, systems characterized as runoff‐dominated (lower BFI) are more sensitive to wetter winters (i.e., increased amplitude). In these catchments baseflow makes a lesser contribution to total outflow, and precipitation events are more likely to generate direct/quick overland and shallow subsurface flow.
