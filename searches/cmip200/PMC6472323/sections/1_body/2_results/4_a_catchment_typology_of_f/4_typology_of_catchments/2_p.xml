<p class="p">Several hydrological features help to differentiate between sensitivity types. Generally, by altering the dynamics of longer‐term storage and release, changes in the mean and amplitude of precipitation are likely to influence regime change to a greater degree in catchments which have a longer ‘memory’ (i.e., predominantly lowland type systems with permeable geology and greater storage capacity). In contrast, as they have less storage capacity, catchments with a shorter memory (i.e., upland systems with impermeable geology and thin peaty soils) are less sensitive to the effects of interannual and interseasonal precipitation changes. The influence of memory is also reported by Prudhomme, Crooks, et al. (

 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) for the UK where catchments with greater storage potential were also found to be more sensitive to the types of interseasonal changes in precipitation investigated.
