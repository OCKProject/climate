The BFI quantifies the long‐term ratio of baseflow to total flow and is an important attribute when characterizing flood regime type. The index is a measure of the attenuated contribution to total discharge and is indicative of storage effects. Clusters (a) and (e) sit at opposing ends of the sensitivity spectrum and have BFI values (a: &lt;0.4; e: &gt;0.6) that characterize them (in relative terms) as groundwater and runoff‐dominated systems, respectively. The greater baseflow influence in cluster (a) suggests these catchments have a longer memory. The greater influence of memory is also demonstrated by the higher correlation in month to month variations (1‐month lag range: 0.14–0.55; 3‐month lag range: 0–0.27) for cluster (a). Further assessment of the hydrological signatures shows that cluster (e) catchments have a higher RC and greater mean annual discharge (mm/year). In relation to high flow signatures this cluster is also associated with more frequent (high pulse count) and variable flow peaks (coefficient of variation and high flow variability). The significance of the annual water balance in influencing catchment response to a climate signal is highlighted by the prominence of the RC in differentiating sensitivity, ranging from 0.52 to 0.75 for clusters (a) and (e), respectively. RC is considered a measure of annual evaporative losses. Catchments with a lower RC also tend to be those with the lowest precipitation totals. This suggests that in dry catchments, summer soil moisture and storage deficits influence recharge capacity during wetter seasons, leading to reduced sensitivity to an increasingly seasonal precipitation regime.
