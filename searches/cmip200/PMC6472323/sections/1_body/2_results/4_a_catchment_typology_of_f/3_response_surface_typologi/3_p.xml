<p class="p">Cluster (a) is most sensitive to changes in the harmonic mean. In contrast, the greatest proportional increases in flood magnitude associated with changes in seasonal amplitude are returned by clusters (d) and (e), with the degree of differentiation between each, dependent on rainfall‚Äêrunoff model used. GR4J shows a clearer distinction between clusters. Cluster (a) is noted as being the least sensitive to changes in the seasonal distribution.</p>
