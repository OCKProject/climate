 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> there is a spatial aspect to the distribution of cluster members, reflected by an east‐west gradient. Generally, catchments from cluster (a) are situated on the east coast and encompass the Boyne (ID: 7009, 7012), Slaney (12001), and Barrow (ID: 14007, 14019). Catchments from clusters (b) and (c) are located in the Midlands (ID: 26021, 25006, and 26009), [ID: Inny (26021), Brosna (ID: 25006), and Rinn (ID: 26009)], as well as in the south/southeast [Nore (ID: 15003, 15006), Suir (ID: 16008, 16009)], northwest [Mulkear (ID: 25001, 25002), Owenmore (ID: 35002, 35005), Erne (ID: 36010)] and northeast [Glyde and Dee (ID: 3016, 6014)]. Members of cluster (d) are found further west (ID: 34001) and in the south (ID: 18002 to 18006 and 20002). Members of cluster (d) are found further west (Moy and adjoining catchments (ID: 34001)) and in the south (Blackwater subcatchments (ID: 18002–18006) and Bandon (ID: 20002)). Finally, catchments [Feale (ID: 23002), Owenmore (ID: 35002, 35005), and Owenea (ID: 38001)] from group (e) are situated along the furthermost south/north‐western margins of the catchment sample.
