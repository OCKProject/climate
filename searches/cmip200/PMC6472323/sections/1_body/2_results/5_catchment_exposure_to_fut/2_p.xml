<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> shows the combined exposure of all 215 catchments to future climate based on the CMIP5 ensemble. Catchments are classified into one of five sensitivity types according to their PCDs. The percent of EMs that exceed climate change allowances of 0% to 40% relative to baseline conditions are estimated using the centroid response surface for each cluster or corresponding sensitivity type (Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Hence, the mean response surface for clusters identified from the catchment sample (35) are assumed representative of catchments with similar characteristics within the larger (215) set.
