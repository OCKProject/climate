<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> shows the extent of uncertainty due to hydrological model structure. Generally, there is close agreement between models for catchment type (e). In this case, each has a similar centroid response surface (Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>) and level of exposure across exceedance thresholds (Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>). However, for types (a)–(d) GR4J shows greater exposure relative to NAM. This is most pronounced for type (a) where differences in protection afforded by a 20% allowance differs by ~25% to 50% dependent on the RCP and time horizon. Although models disagree about the exact percentage exposure within individual types, each agrees as to the relative exposure between groups, with type (a)/(e) being the most/least exposed according to the 20% threshold. Given that the study examines changes in the seasonal amplitude of precipitation, along with the various dissimilarities in rainfall‐runoff model structure, differences in the representation of antecedent conditions are (in part) causal to the models returning such different estimates of risk exposure.
