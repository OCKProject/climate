<p class="p">The upper row in Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> highlights exposure when projected changes for all RCPs and middle to late century horizons are considered. The 20% allowance is shown to offer protection against ~57% to 92% (~55% to 100%) of uncertainty in the CMIP5_Sub (CMIP5) ensemble. Results highlight the extent to which exposure varies for the same threshold across the five types and illustrates, as in the case of cluster (e), instances where a universally applied allowance of 20% may lead to overadaptation. Conversely, as illustrated by type (a), adoption of a 30% allowance may be necessary to provide an equivalent level of protection against future risk (as measured by the percent of ensemble accommodated). Variations in the level of exposure between types generally follow the ranking of centroids from most to least sensitive (Table 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Irrespective of the time horizon and RCP considered, results indicate that type (a)/(e) is most/least exposed. This can be attributed to the greater sensitivity of type (a) particularly to changes in mean annual precipitation. Given the marked response of type (d) to increases in seasonality, its exposure generally increases relative to types (b) and (c), particularly as changes in amplitude become more pronounced over successive time horizons and RCPs.
