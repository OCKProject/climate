<p class="p">The subselected CMIP5 ensemble indicates similar exposure levels to those derived using the full ensemble—albeit that exposure for CMIP5_Sub is generally greater. This is despite the ensemble being notably reduced in size. For example, dependent on RCP, sensitivity class and horizon, Figure 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> indicates a reduction of between 73% and 48% in ensemble size. The similarity in exposure, despite such reductions in size, is indicative of the scale of data redundancy. It is also noted that uncertainty from the hydrological models far exceeds uncertainty related to the use of CMIP5_Sub versus the full ensemble.
