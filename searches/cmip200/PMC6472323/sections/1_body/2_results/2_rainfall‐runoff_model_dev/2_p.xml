 <xref rid="wrcr23804-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> illustrates hydrological model performance in reproducing a series of hydrological indices estimated using the period for which all observed flow data are available; also shown are the NSE validation scores. In both cases model performance is examined using the median GLUE simulation. Given the domain used for sensitivity testing, indices relating to catchment memory (autocorrelation) and interseasonal variability (seasonal elasticity: i.e., link between summer/winter rainfall and winter/summer flow response); (Visessri &amp; McIntyre, 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) as well as peak flows (high pulse count) are employed (Hrachowitz et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; McMillan et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Westerberg et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Differences between models, as well as validation periods, are most evident for NSE
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The highest validation scores (0.96; NSE
 <sup class="sup">0.5</sup>) are returned for the river Glyde (ID: 6014) by GR4J. In contrast, NAM returns the lowest score (0.64; NSE
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) for the river Bandon (ID: 20002). Generally, GR4J performs better than NAM for the majority of catchments, particularly those with a lower baseflow index (BFI), which is indicative of runoff—as opposed to groundwater—dominated systems. In addition, both models reproduce variations in the hydrological signatures between catchments. Each captures the runoff coefficient, BFI, annual runoff, and coefficient of variation. However, for catchments with a low BFI, models tend to underestimate the high flow variability and pulse count. Moreover, both consistently underestimate the autocorrelation coefficient of the observed mean monthly series for lags of 1, 3, and 6 months.
