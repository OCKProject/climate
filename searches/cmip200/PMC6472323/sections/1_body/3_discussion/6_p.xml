<p class="p">Despite the pattern of response being similar between models, the study highlights the notable effect that structural differences in hydrological model have on flood estimates. This uncertainty has important implications for how response surfaces are interpreted and used for adaptation planning. Furthermore, it underlines the importance of addressing this aspect of uncertainty, particularly given the potential to underestimate true risk. It is shown, for example, that exposure across various thresholds within sensitivity types is greater for GR4J than NAM. Design decisions based on GR4J would require greater climate change allowances than those associated with NAM. We also focused on changes in the 20‐year return period event. Rainfall‐runoff model uncertainty would be expected to increase for more extreme floods, yet information on these rarer events may be needed in high‐risk situations. Managers must, therefore, consider hydrological model uncertainty when specifying climate change allowances for a given catchment type, return period, RCP scenario, and time in the future.</p>
