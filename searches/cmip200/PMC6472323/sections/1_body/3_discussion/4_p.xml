<p class="p">Response surfaces are a powerful visual aid but they are limited to studying sensitivity along two (or maybe three) axes. This hinders graphical representation of changes for a larger set of climate parameters. The present analysis examined monthly scale changes, with results pointing to catchment memory and longer‐term storage dynamics influencing sensitivity and risk exposure. However, small, catchments with a shorter memory and more linear rainfall‐runoff response are also likely to be affected by changing patterns at (sub)daily scales, particularly for extreme events. Consequently, given a wider range of possible climate changes, the resultant classification reflects only one component in the overall picture of flood sensitivity for Ireland.</p>
