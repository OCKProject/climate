<p class="p">Our results relating to the physical controls on flood response are commensurate with previous studies which highlight that, while rainfall quantities immediately preceding or during a flood event contribute to its magnitude, given the nonlinear nature of generating processes, the magnitude of antecedent storage (e.g., groundwater and soil moisture levels) is critical in preconditioning the catchment, and thus affect the frequency and scale of flood events across different time scales (Sivapalan et al.,

 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Hence, a physically sensible relationship exists between the harmonic (mean and amplitude) parameters of annual precipitation explored here and changes in flood regimes.
