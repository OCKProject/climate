<p class="p">Using minimally affected catchments means that it is easier to elucidate the physical catchment controls (e.g., land cover, soil type, and morphometric attributes) on flood response, the absence of urbanized catchments (&gt;10%) is also due to a lack of monitoring in these areas and their uniqueness in the Irish case. With respect to urban extent ~91% of the FSU (215) catchments have a similar urban coverage as the reduced catchment sample (~2% extent). Hence, results from our “natural” catchment sample are considered transferable to catchments with a small proportion (&lt;5%) of urban extent.</p>
