<p class="p">Although the chosen catchments provide good coverage of hydroclimatological variability across the island, the sample is limited in size with underrepresentation of small “flashy” systems, particularly along the western seaboard and uplands. By focusing on rivers with minimal artificial influences, heavily modified catchments such as those with regulated flows or large urban areas are excluded. This has important implications for study robustness, particularly relating to the clustering and discriminant analysis, wherein a larger sample would facilitate additional testing and may reduce noise allowing clearer identification of more distinct sensitivity types. The strength of the inferences drawn from both the importance of underlying physical processes and the extent to which results can be robustly generalized is also related to sample size and diversity. Similarly, the constraints posed by the list of available PCDs must be considered. It is possible that descriptors that better distinguish catchment type or provide a clearer indication of the hydrological processes at work are not included. Despite shortcomings the FSU provides an ideal starting point for developing a national set of PCDs (Mills et al.,
