<p class="p">By allowing exploration of key uncertainties, multimodel and perturbed physics ensembles are essential for avoiding maladaptations (Clark et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, CMIP5 essentially constitutes an “ensemble of opportunity”—derived from imperfect sampling of available climate projections, with implications for the overrepresentation/underrepresentation of constituent GCM sensitivities and biases. This study highlighted the extent of redundancy in the ensemble, wherein using 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>‐medoids clustering the number of members are reduced (&gt;50%) in some cases considerably. This redundancy was greatest for simulations from the same GCM, wherein within‐model dependencies increase as the climate change signal strengthens. However, results highlight that subsampling the ensemble had little effect on the exposure estimates—albeit that a slight increase in risk is associated with the subselected set. Despite this, to provide a more statistically robust estimate of risk, we argue that selection of EMs should be on an objective basis, designed to address data redundancies and model interdependence. In comparing sources of uncertainty, the choice of hydrological model structure has a much greater effect on exposure estimates than uncertainty relating to whether the subselected or complete CMIP5 ensemble is used.
