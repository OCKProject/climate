<p class="p">With the above issues in mind, this study represents a first step toward national climate change allowances for infrastructure that could accommodate expected climate‐driven changes in flood risk across Ireland. By highlighting how catchments are differentially affected by specified precipitation changes, these climate change allowances could be tailored to meet regional/local vulnerabilities. In places of heightened exposure this avoids underestimation of risk; conversely, in catchments with greater natural resilience, unnecessary investments may be avoided. For example, the greatest exposure is associated with sensitivity types (a) and (b) which relates to ~22% of the 215 catchments. These catchments are generally low‐lying drier catchments located in the midlands and east. They are associated with greater storage and longer catchment “memory” and thus are more greatly affected by interseasonal and interannual variability. Here exposure varies between ~20% (NAM; b) and 52% (GR4J; a) for the end of the century under RCP8.5 CMIP5 and CMIP5_Sub. While 20% generally provides a good level of protection, for these catchment types a marginal shift in allowances to 30% could accommodate a larger proportion of uncertainty. Conversely, our results also highlight that applying a universal 20% allowance could in some cases lead to costly overadaptation. This is particularly relevant for sensitivity type (e) which encompasses ~15% of the 215 catchments. Type (e) generally has a “flashier” flow regime and is located in more exposed relatively wetter upland areas. Overall, our results support Bastola et al. (
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011b</xref>), who identified the Boyne catchment (ID: 7012; Eastern Ireland) as the most sensitive to changes in flood magnitude. In this specific case, an allowance of greater than 40% is necessary to reduce exposure (~7% exposure based on RCP8.5 CMIP5_Sub for 2070–2099) to a level comparable with less sensitive catchments. It is noted that, although all catchments are relatively more sensitive to changes in mean annual precipitation as opposed to amplitude, when considered in its entirety, the CMIP5 ensembles suggest that significant changes in seasonality are more likely. Hence, it cannot be assumed that greater sensitivity in one parameter is necessarily indicative of exposure to climate risk. This highlights the value of using climate ensemble alongside response surfaces.
