<p class="p">On the other hand, monthly precipitation changes are more confidently represented by GCMs given their coarse spatial resolution. Although GCMs are capable of capturing changes in slowly responding and spatially homogenous elements of the regime, such as the seasonal cycle, their resolution constrains their ability to resolve finer‐scale processes and topographical features required to capture extremes. Hence, the study focuses on exploring sensitivity to those aspects of the regime (total amount and seasonality) for which we have greater confidence in the likely direction of change. Similarly, there is an implicit assumption that the rainfall‐runoff models provide an accurate proxy of catchment behavior even when applied to climate conditions which differ greatly from the observations available for model development (Broderick et al.,
