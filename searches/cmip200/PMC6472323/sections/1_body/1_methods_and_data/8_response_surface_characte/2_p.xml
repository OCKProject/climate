<p class="p">Differences in sensitivity between the response surface centroids for each cluster are quantified based on the mean rate of change (gradient) along the 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> (horizontal) and 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> (vertical) axes, respectively. This demonstrates the degree of sensitivity to unit changes in each harmonic parameter independently, without explicitly considering interactive effects. It is calculated based on the maximum difference in the percent flood peak response between each neighboring vector element or grid point on the 5% interval along the 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> axes, respectively.
