<p class="p">The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method is used to investigate flood response across the sensitivity domain (Beven &amp; Binley, 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). For each rainfall‐runoff model 10,000 simulations are conducted for the period 1970–2010 using parameter sets randomly sampled using a Latin Hypercube scheme from uniform distributions (McKay et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>). Following the GLUE procedure, parameter sets are weighted according to calibration performance. Three efficiency criteria are used consisting of the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency criterion (NSE; equation

 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0267" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1970</xref>) applied to the nontransformed (NSE), squared (NSE
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), and square root (NSE
 <sup class="sup">0.5</sup>)‐transformed series, respectively. This application ensures consideration of model performance across the hydrograph including those for variability in low (square root) and high (squared) flows. The aggregate efficiency score for each parameter set is estimated as the product of the three individual NSE values. In this respect, each NSE criterion is given an equal weighting. However, by multiplying values parameters must perform well according to each (transformed and nontransformed) to achieve a high overall score. In addition, parameter sets are omitted if they overestimated or underestimated flow volume by more than 15% estimated according to percent bias. This measure does not contribute to the final weighting.
