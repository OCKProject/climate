 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) is a lumped conceptual model, with nine calibration parameters, which simulates the transformation of precipitation to runoff by continuously updating the water content of three coupled stores. Stocks are diminished through evaporative losses and interflow. Overland flow is generated when surface zone capacity is exceeded; a proportion of this excess is transferred through infiltration to the root zone and groundwater storage. Surface and interflow contributions are routed through two linear reservoirs; baseflow is routed through a single linear reservoir.
