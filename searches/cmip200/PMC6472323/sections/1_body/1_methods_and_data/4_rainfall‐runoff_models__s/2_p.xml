<p class="p">To address hydrological model uncertainty, two conceptual rainfall‚Äêrunoff models were applied. Models differ according to their number of calibration parameters and numeric formulation. Our criteria for selection includes the following: (i) previous application to Irish hydroclimatological conditions; (ii) proven performance for the catchment sample; (iii) computational efficiency; and (iv) representation of alternative model structures (Bastola et al.,
