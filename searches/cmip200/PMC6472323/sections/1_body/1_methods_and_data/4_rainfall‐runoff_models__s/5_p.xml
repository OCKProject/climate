<p class="p">To ensure transferability between wet and dry conditions, models are calibrated using the first, third, and fifth ranked noncontinuous wettest and driest years, respectively, (Broderick et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). These years are identified based on catchment average rainfall. For validation the second, fourth, and sixth wettest and driest years, respectively, are used. By simulating the complete time series and examining nonsequential 6‚Äêyear periods for calibration/validation the internal dynamics and consistency of catchment stores is preserved.
