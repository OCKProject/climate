 <italic class="italic">GR4J</italic> (Perrin et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) is a lumped model with four calibration parameters. Effective precipitation and soil moisture are estimated from net rainfall. Fluxes from the soil moisture zone along with effective precipitation are partitioned as a fixed 10:90 division between two routing channels. The first channel applies a single‚Äêunit hydrograph; the second a unit hydrograph and nonlinear storage function. A gain/loss function is used to simulate groundwater exchanges with deeper aquifers and/or adjoining watersheds.
