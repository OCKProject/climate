<p class="p">Their computational cost mean experiments like CMIP5 rely on autonomous modeling groups. However, groups differ with respect to the number of simulations they contribute, the specific model(s) used, and which uncertainty component(s) they consider (e.g., parameter perturbation, initial conditions, structural differences, and emission scenario). Moreover, GCMs developed by different groups can share a similar formulation and hence many of the same assumptions/errors—an issue also affecting successive model generations (Knutti et al.,

Here biased sampling leads to a disproportionate weighting of the respective model sensitivities, resulting in a skewed interpretation of likely changes. Providing statistically robust descriptors of future climate is conditional on the independence of EMs (Déqué &amp; Somot,
