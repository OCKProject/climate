<p class="p">Dependent on horizon and RCP up to 22% (#10) of CMIP5 EMs are produced by the same GCM (CSIRO‐Mk3–6‐0). To address possible redundancies, the partitioning around medoids procedure (Kaufman &amp; Rousseeuw, 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) is used to identify a representative ensemble subset (herein referred to as CMIP5_sub). The 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>‐medoid algorithm differs from 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>‐means in that the point used to quantify within/between cluster differences is not the centroid but a member of the subset (medoid). As the objective is to identify that EM which is most representative of a given subspace, this constitutes a more appropriate approach. Subselection is conducted using the GCM grid box precipitation scenarios for each (215) catchment, 30‐year horizon, and RCP, respectively. To correspond with the sensitivity domain, EMs are clustered according to similarity in their intercept and amplitude. Parameters are standardized (
 <italic class="italic">z</italic> score) prior to clustering and similarity is measured in squared Euclidean distance. It is highlighted that clustering algorithms are biased toward regions of higher density, which has implications for excluding EMs located at the extremities ‐ potentially underestimating risk (Cannon, 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). To address this, the KKZ (Katsavounidis‐Kuo‐Zhang) initialization procedure is used to identify seed points which maximize ensemble diversity (Katsavounidis et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). In addition, the number of clusters is selected as the minimum required for the subset to span the original ensemble range.
