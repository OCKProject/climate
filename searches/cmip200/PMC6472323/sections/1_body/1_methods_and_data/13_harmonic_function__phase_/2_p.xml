<p class="p">In this study a single‐phase harmonic (equation 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(2)</xref>) is used to (i) scale the WGEN series so as to traverse the sensitivity domain according to changes in the precipitation cycle, (ii) to estimate percent changes in the amplitude and mean of individual CMIP5 projections. As visual presentation of response surfaces is limited to two dimensions, the phase is held constant and set to December. This represents the median month for which the annual precipitation cycle peaks across the catchment sample. The assumption of a December phase is also commensurate with the CMIP5 ensemble, for which the majority (65% considering all 215 catchments, RCPs, and time horizons) of model runs indicate a more pronounced winter peak. This signal generally strengthens through each consecutive time horizon and is most distinct for 2070–2099 under RCP8.5, wherein 95% of EMs indicate a winter phase. Kay, Crooks, and Reynard (
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) explored the influence which a fixed phase may have on flood response across the sensitivity domain for nine typical response types found in the United Kingdom. Results show that this assumption is more/less impactful depending on the catchment and climate ensemble considered. In some cases catchments revealed increased sensitivity to alternative phases. However, the authors highlight that this simplification is supported by the majority of climate projections indicating a winter phase.
