<p class="p">Response surfaces developed for UK catchments show the flood regime to be more sensitive to precipitation than evaporation changes (Prudhomme et al.,

 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011b</xref>), who examined flood sensitivity using the SN framework applied to four Irish catchments. They found that changes in PE associated with temperature increases had a negligible effect on flood magnitude. Thus, our assessment is restricted to a single scenario representing an absolute increase in mean annual temperature of 2 °C relative to 1976–2005.
