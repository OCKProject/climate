<p class="p">We apply a SN approach to flood assessment using an initial sample of 35 Irish catchments. Flood responses are evaluated given incremental changes in the annual mean and seasonal distribution of catchment average precipitation. For each increment the precipitation series is altered and input to two different rainfall‐runoff models. A weather generator (WGEN) is employed to extend the observed precipitation series and the simulated 20‐year flood peak is used to quantify sensitivity to precipitation changes relative to a (1976–2005) baseline. This impact metric is chosen as it represents a standard exceedance threshold used in flood design and can be more reliably estimated given the observed series length (30 years). To account for changes in potential evaporation (PE), a single temperature scenario (+2 °C relative to a baseline) is used. Changes in simulated flood peaks across the sensitivity domain are then used to construct two‐dimensional (2‐D) response surfaces. To establish a classification, catchments are clustered according to similarities in their response surfaces. Using a random forest (RF) classifier those physical attributes, which are most important in determining group membership, are identified. The model is used to infer the likely sensitivity of an additional 215 sites nationally. These sites are either unmonitored or lack flow data of sufficient quality to undertake robust hydrological model calibration. Exposure to climate risk and the efficacy of design allowances are established using GCM simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble (Taylor et al.,
