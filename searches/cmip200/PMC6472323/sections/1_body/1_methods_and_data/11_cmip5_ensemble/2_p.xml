<p class="p">CMIP5 simulations of monthly precipitation covering the period 1850–2100 and relating to one of four different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5) are used to examine the flood risk exposure of individual catchments (Table 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). For each EM and all 215 catchments, Change Factors (CFs; Anandhi et al.,

 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) are calculated based on the percent difference in mean monthly precipitation between the 1976–2005 baseline and three separate 30‐year horizons (2010–2039; 2040–2069; 2070–2099). Precipitation series are extracted for the GCM grid point directly overlying each catchment centroid. Following Prudhomme et al. (
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), CFs are calculated by differencing all continuous 20‐year blocks within the 30‐year window. This reduces potential sampling uncertainty introduced by relying on a single (30‐year) value of baseline and future climate (Kendon et al.,

 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). To estimate changes in amplitude and mean annual precipitation, a harmonic function (equation 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(2)</xref>) is fitted to the median of the block‐sampled CFs. This is applied to each 30‐year horizon, EM and 215 catchments. Extracting changes in parameters of the sensitivity domain allows the CMIP5 projections to be overlain on the 2‐D response surfaces, from which the corresponding change in flood magnitude can be derived. Also estimated from the CMIP5 ensemble are absolute changes in mean annual temperature for the same RCPs and time horizons.
