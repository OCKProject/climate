<p class="p">To generate a longer annual maximum series than is available from observed data, response surfaces were developed from climatological series stochastically simulated using a WGEN. Using an extended peak flow series allows greater confidence in the fitted generalized extreme value (GEV) parameters and provides a more robust estimate of flood magnitude. The present study employs the Weather Generator École de Technologie Supérieure (WeaGets) multivariable single‐site stochastic WGEN (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The model is fitted (over 14‐day periods) to observed precipitation (1976–2005) and temperature in each catchment. Precipitation occurrence is simulated using a third‐order Markov chain, while amounts are generated from a two‐parameter Gamma distribution. This distribution has been fitted to rainfall amounts across diverse climates for a range of applications (Stephenson et al.,

This reduces the sharp parameter transitions between fitting periods which result from outliers—particularly when using shorter time series. Additionally WeaGETS incorporates an adjustment for the underestimation of low‐frequency variability (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="wrcr23804-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Temperature is modeled dependent on precipitation occurrence. Daily precipitation and temperature for a 400‐year period are generated. This period length ensures that the key descriptive statistics (monthly mean, variance, percentiles, etc.) of the stochastic series are stationary and match the observations without unduly increasing the computational overheads of using a longer (relative to the 30‐year baseline) climate series.
