  <p class="p">Changes (%) in the magnitude of a 20‐year return period flood event for incremental changes (5%) in harmonic parameters representing the mean amount (−10% to +40%; 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis) and seasonality (0% to 50%; 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic> axis) of the annual precipitation cycle. Surfaces are developed for each of the 35 catchments using the median Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation simulation from the NAM model. Overlain on each plot are changes (%) in the harmonic mean and amplitude projected for the 2070–2099 relative to 1976–2005 under RCP8.5 by each member of the CMIP5_sub ensemble. For plotting the range is constrained between 0% and 90%. Also shown is the 10%, 20%, and 30% climate change allowance. Lines are interpolated using the technique of nearest neighbor. Also given in brackets is the maximum slope (
