 <caption class="caption">
  <p class="p">Percent of CMIP5 and CMIP5_Sub ensemble members (
   <italic class="italic">y</italic> axis) which exceed climate change allowances of 0–40% (relative to baseline conditions; 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis) calculated for each sensitivity type and hydrological model. The percent flood response and associated exposure is estimated using projections for all 215 catchments and the corresponding centroid relating to their sensitivity type. Plots show the exposure of each to projected climate and the adequacy of different adaptive capacity thresholds. The indicative 20% allowance is highlighted using the vertical black line. Combined threshold exceedances calculated for RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5 over the 2050s (2040–2069) and 2080s (2070–2099) are shown in the upper row. The second, third, and fourth rows show exceedances for the 2080s relating to RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5, respectively. The percent of the original CMIP5 ensemble members included in the CMIP5_Sub set is shown in brackets. RCP = Representative Concentration Pathways; CMIP5 = Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5.
