  <p class="p">The centroid of five clusters for each rainfall‐runoff model (GR4J and NAM) showing the centroid response surface relating to a 2 °C temperature increase. Centroids are derived as the arithmetic average of the grid points from the response surfaces of each cluster member and hydrological model. Response surfaces show change (%) in the magnitude of a 20‐year return flood event for corresponding changes (%) in the mean amount (−40% to +60%;
