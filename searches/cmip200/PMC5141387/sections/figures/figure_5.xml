  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Synthetic near-global (60°S-80°N) annual time series combining historical observations from HadCRUT4.4 (red) with several projections from climate models (blue). Each of the 25 projections in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> combines the CMIP5 multi-model RCP8.5 warming projection with a different episode of multidecadal internal variability cooling from the CM3 control run. Series are plotted with an arbitrary vertical offset for display purposes (see 0.5 °C scale indicator; tic marks on vertical axis are at 0.5 °C intervals). The dotted vertical lines denote the year 2015 for reference. The synthetic series are constructed using the observed mean anomaly for 1996–2005 as the reference value. Each model projection begins in 2001, using the first year of the CM3 control run segment combined with a long-term warming projection of near-global surface air temperature. The warming projection contribution is adjusted to have zero magnitude in year 2000. The CM3 anomalies, averaged over years 1–10 of the selected segment, are also adjusted to have the observed reference value. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) As in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> but the long-term warming projection contribution is adjusted by the factor 0.5 to explore effects of a smaller transient climate sensitivity than that simulated in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Observed (HadCRUT4.4; red) and CMIP5 multi-model ensemble (All-Forcing/RCP8.5; 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic>=25) simulated (blue) near global temperature anomalies (80 N-60 S, using modelled SST over ocean regions and 2-metre air temperature over land. Model data masked with observed missing data mask. Anomalies are relative to 1961–1990. HadCRUT4.4 observed (purple dashed: 1998–2015; or green dashed: 1999–2014) and CMIP5 modelled (black dashed: 1998–2015) trends are compared over recent periods (see legend).
