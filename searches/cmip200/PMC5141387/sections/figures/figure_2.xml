  <title class="title">Surface temperature anomalies from a 5200-year CM3 control run compared with observations.</title>
  <p class="p">Anomalies (°C) averaged over (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) near global domain, 60°S-80°N or (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) northern hemisphere extratropics, 23.6°N-90°N. Ten-year running means are shown, with an arbitrary vertical shift for display purposes (see 0.5 °C vertical scale; tic marks on vertical axis at 0.25 °C intervals). CM3 control run 2 m air temperature data (black lines) are averaged over the full domain noted, without screening out data where observations are missing. The red, blue and green lines on each plot depict HadCRUT4 observed combined SST/surface air temperature anomalies over available data regions for full observations (red), observed minus CMIP5 All-Forcing ensemble mean (blue) and observed minus linear trend (green). Open circles connected by straight line segments in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> show the 25 CM3 control run multidecadal cooling events selected for further analysis in our study. The purple and orange dashed lines in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> depict the two linear trends fit to separate sub-segments of the 5200 year CM3 control run (purple for years 1–1530 and orange for years 1,531–5,200), which were subtracted from the control run data to approximately filter out a spurious long-term drift signal. The upper black lines in 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> depict years 1–2500, and the lower black lines depict years 2501–5000 of the CM3 control run.
