  <title class="title">Running standard deviation of global temperatures from the CM3 control run compared with observations.</title>
  <p class="p">The running standard deviations from CM3 are based on overlapping 141-year segments of 10-yr running mean global surface air temperatures. A long-term drift in the control run temperatures is filtered out by removing separate linear trends over years 1–1530 and 1531–5200 and recombining the residuals to form a single 5200-year series. The drift is removed, followed by computation of 10-year running means, followed by computation of the running standard deviations of the overlapping 141-year smoothed time series segments. The blue line depicts the s.d. of 10-year running mean residual anomalies for observations (that is, observed minus CMIP5 All-Forcing ensemble mean, 141-year smoothed series). The figure illustrates the time-varying nature of the interdecadal variability in the CM3 control run. Unit: °C.</p>
