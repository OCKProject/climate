 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> would be representative of what to expect, on average, over the next few decades, in contrast to the 0.2 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> background warming projected by the CMIP5 models. Even if the ensemble transient warming rate from CMIP5 models (0.2 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) turns out to be correct, we find that strong internal variability could still extend the recent warming slowdown (&lt;0.1 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) for another decade or more, at least partially masking the strong underlying warming trend. Specifically, in this case, we estimate that a warming slowdown (&lt;0.1 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> net trend beginning in 1998) could be sustained by a strong cooling phase of internal variability through 2020, 2025 or 2030 with probabilities 16%, 11% and 8%, respectively, assuming CM3's internal variability is realistic.
