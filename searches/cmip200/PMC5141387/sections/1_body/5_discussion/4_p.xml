<p class="p">We have further explored the possible contributions of internal variability to historical surface temperature changes. Our analysis of global mean temperatures and trend maps across five historical epochs suggests that internal variability may have contributed significantly, along with external forcing, to several prominent warming and hiatus epochs since the late 1800s. However, confident assessment of the relative role of external forcing (including aerosols) and internal variability in these historical changes remains a significant challenge at global and regional scales
