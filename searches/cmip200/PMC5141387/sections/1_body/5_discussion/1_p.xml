<p class="p">We investigated the potential influence of internal multidecadal climate variability on near-global mean surface temperature evolution over the past century and next several decades using the GFDL CM3 model, which exhibits the strongest multidecadal variability among the CMIP5 models. We explored whether CM3-like internal climate variability could, in the coming decade or so, produce a prolonged warming slowdown or hiatus. We also noted some simulated cases of rapid global warming lasting a decade or more as an internal cooling episode flips to a warming phase and combines with the underlying long-term forced warming trend. If the slowdown in warming over the recent period (for example, 1998–2015, or 1999–2014) turns out to have resulted mostly from Pacific-centric internal variability, for example, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation or Pacific Decadal Oscillation

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, combined with background warming like that in the CMIP5 ensemble, these variations might likely have a shorter timescale (∼10–15 years of cooling) than many of the longer timescale (∼30 years) internal variability events from CM3 highlighted in our analysis. In that case, we would speculate that—if the TCR of the climate system is close to that of the CMIP5 ensemble mean—the current global warming slowdown will end soon or perhaps has already ended, given the strong positive anomaly in global mean temperatures in 2015. However, our analysis suggests that multidecadal internal variability involving the Atlantic, and particularly higher latitude regions, could potentially lead to a more prolonged influence on global temperature than is thought to have occurred to date. This longer timescale internal multidecadal variability in CM3 has strong regional expressions, particularly in high latitudes, and is not dominated by variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Our synthetic timeseries suggest that it is possible for an early 21st century warming hiatus or slowdown to extend past 2030, and in a few extreme cases eventually even come to resemble the 1941–1973 hiatus. The most extreme cases could result from a large internal variability cooling event commencing around year 2000, together with a weaker warming trend than projected by the CMIP5 model ensemble mean, due to either a lower TCR

However, according to the model simulations, the probability of a hiatus (zero or negative trend) extending from 1998 to some year beyond 2015 is now very small (2%), even if the CMIP5 models have warming rates that are a factor of two too large.
