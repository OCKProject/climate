<p class="p">The evolution of global mean temperature and the recent slowdown in global warming pose interesting opportunities to test our understanding of the climate system, and determine strengths and weaknesses of current models, particularly since models cannot be tuned to observations that have not yet occurred. Our analysis of model simulations suggest some conditions whereby an early 21st century global warming slowdown could potentially last much longer (to âˆ¼2030) than is generally expected, as well as scenarios where a rapid temporary acceleration of warming might occur. The possibility of such behaviour in the climate system in coming decades, while not a prediction, should motivate more study of internal multidecadal climate variability and its mechanisms.</p>
