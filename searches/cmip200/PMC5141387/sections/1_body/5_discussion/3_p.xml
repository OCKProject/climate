<p class="p">Our analysis suggesting a potential extension of an early 21st century slowdown to âˆ¼2030 assumes no substantial volcanic forcing or unusually weak solar forcing over the period. If a climatically important eruption(s) occurred

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref> conclude that hiatus decades will be very unlikely to occur beyond 2030 for high greenhouse emissions scenarios in CMIP5 models (for example, RCP8.5) even including volcanic eruptions, although hiatuses in the late 21st century remain relatively likely under scenarios with lower externally forced warming rates (for example, RCP2.6).
