<p class="p">The CM3 model has stronger global mean internal multidecadal climate variability than the other CMIP5 models we examined (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2</xref>), and also a higher than average TCR compared with other CMIP5 models (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). However, we find only a weak statistical relationship across models (correlation of 0.23) between internal multidecadal variability and TCR across 21 CMIP5 models (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). Therefore, the strong TCR in CM3 does not imply that this model's relatively large simulated internal variability should be rejected. While a recent study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref> excluded CM3 from some of their calculations because the model's NINO3.4 SST variability differs by &gt;20% from observed values, in our view the large centennial-scale modulation of tropical Pacific SST variability in long control runs
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref> suggests that requiring model-observation agreement within 20% for this type of variability metric is overly restrictive. Further, recent studies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref> suggest that CMIP5 models systematically underestimate regional decadal and interdecadal internal variability, particularly outside of northern high latitudes. These results support using the relatively high variability from CM3 for our analysis.
