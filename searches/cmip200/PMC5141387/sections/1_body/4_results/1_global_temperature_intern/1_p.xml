<p class="p">The major features of observed global mean temperature evolution since the late 1800s, discussed briefly in the introduction, are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, along with a comparison of observed global temperature to the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean global temperature simulation (Methods). For discussion purposes, in this study, we divide global temperature evolution into the five general epochs, which are labelled in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. Comparison of CM3's control run with observations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) confirms that the observed 20th century global warming was highly unusual compared with CM3's internal variability: there are no periods of century-scale global warming or cooling in a 5000-year sample from the CM3 control run that are comparable to the observed 20th century warming. An observed internal variability estimate for global mean temperature can be obtained by subtracting the CMIP5 All-Forcing ensemble mean from observations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>, blue line). This observed estimate has a smaller characteristic magnitude than much of the typical variability within the CM3 control simulation. However, the internal multidecadal variability in the CM3 model varies considerably during the 5200-year control integration: the running s.d. of different 141-year segments of low-pass filtered data from the CM3 control run is compared with the s.d. of a single observed 141-year segment in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. During some multi-century periods in the CM3 run, the internal variability is at least twice as large as the observed estimate, and in a few periods it is even smaller than the observed residuals. The wide range of multidecadal variability within the 5200-year control run cautions against relying solely on âˆ¼160 years of observations to evaluate modelled global temperature variability. The observed internal variability estimate also has uncertainties due to observational limitations and imperfect knowledge of historical forcings and the climate response to these forcings. An alternate observed internal variability estimate, calculated as a residual from a simple linear trend, is shown for comparison in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>. The northern hemisphere extratropics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>) in CM3 show larger multidecadal fluctuations than the near-global temperatures.
