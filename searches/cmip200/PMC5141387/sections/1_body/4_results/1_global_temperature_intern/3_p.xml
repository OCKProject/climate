<p class="p">While internal variability in the real world and models depends to some degree on the base climate state, here we assume that CM3's pre-industrial control run (with no forcing changes) provides a large sample of plausible internal variability applicable to conditions ranging from the late 1800s through the mid-21st century.</p>
