<p class="p">As an alternative approach, we compare CM3's internal variability alone to observed trend maps over each of the five epochs discussed above (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>), to explore how well internal variability trends can reproduce the observed trends (a, d, g, j and m) assuming no externally forced contributions. That is, the CMIP5 historical run trends contributions are assumed to be zero. For each epoch analysed, the ten periods from the CM3 control run having the lowest global mean absolute deviation from the observed trends are averaged to create the control run composite trend maps. The results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>, panels c,f,i,l and o) show that CM3 internal variability alone can reproduce the observed trends fairly well during hiatus or slowdown periods (1880–1908; 1941–1973; and 2001–2014), without invoking any radiative forcing-produced trends. This is shown by comparing mean absolute deviation values of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref> panels (c,f,i,l and o) to those from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref> (panels c,f,i,l and o), which include both historical forcing and internal variability contributions. However, CM3's simulated internal variability alone appears unable to reproduce a global scale warming trend nearly as strong as observed during the 1908–1941 and 1973–2001 rapid warming periods. For these periods, some warming contributions from external forcing seem crucial for explaining the pronounced observed trends, reinforcing the importance

Maps showing two alternative estimates of the internal variability contribution to the observed trend maps (
