<p class="p">For the 1880–1908 cooling period, the CMIP5 All-Forcing multi-model ensemble forced response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6b</xref>) shows generally weak positive trends over most regions with relatively little resemblance to the observed trend map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6a</xref>). However, when this CMIP5 forced response is combined with the ten internal variability events from CM3 that produce the best agreement with observations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6c</xref>), the combined response matches better the observed 1880–1908 change pattern, reducing the mean absolute deviation with the observed trend by 16% compared with the forced response alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6b</xref>). During this period, the CMIP5 ensemble global cooling response to the Krakatau eruption of 1883 (for example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5c</xref> or ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>) was larger than the observed temporary cooling.
