<p class="p">For the early 21st century slowdown period (2001–2014), the faster-than-observed externally forced warming in CMIP5 models supports a role for internal variability-induced cooling in recent years

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6m</xref>) feature a mixture of cooling and warming regional trends with some strong cooling in the eastern Pacific, differing clearly from the CMIP5 forced response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6n</xref>). We used 2014 as the end year to avoid including the highly anomalous El Niño year of 2015 in the short-term trend. The addition of that single year would alter the observed trend map substantially (not shown) relative to the map for 2001–2014, introducing weaker, less-pronounced cooling trends throughout much of the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific. The lack of agreement between simulated and observed trends is not surprising given the relatively short period analysed (14 years). Excepting major volcanic periods, such relatively short trends are typically more likely to include larger contributions from internal variability versus forced change. Including the selected sample of CM3 modelled internal variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6o</xref>) results in a trend map more closely resembling observations (mean absolute deviation 19% smaller), further suggesting that internal variability can help provide a more plausible explanation for observed changes during 2001–2014 compared with external forcing alone (
