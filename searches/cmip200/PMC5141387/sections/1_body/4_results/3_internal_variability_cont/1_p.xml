<p class="p">We have shown (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) that internal variability generated by CM3 cannot explain the long-term increase in global mean temperatures since the late 1800s. Here we further explore the potential contributions of simulated internal variability to observed multidecadal trends by comparing multidecadal trend maps from GISTEMP observations (Methods) with simulated trends combining CMIP5 All-Forcing historical runs and CM3 control run variability, focusing on much shorter periods of ∼15–30 years. The five key epochs of global temperature since 1880 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) are each examined separately (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>; Methods).
