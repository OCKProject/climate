<p class="p">For the late 21st century rapid warming period (1973–2001), observed trends were similar in some respects to those for the early 20th century warming (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6d,j</xref>). Maps for both periods featured broad-scale warming patterns covering most land and ocean regions, excepting parts of the deep southern hemisphere. The regional cooling in the deep southern hemisphere in the 1973–2001 GISTEMP trend map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6j</xref>) is not present in the CMIP5 All-Forcing ensemble-mean trend map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6k</xref>), but can be partly captured by including selected internal variability episodes from CM3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6l</xref>). Ensemble-mean trends for this period from some individual CMIP5 models (not shown) depict regional cooling features in the deep southern hemisphere similar to observations, so it is not yet clear whether these regional features were caused by internal variability or external forcing. The CMIP5 ensemble global-mean trend is close to observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Nonetheless, if CMIP5 models overestimate the TCR (forced warming rate), internal climate variability may have also played a significant role in the late 20th century global warming.
