<p class="p">Early 20th century warming (1908–1941) extended over most of the globe, except for the far western Pacific near Japan and parts of the deep southern ocean (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6e</xref>) also shows broad-scale warming over most of the globe, but at a smaller rate than observed. Trend maps combining this CMIP5 forced response with selected CM3 internal variability events (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6f</xref>) are much closer to observed trends than the CMIP5 forced response alone (mean absolute deviation 24% smaller). Including the CM3 internal variability events also results in some slight cooling in the deep southern ocean, similar to—though weaker than—observations. These results support earlier studies
