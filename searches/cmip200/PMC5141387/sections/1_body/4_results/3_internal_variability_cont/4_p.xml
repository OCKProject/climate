<p class="p">For the mid 20th century hiatus (1941–1973), an important role for internal climate variability is suggested, as the CMIP5 forced response deviates from the observed spatial pattern. This period featured a slight cooling tendency globally (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6g</xref>) show pronounced northern hemisphere extratropical cooling along with several warming and cooling regions in the southern hemisphere. There is not clear evidence in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6h</xref>) depicts a weak broad-scale cooling over most regions except the deep southern hemisphere. The selected CM3 internal variability episodes combined with the CMIP5 forced pattern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6i</xref>) agree better with observations (mean absolute deviation reduced by 11%), including the pronounced interhemispheric asymmetry (cooling northern hemisphere and warming southern hemisphere). While aerosol forcing potentially could have produced this asymmetry, the CMIP5 ensemble's interhemispheric asymmetry is more muted than observed. The observed pattern thus may reflect a strong northern hemispheric cooling/southern hemisphere warming from internal variability, together with a broad-scale minor cooling due to radiative forcing changes. Remaining uncertainties in climate forcing agents and in the models' responses to those forcings
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref> preclude a more confident assessment.
