<p class="p">Another interesting case to consider is that of the low-end TCR (0.1 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), which results in a forced warming rate essentially the same as the recent observed warming trend (magenta and green dashed lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5c</xref>). If the global temperatures since 1998 have essentially followed a forced warming-only trajectory, then future internal variability could deviate either up or down from this trajectory and create, for example, a near-term hiatus or accelerated warming period. The analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref> concerning the probability of an 18-year hiatus beginning in 1998 would, in such a low-end TCR scenario, provide rough guidance for the case of 2015 as a new start year (that is, implying a 15% chance of an 18-year hiatus beginning around 2015).
