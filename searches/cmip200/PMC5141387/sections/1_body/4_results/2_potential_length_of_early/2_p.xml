<p class="p">The 25 individual cooling events (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) are each combined with background warming (ensemble mean of CMIP5 Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenarios) to produce a set of synthetic 21st century near-global temperature evolution curves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5a</xref>; see Methods). These synthetic timeseries suggest that the current slowdown may be prolonged up to about another decade (âˆ¼2025) for a few particularly prominent cooling events. However, for most of the 25 major CM3 cooling events the hiatus or slowdown appears to end around the present time (dashed vertical lines demark 2015) or even be barely discernible in the synthetic record. We do not include in our analysis the potential effects of future volcanic eruptions
