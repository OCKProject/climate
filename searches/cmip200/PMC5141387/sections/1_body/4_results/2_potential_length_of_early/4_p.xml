 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>); with medians of 1.3, 1.33 and 1.66 °C, respectively) come to differing conclusions on whether the CMIP5 models substantially overestimate the TCR on average (CMIP5 mean of 1.8 °C), but generally agree that a low-end estimate for TCR is roughly half that of the CMIP5 models. Accounting for different efficacies of various forcing agents could lead to further upward revision of the observation-based TCR estimates
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. Here we explore the potential influence of a low-end TCR on the near-term global temperature evolution by reducing the CMIP5 background warming by a factor of 2. The resulting synthetic timeseries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5b</xref>) show a number of cases with hiatus-like or warming-slowdown behaviour extending well beyond 2015. Several examples of these synthetic series even show an early 21st century hiatus/slowdown extending to be roughly comparable to the 1941–1973 hiatus. Using the CMIP5 RCP4.5 scenario instead of RCP8.5 (not shown) gives similar results to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5a,b</xref> through about 2030, but with less overall warming by 2050, as expected.
