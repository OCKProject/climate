<p class="p">Estimated probabilities, based on CM3 internal variability, for various trend scenarios (starting in 1998 and extending through 2030) are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, assuming two different background warming rates. Conditional probabilities, also in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, focus on scenarios that closely follow the historical trend behaviour since 1998. A hiatus of global warming (defined here as net trend of zero or less, beginning in 1998 and ending in some future year) would be very unlikely (1% probability or less) according to our simulations, if we assume the transient climate sensitivity in the CMIP5 ensemble is correct. If we halve the CMIP5 warming rate, then the probability of a hiatus beginning in 1998 being sustained through 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030 is estimated as 15%, 9, 5 and 3%, respectively (see examples in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5b</xref>). However, these estimates do not take into account knowledge about the observed warming since 1998. Restricting to only the 500 (of ∼5170 total) overlapped cases derived from the CM3 control run with global net trends over 1998–2015 that are closest to observed (0.11 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), the probability of a hiatus (trend&lt;0) extending to 2020, 2025 or 2030 drops to 2% or less, even with the weaker forced warming trend. Thus, the constraint of the observed warming since 1998 greatly reduces the odds of a long hiatus (like that from 1941–1973) now occurring.
