<p class="p">Twenty-five large multidecadal internal variability global cooling events in CM3 are identified in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref> (black segments/circles). The composite average trends of these events and of 25 similar warming events (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) show that during typical strong internal variability events, CM3's surface temperature anomalies are pronounced in the extratropics and high latitudes of both hemispheres. Trend maps for the individual events that were used to form the composites in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs 3 and 4</xref>, for cooling and warming events, respectively. As discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Note 2</xref>, the spatial structures of temperature trends for the individual events vary considerably between events, though a consistent feature is a pronounced high-latitude contribution.
