<p class="p">A particularly interesting case (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) is the estimated probability, using CM3's variability and the unmodified CMIP5 ensemble background warming rate (0.2 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), that a global warming slowdown (net trend&lt;0.1 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) will still persist through 2020, 2025 or 2030. While these probabilities are relatively low if we consider all CM3 internal variability cases (9, 5 and 3%), the probabilities rise to 16%, 11% and 8%, respectively, if we restrict the calculation to the 500 synthetic cases closest to the observed warming rate during 1998–2015. A previous study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref> has shown that the set of individual CMIP5 ensemble members with lower warming rates (&lt;0.1 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for at least 14 years) during 1995–2015 have very similar long-term projected warming rates to 2100. Here our analysis suggests that simulating a warming slowdown like that observed from 1998–2015 makes it more likely that a continued slowdown will occur over the next decade or so, assuming the background warming rate of CMIP5 models is accurate. In short, if CM3's internal variability is realistic, there is some chance that a rapid underlying warming rate of 0.2 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> could be ongoing as of 2015, but that this warming signal has been substantially masked (and may continue to be masked for even another decade or more) by an internal variability cooling episode.
