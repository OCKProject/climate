The near global (80°N-60°S) record is shown in the top panel, while the northern hemisphere extratropics (23.6°N-90°N) is shown in the bottom panel. We restrict our analysis to 80°N-60°S (rather than global) for model and observations due to the relatively sparse observations poleward of this domain in both hemispheres. Also shown on the plots for comparison (arbitrary vertical offset) are the observed mean surface temperature anomaly series (HadCRUT4 data

During the first ∼1,500 years of the control run (top curve of the pair of CM3 control model curves on each plot) the model drifts slowly towards a warmer climate state, then settles into a quasi-equilibrium state in terms of global and NH extratropical mean temperature. We fit separate linear trends through years 1–1530 and years 1531–5200 of the control run data to remove most of the influence of this secular drift from our subsequent global temperature evolution analysis.
