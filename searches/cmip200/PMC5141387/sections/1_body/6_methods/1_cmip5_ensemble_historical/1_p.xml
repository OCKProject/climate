<p class="p">The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble historical run timeseries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">5c</xref>) is formed from the 25 models and ensemble members identified in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>. Model data (blended SST and surface air temperature data, using skin temperature for sea ice-covered regions) is masked out where and when data are missing in the HadCRUT4 data set
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. Control run drift effects (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) on the historical run solutions are reduced by subtracting the linear trend field in each control run (computed for years 1–165) from each historical run ensemble member for that model. For FGOALS-g2 the control run drift adjustment is computed using years 151–315. The model ensemble historical series in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">5c</xref> have been extended beyond 2005 using RCP8.5 projection scenarios. Ensemble results for 2006 to 2015 are similar using the RCP4.5 scenario.
