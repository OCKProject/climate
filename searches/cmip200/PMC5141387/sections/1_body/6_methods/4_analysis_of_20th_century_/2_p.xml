<p class="p">The combined CMIP5 forced response and CM3 internal variability trend maps (for example, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6c,f,i,l and o</xref>) were created by adding the CMIP5 All-Forcing ensemble trend to all possible segments of that length from the CM3 control run to create a large sample of âˆ¼5,000 possible trend maps. We compare this large sample with the observed trend and identify the 10 independent (non-overlapping) members of the sample that have the lowest global mean absolute deviation from the observed trend field. The average of these best-10 samples is shown for each epoch in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref> panels (c,f,i,l and o) and (for the case where the CMIP5 All-Forcing contribution is not included) in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref> panels (c,f,i,l and o).
