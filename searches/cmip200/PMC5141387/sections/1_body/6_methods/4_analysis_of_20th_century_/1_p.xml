<p class="p">For mapped analysis of the spatial structure and magnitude of trends during five key historical epochs, we have chosen to emphasize the GISTEMP data set
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref> rather than the HadCRUT4 data set, since the GISTEMP has better spatial coverage in the high-latitude regions. This better spatial coverage is produced by imputing values for regions with missing data based on extrapolation from nearby regions with available data—that is, using all grid boxes located with 1,200 km of a station with available data. While trends in the extrapolated regions should be treated with caution, here we have chosen to use the GISTEMP trend maps for a preliminary exploration of the trend patterns, particularly since an important component of the modelled internal variability in CM3 extends into data-sparse regions of high latitudes in both hemispheres, as we show in our analysis.
