<p class="p">We identify 25 CM3 control run variability cooling episodes, which are combined with observed historical near-global (80°N-60°S) temperature and 21st century forced change from the multi-model ensemble of CMIP5 models (RCP8.5 scenario, with RCP4.5 also used as a sensitivity test), to create 25 synthetic global temperature annual-mean timeseries. For these prototype events, we assume that the internal-variability driven temperature anomaly peaks in year 2000, so that the 10-year mean corresponding to the warm peak value at the beginning of the cooling period is set equal to the observed anomaly averaged over 1996–2005. Beginning in 2001, a long-term, externally forced warming from the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble is added to each of the CM3 control run cooling episodes, adjusted so that the warming contribution is zero for the year 2000. We thus produce 25 synthetic future evolutions of global temperature anomalies under the assumption of a very strong global cooling episode resulting from internal variability, as simulated in the CM3 model, commencing around the year 2000.</p>
