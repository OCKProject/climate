<p class="p">The post-2000 global warming slowdown has been assessed as statistically inconsistent with the continued warming in CMIP5 models by some studies

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>, while others studies suggest the apparent discrepancy results from factors such as misrepresentations of forcing
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref> or the phase of internal variability

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref> in the real world versus CMIP5 models. Various factors that could lead to model-observation inconsistencies include: missing volcanic eruptions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>, stratospheric water vapour changes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>, missing data in warming regions like the Arctic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, and other data adjustments
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Regional trend patterns (1990s to 2013) show a strong Pacific cooling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref> resembling the negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref> with anomalously strong trade winds possibly linked to earlier warm anomalies in the Atlantic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. Aspects of 20th century global temperature evolution have been simulated
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref> using a climate model with eastern equatorial Pacific SSTs constrained towards observations. The Atlantic basin has also been proposed
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref> as an important region for heat uptake during the recent global warming slowdown. Previous work has shown
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref> that by manipulating a climate model's surface heat budget in the Atlantic basin only, northern hemisphere multidecadal variability similar to detrended observations could be reproduced. Some individual simulations from CMIP5 models can reproduce a slowdown similar to that observed
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref> and some aspects of the slowdown might have been predictable
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. A semi-empirical method
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref> suggests that the contribution of northern hemispheric internal multidecadal variability to global temperature likely peaked before 2000 and has been offseting anthropogenic warming since then.
