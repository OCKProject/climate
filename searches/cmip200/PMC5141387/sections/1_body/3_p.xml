<p class="p">Here we explore how long an early 21st century hiatus or slowdown could last, assuming a strong internally generated cooling superimposed upon ongoing anthropogenic warming. In a previous analysis
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>, the likelihood of a hiatus (zero or negative trend in global temperature) lasting 10 or 20 years in the presence of an underlying forced warming trend of 0.2 K per decade was estimated as ∼10% or &lt;1%, respectively, with the conditional probability of an existing 15 year hiatus lasting 20 years of up to 25%. We focus here on the period 1998–2015—during which the observed trend was about 0.1 K decade
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>—as the conditional target for simulations to match. Thus we are able to include the influence of the recent record warm year (2015) on the conditional probabilities and explore the influence of possible lower transient climate response (TCR) on future trends. We also explore possible internal variability contributions to regional temperature trends in other 20th century accelerated warming and hiatus epochs. We focus on internal variability simulated by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) CM3 model control run, which simulates the strongest multidecadal internal variability among the CMIP5 models we examined. We find that there are some conditions under which a continued global warming slowdown could occur over the next decade or more, due to either an overestimate of the TCR by CMIP5 models, or due to a partial offsetting of a relatively strong forced warming signal (as simulated by CMIP5 models) by an internal variability cooling episode lasting up to a few decades.
