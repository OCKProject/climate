<p class="p">Next, we remove the mean seasonal cycle (the mean EIE on each calendar day of the year) from the model output. Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F1" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F2" class="xref">2</xref> show the mean seasonal cycle for the Arctic sea-ice extent and the EIE for both the AR5 models and the observations. The inter-model variability is remarkable. It is noted in the IPCC report 
 <italic class="italic">Evaluation of climate models</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] that models are tuned to match the observed climate system, which in turn helps to give skilful predictions. However, as is evident in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>, where although the models may be tuned to match the Arctic sea-ice extent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>), if one calculates the EIE from the model output the variation from the observed seasonal cycle is substantial, not only in the magnitude of the mean seasonal cycle, but also in the qualitative shape of the curves. Namely, some models have a 
 <italic class="italic">cycloidal structure</italic>, with a plateau shaped region in winter and a deep well structure in summer. We emphasize again that the EIE not only mitigates the effects of land on the ice extent, but it also appropriately characterizes regional sea-ice characteristics. Thus, even if a model is able to faithfully reproduce the total ice extent, it is possible that regional differences between the models and the observations are large and summing these acts to minimize these differences [
