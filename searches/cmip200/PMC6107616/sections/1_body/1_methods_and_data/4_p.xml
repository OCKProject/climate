<p class="p">When viewing a time series as a temporal multifractal, there is no constraint on the number of allowable time scales present within the data. Thus, depending on the temporal resolution of the time series, one can extract all time scales corresponding to the physical processes governing the system. Kantelhardt 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] developed a multifractal generalization of detrended fluctuation analysis (a modification of the rescaled range method used by Hurst [
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] to study the dynamics of river discharge) called multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). We use a new variant of MF-DFA called multifractal temporally weighted detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-TW-DFA), which exploits the intuition that points closer in time are more likely to be related than points distant in time, providing a clearer signature of long time scales present in a time series [
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The detailed algorithm for MF-TW-DFA can be found in ([

 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and references therein) and this is the approach we use to analyse and compare the EIE (without a seasonal cycle) from AR5 models to that from the satellite observations. Because of the fact that there are no 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> assumptions made regarding the physical processes in the system, this method has also been used to explain the dynamics of Arctic sea-ice velocity fields [
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], and to detect exoplanets [
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and their atmospheres [
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. We note again that when the seasonal cycle is not removed from the sea-ice data multifractality is inhibited and hence all the time scales longer than annual are masked, which leads to erroneous interpretation of data or model output as obeying an AR-1 process.
