<p class="p">In an effort to improve understanding of Arctic sea-ice behaviour in the AR5 GCMs, we compare the daily satellite observations from 1978–2005 to the model output data with daily frequency for the same period. For parity in this comparison, we analyse the 21 AR5 models (shown in 
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref>) with daily data in their historical runs, and use the first ensemble member from 11 of these and two from the remaining 10 models. To be consistent in our comparison of all the models and the satellite observations, a common latitude–longitude grid of 0.5° × 0.5° is used and we interpolate the sea-ice concentration (or sea-ice area fraction) from the original model/observation grid onto this common grid. As is done for the observations, the sea-ice extent obtained from the models is then converted to EIE.
