<p class="p">Polar amplification and the ice–albedo feedback focus scientific study on the fluctuations in the areal coverage of high latitude ice. By area, on average the Southern Hemisphere ice cover is dominated by the Antarctic ice sheet, whereas in the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic sea-ice cover dominates. Although we can observe the daily ice cover from space, the substantial changes in Arctic ice mass during recent decades are associated with an ostensibly unmeasurable (approx. 1 W m

 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], the most reliably measured characteristic of sea ice is the hemispheric sea-ice extent, to which models are tuned and parametrizations refined. To this end, we compare the statistical structure of satellite observations of ice extent to that from model output.
