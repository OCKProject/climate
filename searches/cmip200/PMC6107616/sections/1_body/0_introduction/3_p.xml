<p class="p">The global climate models (GCMs) from the IPCC Assessment Report 5 (AR5) project the Arctic to be ice-free by the middle of this century, whereas the previous assessment projected this to occur at the end of the century. The AR5 models project the Arctic to be ice-free as early as 2030 to as late as 2100 ([
