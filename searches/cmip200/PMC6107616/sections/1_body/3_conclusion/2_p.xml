<p class="p">The observed Arctic sea-ice extent can be thought of as the ‘output’ of the highly complex nonlinear interactions governing the air/sea/ice system. It is a central goal of modelling to try and reproduce this output. A model can be tuned to match some of the observations, but if one is interested in making predictions about the future state of the system, one seeks to know the key underlying physical and dynamical processes and how they govern its central statistical response. Many studies compare the multi-model ensemble mean (MMEM) to observations, and argue that a sufficient condition for predictability is that the observations are within 1 s.d. of the MMEM. However, here we find that even the MMEM does not exhibit the robust observational features of white noise characteristics on annual–biannual time scales or the characteristic decadal time scales. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> compares the fluctuation functions for the EIE from the satellite observations (blue) to the MMEM. The longest crossover time scale present in the MMEM data is 1.8 years and that from the observations is 8.6 years. Therefore, simply summing different models to produce the MMEM does not provide the observed statistical structure of the ice pack.
