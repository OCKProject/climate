<p class="p">A central role of observations is to produce robust statistical metrics that can serve as a target for modelling. Whereas, even with incorrect physics, it is possible to match features of the observations, capturing the appropriate statistical properties should provide important litmus tests for models. Our method is agnostic with regard to the number of crossover time scales, and hence associated processes, that may be present in the system. Therefore, we hope that the fact that we capture both the shortest and longest observed processes in the ice pack will provide a useful and robust test bed for modelling studies.</p>
