<p class="p">The high-frequency processes governing shorter time scales are associated with the influence of synoptic systems, the intermediate time scales are seasonal and the longer—decadal—time scales are generally ascribed to climate processes [

 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] demonstrated that on annual–biannual time scales, the sea-ice extent is largely controlled by the wind fields over the Arctic. By comparing the sea-ice volumes from the models with the PIOMAS [

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] showed that the sea-ice thickness produced in the CMIP5 models is much less than what is observed. Therefore, although analysis of the Arctic sea-ice velocity fields from the CMIP5 models shows that most models reproduce the statistical characteristics of the observed velocity fields, if the sea ice produced by the models is too thin, the spectrum of its response to wind forcing will change. For example, Colony &amp; Thorndike [
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] showed that local low-frequency ice motion is linearly correlated with local synoptic wind forcing, but the local inertial motion is not, despite a high coherency between the inertial motion of the ice on the same length (approx. 100 km) scales. This highlights the role of mechanical interactions between ice floes on short time scales, which would not be captured in models producing thinner ice.
