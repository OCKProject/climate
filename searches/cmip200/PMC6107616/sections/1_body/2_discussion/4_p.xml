 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] tried to reduce the CMIP5 uncertainty for the Arctic to become ice-free, finding a spread of about 40–60 years. However, the absence of the longer time scales in the models that we have shown here provides a challenge for their predictive capability on decadal time scales. The origin of this lack of parity between satellite observations and the models will of course differ from model to model, but should provide an observational and statistical constraint for model physics, which has evidently not been met by the tuning and parametrization schema used thus far. Indeed, Swart 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSTA20170332C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] showed how a deliberately-biased picking of short-term trends to predict the long-term behaviour of sea-ice extent can lead to false conclusions. Similarly, our study demonstrates both quantitatively and qualitatively the reason behind such high inter-model spread on decadal time scales and longer.
