<p class="p">Here we compare the fluctuation functions from the AR5 models to the observations. The nature and number of figures are such that the majority of the results are presented in appendix A, and here we summarize the key features, which are (i) large inter-model variability in the crossover time scales extracted from the models, (ii) none of the models exhibit the decadal time scales found in the satellite observations, and (iii) only five (CNRM-CM5, MRI-CGCM3 , MRI-ESM1, FGOALS-g2, MIROC5 (second ensemble member)) of the 21 models exhibit the white noise structure (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTA20170332F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>) observed in the satellite record on annual to biannual time scales. Additionally, only four models exhibit time scales approaching decadal (7.2 years in BCC1-1, 4.8 years in FGOALS-g2, 7.9 years in NorESM1, 4.5 years in the second ensemble member of NorESM1 and 6 years in GFDL-ESM2G), whereas in all of the other models the longest time scale is of the order a year.
