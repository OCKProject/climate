 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] analyzed the impact of land use change on flooding over the Adyar sub-basin by integrating both the hydrologic and hydraulic models, but the impact of climate change was not considered in the analysis. Anushiya and Ramachandran [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] studied the changes in water balance components of the Chennai basin under present and future climate scenarios, but flood assessment was not addressed in this study. Though the Adyar sub-basin is receiving more floods in recent times, the climate change analysis was not used in the flood assessment studies carried out so far [

 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The Adyar sub-basin experienced severe flooding during November-December 2015 which is approximately a 165-year flood event. The severity of the flood was very extreme, indicating the need for the assessment of flooding under climate change scenarios.
