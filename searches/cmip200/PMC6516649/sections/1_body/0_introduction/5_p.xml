<p class="p">Based on the observed rainfall and the future GCM projections, this study addresses the impacts of climate change on fluvial flooding with an integrated analysis of the hydrologic and hydraulic models in order to develop flood inundation maps over the Adyar sub-basin for the present and future climate change scenario. Flood inundation mapping is used to identify the possible flooding areas for different return periods. The simulations of flood depths and areas will help the planners to distinguish floodplains and regulate the development in hazardous areas.</p>
