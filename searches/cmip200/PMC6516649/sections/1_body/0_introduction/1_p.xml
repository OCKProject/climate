<p class="p">Nowadays, the global climate is changing significantly [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. These changes lead to an increase in the global average temperature and variations in the rainfall intensity and frequency. Consequently, increase in the rainfall intensity and frequency will increase the runoff and peak discharge leading to an increase in flood events [

 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Flooding is considered one of the most disastrous global hazards which has been occurring more frequently in recent times [

 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Due to climate change, there could be a possible increase in flood hazards in the future [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Under climate change, developing countries like India are more vulnerable to flooding, which causes considerable economic losses [

 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Due to the increase in extreme rainfall events, the impacts of climate change on floods severely affect the Indian river basins located in low-lying floodplains [

 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, these impacts vary from place to place on a regional scale under climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. For sustainable development, a basin-scale assessment of impacts of climate change on flooding is necessary [

 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The impact studies on the affected basins under climate change were started off as a result of the recent flooding events across the country [
