<p class="p">Generally, the estimation of floods is carried out by incorporating meteorological and hydrological data by using Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves in the hydrologic model [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In order to simulate the extreme rainfall intensity for a river basin in hydrological modelling, IDF curves are used [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. IDF curves are derived by using rainfall time series data to reproduce the intensity and frequency of rainfall for different durations [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. A critical rainfall depth for different return periods is calculated from the IDF curves and distributed throughout the river basin [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Flood modelling requires both the hydrologic and hydraulic models. A hydrologic model is used to simulate flood discharges, whereas the hydraulic model simulates inundation levels of floods [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Hydrologic modelling can deal with the problems related to flooding at a basin or a sub-basin scale. HEC-HMS is the most commonly used hydrologic model, which is used in many river basin studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. For hydraulic modelling, HEC-RAS is used for the simulation of floods for impact assessment studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Various studies successfully integrated both the HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS models at a regional scale [
