<p class="p">The flood inundation maps indicate that nearly 32 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> area of Adyar is inundated for a normal 2-year storm event. However, a 20% increase in the flooded area is observed for the 5-year storm event, around a 31% increase in the flooded area is observed for the 10-year return period, nearly 50% increase in the inundated area is observed for the 50-year storm event, and a 60% increase in the area is observed for the 100-year storm event. Taking into consideration the future scenarios, the increase in the flooded area ranges from 1% to 7.8% for the 2-year return period and from 12.6% to 26.4% for the 100-year return period. The flood inundation maps depicts a clear picture about the impacts of climate change on the flooding pattern over the Adyar sub-basin. These results reveal that the peak discharge increases as a result of climate change, consequently increases the flood inundation over the Adyar sub-basin.
