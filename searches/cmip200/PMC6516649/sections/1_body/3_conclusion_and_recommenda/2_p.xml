<p class="p">This study successfully used the hydrologic and hydraulic models along with the GIS and also considered the climate change scenario for flood modeling over the Adyar sub-basin. Based on the model simulation, it is determined that the Adyar river can safely discharge the 2, 5, and 10-year floods. However, the 50 and 100-year floods are considered a threat for flooding over the Adyar river since its peak discharge exceeds the anticipated flood-carrying capacity. This fact is clearly justified by the past flood events that occurred in the Adyar river. According to the future scenarios, the increase in peak discharge ranges from 3.2% to 16.6% for the 2-year return period and from 34.3% to 91.9% for the 100-year return period. This is predicted by the 4 GCMs that were selected out of the 26 GCMs based on the higher ranked models in the statistical analysis. The cesm1-cam5 model was ranked 1st among the 26 GCMs, which estimated 91.9% increase in the peak discharge with 17.8% bias. The mpi-esm-mr model was ranked second, which estimated 44.3% increase in the peak discharge with 17.7% bias. The ncar-ccsm4 model was ranked third, which estimated 34.3% increase in the peak discharge with 19.9% bias. The bnu-esm model was ranked fourth, which estimated 49.9% increase in the peak discharge with 35.1% bias. This large fluctuation in the peak discharge is due to the presence of more extremities in the cesm1-cam5 model as compared to other GCMs. Analyzing the impact of extremities may be an additional approach in future studies. Moreover, different GCMs were used to project the impacts of climate change in this study but there exists some uncertainty associated with the GCMs, downscaling techniques and hydrological models [

Considering the changes in sea surface temperature (SST) patterns, internal variability, tropical cyclones etc., will be useful to quantify the uncertainties in the future projections which will be the future scope of the study[

 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The hydraulic model simulation shows that the water surface elevation exceeded the river banks in many cases. Hence, adequate measures are required to be taken in order to increase the flood discharge capacity of the river.
