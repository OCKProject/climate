<p class="p">The ArcGIS software was used to prepare flood inundation maps. In order to understand the significant changes in the flooded area according to the past and future climate change scenarios, these flood inundation maps were further analyzed. Based on the observed data, the flood inundation map for the 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100-year return periods is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216461.g011" class="xref">Fig 11</xref>. For different return periods, flood inundation maps were also generated for all four GCMs. The flood inundation maps for the projected GCMs ncar-ccsm4, mpi-esm-mr, cesm1-cam5, and bnu-esm4 for the 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100-year return periods are shown in Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216461.g015" class="xref">15</xref>. The flood inundation maps show that there is an increase in the flood depth from 1 m to 4 m around the Adyar river. It is observed that the upstream end of the river is more vulnerable as compared to the downstream end of the river. Based on the future projections, it is found that areas such as Varadharajapuram, Mudichur, Ankaputhur, and Thirumudivakkam located in the upstream end of the river are more vulnerable to flooding. Moreover, it is also reported that areas such as Chennai International Airport, Ramapuram, Saidapet, and Kotturpuram located in the downstream end of the river are also vulnerable to flooding. Finally, it is concluded that these flood maps are helpful in identifying the flood-prone areas in the Adyar sub-basin.
