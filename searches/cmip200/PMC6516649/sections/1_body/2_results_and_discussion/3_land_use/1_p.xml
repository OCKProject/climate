<p class="p">The land use map was prepared using the Landsat-8 satellite image for the year 2016. The land use of the Adyar sub-basin was divided into five classes, namely, barren lands, settlements, vegetation, water bodies, and forest. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216461.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B</xref> depicts the land use map of the Adyar sub-basin. The total area of the Adyar sub-basin is about 700 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, and 317 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of this area is barren land that covers almost half of the sub-basin. Settlements cover nearly one-fourth of the total sub-basin area, which is around 170 km
