<p class="p">For a normal 2-year storm event, nearly 32 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the area would be inundated in the Adyar basin. However, for a 5-year storm event, 20% increase is observed in the flooded area, for a 10-year return period, around 31% increase is observed in the flooded area, and for a 50-year storm event, 50% of increase is observed in the inundated area. However, for the 100-year event, 59% increase is observed in the inundated area. Similarly, the flooding pattern was calculated for different return periods according to future conditions. For different return periods, a comparison of the flood area between the observed and projected GCMs is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216461.g010" class="xref">Fig 10</xref>. It shows a significant change in the projected flooded area and the observed data. For the 2-year return period, no significant increase is reported in the flooded area between the observed and projected GCMs. For the 100-year return period, the flooded area of 58.69 km
