<p class="p">The HEC-RAS model is used to simulate the flood depths and flood extent. The flood inundation depth was calculated by intersecting the water surface elevations with the DEM data. Based on the observed data, the flood depths and flood inundation areas were calculated for the 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100-year return periods. For different return periods, the flooding pattern varies according to the present scenario as shown in
