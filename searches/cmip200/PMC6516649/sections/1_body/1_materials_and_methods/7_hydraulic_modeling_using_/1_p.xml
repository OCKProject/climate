<p class="p">HEC-RAS is a one-dimensional hydraulic model, which is used to simulate the surface water elevation along the river for the specified discharge hydrographs. The HEC-RAS model requires geometric data and flow data for simulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. HEC-GeoRAS is an extension of ArcGIS, which is used to create geometric data consisting of the river centerline, bank lines, flow path lines, and cross-sectional details. In order to extract the profiles of river station and elevation data along the cross-sections, the CartoDEM of 10 m resolution was used. By using the Leica DGPS instrument, a field survey was carried out to measure the elevation of the points along the banks of the Adyar river. An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) (Qliner) instrument was used to measure the elevation of the river bed. The geographical co-ordinates of the field survey points are shown in
