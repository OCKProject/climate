<p class="p">No specific permissions were required for these locations where DGPS survey and Qliner survey was carried out since the survey was not carried out in any private ownership land or protected area of land. This field survey did not involve any endangered species or protected species. To cross-verify the geometric data extracted from the DEM data, the above survey points were used. The details of bridges, such as a number of piers, pier width, roadway width, etc., were also collected from the field survey. These geometric data were then exported by using the HEC-RAS model. The steady flow data were used as inputs in the HEC-RAS model. The steady flow data consisted of flow type and boundary conditions. In this study, the flow type was assumed as mixed flow and the required boundary conditions were applied in the upstream and downstream ends of the river. The hydrographs derived from the HEC-HMS model were stored as the data storage system (DSS) format that can be opened in the HEC-RAS model [
