<p class="p">The HEC-RAS model simulated the water surface profile across all the cross-sections of the river. The flood depths for all cross-sections were computed as the peak discharges for the 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100-year return periods were calculated for the observed conditions. For the future projection of rainfall, the hydrographs generated from HEC-HMS for the selected four projected GCMs, namely, ncar-ccsm4, mpi-esm-mr, cesm1-cam5, and bnu-esm, were considered as flow inputs for the HEC-RAS model. The HEC-RAS model simulated the water surface profile for the projected GCMs and the flood depths were calculated. For the observed and projected scenarios, floodplain polygons were created for all return periods.</p>
