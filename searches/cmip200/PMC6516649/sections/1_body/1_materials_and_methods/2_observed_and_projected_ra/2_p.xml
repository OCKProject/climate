<p class="p">GCMs were used to project the future rainfall data for the period 2015â€“2085. In this study, raw GCM data were used in a CMIP5 dataset of IPCC AR5. Moreover, four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), namely, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, were used, each representing different anthropogenic radiative forces on the atmosphere [

First, these GCM data were statistically downscaled and bias-corrected by using the portal provided within the CCAFS website and then the bias-corrected GCM data were downloaded. Applying the pattern correlation (CORR), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and percentage bias, the performance of all 26 models were statistically evaluated. According to their performance, a score was assigned to each model, and the models with the highest ranks were selected (
