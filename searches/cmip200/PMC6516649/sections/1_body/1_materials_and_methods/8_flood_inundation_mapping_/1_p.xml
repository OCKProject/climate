<p class="p">In order to understand the effects of floods from a particular river, flood inundation maps are required. Both the water surface profile and floodplain extent are involved in flood inundation mapping [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The water surface profile and floodplain polygon that were simulated using HEC-RAS were postprocessed by using the HEC-GeoRAS extension in ArcGIS. The water surface profile consisted of water surface elevation at a point over the entire sub-basin. The difference between the water surface elevation and the terrain elevation from the DEM data provided the flood depth at a point in the sub-basin. The flood depth data were overlaid on the satellite image in ArcGIS. Based on the flood depths in the range of 0–1 m, 1–2 m, 2–4 m, 4–6 m, and &gt;6 m, the flood inundation maps were prepared for the observed and projected climate change scenarios with different return periods.
