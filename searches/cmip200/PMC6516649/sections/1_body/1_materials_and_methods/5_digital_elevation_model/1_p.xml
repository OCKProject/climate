<p class="p">High-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data are considered to be extremely useful in establishing the hydrologic and hydraulic models in order to provide accurate flood depth and extent [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The CartoDEM data of 10 m resolution were obtained by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad, India. The CartoDEM is a surface model of elevation, which covers the entire land surface of India. It is constituted of tiles with a size of 13.5 km × 13.5 km [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The whole study area was covered by the following tile numbers: D44U–1-NW, D44U–1-NE, D44U–1-SW, D44U–1-SE, D44U–1-NW, D44U–1-SW, D44T–13-NW, D44T–13-NE, D44T–13-SW, D44T–13-SE, D44O–4-SE, D44O–4-SW, D44O–8-SW, D44N–16-SE, and D44N–16-SW. These 15 tiles were supplied by the NRSC. Moreover, all the procured tiles were merged and geo-corrected in ERDAS IMAGINE 2014. In order to delineate the flow direction and the stream network in the Adyar sub-basin, the high-resolution CartoDEM data were used.
