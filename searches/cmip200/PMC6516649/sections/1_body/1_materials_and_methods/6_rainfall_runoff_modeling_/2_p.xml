<p class="p">In order to simulate the rainfall-runoff processes of a river basin, the Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer is widely used. The basin model, meteorological model, and control specifications are the main components of HEC-HMS [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The basin model provides the physical representation of the sub-basin which was developed by using the ArcGIS Software. The Arc Hydro tool, an extension in ArcGIS, was used to process the DEM data, to delineate the sub-basin and the stream network, and to extract the sub-basin properties, such as area, slope, flow length, stream network density, etc. Moreover, land use information, hydrologic soil group, and curve number were used as the inputs to the model. Based on the soil data collected from the Institute of Remote Sensing, Anna University, the hydrologic soil group map of the study area was prepared. Furthermore, the weighted curve number (CN) map was generated for the sub-basin considering the land use data, hydrologic soil group, and curve numbers. Digital elevation model, Land use, Hydrologic soil group and Curve number grid of the Adyar sub-basin are shown in
