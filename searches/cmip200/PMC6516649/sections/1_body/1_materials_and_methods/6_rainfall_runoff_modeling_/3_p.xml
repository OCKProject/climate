<p class="p">The SCS method is considered to be a simple and stable method. Generally, it is applied in different environments and provides good results [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The SCS method was used for model simulation, whereas the Muskingum method was used for channel routing. The SCS unit hydrograph (UH) was used for sub-basin transformation. By assuming the time of concentration as the duration of rainfall in a basin, the critical rainfall depth for a selected return period is determined by using the IDF curves. This critical rainfall depth is distributed over time across the basin [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. This rainfall intensity was considered as an input to the meteorological model of the HEC-HMS. The start and end of the computation period and time interval were specified in the control specifications. According to the present and future climate scenarios, the simulation run for the Adyar sub-basin was processed and the runoff hydrograph was generated for different return periods. In order to calculate flood inundation, these hydrographs were used as inputs for the HEC-RAS model.
