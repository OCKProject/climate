<p class="p">The study area boundary that covers the entire Adyar sub-basin and its surrounding areas was digitized by using toposheets 66 D 1&amp;5, C4, C8, 57 P 13, and 57 O 16 collected from the Survey of India (SoI) and the administrative map as shown at

By using the topographic maps of the Adyar sub-basin at the 1:50000 scale, a geometric correction was performed on the satellite image. First, the satellite image was geo-referenced in the cartographic projection (UTM Zone 44N, WGS84). Then, the satellite image was clipped along with the boundary of the study area. The satellite image was digitized manually by using the ArcGIS software in order to analyze and compute the areas under each land use class as adopted in the LULC scheme. Considering the standard Level I classification defined in an earlier report [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] and the local factors such as topography, land use, etc., five separate LULC classes, namely, agriculture land, barren land, forest cover, settlements, and water bodies, were defined. By using the Google Earth Explorer, the accuracy of the satellite image was cross-verified.
