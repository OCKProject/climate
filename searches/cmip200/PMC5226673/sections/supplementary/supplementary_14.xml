  <p class="p">Annual mean surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1901-1930 mean for 32 models in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble for RCP4.5 (blue) and RCP8.5 (red). The ensemble mean and the individual model projections from 2005 to 2099 are shown by colored thin lines and the globally averaged (land+ocean) ensemble mean projections are shown by colored dotted lines. The dotted grey lines indicate the baseline (1901-1930) and 1.5, 2, 3, and 4Â°C warming thresholds. The thick black line shows the observed (CRU) temperature anomalies from 1901-2014 for CONUS. The vertical grey line marks the boundary between historical and RCP CMIP5 simulations.</p>
