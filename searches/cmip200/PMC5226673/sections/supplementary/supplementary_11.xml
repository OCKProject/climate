  <p class="p">The masks are at 2.5°×2.5° resolution and created based on ‘Bukovsky regions’ [
   <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The region definitions in terms of Bukovsky regions are as follows: Northwest (NW): PacificNW+GreatBasin, Southwest (SW): PacificSW+Southwest, Rockies (R): NRockies+SRockies, GreatPlains (PL): CPlains+SPlains+Central, Midwest (MW), South (S), East (E), Northeast (NE). Some regions are created by merging original Bukovsky regions to avoid using too few grid-boxes in spatial and temporal averaging. Note that regions NorthAtlantic and Plains are sub-regions of East and Central respectively.
