  <title class="title">Boxplots showing the ranges in annual and seasonal temperature (top panel) and precipitation (bottom panel) projections spanned by 32 CMIP5 models for RCP4.5 and 8.5 for the globe, CONUS, and for 8 regions in CONUS.</title>
  <p class="p">Projections are calculated for two 20-year periods when the GMAT increase is 1.5°C (left) and 2°C (right) relative to the baseline (1901-1930). The annual mean projections are in black, summer (JJA) in red and winter (DJF) in blue. Filled circles indicate the ensemble mean projections. Triangles show the 5
   <sup class="sup">th</sup>-95
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile ranges for annual and seasonal mean fields based on 32 models across 20 years and 2 RCPs. The numbers below boxplots indicate Spearman rank correlation coefficients between GMAT warming and regional mean annual warming (top panel), and between regional seasonal warming and seasonal precipitation change (bottom panel) across 64 model projections. Only statistically significant coefficients at the 90% level are shown.
