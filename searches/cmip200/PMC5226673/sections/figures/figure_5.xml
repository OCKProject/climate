  <p class="p">The regional 2Â°C TCTs are calculated based on regional 5-year mean annual mean temperatures for RCP8.5 for 5 CMIP5 models with initial conditions ensembles. The red symbol indicates TCTs for one realization of the model included in all analyses. The blue symbols show TCTs for different members of the initial conditions ensembles. Gray shaded area indicates the spread in regional TCTs based on all 32 models, each with one realization.</p>
