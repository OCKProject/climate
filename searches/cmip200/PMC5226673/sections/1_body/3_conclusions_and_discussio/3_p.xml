<p class="p">The effect of different global temperature targets on climate extremes has been a focus of a number of previous studies. The global occurrence of temperature and precipitation extremes has been shown to increase non-linearly with global mean temperature [

 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] leading to large increases in high-impact extreme events for every degree increase in temperature. While the observed trends in the temperature extremes are within the bounds of natural variability [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], results based on CMIP3 and CMIP5 models indicate a substantial increase in summer temperature extremes in the US before global warming reaches 2Â°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The extreme high temperatures over CONUS are projected to increase linearly with GMAT, but at a slightly faster rate [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. While such trends in extremes have been noted, overall, the model projections of regional climate extremes remain highly uncertain due to differing model responses and large climate variability.
