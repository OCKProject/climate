<p class="p">The world leaders gathered for the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris in December 2015 agreed to take steps towards limiting the global mean annual surface air temperature (GMAT) increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts towards a target of 1.5°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Many studies argue that the 2°C target is overly optimistic [

 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], since the global emissions are currently tracking the high end of plausible scenarios [

 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] resulting in stringent limits on cumulative CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. While there is no real scientific basis to why global warming of 2°C should be considered ‘safe’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], it emerged as “the least unattractive course of action” [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and has been used as an easily understood, politically useful marker to communicate the urgency of the climate change problem and to drive action on a global scale. The inclusion of 1.5°C in the Paris Agreement, initially proposed by the small island nations, is especially pertinent to avoid the worst impacts of rising sea levels, and declining Arctic sea ice among other factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Unlike 2°C, the 1.5°C target is relatively unexplored, and studies highlighting its feasibility and impacts are beginning to emerge [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Under most low emission scenarios, global warming overshoots 1.5°C some time during the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century before dropping to this limit around or after 2100 [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. As a result, 1.5°C is considered an aspirational ‘long-term’ temperature goal.
