<p class="p">The GMAT increase of 1.5 to 2°C—relevant for global scale policy recommendations and mitigation strategies—is not a helpful metric for impacts assessment and adaptation planning at regional scales. The land regions of the Northern Hemisphere are warming at rates faster than the globe [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and are projected to cross the 2°C target before GMAT [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Therefore, information on regional climate projections and associated uncertainties for global warming thresholds of 1.5 and 2°C can prove beneficial to effectively communicate regional consequence of the Paris Agreement to the regional stakeholders (e.g., hydrologists, ecologists, resource planners). A study based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) simulations [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] demonstrated that the contiguous United States (CONUS) is projected to experience 2°C warming during the 2040s under the A1B scenario (see Fig 4 in [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]). Their analysis focussed on regions at subcontinental scales and is inadequate to determine how the rate of warming varies across the country, which is more relevant for regional planning. The historical warming trends are different across the country with the northern and Southwest US warming at much faster rates than the Southeast and southern Great Plains [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Similarly, the observed precipitation has increased over CONUS in the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, but with substantial seasonal and regional differences [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Studies of climate projections [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], however, do not discuss how projected warming trends vary across the US. Also, the traditional approach of using multi-model means for a future 20-30 year period to present climate change information is not useful in communicating the timing of regional changes for specific thresholds. We use data from the CMIP5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] multi-model ensemble (MME) for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]) to compare global, national and regional projections in terms of the timing and magnitude of temperature and precipitation changes for different global warming thresholds. Specifically, we provide a regional perspective for COP21 global temperature targets by addressing the following questions: (i) when will 1.5 and 2°C warming occur regionally in the US? and (ii) what are the temperature and precipitation projections for a region when GMAT crosses 1.5 and 2°C warming thresholds? Furthermore, we also describe agreement and uncertainties in model projections.
