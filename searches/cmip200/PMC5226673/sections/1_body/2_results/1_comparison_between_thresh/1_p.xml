<p class="p">The annual mean temperature anomalies relative to 1901-1930 mean (considered here to be comparable to the pre-industrial baseline) averaged over the contiguous US (CONUS) for 32 CMIP5 models and 2 RCPs are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>. The observed temperature evolution over the historical period is within the variability presented by the CMIP5 models. The ensemble mean projected warming over CONUS is greater than the global mean temperature increase for both RCPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The ensemble mean GMAT is projected to reach 1.5°C by around 2030 for both RCPs whereas the 2°C target is reached by 2040 for RCP8.5 and by 2050 for RCP4.5. The 3°C warming is projected to be reached soon after 2060 for RCP8.5, but not before 2100 for RCP4.5. For CONUS, the ensemble mean warming (solid colored lines) reaches all these temperature thresholds at least a decade earlier than the global mean temperature (dashed colored lines).
