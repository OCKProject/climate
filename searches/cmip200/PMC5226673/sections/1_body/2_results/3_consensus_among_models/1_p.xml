<p class="p">Uncertainty in climate change projections is described in two different ways in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g002" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g003" class="xref">3</xref>. The former shows uncertainty in the timing of a given climate change outcome, whereas the latter shows uncertainty in the magnitude of change for a given period. The timing of when CONUS mean annual temperature will cross the 1.5°C and 2°C thresholds differs substantially between models and greenhouse gas concentrations pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>) and similar analyses for regional temperatures show even more disagreement. Alternatively, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> provides a regional perspective for different global warming thresholds, but the ranges of regional projections are wide and may pose difficulties for planners and decision-makers. This information can, however, be expressed in terms of the percentage of models crossing a particular global warming threshold at any given time to reveal consensus amidst uncertainty.
