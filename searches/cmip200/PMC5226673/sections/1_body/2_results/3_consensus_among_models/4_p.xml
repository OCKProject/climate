 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>. By 2060, about 90% of the CMIP5 projections indicate at least 2°C warming over CONUS. For RCP8.5, all models cross this threshold by 2060 globally as well as regionally (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168697.s006" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>), whereas for RCP4.5 only 4 models (out of 32) cross the 2°C warming threshold after 2060. Since the differences between RCPs are larger at longer lead times, models disagree more on crossing times for 3°C than for 2°C. Nonetheless, over 90% of the projections indicate at least 2°C warming and about 60% indicate 3°C warming over CONUS by 2060. Since the Northeast is projected to cross the 2°C threshold about 20 years earlier than GMAT, it is projected to warm by 3°C (
