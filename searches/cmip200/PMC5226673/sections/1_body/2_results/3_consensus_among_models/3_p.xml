<p class="p">The regional TCTs discussed earlier are calculated for a single realization of every model, and by design, do not fully capture the impact of internal variability. The 5-year running means damp interannual variations, and provide reasonably accurate TCTs for a given realization of a climate model. But another realization of the same model with a different flavor of internal variability may lead to different TCTs. Several models participating in the CMIP5 activity submitted multiple simulations that were initialized using different but realistic initial conditions (IC) in an effort to sample internal climate variability [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. We use 5 CMIP5 models with multiple initial conditions simulations to investigate how internal variability affects regional TCTs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> shows that the regional 2Â°C TCTs for RCP8.5 can be different by a few years to two decades as a result of the unpredictable nature of internal climate variations. All models show significant spread in TCTs across the IC ensemble for northern regions such as the Northeast and the Midwest, but the spread is comparatively smaller for regions in the southern US (South, Southwest). This uncertainty in TCTs due to internal variability is, however, smaller than the spread in TCTs arising from using different models (indicated by gray shading in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) for all regions. So we conclude that while the TCTs based on 5-year means might be affected by the nature of decadal variability in individual models, the overall spread in TCTs is mainly due to differing sensitivities of these models to future changes in radiative forcing.
