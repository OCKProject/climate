<p class="p">For the regional warming threshold of 2°C, the variation in TCTs resulting from different model responses is much larger than that resulting from different scenarios. The regional 2°C TCTs for the ensemble mean projections for RCP4.5 lag behind those for RCP8.5 only by about 1 to 6 years across the US regions. Therefore, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> we have combined all CMIP5 projections (a total of 64; 32 each for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) to show the fraction crossing a 2°C threshold globally, for CONUS, and for eight US regions (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168697.s004" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>) at any given time in the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. It is clear from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> that the CONUS and regional mean annual temperatures cross the 2°C warming threshold well before GMAT. Regions within the US show different warming rates with mean annual temperatures in the South, Southwest, Great Plains rising slower than that for CONUS. The Northeast is projected to warm the fastest whereas the South is slowest (although still faster than the global mean). The Northeast is projected to cross the 2°C threshold about 15 years earlier than the South and about two decades before GMAT. For instance, about 80% of the projections indicate 2°C global warming by 2060 whereas the same percentage of projections cross the 2°C threshold in the Northeast by 2040. Additionally, all models project faster warming in the Northeast and the eastern US than the South and the Southwest, which indicates that there is an agreement among models with regard to the pattern of differential warming across the US even though they disagree on the threshold crossing times.

In contrast, Figs
