<p class="p">The regional consequences of global warming of 1.5 and 2°C can be understood by determining the timing of when GMAT crosses these thresholds and by calculating regional projections for those times. It is evident from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> that an exact determination of when a given GMAT threshold will be crossed is not possible due to the spread in future projections. We, therefore, calculate projections for 8 regions in the US (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168697.s004" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>) for two 20-year periods (2020-2039 and 2036-55). These two periods indicate when the mean GMAT projections calculated across all 32 models and 2 concentration pathways (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) are 1.5°C and 2°C above the baseline respectively (see yellow dotted line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The comparison between the ranges in global, CONUS and regional temperature and precipitation changes spanned by 64 model projections (32 models and two RCPs) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. Here, each projection is considered equally likely regardless of the model and emissions scenario. By using a large number of CMIP5 models for one medium stabilization scenario (RCP4.5) and one high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), we believe that our results span the range of uncertainties in climate change projections reasonably well.
