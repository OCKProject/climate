<p class="p">For the 20-year period when the ensemble mean projection for GMAT is roughly 1.5°C, the individual models produce warming estimates ranging between 1°C and 2.2°C as a result of differing climate sensitivities. The ensemble mean warming for CONUS is higher (2°C) than that for GMAT and ranges from 1°C to 2.7°C. A wide range in warming at a regional scale compared to global and CONUS ranges is a result of larger climate variability and because individual models produce markedly different responses at regional and short time scales. The regional projections are strongly season-dependent; summer (JJA) warming is more pronounced in most regions than winter (DJF) warming. The only exception is the Northeast where greater warming is projected for winter. With the exception of winter warming for the South and Southwest regions, over 75% of model projections indicate higher than 1.5°C seasonal and annual mean warming for all regions by the time global warming reaches 1.5°C. For the second 20-year period corresponding to global warming of 2°C, the uncertainty in the regional projections is higher. The lower bounds of temperature projections in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> typically represent how low climate sensitivity models respond to RCP4.5 whereas the higher bounds are determined by the responses of high climate sensitivity models to RCP8.5. Since the low sensitivity models indicate very little warming globally as well as regionally throughout the century, the lower bounds of projections are comparable across regions. Additionally, RCP4.5 is a stabilization scenario [

 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The largest differences between global and regional projections can be seen at the higher end of regional projections. The ensemble mean and median warming estimate for all regions in the US are higher than those for the globe, indicating that the enhanced warming at regional scales is projected by most models in the CMIP5 ensemble. Overall, the models that project greater (smaller) warming at a global scale also project greater (smaller) warming at regional scales as indicated by high Spearman rank correlations between the global and regional warming across all model projections (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168697.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Among the regions examined, the Northeast and the Midwest are projected to warm most with over 2.5°C warming in both seasons when the GMAT increase is 2°C. While the 20-year mean projections describe the overall effect of global warming on a region, they mask the interannual variations that are important for impacts assessment. Year-to-year estimates of regional temperature projections over the two 20-year periods show significant variation (see 5

This result highlights the influence of climate variability at regional scales on our results. Nonetheless, the regional projections for the GMAT increase of 2°C can be clearly distinguished from those for the GMAT increase of 1.5°C.
