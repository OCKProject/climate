<p class="p">The analysis is based on climate model simulations that contributed to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]). The CMIP5 MME used here comprises 32 models (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168697.s001" class="xref">S1 Text</xref>) and includes surface air temperature (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168697.s002" class="xref">S1 File</xref>) and precipitation data (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168697.s003" class="xref">S2 File</xref>) from historical and two RCP (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) simulations. The simulations over the historical period (1880-2005) are compared against gridded observations: Climate Research Unit Time Series (CRU TS version 3.23) data for temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and University of Delaware (UDel) data for precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0168697.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. All model data and observations were first regridded to a common 2.5°×2.5° latitude-longitude grid using bilinear interpolation to allow for comparisons to be made at same resolution. Temperature and precipitation anomalies were calculated relative to the mean of 1901-1930, the period which is common to all data sets and serves as a pre-industrial baseline for all comparisons. Note that the annual means for a given year are calculated from December of the previous year to November of that year.
