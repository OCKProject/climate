 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> concentration in India by analysing 13 Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) model data for two climate change scenarios represented by representative concentration pathways, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and combine with demographic and socioeconomic projections used in the five shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios as key scenario drivers

 </sup> to estimate future premature mortality burden for 10 combined RCP–SSP scenarios. Ambient PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure in India is projected to drop below the baseline period exposure only after 2050 under the RCP4.5 and after 2090 under the RCP8.5 scenario. Changes in meteorology induced by climate change are expected to decrease PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure by 7–17% in the future under the RCP4.5 scenario. The baseline mortality is projected to decrease rapidly in future. On the contrary, population is projected to increase till 2050 for all five SSP scenarios beyond which it is projected to increase further only for SSP3. All these factors are expected to influence the projected premature mortality burden over India spatially and temporally. We hope that our results might help steer policy to mitigate air pollution in future decades such that co-benefits can be obtained by restricting both health impacts and climate change.
