 </sup> (~1.0 million), though such estimates are being updated due to modifications in concentration–response function based on new epidemiological evidence, alterations in concentration estimations due to different methodology and databases and adjustment for local health conditions.

 </sup>. Global warming has added further complexity in resolving this problem. Climate change is expected to modulate ambient PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure by perturbing ventilation rate (that depends on atmospheric boundary layer depth and wind speed), precipitation scavenging, dry deposition, anthropogenic and natural emissions and background concentration
