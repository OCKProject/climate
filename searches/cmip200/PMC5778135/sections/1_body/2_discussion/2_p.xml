<p id="Par23" class="p">The coverage of the Great Pollution Episode of 2016 in Delhi by the mass media and the reports of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) assessment have created an awareness among the general public about the menace of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> on human health in India. After the November episode, graded action plan was implemented in the city of Delhi by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change as per the directive of Honâ€™ble Supreme Court of India (

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has also started various initiatives

 </sup> including formation of a steering committee that published a report on a multi-sectoral approach to combat air pollution. One can hope that these efforts will drive intersectoral mitigation measures in the future to create a cleaner India just like the policy interventions after the Great London Smog event of 1952 succeeded in making London one of the cleanest cities in the world

 </sup>. India, however, is coming to recognize the need for air pollution control when it still has much traditional pollution in villages due to biomass fuel use as well as a growing and largely uncontrolled modern sector. Both have significant impacts and interact in the sense that household sources are also major sources of ambient pollution. As a result, the total health burden per capita is likely higher in major Indian cities (e.g., Delhi) than in London, which started its control of ambient pollution well after it had given up open fires for cooking, although still using coal for space heating. Arguably, therefore the urgency is higher now in India. The Lancet Commission 2015

 </sup> identifies that the continued acceleration of greenhouse gases and pollutant emissions along with changing demographical features would make climate change an increasingly severe risk to human health. Implementing measures to mitigate air pollutants like PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> assures co-benefits in terms of reducing climate altering pollutants (which plays an important role in accelerating climate change) and averting premature mortality
