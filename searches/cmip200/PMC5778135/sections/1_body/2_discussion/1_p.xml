 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure in India for the period 2011â€“2100. Our results provide an overview of premature mortality burden attributed to demographic and epidemiologic changes and meteorological changes in response to climate change. Though the premature mortality burden from PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure in India is projected to decrease in the forthcoming decades, the absolute values are quite large and therefore the decreasing trend should not be taken lightly. Our estimates (absolute numbers) vary due to the underlying assumptions (see Methods section), but banded estimates that incorporate variations in assumptions provide comprehensive datasets across multiple scenarios that will facilitate policymakers in formulating appropriate strategy to deal with climate change in India. We note that, in addition to change in ambient PM
