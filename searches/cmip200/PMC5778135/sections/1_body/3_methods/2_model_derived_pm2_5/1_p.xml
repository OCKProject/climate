<p id="Par26" class="p">Thirteen models from the CMIP5 family were considered in this study, name of which along with their respective grid resolutions are listed in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>. PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> was estimated from each of the models for the period 2011 up to 2100 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios following two approaches. Estimated PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> by each model was downscaled statistically to 0.5° × 0.5° resolution to negate the inconsistency among the grid resolutions of these 13 models and to be at par with the resolution of MISR-retrieved PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>.
