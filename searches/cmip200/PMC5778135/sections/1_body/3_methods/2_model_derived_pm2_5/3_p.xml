<p id="Par28" class="p">Approach 2: AOD simulated by each of the 13 CMIP5 models was converted to surface PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> using the same conversion factor 
 <italic class="italic">η</italic> (i.e., PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>/AOD) as has been used to estimate satellite-derived PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> for the baseline period. Since the space–time variation of 
 <italic class="italic">η</italic> depends on meteorology, consideration of the same 
 <italic class="italic">η</italic> in the future where AOD is simulated from changing emissions as per RCP scenarios implies that the estimated PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> in future is only governed by the change in emission and not by the meteorology. Difference in the estimated PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> by these two approaches can isolate the role of meteorology in warming climate in modulating PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> distribution.
