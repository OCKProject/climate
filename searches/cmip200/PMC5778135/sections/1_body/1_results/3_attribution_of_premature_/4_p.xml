<p id="Par20" class="p">We also perform an analysis to examine the effect of changing meteorology due to climate change in modulating the projected premature mortality burden (SA3). We project the difference in premature mortality estimated by using PM

 </sup> estimated a little benefit in terms of averted premature mortality in South Asia till 2030 due to projected meteorological changes due to climate change. However, for India, our estimate is that meteorology will help averting 9100–12,300 premature deaths per year in near future (2031–2040) under the RCP4.5 scenario and 5500–7900 premature deaths under RCP8.5 scenario for all the SSP populations. In distant future, favourable meteorological condition is projected under the RCP4.5 scenario to avert 15,700–39,500 premature deaths per year. In the far future, 18,800–88,400 premature deaths per year will be averted under the RCP4.5 scenario due to meteorological changes induced by global warming. It is expected that the meteorology under RCP8.5 scenario will aggravate premature mortality burden per year after 2050 until the last decade of the century when the meteorological condition turns favourable to avert 700–2900 deaths per year.
