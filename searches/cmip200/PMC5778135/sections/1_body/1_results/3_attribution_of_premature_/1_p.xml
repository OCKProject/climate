 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure depends on baseline mortality and exposed population. We carry out four sensitivity studies (SA1–SA4; summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) to understand the relative importance of each of these individual factors in the estimated burden. In the first sensitivity study (SA1), we isolate the impact of future demographic transition on the premature mortality burden. The second sensitivity study (SA2) isolates the impact of epidemiologic/health transition, due to the growing economy, on the future burden. The third sensitivity study (SA3) is designed to separate out the impact of meteorological changes due to climate change on the future premature mortality burden. In the fourth sensitivity study (SA4), we assume that policy interventions would be enforced on sources of air pollution, which would limit the PM
