<p id="Par19" class="p">In the second case, we use population and exposure for the baseline period and the baseline mortality as a function of projected GDP in future from all the SSP scenarios to estimate the premature mortality burden. The difference between this case and the estimated premature mortality using baseline period exposure, exposed population and baseline mortality can be attributed solely to the epidemiologic transition and is labelled as SA2 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The negative change indicates that epidemiologic transition in future is expected to reduce the premature mortality burden. It is noted that the demographic and epidemiologic changes act in opposite direction though negative epidemiologic transition is unable to compensate fully for positive demographic transition for any of the SSP populations in any of the representative decades except for SSP1 and SSP5 in far future.
