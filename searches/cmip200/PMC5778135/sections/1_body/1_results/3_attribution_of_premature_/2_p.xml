<p id="Par18" class="p">We estimate the expected premature death in 3 representative decades (2031–2040, 2061–2070 and 2091–2100) for two hypothetical cases. In the first case, we use projected population based on SSP scenarios but the baseline mortality rate and PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure are considered for the baseline period. The difference between this case and the estimated premature mortality using baseline period exposure, exposed population and baseline mortality can be attributed solely to the demographic transition and is tagged as SA1 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The positive values indicate that projected demographical change in the future decades plays a role in aggravating the premature mortality burden in future. We see that the contribution of demography towards modulating the premature mortality burden is the highest in the distant future (2061–2070) for SSP1, SSP2, SSP4 and SSP5 when the projected population for these four SSP scenarios reach the peak (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>). On the contrary, the demographic contribution is expected to be the highest in the last decade (2091–2100) for SSP3 scenario. The projected change in Indian population by age is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>. For all the SSP scenarios, we see that the aged population is projected to increase substantially while the relative count of younger population is projected to decrease.
