 </sup> (see Supplementary Note). As we move away from the origin diagonally (from SSP1 towards SSP3), challenges for both mitigation of climate change and adaptation to it increase. SSP2 is the midway scenario with intermediate challenges for adaptation and mitigation, and SSP4 is the scenario with no challenge for mitigation but a higher challenge for adaptation. SSP5 has high challenge for mitigation but no challenge for adaptation. We note that the SSP forcing targets are not considered in this analysis; rather we use the RCP scenarios to estimate PM
