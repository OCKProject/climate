<p id="Par14" class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows the future premature mortality burden in India relative to the baseline period. Under the RCP4.5 scenario for all five demographic and socioeconomic projections of the SSP scenario drivers, total premature mortality burden is expected to decrease in the future relative to the baseline period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). We speculate that the reason for this is the steep projected fall in the baseline mortality for all the diseases in the future (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>) as the GDP is expected to increase over India as per the SSP scenario descriptions. Crude premature mortality rate (per 100,000 exposed population) is also expected to decrease in future for all the SSP population projections under RCP4.5 scenario (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Highest ( ± 1
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>) rate of crude premature mortality burden per 100,000 exposed population at the end of the century is expected for the SSP3 population (11.8 ± 4.8) followed by SSP4 (7.3 ± 2.9), SSP2 (5.8 ± 2.4), SSP1 (4.3 ± 1.7) and SSP5 (3.2 ± 1.3) for the RCP4.5 scenario. The combination of SSP3 and RCP8.5 scenario projects premature mortality burden to increase above the baseline period after 2050. This is because SSP3 population is projected to increase rapidly in the future decades, which in combination with a higher ambient PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure under RCP8.5 is expected to overcome the reduction in baseline mortality per capita, thus aggravating the premature mortality burden. Combinations of all other SSP demography and socioeconomic projections with PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure for RCP8.5 scenario project a decrease in premature mortality burden in future (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Premature mortality burden per 100,000 population (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>) for the combination of SSP3 population under the RCP8.5 scenario exposure decreases throughout the century relative to the baseline period. This further clarifies the claim that the projected surge in SSP3 projected population enhances the premature mortality burden in the middle of the century above baseline period premature mortality burden (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Crude premature mortality burden per 100,000 population at the end of the century under RCP8.5 scenario is expected to be highest for SSP3 population (15.6 ± 5.2) followed by SSP 4 (9.6 ± 3.1), SSP2 (7.7 ± 2.5) and SSP5 (4.3 ± 1.4). The total premature mortality burden for all the 10 combined scenarios in all the decades is summarized in Table
