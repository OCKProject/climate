 </sup> that projects a decrease in premature mortality burden below the present-day level after 2050 in India only for the RCP4.5 scenario, our results depict a decrease in the premature mortality burden below the present-day level much earlier by the next decade under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios except the RCP8.5–SSP3 combined scenario. This difference can be attributed to our consideration of the projected improving economic condition in India as a major determining factor in our estimated premature mortality burden in future.
