<p class="p">The discrepancy between the two approaches (model versus grid point statistics) at larger scales is illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a that compares multimodel cumulative temperature and precipitation statistics. At the global scale, the temperature response is between 2.5 and 5.0 K using model statistics and between 1.9 and 5.8 K using grid point statistics. This illustrates how the overall spread is exacerbated at the global scale (here by 1.4 K) when information is extracted at the grid point level. For precipitation, neither the driest (+2%; i.e., still an overall wetting) nor the wettest (+23%) global mean model response resembles the driest (−23%; a global reduction in precipitation) or wettest (+79%) response obtained from aggregating grid point statistics. Therefore, if the largest changes in precipitation were selected everywhere (whether the driest or wettest response), this would be inconsistent with our physical understanding of the climate system at the global scale (although the exact range of the possible global precipitation response is not easy to quantify as it is constrained by the energy budget as well as the atmospheric moisture content (Allen &amp; Ingram, 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>)) and it would be far from that projected by any single model. This further illustrates the dissimilarity in the two approaches. Globally as well as hemispherically, the use of grid point statistics inflates the uncertainty in precipitation so much that the full uncertainty range (minimum to maximum change) based on the individual models is close to the 25%–75% percentile range based on grid point statistics. As Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> suggests, this effect is also present at the continental (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b) and even at subcontinental scales. For precipitation in particular, the latter is confirmed by Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> that summarizes the same statistics at the somewhat smaller regions used and presented in the IPCC Atlas (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013b</xref>); the discrepancy is, however, larger when aggregated over larger regions. Figures 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> further illustrate that the physical consistency between temperature and precipitation that exists within each individual model is basically lost in an analysis based on grid point statistics. This issue needs to be addressed as well if physically consistent climate projections of multiple variables are to be extracted from multimodel ensembles (Piani &amp; Haerter, 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>).
