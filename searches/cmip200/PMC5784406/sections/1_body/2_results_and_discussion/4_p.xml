<p class="p">Statistics at the grid point level is most often used for illustrative purposes (e.g., in the IPCC Atlas). However, an approach commonly used in impact research uses a similar way of regional ranking to select a subset of climate models to represent the spread in regional climate change projected by the full ensemble (Lutz et al.,

 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Figures

 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> compare regional ranking with ranking at the global/grid point scale for Europe, Northern/Central Europe, and the Mediterranean region. The differences between the three approaches are larger for precipitation than for temperature. For Europe as a whole (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), the regional ranking (d) is a balance between less precipitation in the southern part of the domain and more precipitation to the north; that is, the model with the lowest regional ranking has a large decrease in precipitation in Southern and Central Europe combined with only a small increase in Northern Europe. When the min/max changes are selected in each grid point without further constraints (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>e), there are much larger differences between the two extremes than in the regional approach. For global ranking (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>f), there is no systematic increase in regional precipitation change when going from one extreme to the other (
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>f, left to right). Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> illustrates that there is a larger similarity in regional and grid point statistics for the smaller regions. This indicates that ranking at the regional scale may lead to similar inconsistencies as ranking at the grid point scale; for each region, the models with the most extreme local climate change could be selected and aggregated regionally or globally this would result in a larger uncertainty range than projected by the individual models. Similar issues relate to probabilistic regional climate projections (Frieler et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Hawkins &amp; Sutton, 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Schleussner, Rogelj, et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Schleussner, Lissner, et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>); if the multimodel based climate change signal is chosen in each grid point (or subregion), the associated global mean change would exceed the range projected by the collection of individual models. This also implies that estimating the probability for a change locally in any particular region using the multimodel ensemble statistics prevents a consistent probabilistic statement about the change in any other region, as this would potentially be in conflict with the global mean giving an overall constraint in any given model realization.
