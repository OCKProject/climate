 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the spread in projected annual mean temperature change (2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005) using output from the 39 CMIP5 models included in the IPCC Atlas for the RCP8.5 scenario. In Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a, an approach identical to that adopted in the IPCC Atlas is used; that is, information from all 39 models is ranked grid point by grid point. The resulting spread between absolute minimum values and maximum values of change is evident, particularly for all land regions and the two polar regions. In Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b, the models are ranked according to their projected change in global mean temperature (a measure of model climate sensitivity), such that each panel shows temperature changes for one single model. Comparing column by column, differences are particularly evident for the minimum and maximum rankings and also clearly visible at the 25th and 75th percentiles. Similar statistics for projected changes in annual mean precipitation (2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005) are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. For grid point statistics, the total spread is large in all grid points, giving a range consistent with no change and an apparent large uncertainty almost everywhere. On the other hand, each individual model shows a distinct pattern of change far from the extremes indicated in Figure 
 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a. The detailed dynamical shifts in atmospheric circulation responsible for the precipitation changes in individual models differ, and displacement of major convergence and divergence zones with just a few hundred kilometers results in large numerical differences. Strongly varying model deficiencies in reproducing observed atmospheric circulation and dominant modes of variability holds part of the signal in the projected precipitation patterns in essence creating the lack of grid point consistency across models highlighted in Figure
