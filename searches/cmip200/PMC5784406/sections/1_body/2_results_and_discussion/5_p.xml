 <xref rid="grl56635-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> also clearly show that the resulting range of regional changes is smaller, when global ranking is applied, especially for precipitation where there is no systematic increase. Regional climate processes may generate a range of regional climate change signals which are important locally but without having a large impact on the global ranking. In this case, we do not capture the regional range of climate change signals which is constrained by the global ranking. This implies that impact studies relying on global selection criteria, for example, (Warszawski et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) are consistent at the global scale (McSweeney &amp; Jones, 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) but at the expense of underestimating the regional model spread as projected by the full ensemble. These issues also need to be addressed when global climate models are selected for dynamical downscaling over multiple regions (McSweeney et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Applying a multimodel dynamical downscaling approach as adopted by CORDEX (Giorgi &amp; Gutowski, 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and in previous coordinated experiments, for example, PRUDENCE (Christensen et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and ENSEMBLES (Christensen et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) using grid point‐based statistics further exacerbates the apparent model spread (Deque et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Jacob et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). While climate change impacts are realized locally, the aggregated impacts on larger scales will never be realized as the worst or best case everywhere. The causal interlinkages between regional change as realized through recognizable patterns of change (e.g., as found by individual models) are important teleconnections that limit the validity of any implicit assumption about local independence of change; that is, the laws of physics constrain the statistics.
