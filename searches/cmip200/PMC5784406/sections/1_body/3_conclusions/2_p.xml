<p class="p">We have shown that grid point statistics grossly degrades available patterns of information present in multimodel climate projections and consequently inflates uncertainty estimates based on a multimodel ensemble. We further point out that similar inconsistencies arise when subsets of climate models are selected based on regional criteria or when regional probabilistic projections are applied using global models. If global selection criteria are used instead, the plausible range of projections may be underestimated at the regional scale. Using statistics based on values ranked at the grid point or very local level therefore poses a major problem at the global, continental, and regional scales as it severely inflates the uncertainty as represented by model spread. An important consequence of this finding is that impact analyses relying on multimodel information based on grid point ranked statistics will indicate a likelihood of highly unwanted future impacts, a risk primarily resulting from the inflated uncertainty and unlikely to be physically realizable. Such analyses may lead to costly overadaptation and hence maladaptation. These caveats should be carefully considered when multimodel projections are used in impact studies, and any selection of subensembles should be based on appropriate, well‚Äêargued, and transparent choices.</p>
