<p class="p">The sets of simulations available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 and Phase 5 (CMIP3 (Meehl et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>)) have been shown to extract common patterns of regional change of temperature and precipitation, while model spread has been used to gauge the regional agreement between models and thereby assess the significance of the change (Collins et al.,

 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013a</xref>) as well as to inform about the associated uncertainty (Tebaldi et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The apparent robustness of climate change patterns together with the observation that a multimodel average often outperforms any individual model when compared to observations (Gleckler et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) suggests that the multimodel mean of a particular climate variable is indicative of a best estimate of the future pattern of change (Knutti et al., 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Knutti &amp; Sedlacek,
