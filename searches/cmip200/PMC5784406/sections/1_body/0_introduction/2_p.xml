<p class="p">Climate scenarios are widely used to explore likely impacts of climate change. For use in risk‚Äêbased impact analyses, there is an increasing demand for probabilistic climate change information based on multimodel approaches. However, information from multimodel ensembles may be extracted in several ways with different implications for the uncertainty of the resulting climate change projections. Pattern scaling, that is, simple scaling of multimodel mean changes of temperature and precipitation patterns with global mean temperature change, has long been used to generalize climate change information beyond the information available from single climate models (Santer et al.,
