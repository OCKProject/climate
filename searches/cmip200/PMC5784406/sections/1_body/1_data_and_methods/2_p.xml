<p class="p">The analysis is based on the set of 39 models used in the IPCC Atlas for the RCP8.5 scenario (Table AI.1 in IPCC,

 <xref rid="grl56635-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). The temperature and precipitation fields are remapped to a common T42 Gaussian grid with an approximate horizontal resolution of 2.8°. Bilinear interpolation is applied for temperature, whereas precipitation is remapped conservatively (Jones, 
 <xref rid="grl56635-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Twenty year average changes of annual mean surface air temperature and relative changes of annual mean precipitation are calculated for 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005. In the analysis, these are ranked both model wise (one pattern for each of the 39 models) and grid point wise, that is, by ranking values of change at each grid point individually and aggregating these into 39 patterns all with contributions from multiple models. Global and regional means of simulated change in temperature and precipitation are then calculated and cumulative distributions are used to compare the number of models/patterns (vertical axis) that reach a certain level of change (horizontal axis) using each of the two ways of ranking.
