  <p class="p">Grid point and model statistics for Northern Europe, Central Europe, and the Mediterranean region. Spread in relative precipitation changes (2081–2100 with respect to 1986–2005) for the RCP8.5 scenario and an ensemble of 39 CMIP5 models using three different approaches. (a, d, and g) The models are ranked according to their regional mean change in precipitation, (b, e, and h) the values are ranked grid point by grid point, and (c, f, and i) the models are ranked according to their global mean precipitation change.</p>
