  <p class="p">Scatterplots of the standardized NDJF SST anomalies (SSTA SD) of IPWP Niño events vs (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) the 70°N–90°N DJF zonal mean temperature anomalies at 100–50 hPa, and (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) the 50°N–70°N DJF zonal mean zonal wind anomalies at 50–10 hPa, based on CESM-WACCM4 historical simulations (1850–2005) provided by CMIP5. For all quantities, the variance linearly associated with ENSO and the QBO was regressed out before the data were stratified using the IPWP Niño strength. The correlation coefficient R for the linear fit (black; for SSTA SD from 0 to 1) is provided in the upper-left corner of each plot. A polynomial fit better describes the relationship, because adjusted R
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> for a polynomial fit is larger than a linear fit (shown in the bottom-right corner of each plot).
