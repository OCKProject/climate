<p id="Par17" class="p">When the strength of the IPWP Niño is below the 1σ threshold, the intensity of the polar stratospheric temperature and zonal wind anomalies increases with increasing IPWP Niño strength. However, the response reverses and becomes weaker when IPWP Niño strength exceeds the 1σ threshold. This nonlinear relationship between IPWP SST anomalies and the NH stratospheric response is seen in CESM-WACCM4 CMIP5 historical simulations from 1850 to 2005. As 1σ is the point at which nonlinearity begins to develop in the stratospheric response, we used 1σ as the threshold to separate the IPWP Niño events into two groups (moderate and strong). By comparing the composition of the anomalous stratospheric temperature and circulations during moderate and strong IPWP Niño events, we found that the stratospheric circulation and temperature response is weaker during strong IPWP Niño events than during moderate events based on ERA-Interim for the period 1979–2017. That is, the stratospheric polar vortex is significantly warmer and weaker during moderate IPWP Niño events, whereas there is no significant signal during strong IPWP Niño events in the observations.</p>
