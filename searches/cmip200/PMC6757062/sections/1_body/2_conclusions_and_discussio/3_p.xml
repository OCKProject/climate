<p id="Par18" class="p">Idealized model experiments with scaled IPWP Niño SST forcing have been performed to isolate the signal from IPWP Niño and to validate the nonlinearities arising from IPWP Niño strength. After the westward extension of precipitation into the Maritime Continent, there is some cancellation between the extratropical response to the west part convection over the Maritime Continent and the response to convection over the east warm pool. This leading to the attenuation of extratropical wave response, with a ~10° westward shift in the Aleutian low region during strong IPWP Niño events. Thus, the wave-1 component moves from strong in phase with the climatological wave in moderate IPWP Niño case into rather weak in phase in strong IPWP Niño case and is mostly confined in upper stratosphere. This linear wave interference produces a significant vortex response in moderate IPWP Niño case but a very weak response in strong IPWP Niño case.</p>
