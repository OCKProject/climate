<p id="Par16" class="p">The combination of analyses using the historical relationship, reanalysis composites, and idealized experiments allows us to draw conclusion on the nonlinearity of IPWP Niño’s impacts on the NH stratospheric vortex. Anomalous warming SST associated with IPWP Niño launches precipitation over this area, which drives extratropical waves that further weaken the polar vortex. However, a nonlinear relationship between the amplitude of the IPWP Niño strength and the NH stratospheric vortex response is identified.</p>
