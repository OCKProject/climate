CESM-WACCM4 uses active ocean and sea ice components, and the model is forced using observed atmospheric composition changes from both natural (e.g., solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols) and anthropogenic (e.g., greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, and ozone) sources. The atmospheric component used was WACCM4. A representation of the QBO was achieved by relaxing the equatorial zonal wind between 86 and 4 hPa toward that observed

 </sup>. To avoid the possible entanglement of QBO signals in our composite results from the fully coupled model, we regressed out the zonal wind at 50 hPa.
