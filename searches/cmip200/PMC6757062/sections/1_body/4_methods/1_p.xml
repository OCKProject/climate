<p id="Par21" class="p">We calculated the monthly anomalies by subtracting the long-term mean of each calendar month from each individual month. The linear trends were removed before analysis from the temperature, zonal wind, and geopotential height data using linear regression analysis. The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) index used was the standardized anomaly of equatorial 50-hPa zonal winds and it was used to regress out the QBO signal. The Niño 3.4 index was defined as the area mean SST anomaly over the region 5°S–5°N, 150°W–90°W (
