<p id="Par24" class="p">The time-slice simulations were performed using CESM-WACCM4. The CESM-WACCM4, developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), has 66 vertical levels extending from the ground to 4.5 × 10

It is unable to internally simulate the QBO signals but is forced using a 28-month fixed cycle (nudged QBO). The time-slice simulations presented in this paper were performed at a resolution of 1.9° × 2.5°, with interactive chemistry.
