 </sup>, the performed experiments mimic a linear IPWP Niño forcing. Five 30-yr time-slice experiments are conducted, consisting of a climatological run (R1) and four experiments (R2–R5) with IPWP Niño SST forcing. The simulations use prescribed fixed SSTs following the 1958–2016 monthly SST climatology. The winter mean composite SST anomalous pattern for moderate IPWP Niño (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>) is multiplied by factors of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 to generate weak (R2), moderate (R3), strong (R4) and very strong (R5) IPWP Niño forcing, respectively. The anomalous SST pattern is imposed in the IPWP region (15°S–15°N, 90–160°E), and SST forcing is set to zero outside of the IPWP region. To prevent discontinuities in SST forcing on the IPWP boundary, SST anomalies on the boundary are added to the five model grids centered at the IPWP boundary, with respective weights of 1.0, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25, and 0.0 from the inside to the outside model grids of the IPWP boundary. The experiments are each run for 33 years, removing the first 3 years as spin-up. The key point is that these model integrations isolate possible nonlinearities arising solely through changes in IPWP Niño strength.
