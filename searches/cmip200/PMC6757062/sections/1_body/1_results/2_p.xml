<p id="Par9" class="p">Now we have seen the nonlinear stratospheric response in CESM-WACCM4 historical experiments. Note that this relationship is based on a single CMIP5 model (CESM-WACCM4), and can be different in other models, though not extended in this paper. However, two questions must be addressed here. Does the nonlinearity really exist? If so, does it come from IPWP Niño strength? Thus, we next investigate the change in stratospheric response with increasing IPWP Niño strength in the observations to validate the nonlinearity in the CMIP5 simulations, and then isolate the signal and tracing the nonlinearities from tropics to extratropical stratosphere based on idealized modeling results.</p>
