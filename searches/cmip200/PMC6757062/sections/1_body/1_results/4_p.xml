<p id="Par11" class="p">To overcome the limited availability of observations and isolate the impact of IPWP Niño, we performed five 30-year sensitivity runs (R1–R5; see Simulations) using CESM-WACCM4 to mimic the IPWP Niño SST forcing with linear increasing strength, ranking as weak, moderate, strong, and very strong PWP Niño forcing (Fig.

 </sup>, the nonlinearities arising solely through changes in IPWP Niño strength is isolated by forcing a linear change in the amplitude of the SSTs in the IPWP region and by forcing climatological SSTs elsewhere. It should be noted that the prescribed IPWP Niño SST forcing implicitly assumes that the SSTs in the IPWP region is applied entirely as a forcing, although it is likely that some fraction of the SST pattern is generated in response to atmospheric forcing, for example by a modulation of the Pacific Walker Circulation associated with ENSO

 </sup>. We first compare the tropical response to the four linear IPWP Niño forcings. Here the magnitude of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) response is used as a proxy for the intensity of tropical convection response. Low-level (850 hPa) convergence of zonal winds associated with Kelvin and Rossby waves towards the IPWP region coincides with upper level (250 hPa) divergence, leading to enhanced convection (negative OLR anomalies) over the IPWP region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e–h</xref>). This tropical circulation response is in agreement with previous findings from observations and ideal experiments with the linear baroclinic model

 </sup> using multiple configurations of atmospheric general circulation models also found an approximately proportional relationship between amplitude of zonally asymmetric components of tropical SST forcing and tropical precipitation response, accept in the Pacific cold tongue region due to thresholds for tropical convection. However, in cases of weak and moderate IPWP Niño precipitation anomalies centered over the equatorial from 150°E to 180°; in strong and very strong IPWP Niño cases, stronger ascent and larger precipitation penetrate deeper into the Maritime Continent.
