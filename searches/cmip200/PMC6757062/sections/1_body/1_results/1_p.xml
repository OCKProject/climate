<p id="Par8" class="p">To obtain a wide range of IPWP Niño events, we used CMIP5 outputs from a coupled climate system. Considering the good performance of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 4 (WACCM4) (see Simulations for more information) in representing stratospheric variability, we analyzed simulations using CESM-WACCM4 from historical experiments covering the period 1850–2005 (see the Methods for details). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows scatterplots of the standardized NDJF TI
 <sub class="sub">(IPWP)</sub>, which indicates the strength of the IPWP Niño, versus the December–January–February (DJF) polar cap temperature anomalies between 70°N and 90°N and from 100 to 50 hPa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), as well as the DJF zonal mean zonal wind anomalies averaged between 50°N and 70°N and 50 to 10 hPa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). A clear nonlinearity in the stratospheric response is shown. That is, a parabolic fit of the polar cap temperature anomaly, which can be approximately expressed as

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, better describes the relationship between IPWP Niño strength and the stratospheric response than does a linear fit. This is measured by the adjusted

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (See the Method section), which is larger in case of polynomial fit (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.01 for temperature; 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.02 for zonal wind). Importantly, an inflection point occurs near the 1σ threshold. When IPWP Niño strength is below the 1σ threshold, the intensity of the polar stratospheric temperature and zonal wind anomalies increases with IPWP Niño strength. The correlation coefficient between IPWP Niño strength and the DJF polar vortex temperatures is 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.57, which suggests that the stronger the IPWP Niño event, the warmer the stratospheric anomaly. Correspondingly, the correlation coefficient for the zonal wind anomalies is 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.59; i.e., the stronger the IPWP Niño event, the weaker the polar vortex. In addition, the linear fit crossed zero close to, but lower than, the 0.5-SD threshold, supporting the use of 0.5σ to define IPWP Niño winters. However, when IPWP Niño strength exceeds the 1σ threshold, the response reverses so that it weakens with increasing IPWP Niño strength. An inflection point occurs near the 1σ threshold for both stratospheric temperature and circulation response.
