 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> presents the simulated stratospheric temperature and circulation response to the four linear IPWP Niño forcings. Consistent with anomalous strengthened wave activities, the moderate IPWP Niño leads to a significant warmer stratosphere at mid-to-high latitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>). However, the warming is weaker and insignificant in strong and very IPWP Niño cases, comparing with that in moderate case (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c,d</xref>). Coherently, the zonal mean winds is markedly weakened during moderate IPWP Niño events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7f</xref>), whereas the decrease during strong and very IPWP Niño events is not statistically significant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7g,h</xref>). This characteristic of the stratospheric temperature and winds clearly validate the nonlinearity in the stratospheric response to IPWP Niño, which has been identified in CMIP5 simulations and observations above.
