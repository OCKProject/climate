 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). However, the strong and very strong IPWP Niño cases show a weaker negative anomaly in the Aleutian low region with a ~10° westward shift, comparing with weak and moderate cases. This is corresponding to westward extension of convection response in strong and very strong IPWP Niño cases. In addition, the weak amplitude of extratropical response suggests that contribution from the east part of IPWP Niño convection is largely cancelled out by contribution from the west part.
