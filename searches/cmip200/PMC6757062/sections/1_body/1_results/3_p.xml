<p id="Par10" class="p">As the 1σ threshold has been shown to be the turning point of the stratospheric response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), we used this value to separate all of the IPWP Niño events into two groups: moderate and strong. That is, we defined a strong IPWP Niño as occurring when the winter mean TI
 <sub class="sub">(IPWP)</sub> exceeds 1σ, with the moderate IPWP Niño group containing all of the remaining IPWP Niño events. The years included in each composite are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. The regional-mean composite SST anomaly during strong IPWP Niño events is obviously larger than that during moderate IPWP Niño events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>). We first present composite NH stratospheric temperature and circulation anomalies during moderate and strong IPWP Niño events, for the DJF average based on European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) reanalysis dataset (ERA-Interim) (see Data for more information) for the period 1979–2017 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c–f</xref>). The general structure in the high latitudes during moderate IPWP Niño events resembles those reported by Zhou

 </sup> (their Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) in terms of a significant stratospheric warming (peaking at about 1 K) together with a robust weakening of zonal mean zonal winds throughout the stratosphere. These significant stratospheric zonal mean temperature and wind anomalies indicate a weakening and warming stratospheric polar vortex. However, during strong IPWP Niño events the stratospheric temperature anomalies show a weak and insignificant cooling rather than a linearly stronger warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). Consistent with this, the polar stratospheric zonal winds are not weakened except in the vicinity of stratopause (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2f</xref>). Thus, observational evidence implies that a strong IPWP Niño has a weaker influence than its moderate counterpart.
