 </sup> applied a dynamical core of a climate model to run experiments with the heating field restricted to each of seven small domains located near or over the equator. They found that the heating anomalies over the equatorial Pacific from 150°E to 150°W force an anomalous low over the North Pacific and an anomalous high over the North America. However, heating anomalies over the Maritime Continent and Indian Ocean (50°E–150°E, 15°S–15°N) force opposite-signed extratropical response. Their findings suggest that the extratropical response in cases of strong and very strong IPWP Niño is very likely to have some cancellation between contribution from precipitation anomalies over the east part the IPWP region (150°E–180, 15°S–15°N; domain 1) and contribution from precipitation over the Maritime Continent (the west part of convection; 90°E–150°E, 0–15°N; domain 2). The essence of this argument involves the distinct extratropical response to convection over the two domains. In order to identify basic atmospheric processes associated with hearting in domain 1 and 2 separately, the linear baroclinic model (LBM) is used, with two heating fields restricted in domain 1 and 2 imposed separately in two runs (See Simulations for more information). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the imposed heating fields and corresponding 300-hPa geopotential height response. The response to heating fields in domain 1 and 2 shows opposite-signed anomalies over the mid-latitude North Pacific and North America regions. The modeled results are in good agreement with findings in Goss and Feldstein
