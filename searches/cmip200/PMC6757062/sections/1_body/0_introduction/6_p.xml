<p id="Par7" class="p">This study constitutes the first attempt to investigate the nonlinearities in the NH stratospheric polar vortex response to IPWP Ni単o in both observations and atmospheric model. We first show the relationship between the SST anomalies associated with IPWP Ni単o events and the polar stratospheric response in CMIP5 historical simulations, for identification of the nonlinearity and turning point of the stratospheric response. Using this turning point as a threshold, we confirm the nonlinearity by comparing the composite stratospheric circulation and temperature anomalies during strong and moderate IPWP Ni単o winters based on reanalysis datasets. Finally, we isolate the nonlinearities arising solely through changes in IPWP Ni単o strength by forcing a linear change in the amplitude of the SST forcing in time-slice model simulations.</p>
