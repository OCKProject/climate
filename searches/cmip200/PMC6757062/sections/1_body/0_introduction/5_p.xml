 </sup>. During boreal winter, anomalous SST warming associated with IPWP Niño can excite NH extratropical teleconnections that project onto the positive phase of the Pacific–North America (PNA) pattern in mid–high latitudes, intensifying the upward propagation of planetary waves into the stratosphere and, in turn, warming and weakening the NH stratospheric vortex

 </sup>. Note that the wave pattern excited by IPWP Niño is located further west than the PNA pattern, a fact that may be related to the different wave source locations from that of ENSO. Asymmetric response between the IPWP Niño and IPWP Niña–i.e. a same-signed response during opposite IPWP phase–has already been shown
