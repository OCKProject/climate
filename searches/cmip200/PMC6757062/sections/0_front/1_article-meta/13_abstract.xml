 <p id="Par1" class="p">Variations in tropical sea surface temperatures (SST) have pronounced impacts on the stratospheric polar vortex, with the role of El Niño being the focus of much research interest. However, the Indo–Pacific warm pool (IPWP), which is the warmest body of seawater in the world, has received less attention. The IPWP has been warming in recent years. This paper presents for the first time the remarkable nonlinearity in Northern Hemisphere (NH) stratospheric circulation and temperature response to IPWP warming (the so-called IPWP Niño) in boreal winter. The magnitude of NH stratospheric vortex weakening is strong and significant in case of moderate IPWP Niño, but is weak and insignificant in strong IPWP Niño case. This phenomenon is robust in both the historical simulations and observations. An idealized model experiments forced with linear varying SST forcing in the IPWP region isolate the nonlinearities arising from IPWP Niño strength. Westward extension of precipitation into the Maritime Continent drives attenuation and westward shift of extratropical waves during strong IPWP Niño events. Linear wave interference analysis reveals this leads to weak interference between the climatological and anomalous stationary waves and thereby a weak response of the stratospheric vortex. These findings imply a distinct stratospheric vortex response to the IPWP Niño, and provide extended implications for the surface climate in the NH.</p>
