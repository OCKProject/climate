 </sup>, QIC is the largest tropical ice cap. The average elevation of the ice margin is ~5300 m above sea level (m a.s.l.) and the approximate summit elevation is 5680 m a.s.l.; therefore, QIC is representative of many tropical glaciers in the Andes with a relatively low summit elevation

 </sup>. In comparison, the lowermost elevations reached by the largest glaciers in the tropical Andes is typically close to 4850–4900 m a.s.l., whereas their upper reaches are frequently above 6000 m a.s.l. (the highest elevation being reached at the peak of Mount Huascaran at 6768 m a.s.l. in the Peruvian Cordillera Blanca).
