<p id="Par8" class="p">Here we assess the rate of change of surface air temperature and FLH over QIC, using CMIP5 projections based on two different emission scenarios. In contrast to variables related to the hydrologic cycle (e.g., precipitation), free-air temperature is quite accurately simulated by GCM’s, and very well represented by reanalysis

 </sup>. Surface temperature is also well reproduced by most GCM’s, although there is a substantial warm bias over the Andes due to the low topography in the models. Here we rely on

 </sup> to remove the temperature bias from both reanalysis and GCM output, allowing for an accurate future projection of changes in FLH. We further take advantage of the documented close empirical relationship between FLH and the glacier equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) on tropical Andean glaciers

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup> to project the future rise of the ELA on QIC under various emission scenarios. Although no spatially-comprehensive ELA measurements exist on QIC, the ELA can be constrained by determining the snowline during the dry season using satellite data

 </sup>. Hence the aim of this study is to determine how imminent a future disappearance of the QIC really is, and to what extent the timing depends on the emission scenario. We also consider the influence of EDW on the rate of the ELA rise, by comparing CMIP5 simulations with an empirical model that relates tropical SST to FLH assuming a constant lapse rate
