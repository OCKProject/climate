<p id="Par22" class="p">For the RCP8.5 scenario the changes at QIC are going to be more profound and occur much earlier than in the case of the RCP4.5 scenario. By the middle of the century the ensemble mean ELA is projected to reach the QIC summit, turning all of QIC into an ablation zone. A very important point is that the QIC summit at 5680 m a.s.l. will of course be continuously lowered, once the ice cap increasingly thins from its current thickness of approximately 170 m

 </sup>. Hence it will be exposed to higher temperatures at lower elevation (elevation feedback), as well as increasingly to edge effects and warm air advection from surrounding exposed bare rock areas as the ice cap shrinks in size (edge effects feedback). These feedbacks are not accounted for in our analysis, suggesting that our results likely err on the conservative side and that the ELA may in fact reach the QIC summit earlier than projected in our analysis. Finally, the RCP8.5 Ta projections at QIC suggest that at the end of the 21
