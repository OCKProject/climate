 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> presents observational, historical and future annual ELA projections for QIC. The mean ELA from observations was 5436 m a.s.l. over the 1992–2017 period, and the mean ELA value from ERA-interim over the baseline 1979–2005 was 5416 m a.s.l. (data not shown). The increase in the ELA is +16.3 m, +13.6 m, +24.5 m and +58.4 m/decade, for reanalysis (1980–2017), historical (1950–2005), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (2006–2100), respectively. Based on the multi-model mean estimate, the ELA will remain below the QIC summit until the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century in the RCP4.5 scenario, although some CMIP5 models are projecting a future ELA that is higher than the QIC summit.
