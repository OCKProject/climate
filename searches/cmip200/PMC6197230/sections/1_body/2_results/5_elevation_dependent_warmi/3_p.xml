<p id="Par28" class="p">The difference between the ensemble mean ELA
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub> and ELA
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> of about 5.5 m/decade for the RCP8.5 scenario implies that by 2055, the ensemble ELA
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub> will reach the QIC summit level, while the ELA
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> ensemble will still be ~30 m below the QIC summit. In other words, the ELA
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub> will reach the QIC summit about 12 years earlier than the ELA
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub>. Note that these calculations were done for the ensemble of 16 CMIP models, and that results for individual CMIP5 models vary considerably.
