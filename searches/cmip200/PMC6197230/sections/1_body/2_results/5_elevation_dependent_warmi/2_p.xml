<p id="Par27" class="p">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, the control case results (black dots) are consistent with the historical comparison between the ELA
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> and ELA
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub> ensembles from 16 CMIP5 historical simulations (gray dots). Future projections of ELA
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub> ensembles, based on 16 CMIP5 RCP4.5 (blue dots) and RCP8.5 (red dots) simulations, however, are not following the expected ELA increase inferred from the ELA
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> model. For instance, in the RCP4.5 scenario, the increase in the ELA
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> ensemble is about 22.8 ± 0.74 m/decade; less (albeit not significantly) than the ensemble ELA
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub> increase of 24.5 ± 0.94 m/decade. In the case of the scenario RCP8.5, this difference in ELA trends is significant (p &lt; 0.05), with 52.9 ± 1.04 m/decade and 58.4 ± 1.45 m/decade for ELA
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> and ELA
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub>, respectively. This implies that CMIP5 simulations with RCP4.5 radiative forcing at the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century generate an insignificant additional rise of the ensemble mean ELA at QIC of about 1.72 m/decade when compared to the tropical SST forcing, while the RCP8.5 radiative forcing generates an additional, statistically significant ELA rise of about 5.5 m/decade. This additional ELA rise can be understood as an EDW response, resulting from feedbacks that effectively lead to a flattening of the tropical lapse rate. Thus, for a more intense anthropogenic radiative forcing scenario, the EDW effect will increase. This analysis verifies and quantifies the projected EDW effect over the QIC environment in response to future changes in radiative forcing.
