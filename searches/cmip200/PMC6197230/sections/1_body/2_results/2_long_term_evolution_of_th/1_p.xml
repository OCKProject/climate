<p id="Par19" class="p">Since the date of the satellite images used to calculate the SLA (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) typically falls toward the end of the hydrological dry season on QIC, the derived ELA is defined as representing the previous hydrologic year starting in September of the previous year and ending in the current August. Thus, the year label indicated in the x-axis in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref> corresponds to the August’s years.
