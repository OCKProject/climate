  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>
 </sup>. This relationship can be exploited to calculate how the FLH over QIC will change in the future, using future projections of tropical SST, and assuming that the FLH-SST relationship remains stable over time (i.e. no change in lapse rate). Here we calculate the FLH at QIC using reanalysis products, and linearly relate it with tropical SST
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup>, to assess future FLH changes under such a fixed lapse-rate scenario. These FLH estimates, henceforth referred to as FLH
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> can then be compared with future FLH changes simulated by coupled ocean-atmosphere CMIP5 models (FLH
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub>), with the difference being a measure of future adjustment in the lapse rate and thus of EDW. Paleoclimate studies have documented how this tropical lapse rate, linking SST with the snowline in tropical mountain regions, has changed in the past

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup> and they have been used to constrain future amplified high-elevation-warming in tropical mountain regions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>. Here we apply the same methodology to the QIC.
