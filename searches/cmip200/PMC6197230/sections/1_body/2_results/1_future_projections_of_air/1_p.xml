The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the annual mean Ta from ERA-interim and the AWS time series over the 2005–2016 period was 0.78, indicating that the reanalysis has a high skill in reproducing the annual Ta variability at QIC. As a reference, the mean annual ERA-interim bias corrected Ta at QIC is about −4.4 °C over the 1979–2005 period. The ensemble of 16 CMIP5 historical simulations and the reanalysis data are characterized by a common Ta warming rate of 0.14 °C/decade over the periods 1950–2005 and 1979–2016, respectively. It is worth noting that the CMIP5 interannual variability is substantially muted due to the cancellation of internal variability once multiple models are averaged to obtain the mean (hereafter labeled as ensemble). Future ensemble projections of Ta using RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios indicate substantial warming over the 2006–2100 period of about 0.25 °C/decade and 0.57 °C/decade, respectively. Those future scenarios suggest that the mean Ta at QIC summit will increase by approximately 2.4 °C and 5.4 °C, respectively, by the end of the 21

 </sup> using the older SRES scenario A2. Maybe more relevant in this context is the fact that under the RCP8.5 scenario Ta at QIC summit will surpass 0 °C by ~2060, while under the RCP4.5 scenario Ta will start to stabilize around −2 °C by ~2070.
