<p id="Par29" class="p">CMIP5 model simulations of future temperature changes were applied to study the impacts of climate change over the Quelccaya Ice Cap region, assessing the relationship between ELA and FLH and how these variables relate to tropical SST forcing in the past and the future. We did not consider the influence of potential future changes in ENSO behavior on QIC climate, which would be relevant for understanding future changes in interannual variability and will be included in future work, but present-day ENSO variability over the period for which the model was built is implicitly included.</p>
