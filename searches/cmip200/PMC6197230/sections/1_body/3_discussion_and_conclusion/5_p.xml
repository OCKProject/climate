 </sup>, this prediction of the ELA could potentially be further improved by applying a multivariate model including other atmospheric variables, such as precipitation and wind field. We have, however, opted not to consider such variables, given the large uncertainties in future projections of precipitation over the Andes. In our view the added values from inclusion of these variables is offset by much larger uncertainties in the future projections. That said, the presented uncertainty ranges in the timing of ELA reaching the summit should themselves be considered conservative estimates.
