<p id="Par34" class="p">More research is needed to further clarify the nature of the feedbacks that lead to the anticipated elevation-dependent warming on QIC. In addition, it is critical to better quantify elevation feedbacks, edge effects, and the impacts of changing precipitation phase with higher FLH on QICâ€™s surface mass balance. As these aspects will promote an even faster demise of the ice cap, our projections are likely conservative estimates.</p>
