<p id="Par32" class="p">Here we have focused on the influence of tropical SST on FLH over QIC, since tropical SST provide the dominant first-order control on FLH and snowline altitude throughout tropical mountain regions

 </sup>. Indeed tropical SSTA explain more than 70% of the total variance in the FLH over QIC on interannual timescales. While other factors such as land surface feedbacks, tropical convection over the Amazon basin and interactions with extratropical air masses can also influence the FLH over Quelccaya on interannual timescales
