<p id="Par30" class="p">Here we relied on air temperature (and FLH) from global products (reanalysis and CMIP5) since a comparison with 
 <italic class="italic">in-situ</italic> data from our AWS showed that these products very faithfully reproduce temperature conditions on QIC once a biasâ€“correction is applied, consistent with earlier studies
