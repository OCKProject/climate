<p id="Par31" class="p">One important outcome of this study is that the ELA will strongly be affected by feedback mechanisms that accelerate the warming at high elevations, most noticeable in the RCP8.5 scenario. QIC is likely to completely loose its accumulation zone before the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. The critical time when the ensemble RCP8.5 simulated ELA will reach the QIC summit is around 2055, concomitant with RCP8.5 annual average Ta at QIC summit rising to approximately −1.8 °C. From that point forward, the ELA will remain above the ice cap’s highest elevation, leaving the entire ice cap exposed to a continuously negative surface mass balance. However, other factors, not considered here, can change this timing, such as changes in the amount or seasonality of precipitation. Since changes in precipitation are a more complex issue to assess, it will be dealt with in a separate analysis. As far as precipitation phase is concerned, Ta = −1 °C is the critical threshold where precipitation starts to change phase in the tropical Andes

 </sup>, leading to a decrease in snowfall and increase in mixed precipitation. Based on our results, this threshold will be reached around 2070 for a few models in the RCP4.5 scenario and the ensemble mean Ta for the RCP8.5 scenario.
