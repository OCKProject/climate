 </sup>. Monthly Ta at the elevation of QIC summit was calculated by interpolating Ta and geopotential height (Zg) between 400 and 500 hPa pressure levels, which are the nearest standard pressure levels above QIC summit. The ERA-interim products were resampled to a 2.5° grid resolution, mimicking the spatial scale of the majority of CMIP5 models. A bias correction was applied to the reanalysis Ta using as reference the observed data from the AWS at QIC summit. Similarly, the FLH at QIC was calculated as the elevation of the 0 °C isotherm using a linear interpolation of ERA-interim Zg and (bias-corrected) Ta between 500 and 600 hPa. The same approach was applied to Ta and FLH from CMIP5 simulations to remove temperature biases from the simulations and to calculate historical and future FLH as simulated by the models.
