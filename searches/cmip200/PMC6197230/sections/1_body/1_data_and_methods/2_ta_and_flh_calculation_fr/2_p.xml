 </sup>. Here, we followed this approach by comparing the QIC FLH derived from ERA-interim with ERSST data over the tropics for the period 1979–2017. This linear SST-FLH relationship was then applied to tropical SST simulated with CMIP5 models from both historic runs and future projections. Comparing the FLH at the elevation of QIC as simulated by the CMIP5 models (henceforth labeled FLH
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub>) with the FLH estimated from a linear empirical dependency with SST (henceforth labeled FLH
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub>) yields an estimate of future EDW, since the lapse rate is allowed to adjust to EDW feedbacks in the coupled CMIP5 simulations used to determine FLH
