<p id="Par9" class="p">Daily mean non-aspirated temperature and snow height data between 21-07-2004 and 22-07-2017 from an AWS installed at QIC summit (5680 m a.s.l., 13.93°S, 70.82 W) were used to bias-correct air temperature from reanalysis and CMIP5 models, and to inform LANDSAT image selection (see below). As reference, the mean annual air temperature (Ta) at QIC from this dataset is −3.99 °C over the 2005–2016 period. Additionally, daily rainfall data, available over the period 1979–2016 from Ccatcca station (3693 m a.s.l., 13.61°S, 71.5603°W, closest station to QIC, Fig.

 </sup> were extracted over the tropical belt (28.5°S–28.5°N) from 1950 to 2017. Anomalies were calculated using 1979–2005 as the reference period, and then spatially averaged to obtain a tropical SST anomaly (SSTA) time series.
