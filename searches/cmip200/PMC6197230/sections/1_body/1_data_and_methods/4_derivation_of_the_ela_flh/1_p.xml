 </sup>. We first calculated FLH over QIC using bias-corrected reanalysis data over the period of overlap with satellite data. The FLH is calculated as the average of the hydrologic year, which runs from Sep. to Aug. Finally, projected future changes in the ELA were calculated by applying the present day FLH-ELA relationship to future FLH simulated by bias-corrected CMIP5 models, as outlined in the Data and Methods section.
