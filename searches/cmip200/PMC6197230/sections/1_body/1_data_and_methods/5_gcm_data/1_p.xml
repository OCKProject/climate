 </sup> (CMCC-CMS, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-CC, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MRI-CGCM3, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MIROC-ESM, MIROC5, NorESM1-M, NorESM1-ME) for historical (1950–2005), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (2006–2100) were selected for our analysis. The three variables of interest include Ta, Zg, and SST. From those variables we calculated the FLH
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub> and FLH
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> and their corresponding ELA
 <sub class="sub">atm</sub> and ELA
 <sub class="sub">SST</sub> projections in the same way as previously described for the reanalysis products, using the model or reanalysis grid cell encompassing QIC.
