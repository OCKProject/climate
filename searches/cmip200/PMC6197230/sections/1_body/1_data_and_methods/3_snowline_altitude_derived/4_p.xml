<p id="Par15" class="p">An error source which is more difficult to account for is the combined effect of an intermittent image acquisition schedule and scene obscuration by clouds. For example, LANDSAT 7 provides an image every 16 days. When LANDSAT 8 went into service with an offset orbit, 8-day repeat coverage became available. However, sometimes cloud cover obscures the glacier and hence the SLA cannot be mapped from every available image. The combined effect of these two issues is that our remotely-sensed, highest-annual SLA determination will always be lower than or equal to the actual annual SLA. Our observations in recent years, when AWS measurements and additional imagery are also available (e.g., ESAâ€™s Sentinel-2) provide some assurance that this error is not large, as the SLA reflects seasonal snowfall as well as dry-season weather.</p>
