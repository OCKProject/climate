  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>. This method is based on the fact that on glaciers in the outer tropics the highest snowline altitude (SLA) reached during the dry season is representative of the annual ELA of the same hydrological year. Here, the annual SLA was determined using data from LANDSAT-5, -7 and/or -8 with 30 m spatial resolution between 1992 and 2017, selecting one image (or date) per year (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The selection criteria for the LANDSAT data consist of choosing the date with the highest SLA, avoiding dates with recent snowfall and rainfall events. As indicated in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> the chosen LANDSAT images date to the dry season and early transition season, i.e. from June to October. Images that postdate recent snowfall on QIC were flagged based on the daily snow height time series from the AWS at QIC, and daily rainfall data from Ccatcca station. Additionally, the ALOS PALSAR

The spatial resolution of PALSAR is superior to conventional products, and it includes terrain, radiometric and orthorectification corrections.
