<p id="Par14" class="p">Although the SLA delineation is often unambiguous, it is worth noting that the determination is threshold-selection sensitive. Measurement errors can also be produced by debris located on the lower slopes of the ice cap. Moreover, the western side of the QIC has a higher sensitivity (and hence a lower uncertainty) in SLA detection than the eastern side, since the western slope extends over flatter terrain covering a larger surface area per unit elevation change. In general, however, these errors introduced by complex topography, insolation or debris-covered ice are reduced when the SLA is measured at the end of the dry season, as the SLA reaches its highest position. At that time of year the terrain is more symmetric and uniformly sloped on western and eastern QIC sides, as observed from vertical profiles

 </sup> resulted in an estimated uncertainty in their areal measurements of 5%. For the current study, the mean SLA is obtained as the mean elevation of all cells corresponding to SLA pixels, along the entire ice cap perimeter (yellow perimeter in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>), which corresponds to approximately 800 to 1200 cells, depending on the year. The resulting mean SLA per year (or date selected) is plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>. The SLA error is associated with a) the standard deviation of the estimated mean SLA per year. It ranges between 64.2 m and 102.6 m. This standard deviation value is higher than the values mentioned in other similar studies; this is most likely due to exposure effects around the ice cap, b) their corresponding slopes [range between 15.3° and 27.1°], c) the 30 m LANDSAT spatial resolution (considering a ± 1 pixel deviation range, the final dispersion value was taken as 90 m), and, d) the vertical accuracy of the DEM calculated as the mean of the differences between the ‘true’ elevation measured at 53 locations distributed along a transect from bedrock below the ice cap up to the summit of QIC in 2013, and their corresponding DEM values (2007). The error propagation method was used for the calculation of the SLA error

It is worth noting that the SLA distribution per date selected has an approximately Gaussian distribution, and the 95% confidence intervals calculated with t-distribution presented values similar to the ones calculated using bootstrap analysis. The non-zero trend presented in Fig.
