 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup> since lighting conditions vary through dates (e.g., Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>). For the images listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, thresholds between 80 and 180 were used in the histogram from NIR and Green bands. Finally, the perimeter of the snow-covered area above the SLA was hand-digitized and projected on the DEM to extract the corresponding elevation values of the SLA. A mean SLA was calculated for each date by averaging the elevation corresponding to all SLA pixels.
