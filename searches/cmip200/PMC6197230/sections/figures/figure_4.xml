  <p class="p">Scatter plot between annual FLH and annual ELA at QIC. FLH is calculated by interpolating bias-corrected air temperature (Ta) and geopotential height between 500 and 600 hPa from ERA-interim. The bias-corrected Ta was obtained by fitting reanalysis air temperature with observed Ta from an AWS at QIC summit. ELA data were obtained from LANDSAT images at the end of the dry season (see Table 
   <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>; median date 4 September). ELA and FLH were calculated for hydrologic years (September of previous calendar year to August). Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and p-value are indicated in the Figure.
