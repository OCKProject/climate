  <p class="p">ELA
   <sub class="sub">atm</sub> vs ELA
   <sub class="sub">SST</sub> comparison. Annual mean ELA derived from FLH at QIC calculated by linear regression (equation 
   <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1</xref>) with annual mean tropical SST from ERSST dataset as predictor (FLH
   <sub class="sub">SST</sub> using equation 
   <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="" class="xref">2</xref>), compared with ELA derived by interpolating air temperature (Ta) and geopotential height (Zg) from ERA-interim reanalysis between 500 and 600 hPa levels (FLH
   <sub class="sub">atm</sub>) (black dots). The same approach is applied to the ensemble mean of annual FLH
   <sub class="sub">SST</sub> and FLH
   <sub class="sub">atm</sub> obtained from 16 CMIP5 models for Historical (gray dots), RCP4.5 (blue dots) and RCP8.5 (red dots) scenarios. Historical and future simulations were analyzed over the periods 1951–2005 and 2006–2100, respectively. Dashed line represents the 1:1 line. A bias-correction was applied to Ta and ELA, using data from the AWS at QIC summit elevation (5680 m a.s.l.) and estimated highest annual snowline altitude from Landsat images, respectively.
