<p id="p0060" class="p">The point count method was used to survey birds. All birds seen or heard were recorded by the observers at 250 m intervals along transects/recces. The observers waited a couple of minutes for birds to adjust to their presence and then made five minute point counts. Birds were identified visually or by their calls at every point visited and a GPS reading was taken. Two observers would stand at every point and record all the birds in the following distance classes: 0–10 m, 10–20 m, 20–50 m, 50–100 m, 100–200 m, 200–500 m for five minutes.</p>
