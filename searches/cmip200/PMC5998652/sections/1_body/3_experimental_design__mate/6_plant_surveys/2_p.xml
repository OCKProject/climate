<p id="p0075" class="p">Standard nested circular plots located at 250 m intervals along transects were used in the survey of plants. The circular plots consist of a 20 m radius plot (trees greater than 10 cm DBH (Diameter at breast height) are identified and counted), 10 m radius plot (lianas, shrubs and trees less than 10 cm DBH but greater than 2.5 cm DBH are identified and counted) and a 2 m radius plot (all grasses and herbs are identified). Sample specimens were collected, dried and pressed on site for all uncertain species, to enable confirmation of identification at a Herbarium.</p>
