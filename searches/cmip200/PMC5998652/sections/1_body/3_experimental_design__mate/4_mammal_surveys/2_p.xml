The number of animals seen along transects/recce walks and indirect signs of speciesâ€™ presence were recorded. In some protected areas camera traps were installed to observe cryptic or elusive animals. Capture methods were used to survey small mammals (bats, rodents and shrews). Mist netting was used to survey bats at various sites. Sherman traps were set along line transects and baited with peanut butter, maize flour, ghee or fish.
