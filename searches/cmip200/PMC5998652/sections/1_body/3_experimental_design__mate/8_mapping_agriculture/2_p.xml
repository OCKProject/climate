<p id="p0085" class="p">To remove suitable habitat lost to agriculture from each species range the GlobCover 2009 land cover map was re-classified into three land cover classes; water, other, and natural vegetation 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[8]</xref>. The “other” class was characterized by agriculture areas, plantation forestry and human settlements. When exploring the GlobCover 2009 land cover map in ArcGis 9.3 we found that there were vegetation misclassifications in our study area. For example some of the high tropical forest reserves had been classified as mosaic vegetation/cropland. We edited the GlobCover 2009 landcover map by locking in areas we knew to be natural vegetation and using other landcover maps for the region to produce a final layer used for removing modified habitat from the species range maps. This map was then used to clip the current threshold maps to estimate the percentage of suitable habitat lost to agriculture for a species.
