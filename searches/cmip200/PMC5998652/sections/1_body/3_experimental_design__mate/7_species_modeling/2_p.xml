 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>. We selected 17 Worldclim variables relating to climate that are likely to influence the distribution of the birds, mammals, plants, reptiles and amphibians in the Albertine Rift. All the predictor variables were clipped to the area of interest and a pairwise Pearson correlation between predictor variables were obtained using ENMTOOLs 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[6]</xref>. To minimize the effect of multi-collinearity and overfitting, only seven variables with less than (Â± 0.75) correlation were retained (
