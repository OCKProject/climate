Additional data for western Tanzanian large mammals was obtained from the Tanzanian mammal atlas (courtesy of Charles Foley), Global Biodiversity Information Facility 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[4]</xref>, records of amphibian collections made by Mathias Behangana (Makerere University), Michele Menegon (Trento Science Museum) and Eli Greenbaum (University of Texas at el Paso), and small mammal collections by Julian Kerbis Peterhans (Chicago Field Museum). Areas of each speciesâ€™ range lost to agriculture were estimated by clipping predicted suitable habitat from the current Maxent threshold raster by an agriculture layer for the region that mapped presence/absence of agriculture (see below). Area lost to climate change was estimated for each species by measuring the areas of the threshold suitability maps for the current maps and the maps from 2070. These results are given for each species in 
 <xref rid="s0065" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Table S1</xref> together with areas of overlap between current and future ranges of each species.
