 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup> reported an effective ensemble size much smaller than the actual number of CMIP3 models. SI violations are very large in CMIP5 than CMIP3 models due to multiple reasons, especially similarities in numerical schemes, physical parameterizations, etc. (Pincus

 </sup>). For example, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, and IPSL-CM5B-LR were developed by slight modification in resolution and the atmospheric component. Similar is the case with GISS-E2H and GISS-E2R. GFDL-ESM2M and GFDL-ESM2G primarily differ only in their ocean components. MIROC-ESM and MIROC-ESM-CHEM differ in ocean biogeochemistry and atmospheric chemistry. MPI-ESM-LR and MPI-ESM-P were developed from their predecessor by changing resolution and neglecting the feedback between dynamic vegetation and land use.
