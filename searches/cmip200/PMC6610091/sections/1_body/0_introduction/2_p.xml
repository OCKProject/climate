<p id="Par3" class="p">Although sharing of components between various model versions from the same center may sound obvious, even different modeling centers share large fraction of the model code. For example, CNRM and EC-EARTH use similar atmospheric components (AEPEGE/IFS/ECMWF); ACCESS uses the HadGEM2 atmospheric component; FGOALS uses several physical parameterizations from CCSM; NorESM uses some key components of CESM1. All such similarities in codes, schemes and concepts among the various CMIP5 models have been found to be a reason for common biases in the simulated fields

 </sup>. Past studies on model similarity and genealogy have reported the use of similar ocean component to be less relevant than the use of similar atmospheric component in producing large model similarity in surface climatology

 </sup>. In simpler words, it means that the surface climatology from two models with similar atmospheric components but different ocean components would have greater commonality than that of two models with similar ocean components but different atmospheric components.
