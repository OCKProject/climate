<p id="Par5" class="p">There have been studies on model genealogy as discussed above, using total precipitation as the variable of interest, but common biases across models in the individual precipitation components (convective and large-scale) have never been analyzed. Evaluating model similarity in biases in precipitation components is critically important because most of the model development efforts have focused on reducing the common biases in total precipitation, leading to an invisible bias in the individual components (e.g., He
