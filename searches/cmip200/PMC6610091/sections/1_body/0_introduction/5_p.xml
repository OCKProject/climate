<p id="Par6" class="p">In this paper we investigate common biases in CMIP5 models by using total precipitation as well as its convective and large-scale components, and for each of the three variables we divide the models into broad groups based on the patterns of their biases on a global scale. Subsequently, the ability of models belonging to a particular group in simulating the south Asian summer monsoon and tropical waves is evaluated. In addition, AMIP5 model results have also been used to explore if the reported biases in the corresponding models from CMIP5 behave any different with prescribed sea surface temperatures.</p>
