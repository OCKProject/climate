<p id="Par17" class="p">By grouping the CMIP5 models based on their convective precipitation biases we find that the similarity in convective precipitation biases in a given group primarily comes from similarity in closure assumptions and trigger mechanisms, and to a lesser extent on the details of the cloud models used in the deep convection parameterization schemes of the models. By grouping the CMIP5 models based on their large-scale precipitation biases we find that the degree of similarity in large-scale precipitation biases among model groups was much higher than that seen in the corresponding convective precipitation biases (based on convective precipitation grouping). Over the south Asian domain, we find many biases that are common across the groups. In general, each of the convective groups show largely positive biases, whereas, each of the large-scale groups show largely negative biases over the south Asian region, with spatially varying magnitudes. We find that the spatial pattern of biases in the convective precipitation in various model groups have prominent signatures in the 850 hPa wind circulation biases as well.</p>
