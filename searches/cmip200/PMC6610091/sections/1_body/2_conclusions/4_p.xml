<p id="Par19" class="p">As a first step towards eliminating a given bias in a model it is important to know how the bias structure in the model compares to other models in the same group and models in different groups. Thus, a more informed and efficient model development approach may be designed for achieving improved simulations of global and regional climate. Not to mention, the spatial resolution used in CMIP5 models is too coarse to resolve weather features such as fronts, atmospheric rivers, cyclone properties, and thus, weather resolving climate models would be required for improving the accuracy of simulations even further
