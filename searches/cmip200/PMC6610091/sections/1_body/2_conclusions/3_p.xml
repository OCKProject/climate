 </sup>, we find that if 2 models have the same atmospheric component the degree of similarity in their global precipitation bias patterns is quite high, as compared to that if some other component(s) are similar but the atmospheric components (especially the convection scheme) are quite different. This finding highlights the primary role played by the atmospheric component of the model in governing precipitation biases. To investigate this further, we compare the corresponding model biases from CMIP5 and AMIP5 simulations, and conclude that, in general, the precipitation biases primarily depend on the atmospheric component of the models, and to a lesser extent on biases in SSTs or atmosphere-ocean feedbacks, at least on timescales of the current analysis. Notably, we find that there is only one model group wherein the ocean component is primarily responsible for the simulated convective precipitation biases (found over the maritime continent region).
