<p id="Par16" class="p">We have carried out a systematic analysis of the structure of precipitation biases in 33 CMIP5 and AMIP5 models, and have grouped them based on the correlation of their biases in total, convective and large-scale precipitation on global scale. We found that the grouping of models is somewhat sensitive to the variable used, i.e., a given pair of models that fall in the same total precipitation bias group may not necessarily fall in the same convective or large-scale precipitation bias group.</p>
