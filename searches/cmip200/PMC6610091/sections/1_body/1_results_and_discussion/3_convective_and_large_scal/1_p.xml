<p id="Par9" class="p">Convective parameterization schemes are generally based on one of the following cloud model types: (i) Spectral cloud ensemble, similar to Arakawa and Schubert

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>; for more details see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). For example, GFDL and MIROC models are based on approach (i), GISS-E2R/H and GISS-E2R-CC, HaDGEM2-ES/CC and HadCM3, ACCESS, MPI-ESM-LR/P, CNRM-CM5/5-2, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, and EC-EARTH models are based on approach (ii), and CCSM4, CESM-CAM5, FGOALS, and NorESM models are based on approach (iii). In addition to cloud model type, the closure and triggering mechanism of convective parameterization (for more details see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) also controls the total precipitation and its partitioning. In CMIP5, most of the models use convective available potential energy (CAPE) or dilute CAPE (DCAPE) based closure and trigger function (as can be seen from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), whereas, few models use moisture convergence-based closure and moisture convergence or relative humidity-based triggers. In CMIP5, most of the models use prognostic cloud condensate-based approach in their large-scale precipitation parameterization (for more details see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), and hence exhibit large similarity in the simulated large-scale precipitation (discussed later).
