Also shown are the corresponding biases for each of the groups. ERA-I shows a well-established cross-equatorial flow and well-established Somali current over northern AS, southern peninsular India and over the northern BoB (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>) as reported in the literature

 </sup>. The cross-equatorial current and Somali current are also found in all convective groups, however with varying magnitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b–e</xref>). From the mean wind biases: (a) in GC1 we find a very large cyclonic anomaly over the central equatorial Indian Ocean consistent with the overestimation in precipitation over eastern AS and BoB, easterly wind anomaly over western coast of AS, and consistent with the underestimation in precipitation over northern Indian region

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6f</xref>), (b) in GC2 we find easterly wind anomaly to be low over peninsular India, high over AS and small over SCS, which is thus consistent with the underestimation in precipitation over northern Indian region, and overestimation over SCS. Weak cyclonic anomaly over central equatorial Indian Ocean (IO) is consistent with small overestimation in precipitation over equatorial IO, BoB, and eastern AS (Fig.

 </sup>, (c) in GC3 we find the easterly wind anomaly over the western AS, northern BoB and westerly wind anomaly over peninsular India consistent with the large underestimation in convective precipitation over Indian region and small overestimation over rest of the domain, in line with previous studies

 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6h</xref>), and (d) in GC4 we find the large easterly equatorial wind anomaly and westerly wind anomaly over central BoB causing more overestimation in precipitation over equatorial region, BoB and SCS, in line with previous studies
