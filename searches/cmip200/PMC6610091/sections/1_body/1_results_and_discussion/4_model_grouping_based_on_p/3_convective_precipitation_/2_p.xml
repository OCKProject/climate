 </sup> have also shown this using numerical experiments that cool AS SST can delay south Asian summer monsoon and subsequently reduce monsoon precipitation. Next, we investigate how important are SST biases and atmosphere-ocean feedbacks in the convective precipitation biases discussed above, by analyzing the differences in biases in CMIP5 models with their corresponding AMIP5 counterparts. Hatching (in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) indicates that the biases are primarily due to the atmospheric component, whereas, stippling indicates that the errors in SSTs and the atmosphere-ocean feedbacks are also important. Over a given grid point if the root mean square error (RMSE) in a given model group from AMIP5 simulations is greater than or equal to 80% of RMSE in the same model group from CMIP5 simulations the grid point is hatched, whereas, if the RMSE in the AMIP5 simulations is smaller than 20% of the RMSE in the corresponding CMIP5 simulations the grid point is stippled. In addition, we also impose a second condition of two-tailed student-t test for significant bias at 99% on hatching and stippling along with the first condition mentioned above. If a grid point is neither hatched nor stippled it means that the bias is either not significant or is due to both atmospheric and oceanic components. Thus, in all the convective groups, overestimation in convective precipitation over majority of the South Asian region seems primarily to be coming from the atmospheric component. Notably, the significant biases in GC1 models over the maritime continent seem to be coming from the SST biases (since the CMIP5 biases are found to be much higher than the AMIP5 biases). In order to further confirm that the model groups are distinctively different from each other, we analysed the inter-group differences (shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>), and find that there are indeed significant differences between the groups, thus also confirming the robustness of the method used for clustering.
