 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows spatial variation of mean seasonal convective precipitation and convective precipitation biases from observation in various convective groups. Observed convective precipitation is found to be highest over Indo-Burmese Mountain, Western Ghats (WG), moderate over central India and eastern equatorial Indian Ocean, and lowest over northwest India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). In GC1, the convective precipitation is found to be highest over Indo-Burmese mountain, eastern Bay of Bengal (BoB), south Arabian Sea (AS) adjoining to WG, and south China Sea (SCS) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>), in GC2, the convective precipitation is found to be high only over northeast India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>), in GC3, convective precipitation is found to be high only over the Indo-Burmese mountain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d</xref>), and in GC4, convective precipitation is found to be high over eastern BoB, WG, and central SCS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4e</xref>). Thus, in GC1, we find large significant overestimation over northern AS, Indo-Burmese mountain, and SCS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4f</xref>), in GC2, we find large significant overestimation over northeast India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4g</xref>), in GC3, we find small overestimation over entire south Asian region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4h</xref>), and in GC4, we find the large significant overestimation over SCS, Indo-Burmese Mountain and eastern BoB (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4i</xref>). Small underestimation in convective precipitation is found over the Indo-Gangetic region in all convective groups except in GC4, with increase in spatial extent of the negative bias from GC1 to GC3. We also notice that model grouping and spatial pattern of convective precipitation biases do not change much irrespective of the changes in observational dataset type (for example, when we change PERSIANN-CDR data with GPCP data, convective model grouping and spatial pattern biases do not change much; figure not shown).
