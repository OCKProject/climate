 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref> shows spatial variations of mean seasonal large-scale precipitation and large-scale precipitation biases from observations in various large-scale groups. It can be seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref> that observed large-scale precipitation is high over Indo-Burmese mountain, WG, and northeast India. In GL1, highest values are found over Himalayan foothills (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>); in GL2, highest values are found over Himalayan foothills, WG and eastern Arabian Sea (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref>); in GL3, highest values are found over Himalayan foothills and over northeast India (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d</xref>). From the bias patterns, GL1 shows large underestimation over Indo-Burmese mountain, eastern BoB, and WG (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7e</xref>), GL2 shows large underestimation over Indo-Burmese mountain and eastern BoB (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7f</xref>), and GL3 shows negative biases in line with GL1 and GL2 but with lower magnitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7g</xref>). All large-scale precipitation groups also show the underestimation over central India and eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. In all the large-scale groups, underestimation in large-scale precipitation over majority of the south Asian region seems primarily to be coming from the atmospheric component (see hatching in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). The underestimation in large-scale precipitation over WG in all large-scale groups seems to be due to both atmospheric and oceanic components. Similar to the convective precipitation grouping and spatial bias pattern, the large-scale model grouping and spatial bias pattern is also found to be minimally affected by the use of two different observational datasets (PERSIANN-CDR and GPCP; figure not shown). Similar to the analysis carried out to test the distinctiveness of the convective groups discussed above, we analysed the inter-group differences for the large-scale-precipitation-based groups (shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>), and find that the inter-group differences are significant.
