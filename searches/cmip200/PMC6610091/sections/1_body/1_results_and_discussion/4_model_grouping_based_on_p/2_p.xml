<p id="Par11" class="p">Considering three major aspects of the convection parameterizaton schemes used in CMIP5 models, namely, (a) cloud model type, (b) closure, and (c) trigger, we find that: (1) based on cloud model type (spectral, bulk and mix), the distribution in GC1 is (2, 3, 2), in GC2 it is (2, 3, 3), in GC3 it is (2, 4, 6), and in GC4 it is (1, 4, 0), respectively, (2) based on closure mechanism (CAPE, moisture convergence, and other methods), the distribution in GC1 is (7, 0, 0), in GC2 it is (5, 3, 0), in GC3 it is (9, 3, 0), and in GC4 it is (3, 2, 0), respectively, and (3) based on trigger function (CAPE, moisture convergence, other methods), the distribution in GC1 is (5, 0, 2), in GC2 it is (4, 3, 1), in GC3 it is (5, 4, 3), and in GC4 it is (3, 2, 0), respectively. Further, we notice that some models in GC2 use moisture convergence for both trigger as well as closure, whereas, some models in GC3 use moisture convergence for triggering deep convection (similar to GC2) but for closure they use CAPE (for more details see TableÂ

We also find that the cloud model type used in the convection parameterization schemes has very limited effect on simulated convective precipitation. For example, FGOALS-g2 and CESM-CAM5, GFDL-CM3 and MIROC-5 model pairs have a common cloud model type but do not show much similarity in their convective precipitation fields. This finding is in line with Yanai

 </sup>, wherein it was reported that for tropical convection both spectral and bulk methods were found to produce similar total vertical mass fluxes. Unlike the convective groups, which show large inter-group variations in convective precipitation, the large-scale groups do not show as much variations, likely due to lesser degree of differences in the large-scale precipitation parameterization schemes.
