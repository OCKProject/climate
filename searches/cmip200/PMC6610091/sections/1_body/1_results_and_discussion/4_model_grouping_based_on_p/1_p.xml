<p id="Par10" class="p">CMIP5 models are clustered into the various convective groups, namely, GC1, GC2, GC3 and GC4 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) and large-scale groups, namely, GL1, GL2, and GL3 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), by computing similar statistics for convective and stratiform precipitation as those computed for total precipitation earlier. Models of a given convective group show similarities in cloud model type, closure assumption, or trigger mechanism. For example, (i) in GC1, MIROC-ESM/ESM-CHEM, HadGEM2-CC/ES, ACCESS1-0, FGOALS-g2, and BCC-CSM1-1 use CAPE based closure, (ii) in GC2, GFDL-ESM2M/2G, NorESM1-M/ME and INMCM4 use CAPE based closure (GISS-E2H-R/R-CC, however, uses moisture convergence based closure), and most of them use CAPE based trigger, (iii) in GC3, most of the models use either CAPE or moisture convergence based closure and CAPE or moisture convergence based trigger (for more details see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), and (iv) in GC4, CNRM-CM5/5-2 use moisture convergence based stability profile for closure, HadCM3, GFDL-CM3, EC-Earth use CAPE based closure, however, most of the models in this group use CAPE based trigger (for more details see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
